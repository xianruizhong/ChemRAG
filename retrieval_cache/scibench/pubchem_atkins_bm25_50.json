The constant-volume heat capacity of a gas can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when it expands adiabatically and reversibly. If the decrease in pressure is also measured, we can use it to infer the value of $\\gamma=C_p / C_V$ and hence, by combining the two values, deduce the constant-pressure heat capacity. A fluorocarbon gas was allowed to expand reversibly and adiabatically to twice its volume; as a result, the temperature fell from $298.15 \\mathrm{~K}$ to $248.44 \\mathrm{~K}$ and its pressure fell from $202.94 \\mathrm{kPa}$ to $81.840 \\mathrm{kPa}$.

Concerns over the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons on stratospheric ozone have motivated a search for new refrigerants. One such alternative is 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (refrigerant 123). Younglove and McLinden published a compendium of thermophysical properties of this substance (J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 23, 7 (1994)), from which properties such as the Joule-Thomson coefficient $\\mu$ can be computed. Compute the temperature change that would accompany adiabatic expansion of $2.0 \\mathrm{~mol}$ of this refrigerant from $1.5 \\mathrm{bar}$ to 0.5 bar at $50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.",

Rayleigh prepared some samples of nitrogen by chemical reaction of nitrogencontaining compounds; under his standard conditions, a glass globe filled with this 'chemical nitrogen' had a mass of $2.2990 \\mathrm{~g}$. He prepared other samples by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour from atmospheric air; under the same conditions, this 'atmospheric nitrogen' had a mass of $2.3102 \\mathrm{~g}$ (Lord Rayleigh, Royal Institution Proceedings 14, 524 (1895)). With the hindsight of knowing accurate values for the molar masses of nitrogen and argon, compute the mole fraction of argon in the latter sample on the assumption that the former was pure nitrogen and the latter a mixture of nitrogen and argon.",

On June 15, 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval and orphan drug designation to lurbinectedin for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC who have experienced disease progression despite therapy with platinum-based agents.
