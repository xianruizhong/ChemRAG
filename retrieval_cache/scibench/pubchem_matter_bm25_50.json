The exact mechanism through which levetiracetam exerts its effects is unknown but does not involve inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter activity. Stereoselective binding of levetiracetam was confined to synaptic plasma membranes in the central nervous system with no binding occurring in peripheral tissue. Levetiracetam inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, which suggests that it may selectively prevent hyper-synchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity.']",

Approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2011, Gimeracil is available in combination with [DB03209] and [DB09256] within the commercially available product \"Teysuno\". The main active ingredient in Teysuno is [DB09256], a pro-drug of [DB00544] (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called \"pyrimidines\" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth.   Gimeracil\\'s main role within Teysuno is to prevent the breakdown of [DB00544] (5-FU), which helps to maintin high enough concentrations for sustained effect against cancer cells. It functions by reversibly and selectively blocking the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which is involved in the degradation of 5-FU. This allows higher concentrations of 5-FU to be achieved with a lower dose of tegafur, thereby also reducing toxic side effects.']",

(Science 238, 1670 (1987)) examined several weakly bound gas-phase complexes of ammonia in search of examples in which the $\\mathrm{H}$ atoms in $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ formed hydrogen bonds, but found none. For example, they found that the complex of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ and $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ has the carbon atom nearest the nitrogen (299 pm away): the $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ molecule is at right angles to the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{N}$ 'bond', and the $\\mathrm{H}$ atoms of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ are pointing away from the $\\mathrm{CO}_2$. The magnitude of the permanent dipole moment of this complex is reported as $1.77 \\mathrm{D}$. If the $\\mathrm{N}$ and $\\mathrm{C}$ atoms are the centres of the negative and positive charge distributions, respectively, what is the magnitude of those partial charges (as multiples of $e$ )?",

Of these 135 compounds, those that contain chlorine atoms at the 2,3,7,8-positions of the parent dibenzofuran molecule are especially harmful. Other than for laboratory use of small amounts of CDFs for research and development purposes, these chemicals are not deliberately produced by industry. Most CDFs are produced in very small amounts as unwanted impurities of certain products and processes utilizing chlorinated compounds. Only a few of the 135 CDF compounds have been produced in large enough quantities so that their properties, such as color, smell, taste, and toxicity could be studied. (L952)",

Upon administration, rucaparib selectively binds to PARP1, 2 and 3 and inhibits PARP-mediated DNA repair. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This may enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverse tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. PARPs are enzymes activated by single-strand DNA breaks that catalyze the post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, which induces signaling and the recruitment of other proteins to repair damaged DNA. The PARP-mediated repair pathway plays a key role in DNA repair and is dysregulated in a variety of cancer cell types.']",

Upon oral administration, CD73 inhibitor LY3475070 targets and binds to CD73, leading to clustering of and internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This prevents adenosine-mediated lymphocyte suppression and increases the activity of CD8-positive effector cells and natural killer (NK) cells. This also activates macrophages and reduces the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs). By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells, tumor cell growth decreases. In addition, clustering and internalization of CD73 decreases the migration of cancer cells and prevents metastasis. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine. It is upregulated in a number of cancer cell types and plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the TME.\"]",
