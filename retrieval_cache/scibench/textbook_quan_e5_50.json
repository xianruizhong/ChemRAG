For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the nucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, the ionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learned about radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and to increase across a period.",

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Figure 3.34. Within a period, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ generally increases with increasing $Z$. Down a group, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ value generally decreases with increasing $Z$. There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as $l$ increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the $s$ electrons are lower in energy than the $p$ electrons. This means that an $s$ electron is harder to remove from an atom than a $p$ electron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2}$ ) is an $s$ electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}$ ) is a $p$ electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring each time a new subshell begins.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.33 The first ionization energy of the elements in the first five periods are plotted against their atomic number.\n\nFirst Ionization Energies of Some Elements (kJ/mol)",

An atomic orbital is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most probable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is based on solutions of the Schrödinger equation. In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.\n\nAnother quantum number is $l$, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take the values, $l=0,1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have only one value of $l, l=0$, whereas $n=2$ permits $l=0$ and $l=1$, and so on. Whereas the principal quantum number, $n$, defines the general size and energy of the orbital, the secondary quantum number 1 specifies the shape of the orbital. Orbitals with the same value of $l$ define a subshell.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second $\\left[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right]$, is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, $\\left(1 \\mathrm{MHz}=1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$ and gigahertz $\\left(1 \\mathrm{GHz}=1 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$. The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 3.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed. The wave with the shortest wavelength has the highest frequency. Amplitude is one-half the height of the wave from peak to trough.\n\nThe product of a wave's wavelength $(\\lambda)$ and its frequency $(\\nu), \\lambda \\nu$, is the speed of the wave.

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are inphase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.\n\nIn a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically $>10^{23}$ atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When $N$ valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, $N / 2$ (filled) bonding orbitals and $N / 2$ (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 5.39 shows the bands for three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.39 Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the size of the \"band gap\" between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move electrons from the valance band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but not as well as conductors.",

Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu . (This isotope is known as \"carbon-12\" as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of one carbon-12 atom: $1 \\mathrm{amu}=1.6605 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~g}$.

The EA of some of the elements is given in Figure 3.35. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a -2 ion, and so on.\n\nAs we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 ( 5 A ), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher $n$ level, which is more difficult to do. Group $2(2 \\mathrm{~A})$ has a filled $n s$ subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy $n p$, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict.

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons.

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nFIGURE 3.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as $2 s$, $3 p$, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, $n$. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nQuantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ differ from those predicted by the overlap of the $1 s$ orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the $2 p$ orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, $\\psi$, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 5.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle $\\left(109.5^{\\circ}\\right)$. The observed angle of $104.5^{\\circ}$ is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 5.7 (a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral arrangement of hybrid orbitals. (b) Two of the hybrid orbitals on oxygen contain lone pairs, and the other two overlap with the 1 s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds in $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$. This description is more consistent with the\n\n[^3]experimental structure.\nThe following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:",

The Aufbau Principle - \nWe will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first and second periods of the periodic table. Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron ( $n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ ). The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 . The first two electrons in lithium fill the $1 s$ orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:\n\n\nAn atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4 , contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus.

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Outline the basic quantum-mechanical approach to deriving molecular orbitals from atomic orbitals\n- Describe traits of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals\n- Calculate bond orders based on molecular electron configurations\n- Write molecular electron configurations for first- and second-row diatomic molecules\n- Relate these electron configurations to the molecules' stabilities and magnetic properties\n\nFor almost every covalent molecule that exists, we can now draw the Lewis structure, predict the electron-pair geometry, predict the molecular geometry, and come close to predicting bond angles. However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen molecule $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would write the following Lewis structure for $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ :\n\n\nThis electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an $\\mathrm{O}=\\mathrm{O}$ double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Figure 5.1. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?\n\nMagnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 5.27), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe multiple covalent bonding in terms of atomic orbital overlap\n- Relate the concept of resonance to $\\pi$-bonding and electron delocalization\n\nThe hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, $\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{4}$, shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.\n\n\nThe three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the $\\sigma$ bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the $2 p$ orbitals and the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 5.22). These orbitals form the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ single bonds and the $\\sigma$ bond in the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ double bond (Figure 5.23). The $\\pi$ bond in the $\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{C}$ double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) $2 p$ orbital on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized $p$ orbital (lobes shown in red and blue in Figure 5.23) is perpendicular to the plane of the $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized $2 p$ orbitals overlap in a side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis (Figure 5.23) and form a $\\pi$ bond.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.22 In ethene, each carbon atom is $s p^{2}$ hybridized, and the $s p^{2}$ orbitals and the $p$ orbital are singly occupied.

The actual value, however, is $-206 \\mathrm{~kJ} /$ mol , some $148 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(35.4 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$ less than expected. Because of this difference in actual and expected energy released during hydrogenation, benzene must have $148 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ less energy to begin with. In other words, benzene is more stable than expected by $148 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ (FIGURE 15.3).\n\n\nFIGURE 15.3 A comparison of the heats of hydrogenation for cyclohexene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, and benzene.

In addition, an electrostatic potential map shows that the electron density in all six $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ bonds is identical.

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long. In addition, the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum shows a single sharp resonance line at $5.78 \\mathrm{\\delta}$, a value characteristic of an alkene rather than an aromatic molecule.\n\nWhat's so special about $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons? Why do $2,6,10,14 \\pi$ electrons lead to aromatic stability, while other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$. Any other number would leave an energy level partially filled.\n\nThe six $\\pi$ molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are shown again in FIGURE 15.6. The lowest-energy MO, $\\psi_{1}$, occurs singly and contains two electrons. The next two lowest-energy orbitals, $\\psi_{2}$ and $\\psi_{3}$, are degenerate, and it therefore takes four electrons to fill both. The result is a stable six- $\\pi$-electron aromatic molecule with filled bonding orbitals.",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant.\n\nIt should be noted that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nHeisenberg's principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science. The uncertainty principle can\nbe shown to be a consequence of wave-particle duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory from classical mechanics.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe sizes of the circular orbits for hydrogen-like atoms are given in terms of their radii by the following expression, in which $\\mathrm{a}_{0}$ is a constant called the Bohr radius, with a value of $5.292 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~m}$ :\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{n^{2}}{Z} a_{0}\n$$\n\nThe equation also shows us that as the electron's energy increases (as $n$ increases), the electron is found at greater distances from the nucleus. This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus. Thus, for hydrogen in the ground state $n=1$, the ionization energy would be:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E=E_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}-E_{1}=0+k=k\n$$\n\nWith three extremely puzzling paradoxes now solved (blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the hydrogen atom), and all involving Planck's constant in a fundamental manner, it became clear to most physicists at that time that the classical theories that worked so well in the macroscopic world were fundamentally flawed and could not be extended down into the microscopic domain of atoms and molecules. Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

Although these two symbols appear nearly identical, they mean very different things).

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nQuantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ differ from those predicted by the overlap of the $1 s$ orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the $2 p$ orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, $\\psi$, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 5.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle $\\left(109.5^{\\circ}\\right)$. The observed angle of $104.5^{\\circ}$ is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 5.7 (a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral arrangement of hybrid orbitals.

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Explain the concept of atomic orbital hybridization\n- Determine the hybrid orbitals associated with various molecular geometries\n\nThinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{4}$, with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two $2 p$ orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds form from the overlap of these two $2 p$ orbitals with the $1 s$ orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be $90^{\\circ}$, as shown in Figure 5.6 , because $p$ orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is $104.5^{\\circ}$, not $90^{\\circ}$. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.6 The hypothetical overlap of two of the $2 p$ orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1 s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of $90^{\\circ}$. This is not consistent with experimental evidence. ${ }^{1}$",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. (We will work exclusively in the SI system, so distances will be measured in meters $(\\mathrm{m})$ ).\nAnd as you may recall, energy is force times distance, so\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d}\n$$\n\nTo illustrate the trend in attractive force, we will consider first the attractive force between two ions of single charge separated by a distance of 2 d :",

Variation in Electron Affinities - \nWe also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that the second element in the group most often has the most negative EA. This can be attributed\nto the small size of the $n=2$ shell and the resulting large electron-electron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA value of $-348 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine is $-322 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion ( $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$), we add an electron to the $n=2$ shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the $n=3$ shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily, resulting in a more negative EA.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.35 This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) for selected elements.\n\nThe properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.",

Figure 5.2 illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 5.2.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm , which is the bond length observed for the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule.\n\nIn addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for two $s$ orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 5.3 illustrates this for two $p$ orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

The EA of some of the elements is given in Figure 3.35. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a -2 ion, and so on.\n\nAs we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 ( 5 A ), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher $n$ level, which is more difficult to do. Group $2(2 \\mathrm{~A})$ has a filled $n s$ subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy $n p$, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled $n p$ subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing $n p$ electron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend in EA.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nQuantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ differ from those predicted by the overlap of the $1 s$ orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the $2 p$ orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, $\\psi$, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 5.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle $\\left(109.5^{\\circ}\\right)$. The observed angle of $104.5^{\\circ}$ is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 5.7 (a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral arrangement of hybrid orbitals. (b) Two of the hybrid orbitals on oxygen contain lone pairs, and the other two overlap with the 1 s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds in $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$. This description is more consistent with the\n\n[^3]experimental structure.\nThe following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:",

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

The EA of some of the elements is given in Figure 3.35. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a -2 ion, and so on.\n\nAs we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 ( 5 A ), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher $n$ level, which is more difficult to do. Group $2(2 \\mathrm{~A})$ has a filled $n s$ subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy $n p$, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled $n p$ subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing $n p$ electron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend in EA.",

Variation in Electron Affinities - \nWe also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that the second element in the group most often has the most negative EA. This can be attributed\nto the small size of the $n=2$ shell and the resulting large electron-electron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA value of $-348 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine is $-322 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion ( $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$), we add an electron to the $n=2$ shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the $n=3$ shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily, resulting in a more negative EA.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.35 This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) for selected elements.\n\nThe properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

For example, a carbon atom weighs less than $2 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~g}$, and an electron has a charge of less than $2 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ (coulomb). When describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the atomic mass unit (amu) and the fundamental unit of charge (e). The amu was originally defined based on hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu . (This isotope is known as \"carbon-12\" as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of one carbon-12 atom: $1 \\mathrm{amu}=1.6605 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~g}$. (The Dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative units that are equivalent to the amu.)

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

But because there are many different kinds of spectrometers with many different magnetic field strengths available, chemical shifts given in frequency units ( Hz ) vary from one instrument to another. Thus, a resonance that occurs at 120 Hz downfield from TMS on one spectrometer might occur at 600 Hz downfield from TMS on another spectrometer with a more powerful magnet.\n\nBy using a system of measurement in which NMR absorptions are expressed in relative terms (parts per million relative to spectrometer frequency) rather than absolute terms (Hz), it's possible to compare spectra obtained\non different instruments. The chemical shift of an NMR absorption in $\\delta$ units is constant, regardless of the operating frequency of the spectrometer. A ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus that absorbs at $2.0 \\delta$ on a 200 MHz instrument also absorbs at $2.0 \\delta$ on a 500 MHz instrument.",

A thin glass tube containing the sample solution is placed between the poles of a strong magnet and irradiated with rf energy.\n\nNMR spectroscopy differs from IR spectroscopy (Section 12.6-Section 12.8) in that the timescales of the two techniques are quite different. The absorption of infrared energy by a molecule giving rise to a change in vibrational amplitude is an essentially instantaneous process (about $10^{-13} \\mathrm{~s}$ ), but the NMR process is much slower (about $10^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}$ ). This difference in timescales between IR and NMR spectroscopy is analogous to the difference between cameras operating at very fast and very slow shutter speeds. The fast camera (IR) takes an instantaneous picture and freezes the action. If two rapidly interconverting species are present, IR spectroscopy records the spectrum of both. The slow camera (NMR), however, takes a blurred, time-averaged picture. If two species interconverting faster than $10^{3}$ times per second are present in a sample, NMR records only a single, averaged spectrum, rather than separate spectra of the two discrete species.\n\nBecause of this blurring effect, NMR spectroscopy can be used to measure the rates and activation energies of very fast chemical processes. In cyclohexane, for example, a ring-flip (Section 4.6) occurs so rapidly at room temperature that axial and equatorial hydrogens can't be distinguished by NMR; only a single, averaged ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR absorption is seen for cyclohexane at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. At $-90^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, however, the ring-flip is slowed down enough that two absorption peaks are visible, one for the six axial hydrogens and one for the six equatorial hydrogens. Knowing the temperature and the rate at which signal blurring begins to occur, it's possible to calculate that the activation energy for the cyclohexane ring-flip is $45 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(10.8 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$.",

This C3 proton signal appears as a doublet centered at $7.49 \\delta$. Because it has one neighbor proton at C 2 , its signal is split into a doublet, with $J=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.\n- The C2 vinylic proton signal (blue) appears at $6.73 \\delta$ and shows an interesting, four-line absorption pattern. It is coupled to the two nonequivalent protons at C 1 and C 3 with two different coupling constants: $J_{1-2}=6$ Hz and $J_{2-3}=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.\n\nA good way to understand the effect of multiple coupling, such as that occurring for the C2 proton of trans-cinnamaldehyde, is to draw a tree diagram, like that in FIGURE 13.15. The diagram shows the individual effect of each coupling constant on the overall pattern. Coupling with the C3 proton splits the signal of the C2 proton in trans-cinnamaldehyde into a doublet with $J=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. Further coupling with the aldehyde proton then splits each peak of the doublet into new doublets with $J=6 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, and we therefore observe a four-line spectrum for the C 2 proton.\n\n\n$6.73 \\delta$",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

As described in the chapter on thermochemistry, the most energetic chemical reactions exhibit\nenthalpies on the order of thousands of $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, which is equivalent to mass differences in the nanogram range $\\left(10^{-9} \\mathrm{~g}\\right)$. On the other hand, nuclear binding energies are typically on the order of billions of $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, corresponding to mass differences in the milligram range $\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{~g}\\right)$.\nNuclear Stability\nA nucleus is stable if it cannot be transformed into another configuration without adding energy from the outside. Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is known as the band of stability (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in Figure 20.2 represents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons ( $\\mathrm{n}: \\mathrm{p}$ ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead- 207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52. This is because larger nuclei have more proton-proton repulsions, and require larger numbers of neutrons to provide compensating strong forces to overcome these electrostatic repulsions and hold the nucleus together.",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger. (d) The paths followed by the $\\alpha$ particles match the predictions from (a), (b), and (c).\n6.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.\n\nWhen a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Figure 4.27). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecule is linear with polar $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (Figure 4.27), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O , and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).\n\n\nFIGURE 4.27 The overall dipole moment of a molecule depends on the individual bond dipole moments and how they are arranged.

(b) In contrast, water is polar because the OH bond moments do not cancel out.\n\nThe OCS molecule has a structure similar to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but a sulfur atom has replaced one of the oxygen atoms.

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. (We will work exclusively in the SI system, so distances will be measured in meters $(\\mathrm{m})$ ).\nAnd as you may recall, energy is force times distance, so\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d}\n$$\n\nTo illustrate the trend in attractive force, we will consider first the attractive force between two ions of single charge separated by a distance of 2 d :",

In the next step, we account for the energy required to break the $F-F$ bond to produce fluorine atoms. Converting one mole of fluorine atoms into fluoride ions is an exothermic process, so this step gives off energy (the electron affinity) and is shown as decreasing along the $y$-axis. We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it is also an exothermic quantity. The total energy involved in this conversion is equal to the experimentally determined enthalpy of formation, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{H}_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}$, of the compound from its elements. In this case, the overall change is exothermic.",

This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

Open the Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstax.org/l/16PhetScatter) and select the \"Rutherford Atom\" tab. Due to the scale of the simulation, it is best to start with a small nucleus, so select \" 20 \" for both protons and neutrons, \"min\" for energy, show traces, and then start firing $\\alpha$ particles. Does this match your prediction from (a)? If not, explain why the actual path would be that shown in the simulation. Pause or reset, set energy to \"max,\" and start firing $\\alpha$ particles. Does this match your prediction from (b)? If not, explain the effect of increased energy on the actual path as shown in the simulation. Pause or reset, select \" 40 \" for both protons and neutrons, \"min\" for energy, show traces, and fire away. Does this match your prediction from (c)?

This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

Adjust the slit width to produce a narrower or broader beam of $\\alpha$ particles to see how that affects the scattering pattern.\n\n[^0]This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very small, positively charged nucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the atom is electrically neutral (Figure 2.10). After many more experiments, Rutherford also discovered that the nuclei of other elements contain the hydrogen nucleus as a \"building block,\" and he named this more fundamental particle the proton, the positively charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used today.\n\n\nFIGURE 2.10 The $\\alpha$ particles are deflected only when they collide with or pass close to the much heavier, positively charged gold nucleus. Because the nucleus is very small compared to the size of an atom, very few $\\alpha$ particles are deflected. Most pass through the relatively large region occupied by electrons, which are too light to deflect the rapidly moving particles.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant.\n\nIt should be noted that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nHeisenberg's principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science.

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

The microstates are collected into five distributions-(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e)-based on the numbers of particles in each box.\n\nFor this system, the most probable configuration is one of the six microstates associated with distribution (c) where the particles are evenly distributed between the boxes, that is, a configuration of two particles in each\nbox. The probability of finding the system in this configuration is $\\frac{6}{16}$ or $\\frac{3}{8}$. The least probable configuration of the system is one in which all four particles are in one box, corresponding to distributions (a) and (e), each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{16}$.

Regardless of the number of particles in the system, however, the distributions in which roughly equal numbers of particles are found in each box are always the most probable configurations.\n\nThis matter dispersal model of entropy is often described qualitatively in terms of the disorder of the system. By this description, microstates in which all the particles are in a single box are the most ordered, thus possessing the least entropy. Microstates in which the particles are more evenly distributed among the boxes are more disordered, possessing greater entropy.",

This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Entropy and Microstates - \nThe previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (Figure 12.4) is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. Initially, the gas molecules are confined to just one of the two flasks. Opening the valve between the flasks increases the volume available to the gas molecules and, correspondingly, the number of microstates possible for the system. Since $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the expansion process involves an increase in entropy $(\\Delta S>0)$ and is spontaneous.\n\nA similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two objects, each containing two particles, and two units of thermal energy (represented as \"*\") in Figure 12.9. The hot object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution (a), is $\\frac{3}{10}$. More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being $\\frac{7}{10}$. The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), the probability of this configuration being $\\frac{4}{10}$. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects' temperatures. And, again, this spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nTABLE 8.3\n\nAt low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, $a$, is more important than the one for molecular volume, $b$. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears to follow the relationship given by $P V=n R T$ over a small range of pressures. This behavior is reflected by the \"dips\" in several of the compressibility curves shown in Figure 8.35. The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an ideal gas, as pressure is raised ( Z decreases with increasing $P$ ). At very high pressures, the gas becomes less compressible ( Z increases with $P$ ), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly significant fraction of the total gas volume.\n\nStrictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of low pressure and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregarded-this is, however, very often not the case.",

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThis view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstax.org/l/16combustion) illustrates the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into energy of motion.\n\nAs discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as $\\Delta U=q+w$. Internal energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m , and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 9.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).\n\n\nFIGURE 9.20 Paths $X$ and $Y$ represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path). (credit: modification of work by Paul Shaffner)\n\nChemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system's internal energy $(U)$ and the mathematical product of its pressure ( $P$ ) and volume ( $V$ ):\n\n$$\nH=U+P V\n$$",

The chemical shift of TMS is set as the zero point, and other absorptions normally occur downfield, to the left on the chart. NMR charts are calibrated using an arbitrary scale called the delta ( $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ ) scale, where $1 \\delta$ equals 1 part-per-million ( 1 ppm ) of the spectrometer operating frequency. For example, if we were measuring the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum of a sample using an instrument operating at $200 \\mathrm{MHz}, 1 \\delta$ would be 1 part per million of $200,000,000 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, or 200 Hz . If we were measuring the spectrum using a 500 MHz instrument, $1 \\delta=500 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. The following equation can be used for any absorption:\n\n$$\n\\delta=\\frac{\\text { Observed chemical shift (number of Hz away from TMS) }}{\\text { Spectrometer frequency in } \\mathrm{MHz}}\n$$\n\nAlthough this method of calibrating NMR charts may seem complex, there's a good reason for it. As we saw earlier, the rf frequency required to bring a given nucleus into resonance depends on the spectrometer's magnetic field strength. But because there are many different kinds of spectrometers with many different magnetic field strengths available, chemical shifts given in frequency units ( Hz ) vary from one instrument to another. Thus, a resonance that occurs at 120 Hz downfield from TMS on one spectrometer might occur at 600 Hz downfield from TMS on another spectrometer with a more powerful magnet.\n\nBy using a system of measurement in which NMR absorptions are expressed in relative terms (parts per million relative to spectrometer frequency) rather than absolute terms (Hz), it's possible to compare spectra obtained\non different instruments. The chemical shift of an NMR absorption in $\\delta$ units is constant, regardless of the operating frequency of the spectrometer. A ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus that absorbs at $2.0 \\delta$ on a 200 MHz instrument also absorbs at $2.0 \\delta$ on a 500 MHz instrument.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen molecule $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would write the following Lewis structure for $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ :\n\n\nThis electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an $\\mathrm{O}=\\mathrm{O}$ double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Figure 5.1. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?\n\nMagnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 5.27), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample.",

Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment - \nAs discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge ( $\\delta^{+}$) and the other atom with a partial negative charge ( $\\delta^{-}$), as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole moment.

Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom.

If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Why did electrons orbit at only fixed distances defined by a single quantum number $n$ $=1,2,3$, and so on, but never in between? Why did the model work so well describing hydrogen and oneelectron ions, but could not correctly predict the emission spectrum for helium or any larger atoms? To answer these questions, scientists needed to completely revise the way they thought about matter.",

Alternatively, if one of the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{Br}$ proton spins aligns with the field and one aligns against the field, there is no effect on the neighboring $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons.

Because they're positively charged, these spinning nuclei act like tiny magnets and can interact with an external magnetic field, denoted $\\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$. Not all nuclei act this way, but fortunately for organic chemists, both the proton $\\left({ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$ and the ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus do have spins. The more common ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ isotope, however, does not have nuclear spin. (In speaking about NMR, the words proton and hydrogen are often used interchangeably, since a hydrogen nucleus is just a proton.) Let's see what the consequences of nuclear spin are and how we can use the results.\n\nIn the absence of an external magnetic field, the spins of magnetic nuclei are oriented randomly. When a sample containing these nuclei is placed between the poles of a strong magnet, however, the nuclei adopt specific orientations, much as a compass needle orients in the earth's magnetic field. A spinning ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus can orient so that its own tiny magnetic field is aligned either with (parallel to) or against (antiparallel to) the external field. The two orientations don't have the same energy, however, and aren't equally likely. The parallel orientation is slightly lower in energy by an amount that depends on the strength of the external field, making this spin state very slightly favored over the antiparallel orientation (FIGURE 13.2).\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\nFIGURE 13.2 (a) Nuclear spins are oriented randomly in the absence of an external magnetic field but (b) have a specific orientation in the presence of an external field, $\\boldsymbol{B}_{\\mathbf{0}}$.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant.\n\nIt should be noted that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nHeisenberg's principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science. The uncertainty principle can\nbe shown to be a consequence of wave-particle duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory from classical mechanics.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Free Energy Changes for Coupled Reactions - \nThe use of free energies of formation to compute free energy changes for reactions as described above is possible because $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ is a state function, and the approach is analogous to the use of Hess' Law in computing enthalpy changes (see the chapter on thermochemistry). Consider the vaporization of water as an example:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g)\n$$\n\nAn equation representing this process may be derived by adding the formation reactions for the two phases of water (necessarily reversing the reaction for the liquid phase). The free energy change for the sum reaction is the sum of free energy changes for the two added reactions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+1 / 2 \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) & \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{f}, \\mathrm{gas}}^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+1 / 2 \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & -\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{f}, \\text { liquid }}^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\hline \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) & \\Delta G=\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{f}, \\mathrm{gas}}^{\\circ}-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{f}, \\text { liquid }}^{\\circ}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThis approach may also be used in cases where a nonspontaneous reaction is enabled by coupling it to a spontaneous reaction. For example, the production of elemental zinc from zinc sulfide is thermodynamically unfavorable, as indicated by a positive value for $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{ZnS}(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Zn}(s)+\\mathrm{S}(s) \\quad \\Delta G_{1}^{\\circ}=201.3 \\mathrm{~kJ}\n$$\n\nThe industrial process for production of zinc from sulfidic ores involves coupling this decomposition reaction to the thermodynamically favorable oxidation of sulfur:",
