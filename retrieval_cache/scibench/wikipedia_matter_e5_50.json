If a force F is applied to the fluid in the input tube, the pressure in that tube will be F/A. Utilizing pressure laws, we find that each output tube will see the same pressure. This means the output tube with area 3A will yield a force of 3F, and the output tube with area A/2 will yield a force of F/2. Thus, if you apply a 10-pound force to the input, you will get forces of 30 lbf and 5 lbf, respectively, from the outputs. If you apply a 10-newton force to the input, you will get forces of 30 N and 5 N, respectively, from the outputs",

Beer's law is commonly written in the form A = ε cl, where A is the absorbance, c is the concentration in moles per liter, l is the path length in centimeters, and ε is a constant of proportionality known as the molar extinction coefficient. The law is accurate only for dilute solutions; deviations from the law occur in concentrated solutions because of interactions between molecules of the solute, the substance dissolved in the solvent.

The energy difference between the exciton 'ground state' (n=1) and the 'vacuum state' is called optical gap and is the energy of the photon emitted when an exciton recombines. This is the energy of the photons emitted by TMD monolayers and observed as huge emission peaks in photoluminescence (PL) experiments, such as the one labelled X0 in the figure. In this picture the binding energy EB is defined as the difference between the free particle band gap and the optical band gap and represent, as usual, the energy needed to take the hole and the electron apart.

Practical limitations set a convenient electron energy to 100–300 keV that corresponds to λ = 3.7–2.0 pm. The resolution of electron microscopes is limited not by the electron wavelength, but by intrinsic imperfections of electron lenses.

During the first half of a nanosecond we would expect 50 electrons to arrive at point B on the average, but in a particular half nanosecond there might well be 60 electrons which arrive there. This will create a more negative electric charge at point B than average, and that extra charge will tend to repel the further flow of electrons from leaving point A during the remaining half nanosecond.

These measurements provide a more accurate picture of such reactions. Applications When considering scaling up a reaction to large scale from lab scale, it is important to understand how much heat is released. At a small scale, heat released may not cause a concern, however when scaling up, build up can be extremely dangerous. Crystallizing a reaction product from solution is a highly cost effective purification technique. It is therefore valuable to be able to measure how effectively crystallization is taking place in order to be able to optimize it. The heat absorbed by the process can be a useful measure. The energy being released by any process in the form of heat is directly proportional to the rate of reaction and hence reaction calorimetry (as a time resolved measurement technique) can be used to study kinetics.",

Lavoisier dubbed this apparatus the calorimeter, based on both Greek and Latin roots. One of the first ice calorimeters was used in the winter of 1782 by Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, which relied on the heat required to melt ice to water to measure the heat released from chemical reactions. Adiabatic calorimeters An adiabatic calorimeter is a calorimeter used to examine a runaway reaction. Since the calorimeter runs in an adiabatic environment, any heat generated by the material sample under test causes the sample to increase in temperature, thus fueling the reaction.",

From the first law, a principle called Hess's Law arises. Hess’s Law states that the heat absorbed or evolved in a given reaction must always be constant and independent of the manner in which the reaction takes place. Although some intermediate reactions may be endothermic and others may be exothermic, the total heat exchange is equal to the heat exchange had the process occurred directly. This principle is the basis for the calorimeter, a device used to determine the amount of heat in a chemical reaction. Since all incoming energy enters the body as food and is ultimately oxidized, the total heat production may be estimated by measuring the heat produced by the oxidation of food in a calorimeter. This heat is expressed in kilocalories, which are the common unit of food energy found on nutrition labels.",

Each carbon atom in the structure is bonded covalently with 3 others.

As such, the Van der Waals model is not useful for calculations intended to predict real behavior in regions near critical points. Corrections to address these predictive deficiencies include the equal area rule and the principle of corresponding states.",

Layer 2 absorbs half and transmits half, but remits nothing. We can build the assembly by first combining layers 1 and 2, and then combining that result as the x value in combing with layer 3 (as y).

In the first step, a superoxide (O2−) species is formed: O2 + Ag → Ag+O2− This species reacts with ethylene Ag+O2− + H2C=CH2 → (CH2CH2)O + AgO The resulting silver oxide then oxidizes ethylene or ethylene oxide to CO2 and water. This reaction replenishes the silver catalyst. Thus the overall reaction is expressed as 7 CH2=CH2 + 6 O2 → 6 (CH2CH2)O + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O and the maximum degree of conversion of ethylene to ethylene oxide is theoretically predicted to be 6/7 or 85.7%, although higher yields are achieved in practice.",

This rule is not valid if the factors affecting the mobility depend on each other, because individual scattering probabilities cannot be summed unless they are independent of each other. The average free time of flight of a carrier and therefore the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the scattering probability.

In catalysis design, the most reactive species are often short lived and unstable. Much work has been done to better understand how to stabilize these compounds. Caulton has specifically worked on stabilizing a rhenium polyhydride. Caulton and his colleagues showed polyolefin-cyclooctatetracene can trap a phototransient intermediate of rhenium polyhydrides. This phototransient species, which is formed from excitation from light, is highly reactive, where the initial rhenium complex is not. If you could trap the highly reactive, short-lived state, then you can make a much more efficient catalyst. The end result of this was they were able to determine that the reason for this trapping of the phototransient intermediate was a result of the",

Almost all of the elements form binary compounds with hydrogen, the exceptions being He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Pm, Os, Ir, Rn, Fr, and Ra. Exotic molecules such as positronium hydride have also been made.",

An example is the London-Eyring-Polanyi-Sato potential for the system H + H2 as a function of the three H-H distances. For more complicated systems, calculation of the energy of a particular arrangement of atoms is often too computationally expensive for large scale representations of the surface to be feasible. For these systems a possible approach is to calculate only a reduced set of points on the PES and then use a computationally cheaper interpolation method, for example Shepard interpolation, to fill in the gaps.

It is then in a metastable state, and we may expect condensation to take place. A reasonable molecular model of condensation would seem to be that two or three molecules of water vapour come together to form a tiny droplet, and that this nucleus of condensation then grows by accretion, as additional vapour molecules happen to hit it.

The oscillating field can then make the dipole transit between its energy states with a certain probability and at a certain rate.

A full description of the theory is given within the quantum mechanical formalism, but since the magnetization is being measured as a bulk property, a more intuitive picture can be obtained with a classical description. For a better understanding of the concept of pulsed EPR consider the effects on the magnetization vector in the laboratory frame as well as in the rotating frame. As the animation below shows, in the laboratory frame the static magnetic field B0 is assumed to be parallel to the z-axis and the microwave field B1 parallel to the x-axis. When an electron spin is placed in magnetic field it experiences a torque which causes its magnetic moment to precess around the magnetic field. The precession frequency is known as the Larmor frequency ωL.",

When direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as sunshine, a combination of bright light and radiant heat. When blocked by clouds or reflected off other objects, sunlight is diffused. Sources estimate a global average of between 164 watts to 340 watts per square meter over a 24-hour day; this figure is estimated by NASA to be about a quarter of Earth's average total solar irradiance. The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a requisite for vitamin D3 synthesis and a mutagen.",

For instance, carbon and hydrogen won't directly react to form methane (CH4), so that the standard enthalpy of formation cannot be measured directly. However the standard enthalpy of combustion is readily measurable using bomb calorimetry. The standard enthalpy of formation is then determined using Hess's law. The combustion of methane (CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O) is equivalent to the sum of the hypothetical decomposition into elements followed by the combustion of the elements to form carbon dioxide and water: CH4 → C + 2 H2 C + O2 → CO2 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O Applying Hess's law, ΔcombH⦵(CH4) = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − ΔfH⦵(CH4).

As a result, a reaction that fractionates 34S will also fractionate 33S and 36S, and the fractionation factor for each isotope will be mathematically proportional to its mass. Because of the mathematical relationships of their masses, the observed relationships between δ34S, δ33S, and δ36S in most natural materials are approximately δ33S = 0.515 × δ34S and δ36S = 1.90 × δ34S.

Ballpark figures: Using the Eyring equation, there is a straightforward relationship between ΔG‡, first-order rate constants, and reaction half-life at a given temperature. At 298 K, a reaction with ΔG‡ = 23 kcal/mol has a rate constant of k ≈ 8.4 × 10–5 s–1 and a half life of t1/2 ≈ 2.3 hours, figures that are often rounded to k ~ 10–4 s–1 and t1/2 ~ 2 h. Thus, a free energy of activation of this magnitude corresponds to a typical reaction that proceeds to completion overnight at room temperature. For comparison, the cyclohexane chair flip has a ΔG‡ of about 11 kcal/mol with k ~ 105 s–1, making it a dynamic process that takes place rapidly (faster than the NMR timescale) at room temperature. At the other end of the scale, the cis/trans isomerization of 2-butene has a ΔG‡ of about 60 kcal/mol, corresponding to k ~ 10–31 s–1 at 298 K.

To begin, the flux J is equated to the product of the differential of the gradient and the mobility B, which is defined as the diffusing atom's velocity per unit of applied force. In addition, NA is Avogadro's number, and C2 is the concentration of diffusing component two. This yields which can be equated to the expression for Fick's first law: so that the expression can be written as After some rearrangement of variables the expression can be written for D2, the diffusivity of component two: Assuming that atomic volume is constant, so C = C1 + C2, Using a definition activity, , where R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature, to rewrite the equation in terms of activity gives",

The entropy is included in any change of the Gibbs free energy. This differs from an endothermic reaction where the entropy is not included. The Gibbs free energy is calculated with the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation: where: T = temperature in kelvins (K) ΔG = change in the Gibbs free energy ΔS = change in entropy (at 298 K) as ΔS = Σ{S(Product)} − Σ{S(Reagent)} ΔH = change in enthalpy (at 298 K) as ΔH = Σ{H(Product)} − Σ{H(Reagent)} A chemical reaction progresses non spontaneously when the Gibbs free energy increases, in that case the ΔG is positive.

Such measurements are much less precise than modern mass spectrometric measurements of atomic weights and molecular masses, and are of mostly historical interest. All of the procedures rely on colligative properties, and any dissociation of the compound must be taken into account. Vapour density The measurement of molar mass by vapour density relies on the principle, first enunciated by Amedeo Avogadro, that equal volumes of gases under identical conditions contain equal numbers of particles. This principle is included in the ideal gas equation: where n is the amount of substance. The vapour density (ρ) is given by Combining these two equations gives an expression for the molar mass in terms of the vapour density for conditions of known pressure and temperature: Freezing-point depression",

Typical errors The prediction error can be up to 10% for polar components and small pressures and the calculated pressure is typically too low. For pressures above 1 bar, that means, above the normal boiling point, the typical errors are below 2%. Example calculation For benzene with Tc = 562.12 K Pc = 4898 kPa Tb = 353.15 K ω = 0.2120 the following calculation for T=Tb results: Tr = 353.15 / 562.12 = 0.628247 f(0) = -3.167428 f(1) = -3.429560 Pr = exp( f(0) + ω f(1) ) = 0.020354 P = Pr * Pc = 99.69 kPa The correct result would be P = 101.325 kPa, the normal (atmospheric) pressure.

For example, if 1.5 mol C6H6 is present, 11.25 mol O2 is required: If in fact 18 mol O2 are present, there will be an excess of (18 - 11.25) = 6.75 mol of unreacted oxygen when all the benzene is consumed. Benzene is then the limiting reagent. This conclusion can be verified by comparing the mole ratio of O2 and C6H6 required by the balanced equation with the mole ratio actually present: required: actual: Since the actual ratio is larger than required, O2 is the reagent in excess, which confirms that benzene is the limiting reagent.",

Morse, is a convenient interatomic interaction model for the potential energy of a diatomic molecule. It is a better approximation for the vibrational structure of the molecule than the quantum harmonic oscillator because it explicitly includes the effects of bond breaking, such as the existence of unbound states. It also accounts for the anharmonicity of real bonds and the non-zero transition probability for overtone and combination bands. The Morse potential can also be used to model other interactions such as the interaction between an atom and a surface. Due to its simplicity (only three fitting parameters), it is not used in modern spectroscopy. However, its mathematical form inspired the MLR (Morse/Long-range) potential, which is the most popular potential energy function used for fitting spectroscopic data.

Although neutral 163Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized 163Dy66+ undergoes β decay into the K and L shells with a half-life of 47 days. Another possibility is that a fully ionized atom undergoes greatly accelerated β decay, as observed for 187Re by Bosch et al., also at Darmstadt. Neutral 187Re does undergo β decay with a half-life of years, but for fully ionized 187Re75+ this is shortened to only 32.9 years. For comparison the variation of decay rates of other nuclear processes due to chemical environment is less than 1%. Due to the difference in the price of rhenium and osmium and the high share of in Rhenium samples found on earth, this could some day be of commercial interest in the synthesis of precious metals.

In the specific cases of melting and freezing, it's called enthalpy of fusion or heat of fusion. If the molecular bonds in a crystal lattice are strong, the heat of fusion can be relatively great, typically in the range of 6 to 30 kJ per mole for water and most of the metallic elements. If the substance is one of the monatomic gases, (which have little tendency to form molecular bonds) the heat of fusion is more modest, ranging from 0.021 to 2.3 kJ per mole. Relatively speaking, phase transitions can be truly energetic events. To completely melt ice at 0 °C into water at 0 °C, one must add roughly 80 times the thermal energy as is required to increase the temperature of the same mass of liquid water by one degree Celsius.

However, the strong hydrogen bonds in water make it different: for some pressures higher than , water freezes at a temperature below 0 °C, as shown in the phase diagram below. The melting of ice under high pressures is thought to contribute to the movement of glaciers. Ice, water, and water vapour can coexist at the triple point, which is exactly 273.16 K (0.01 °C) at a pressure of 611.657 Pa. The kelvin was in fact defined as of the difference between this triple point and absolute zero, though this definition changed in May 2019. Unlike most other solids, ice is difficult to superheat.

The Raman spectrum of nitrogen clathrate shows a N-N stretching frequency at 2322.4 cm−1, this is smaller than for nitrogen dissolved in water (2325.0 cm−1) and gaseous nitrogen (2327.7 cm−1).

So does the surface of \"buckyballs\" (buckminsterfullerene). This ring behaves like a circular waveguide, with the valence electrons orbiting in both directions. To fill all energy levels up to n requires electrons, as electrons have additionally two possible orientations of their spins. This gives exceptional stability (\"aromatic\"), and is known as the Hückel's rule. Further in rotational spectroscopy this model may be used as an approximation of rotational energy levels.

Solution Fullerenes are sparingly soluble in aromatic solvents and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 have a deep purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue light transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.",

Assignment in 13C-NMR follow the same considerations as for 1H. Though in carbon NMR intensity is a bad guide to the number of atoms, in the basic ring the unsubstituted carbons are similar enough to use intensity as indication for their number. A powerful tool too is the multiplicity of the carbon signal due to coupling with the to carbon bonded hydrogens. Masamune himself does not state anything about the nature of the intermediate ion.

Due to β-carotene's high level of conjugation, electrons are dispersed throughout the length of the molecule, allowing one to model it as a one-dimensional particle in a box. β-carotene has 11 carbon-carbon double bonds in conjugation; each of those double bonds contains two π-electrons, therefore β-carotene has 22 π-electrons. With two electrons per energy level, β-carotene can be treated as a particle in a box at energy level n=11. Therefore, the minimum energy needed to excite an electron to the next energy level can be calculated, n=12, as follows (recalling that the mass of an electron is 9.109 × 10−31 kg): Using the previous relation of wavelength to energy, recalling both Planck's constant h and the speed of light c:",
