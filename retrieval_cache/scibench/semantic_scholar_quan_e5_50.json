The ground state of the doubly charged ion comes from removal of the two outermost π g electrons and so is a 1 + g state. The single ionisation electron spectrum of S 2 reported by Dyke et al. 10,11 was compared with spectra at 21.22 eV photon energy measured in the present work and used with other evidence to verify the presence of S 2 . Dyke et al.10found the lowest single ionisation energy to be 9.38 eV, confirmed by more recent studies by Hrodmarsson et al. 12  . According to the rule-of-thumb for double ionisation 13 , DIE = (2.2 ± 0.03)IE + (11.5 ± 1)/r 12 , and using an internuclear distance of 1.889 Å 14 , we expect the lowest double ionisation energy of S 2 to be approximately 26.5 eV. However, electron-impact experiments of sulfur performed by Zavilopulo et al.15previously reported a value of 16.8 eV for the double ionisation energy of S 2 . If we assume this is instead the second ionisation energy, the sum of the first and second ionisation energy suggests a double ionisation energy of 26.2 eV.",

Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd 1\nSynopsis Calculations of the leading-order relativistic corrections for the hydrogen molecular ion D + 2 are reported.\n\nProvided high-resolution laser spectroscopy is feasible for the D + 2 ion, together with highprecision calculations of relativistic and quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections, it is possible to derive an improved value of the deuteronelectron mass ratio. Comparing with values derived from other systems one can test the underlying theories, such as QED. Although the ro-vibrational structures of H + 2 and HD + have been systematically calculated in previous works [1,2,3], which show a good agreement with the most precise measurements, there is scarce theoretical calculation about D + 2 except for the nonrelativistic ro-vibrational energy levels. Experimentally no precision measurements have been reported in recent years.\n\nIn this conference, we will present a systematic calculation of ro-vibrational and hyperfine structure of D + 2 , including the leading-order relativistic and QED corrections, for the states of (v, L), where v = 0−4 and L = 0−2.",

These branching ratios and errors (plus/minus one standard deviation) are estimated by simultaneously fitting each feature in Fig. 4 with separate 2-D Gaussian distributions. Following this fitting procedure, we integrate the fit for each dication state to estimate its contribution to the total NH + 2 + H + yield, while the errors of the fits (determined from the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the fit) are used to determine the uncertainty in each branching ratio.\n\nFrom the PES cuts shown in Fig. 1(a) and the energetics presented in Fig. 4 and Table II, we conclude that the (3a −2 1 ) 1 A 1 state dissociates to the NH + 2 ( 3 B 1 ) + H + limit, the (3a −1 1 , 1e −1 ) 3 E state directly dissociates to this very same limit, and the (3a \n(3a 2 1 ) 1 A 1 (1e 1 , 3a 1 1 ) 3 E (1e 1 , 3a 1 1 ) 1 E FIG. 5.\nThe NH + 2 + H + yield as a function of the kinetic energy sum of the photoelectron pair after PDI of NH3 at 61.5 eV (shown in blue).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nThe results presented in this work are the first ones going beyond our previous studies performed on HD + [11,18] and H + 2 [5] for low collision energies relevant for astrophysical applications. Indeed, not only we extended the range of the incident energy of the electron but, furthermore, we considered for the first time simultaneous rotational and vibrational transitions (excitations and/or de-excitations).\n\nThe calculations were performed using the step-wise MQDT method including rotation, briefly outlined in the previous section. We have used the same molecular structure data sets as those from our previous studies [5,11,18]. The cross sections have been calculated with the inclusion of both direct and indirect mechanisms for the Σ + , Π and ∆ -singlet and triplet, gerade and ungerade -symmetries at the highest (second) order of perturbation theory. The energy range considered here was 10 −5 − 1.7 eV, while the energy step was taken as 0.01 meV.\n\nOur results are presented in figures 1-4, where we have chosen three different initial ro-vibrational levels of the ground electronic state of both target systems, namely (N + i , v + i ) = (0, 0), (1, 0) and (0, 1), corresponding to ground state, lowest rotationally excited state and low- est vibrationally excited state respectively.\n\nThe calculated cross sections (Figs. 1-3) are restricted to low collision energies -ε ≤ 0.5 eV -where the rotational effects are the most relevant, while for calculating the rate coefficients (Fig. 4) we have used the cross sections on the whole energy range. Figure 1 shows the dissociative recombination (solid lines) and resonant elastic scattering (dashed lines) cross sections of HD + for the previously defined three initial target states. The background 1 ε trend is due to the direct mechanism, while the resonant structures correspond to the temporary captures of the incident electron into rovibrational levels of Rydberg states -indirect mechanism.",

[28] for a freeelectron gas model (FEG) where the interference contribution is given by I (r) = 2Z 1 Z 2 sin(kr)/kr.However, we have introduced here the EWPM dielectric function corresponding to the target specific inner shell.We also add a \"localization effect\" through the Gaussian \"cutoff\" function f (k) = e −α k 2 <v 2 > centered in zero and defined in terms of the average square velocity of that shell.This form of cutoff function was introduced by Kihara and Aono [47] as a method to separate short-range and long-range collisions.In our case, for molecules, the purpose of this function is to softly reduce a possible overestimation of the interference contribution for very close collisions of both protons (a low-probability event as shown in Fig. 2).In fact, the results of the calculations for the different targets showed negligible differences for all the atomic levels in the values of the interference term when this function was used, with the standard value α = 1.5 and with the respective values of the square velocities.This agrees with the results of SIPM calculations in Fig. 2, which shows negligible contribution from the close-close interference terms.",

The theoretical results are presented in Table 1, Supplementary Table S1 and as potential energy curves for the gerade and ungerade states in Fig. 5a,b, respectively. For the dication, the potential energy curves result in bound electronic states for lower double ionisation energies, whereas for higher double ionisation energies the states are unbound which lead to efficient dissociation. In particular, a relatively deep potential well is computed for the ground electronic state of S 2+ 2 confirming the long lived nature of this dicationic state and observation of a peak in the mass spectra associated with S 2+ 2 . The formation of S 2+ 2 (X 1 + g ) is associated with the removal of two electrons from the outermost 2π 2 g molecular orbital, which is antibonding in nature. This results in a shortening of the S-S equilibrium distance. For instance, we calculated a S-S distance of 3.588 Bohr (= 1.898 Å) for S 2 (X 3 − g ) and of 3.372 Bohr (= 1.784 Å) for S 2+ 2 (X 1 + g ) (cf. Table 2). Therefore, non-favorable Franck-Condon factors are expected for the S 2 (X 3 − g ) − → S 2+ 2 (X 1 + g ) + 2 e − transition. In particular, the adiabatic double ionisation energy of S 2 should be difficult to measure from the experimental spectra due to the lack of vibrationally resolved structures in contrast to the threshold photoelectron coincidence spectrum and the complete valence double ionisation electron spectrum of O 2 22,23 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The empirical rule-of-thumb for estimating double ionisation energies presented by Molloy et al. 13 , DIE = (2.2 ± 0.03)IE + (11.5 ± 1)/r 12 , and using the values of 9.38 eV for the lowest single ionisation energy of S",

There is a considerable degree of scatter in the values around 301 nm and 310 nm, including two points with values (including ltr errors) of qbo, D which exceed 1. This is suggestive of some systematic error in the normalization procedure at the very low photolysis laser powers that were available around these wavelengths.

By fitting the measured g 2 (τ ) with the model given by Eq. (1), we can obtain the decay constants and the bunching contrast at various excitation powers (See details in Section 4 of Supplemental Materials[34]). The filled solid symbols in Fig. 3(h), 3(i) and 3(j) depict α, β, C m as a function of the excitation intensity, respectively. From Eq.(2)-(4), one also gets the power-dependent rates of k 23 and k 31 , which increases dramatically with the excitation power as shown by the triangles and squares in Fig. 3(i), respectively. The dependence of k 23 and k 31 on the excitation power may result from pumping the lowest triplet state to higher triplet states [30,40], which could make fast reverse intersystem crossing and effectively accelerate both k 23 and k 31 . We have measured the photon statistics of 4 DBT molecules in anthracene nanosheet and the extracted rates of intersystem crossing and triplet decay at very weak excitation are shown in Fig. 3(k). Our measurements show that the intersystem crossing rate k 23 is in the order of 5 -20 kHz at very low excitation power and increases quadratically with the increment of the excitation to typically values of hundreds of kHz for DBT molecules in anthracene nanosheet at room temperature.",

Experimental bands tend to be broader on the high energy side, possibly because they encompass the tails of higher excited states. 1,4-anisidine and 1,3-dimethoxybenzene make an exception, with differences in peak positions of 0.18 and 0.15 eV. A possible source of discrepancy is that the GGA functional used in FPMD simulations leads to systematic errors in the geometry of the molecules. The differences between the gas-phase excitation energies of 1,3-dimethoxybenzene computed for geometries optimized with the PBE and PBE0 78 functionals support this hypothesis\n\n\nThe ML spectra are obtained by averaging over 5,000 frames for each molecule, which guarantees smooth line shapes and converged statistical sampling. At this point, convergence is limited only by the capability of FPMD simulations to sample the configurational space of the molecules in aqueous solution. The main features of the ML spectra obtained with this model are almost indistinguishable from the QC references as ML predictions have the same level of accuracy as the training data.From Figures 2 and 4, we can conclude that a unified ML model is able to accurately predict the excitation energies and thus allowing us to compute the spectra for thousands of molecular configurations at nearly no additional computational cost.\n\nFigure ( 4 )\n4UV-Visible absorption spectra for all 10 aromatic molecules.

The computation process consists of a number of stages. The first stage, STG1, is initiated with the wave function of the core ion as the initial input. The core ion wave function was obtained from atomic structure calculations using code SUPERSTRUCTURE (SS) [34,35] which uses the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-Amaldi potential and includes relativistic contributions from the Breit-Pauli approximation. Table 1 presents the 58 levels (the ground and 57 excited fine-structure levels) of Ne 3+ included in the wave function expansion of Ne 2+ obtained from the optimization of 17 configurations of the core ion. The table compares the calculated energies from SS with the observed values available in the compilation of the NIST [36], and shows a good agreement between the two.",

The JT energies, denoted as E 1 JT and E 2 JT for |e ox e ux and |e ox e uy , respectively, are determined by fitting the adiabatic potential energy surfaces (APES) from ab initio results, as shown in Fig. 3. We found that the JT effect is much more significant for |e ox e ux than |e ox e uy , which yields the negligible E 2 JT . More specifically, the values of E 1 JT are 187 meV and 239 meV for the singlets and triplets, respectively, while E 2 JT are only 0.46 meV and 0.14 meV.

Instead, the lowest-energy UV absorbance of phenyl sulfenic esters is an n → σ* excitation with a λ max of ~300 nm. Time-dependent DFT calculations predict that the excitation of this band would directly break the S-O bond (Fig. 2c). In adiabatic quasiclassical trajectory calculations on the excited-state surface, the O-S bond cleavage to >2.5 Å takes <50 fs, too short for significant energy loss to solvent. The energy available for partitioning into 1 and PhS• would then depend on the excitation energy. To calculate the average wavelength of the photons absorbed, the radiant output spectrum of the light sources employed was weighted by the fraction of light absorbed at each wavelength, allowing for the UV-vis spectrum of 7, its concentration, and the path length. For the 350-nm and 450-nm (blue LED) light sources employed, the average absorption wavelengths were 352 and 412 nm, respectively. These absorptions provide 29.2 and 17.4 kcal/mol of excess energy, respectively, above the 52 kcal/mol dissociation energy of the S-O bond in 7. The amount of this energy that is partitioned into vibrational energy in 1 could not be calculated by the single-trajectory method, owing to discontinuities in the time-dependent DFT energy surface. Instead, an impulsive model 24 was applied to the excited state of 7, assuming that all of its excess energy is supplied to an impulse that breaks the S-O bond (see Supplementary Section II.E). This model leads to predicted E vib values in 1 of 10.5 and 6.3 kcal/mol for the nominal 350 nm and 450 nm light sources, respectively.",

It is clear from this equation that the accuracy of the used method should be tested by increasing the values of angular momentum coefficients l, l ′ and considering as high as possible values for principal quantum numbers n, n ′ . In the tables presented in this study, the fixed values for principal quantum numbers, n = 50.1, n ′ = 50.0 are used. The values of orbital parameters are chosen as ρ = 5.1, τ = 0. These values are based on experience from previous calculations which lead to know that methods hitherto developed in order to calculate the two−center overlap integrals with non−integer principal quantum numbers have failed. The values of angular momentum quantum numbers l, l ′ are increased from {l, l ′ } = 0 to {l, l ′ } = 5, respectively. Benchmark results are obtained via numerical global−adaptive method with Gauss−Kronrod numerical integration extension using Mathematica programming language [104].

Additionally, it has been assumed that ω 1,15N /2π = 15 kHz and ω MAS /2π = 39.5 kHz, in line with our experimental setup. The calculations were conducted using the formula by Kurbanov et al., which accounts for the entry of ω 1,15N and ω MAS frequencies into spectral densities. 8 This formula shows an appreciable difference from the standard solution-type expression for the correlation times τ exceeding ca. 1μs. Dashed lines in the plot show the relaxation rate constants close to the detection limit (determined by the maximum duration of the spin-lock period that is dictated by hardware limitations) and thus delineate the range of motional parameters to which R 1ρ measurements are sensitive.\n\nOne should bear in mind that the formula by Kurbanov, as well as other similar results, 9 are derived from the Redfield theory. In principle, the range of validity of this formula is given by the following relationship, 2π(1-S)d NH τ < 0.1, where d NH is the strength of the proton-nitrogen dipolar coupling (11.5 kHz). The region where this condition is violated is shown as a grey hatched area in the plot. However, our numeric simulations suggest that Kurbanov's results remain sufficiently accurate over the broad (S 2 , τ) region, see Figure 5. To explain this observation, one needs to re-analyze the conditions of validity of the Redfield treatment in the rotating frame under fast MAS conditions, as appropriate for the spin-lock experiment under consideration. Such analysis is beyond the scope of this work.",

First, we neglect small contribution to the tensor C due to the electric fields at the position of protons [21]. The remaining part of the tensor C originates from the magnetic fields produced by the electrical currents in the molecule. One can split the tensor C into two terms,\nC = e C + n C,(15)\nwhere e C and n C are due to the electron and nuclear currents in the molecule, respectively.\n\nThe electron part, e C, appears as an average over electron state, which has nonzero value only in the second order perturbation theory. Its calculation needs the knowledge of electron excited states and thus is rather difficult to perform. On the other hand, the nuclear part, n C, has nonzero value for the ground electron state and can be easily estimated. In the following we will neglect the electron part, e C, and will use the estimation C≃ n C. This can be considered as an upper limit for C because molecular electrons are following the rotation of nuclear frame and thus compensate partially the magnetic field produced by nuclei.\n\nThe spin-rotation tensor n C can be presented (in Hz) as [21] \nC (n) = k =n b k [(r k • R k )1 − r k R k ] • B; b k = 2µ p q k /chR 3 k ,(16)\nwhere R k is the radial vector from the proton H (n) to the charge k; r k is the radial from the center of mass to the particle k; q k are the nuclei' charges; B is the inverse matrix of inertia moment.

For this system b R = 1.10. The results for g ij and Dg = g + À À g À À are presented in Fig. 7, where they are compared to MC simulations results of Zwanikken and coworkers. 61 As seen in the figure, the MDE-DH approximation gives excellent results that nearly coincide with the MC ones. Note that the resolution of the ordinate scale in frame (d) of the figure is an order of magnitude larger than in frame (a). It is noteworthy that quite intricate details of the pair distribution functions are obtained in agreement with simulations. Our results are, in fact, slightly better than those of both the HNC approximation and Zwanikken's DHEMSA approximation, 61 which is quite remarkable considering the simplicity of the present Ansatz.\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of core-core correlations in this system, the pair distribution g hs (r) of the hard sphere fluid is plotted in Fig. 7a and it is seen that the main oscillation of g ij (r) with a wave length Ea is caused by these correlations. It is also seen in frames (a) and (b) of the figure that there is another oscillatory component with longer wave length superimposed on the main oscillation. This component is equal to the term 8bw el (r) in eqn (56), which is oscillatory here.*** It makes the g +À and g ÀÀ curves to repeatedly intersect with one another and has a wave length 2p/k I = 2.06a. In frames (c) and (d) this component gives the contribution Dg el (r) = 2bw el (r), which is the electrostatic part of Dg in the current approximation.

Of course, the first thing to be done for checking the validity of such a scheme of electronic configurations would be that of trying to account for the periodicity of the chemical elements, i.e. the counterpart of the closed-shell assumption of the self-consistent field model of the atom. 1.609 · 10 3 9 (F 7+ ) 0.949 0.180 2.048 · 10 3 2.055 · 10 3 10 (Ne 8+ ) 0.954 0.161 2.546 · 10 3 2.556 · 10 3 11 (Na 9+ ) 0.958 0.145 3.099 · 10 3 3.11 · 10 3   Table captions  Table 1 The normalization constants C 0 , the average radii r 0 , the ground-state energies E 0 as given by (11) and the experimental values E exp 0 of the groundstate energies [8] for the ground-state configuration (100) × (100) of the twoelectron atoms (cations), as functions of the nuclear charge Z.

Equation (2) implies that in stellar calculations the Maxwellian averaged burning rates at temperature T become: pl (T ) = nuc (T )exp(U pl =kT) (4) where nuc are the burning rates for bare nuclei. This clearly gives signi cant changes in the temperature T NB at which nuclear burning becomes e cient (which we de ne from the condition nuc (T NB )t = 1, t being the Sun's age). For example, the burning temperature of 7 Li in the Sun, usually quoted as T NB =2.5 (here and in the following T means the temperature in units of 10 6 K), becomes T NB =2.1 for U p+Li pl =700 eV, whereas for 9 Be one moves from T NB =3.5 to T NB =3 passing from U p+Be pl =0 eV to U p+Be pl =700 eV. The basic question addressed in this paper is thus the following: can we nd a range of U pl values which can account for the observational data in stars?",

MBE-FCI results-obtained using reference spaces spanned by (state-averaged) CASSCF(8e,8o) calculations-are presented in Fig. 2, again in comparison with i-FCIQMC results from Ref. 73. In contrast to the earlier LiH example, the i-FCIQMC results for MgO are noted in Ref. 73 to be somewhat less converged and hence associated with an increased degree of uncertainty (particularly for µ 1 ). Be that as it may, i-FCIQMC was still deemed more accurate than, e.g., high-level coupled cluster results 89,90 (CCSDT), in particular in the case of excited state dipole moments, which from the stochastic wave functions in Ref.73 were shown to depend crucially on highly excited determinants which are less successfully described by means of CCSDT.

For the fit the averaged energy of each level was applied. The standard deviation of the fit is σ = 0.012 cm −1 with 51 fit parameters. This value is close to the average experimental uncertainty of 0.015 cm −1 . Fig. 3 b) shows the differences between the measured values and the energies of the (2) 2 Σ + state calculated within the deperturbation. One finds that the deviations at the crossings have been significantly reduced compared to the uncoupled evaluation in Fig. 3 a), and overall they are located within the range of experimental uncertainty which is indicated by the shaded area in the figure.

The package we used is GRASP-JT, which we made some modification based on the GRASP2K package [2]. The results of theoretical calculations and the empirical formula calculation are displayed in Table 1. We can note that the results of empirical formula calculation agree well with our theoretical one for light atoms, but as the mass number increases, the differences become obvious. For heavy atoms, the error of the empirical formula calculation is even larger than the energy measurement accuracy in the state-of-the-art experiment, which is less than 1 KeV [3]. Therefore, it has practical significance to improve the empirical formula.\n\nBesides, in experimental nucleosynthesis processes, heavy nucleus is produced by the collision processes, and the new atom is always not neutral. So we must also take into account the degrees of ionization. The mass of the new atom with the ionization degree of q is: M q Atom (N,Z)=M Nuclide (N,Z)+(Z-q)m e -B e (Z). More work will be done to improve the empirical formula, the details and the improved formula will be presented in the conference. \n\nTable 1 .\n1Results of theoretical calculation andempirical formular calculation \nDifferent \nelements(mass \nnum.) \n\nEmpirical \nformula \ncal. \n\nOur cal. \nRodrigues \n's cal.[1] \n\nEnergy (KeV) \n3(7) \n0.199 \n0.202 \n0.202 \n11(23) \n4.451 \n4.410 \n4.409 \n19(39) \n16.444 \n16.360 \n16.361 \n37(85) \n81.200 \n81.003 \n81.013 \n55(133) \n211.619 \n211.576 \n211.614 \n87(223) \n660.667 \n659.999 \n660.083 \n119(303) \n1516.074 1523.803 \n-\n\n\n.

All physical properties could then be calculated using the physical space part of the orbitals, with multiplicative factors of two in the right places to account for the double occupancy of each physical space orbital. The triplet state of H2 is not, of course, a closed-shell system, but it is completely spin-polarized, meaning the azimuthal component of spin is at its maximum, that is m s = S. For spin-polarized as for closed-shell systems, just one Slater determinant is needed, and all physical properties can be found from the physical space orbitals. However, each single-particle orbital is singly instead of doubly occupied, because the spins of the electrons are parallel. For a locally uniform electron gas this means that at a particular point, with local potential V(r) and local Fermi energy ~F(r), the total spin-polarized electron gas density p~ (r) = 89 where p(r) is the total electron density when each physical space orbital is doubly occupied. To convert the results of our previous work to those appropriate to a spin-polarized electron gas, we need to insert factors of two in appropriate places. For example, from the ordinary field-free Thomas-Fermi-Dirac energy functional [12] V TED [p(r)], which gives the local potential from the local density, we can find VT TFD, the local potential for a spin-polarized electron gas, as a function of the spin-polarized density:\nVT T~D[pT(r)] = v ~~ T(r)] _ 22/3 h 2 [ 3n2pt(r)] 2/3-(1)\nCarrying through the procedure logically consistent with this on the kinetic and exchange energy densities given in (37) \n+ 4(3napr) he r 2 xE ]} r2 B)Xel(21/3a) + 1 a\" BXe2(2U3a) ,\nwhere the variable a is defined as\na =-[3rt2pt(r)]W3r",

This quotient would be unitless if you were to view the 'e' as being in an energy unit, such as electron volts (eV ). . . then, 'k B T ' (or 'RT ' for the molar quantity) works out to be 2.48 kJ (per mole) at room temperature, and 1 eV = 1.602 * 10 19 J (per particle). So, in that way you could (wrongly) view the units as 'cancelling', but this really is not the meaning of k B T /e -rather, it is energy (in fact the fundamental scale for thermal energy, 'k B T '), normalized by charge ('e'), and that quotient (energy per unit charge) is the definition of voltage. Also, as another way of thinking about it, the above development is akin to the relationship between an electrostatic force at some point in space ( F el ) and the magnitude of the electric field at that point ( E): E = F el /q for charge 'q'. In other words, one can think of the electrostatic field [2] as being the electrostatic force normalized by an elementary unit of test-charge (. . . and so k B T /e can be viewed as an energy density).\n © 2014 Cameron Mura, Creative Commons \"Attribution+ShareAlike\" license (by-sa) c b a\nAcknowledgementsThis work in the Mura lab at UVa was partly supported by UVa start-up funds, the Jeffress Memorial Trust (J-971), and an NSF Career award (MCB-1350957).",

In the exact case,ṽ(r) = v(r), but this is not necessarily true for approximations. In previous work [17], it was shown that in PFT, once n[v](r) is given, F [v] can be deduced, either by a coupling-constant integral or a virial relation. When applied to non-interacting fermions, an approximation n S [v S ](r) yields an approximation T S [v S ], where v S (r) is the potential in this non-interacting case. Now we introduce a direct approximation to the XC energy, E XC [v S ], as a functional of the KS potential, and ask: How can these two approximations be used to find the ground-state energy of interacting fermions? This question differs from that of deducing the KS equations in DFT, because here the approximation is a potential functional, not a density (or orbital-dependent) functional.",

The (G)KS HOMO and LUMO energies from density functional approximation (DFA) with minimum delocalization error are good approximations to −I and −A, based on the rigorously proven results on connection to the chemical potentials. 20 We observed from our recent work 45 that the remaining (G)KS orbital energies from the localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC), a DFA with minimal delocalization error, 46 approximate the corresponding quasiparticle energies well. Thus the entire set of (G)KS orbital energies from a DFA with minimal delocalization error can be used to obtain the photoemission spectrum with good agreement to the experimental reference, suggesting these orbital energies are good approximations to the quasiparticle energies. Based on this observation, we have demonstrated that the excitation energy of an N -electron system can be approximated by the orbital energy difference from an (N −1)-electron system. Bartlett 47 and our group 45,48 demonstrated this is an efficient way to calculate the excitation energy by orbital energies from (G)KS-DFT. Results from our previous work have showed good performance for the low-lying and Rydberg excitation energies within this methodology. 45 Therefore, in this paper, we further explore this approach for application to CT excitation problems.",

Because DFT is formulated in terms of the ground state density, the coupling between the external potential and the density takes a simple (linear) form. This nuclear-electron attraction E Ne [ρ] energy can be evaluated exactly as (8) where υ(r) is the potential experienced by electrons interacting with a set of nuclei. The expectation value of the E ee energy in eq 3 is in DFT terminology expressed as a sum of terms, (9) where J[ρ] denotes the Hartree or mean-field approximation to E ee as calculated in DFT, (10) We remind that one part of the function of the E xc [ρ] energy is to compensate for the inclusion of electron-self-interaction in J [ρ]. In other words, whereas there is a criterion i < j in eq 3 that is carried over to HF approximations, the Hartree term is corrected differently in DFT. [14][15][16][17][18][19]64 The formulation of E ee in eq 9 follows from the definition of the XC energy,\nE xc [ρ] = ⟨T⟩ + ⟨V ee ⟩ − J[ρ] − T KS , 62,65 since T c [ρ]\nis just the difference between the actual kinetic energy and T KS , the kinetic energy of a single Slater determinant of KS orbitals. 62 By combining eqs 1−3 with eqs 7−10, we arrive at the formally exact DFT-based determination of the averaged electron energy: (11) Equation 11 is mostly given in terms provided by generic molecular and periodic DFT codes. We do, however, need a separate step for computing the T c [ρ] term, which we outline in the SI. Fortunately, the T c [ρ] term is often small compared to the total XC energy in molecules, where exchange dominates. In cases where this assumption holds in practice we may proceed with an approximate characterization, (12) where all terms are directly available in standard molecular DFT codes. We shall use this approximation for the analysis below because we have documented that, for the set of investigated molecules, the ratio of T c and E xc is at most 6% (Table S1).",

At the single-reference HF and DFT-levels of approximation, the sum in eq A12 does indeed reduce to a finite sum of discrete peaks, as in eq 6, each having an integer weight. This follows because (a) with a single Slater determinant, there is only a limited number of occupied orbitals from which you can extract electrons and (b) in a mean-field description of electron interactions there is no mixing of Slater determinants to reduce the unity weight of each excitation.

Firstly, we do the electronic-structure calculation without considering the perturbation by positron to obtain the ground-state electronic density n e− ( r) and Coulomb potential V Coul ( r) sensed by positron. Then, the positron density is determined by solving the Kohn-Sham Eq.:\n[− 1 2 ∇ r +V Coul ( r) +V corr ( r)]ψ + = ε + ψ + , n e+ ( r) = |ψ + ( r)| 2 ,(1)\nwhere V corr ( r) is the correlation potential between electron and positron. Finally, the positron lifetime can be obtained by the inverse of the annihilation rate, which is proportional to the product of positron density and electron density accompanied by the so-called enhancement factor arising from the correlation energy between a positron and electrons [21]. The equations are written as follows:\nτ e+ = 1 λ , λ = πr 2 0 c d rn e− ( r)n e+ ( r)γ(n e− ),(2)\nwhere r 0 is the classical electron radius, c is the speed of light, and γ(n e− ) is the enhancement factor of the electron density at the position r. The positron affinity can be calculated by adding electron and positron chemical potentials together:\nA + = µ − + µ + .(3)\nThe positron chemical potential µ + is determined by the positron ground-state energy. The electron chemical potential µ − is derived from the Fermi energy (top energy of the valence band) in the case of a metal (a semiconductor). This scheme is still accurate for a perfect lattice, as in this case the positron density is delocalized and vanishingly small at every point thus does not affect the bulk electronic-structure [6,21]. In practice of this work, each enhancement factor is applied identically to all electrons as suggested by K. O. Jensen [22]. These enhancement factors can be divided into two categories: the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and parameterized by the following equation,",

The results presented above for atomic systems suggest that orbital angular momentum projection constraints may play a similarly important role in the v2RDM-based description of states with non-zero Λ (e.g., Π, ∆, Φ, etc. states). Hence, in this Section, we explore the utility of constraints onL z and (∆L z ) 2 in linear molecular systems, beginning with a simple question: at the v2RDM level of theory, is the ground state of molecular oxygen a singlet or a triplet? Table III illustrates the energy gap between the 3 Σ and 1 ∆ states of molecular oxygen, as computed at the v2RDM, full CI, and MRCISD+Q levels of theory, in various basis sets. Here, a positive value for the gap indicates that the triplet is lower in energy.

Apart from the attraction between the nucleus and electrons, there remain two principal contributions to the energy in an atomic system: (1) inter-electronic repulsion, which is responsible for the energy separation between the terms arising from a given configuration, and (2) spin-orbit interaction, which gives rise to the energy intervals between the components within a given term. In the L-S coupling scheme, it is assumed that electronic repulsion is much greater than spin-orbit interaction. In the terminology of quantum mechanics, the spin-orbit interaction in this scheme is treated as a perturbation.\n\nThe L-S coupling scheme involves the orbital angular momentum quantum number L and the spin angular momentum quantum number S. They define an electronic term conventionally designated by a term symbol written in the form 2S+1 L J . The addition of L and S gives the total angular momentum quantum number J, which has the allowed values given by the sequence: L + S, L + S -1, … , |L -S|.

Beware of the possible confusion between the code symbol S for L = 0 and the total spin angular momentum quantum number, which is also designated as S.

The ground state is the configuration with the highest multiplicity according to Hund's first rule. Thus, the configuration at the left side of Figure 9 corresponds to the ground state because the multiplicity is the highest due to the nonzero total spin angular momentum (s = |∑m s | = 1, and the multiplicity is 3). For the other two configurations in Figure 9, the total spin angular momentum is zero, and the multiplicity is 1. The structure of four electrons in 2p orbitals is the same as that of two electrons in 2p orbitals because it is equivalent to the closed-shell structure (six electrons in 2p orbitals with s = L = 0, where L is the total orbital angular momentum) minus the structure of two electrons in 2p orbitals [112]. Accordingly, the total orbital angular momentum can take the values of L = 0, 1, and 2 because the allowed values of the total angular momentum for the system of two angular momenta of j 1 and j 2 are j = j 1 + j 2 , j 1 + j 2 -1, . . . , |j 1 − j 2 | according to quantum mechanics [113].

It is known that L = 0 is also impossible for this case due to Pauli's exclusion principle [112].

This classification of orbitals into atomic shells is further sub-divided because an electron can occupy an atomic shell by orbiting around in various forms. These different forms are captured by the notion of subshell, and each subshell is represented by the angular momentum quantum number, l. In chemistry, one writes down the shell and subshell that an electron occupies, in terms of the value of the principle quantum number (n) and the letters s,p,d,f that correspond to the values of the angular momentum quantum number (l). So, for example 1 s represents a subshell of the s-form that occupies the lowest atomic shell, 2p represents the p subshell in the second atomic shell etc.\n\nMoreover, from the quantum calculation of the probability density of finding an electron at a particular subshell, it turns out that not all atomic shells allow all forms of subshells (p. 33, Atkins and Jones 2010). This is because for example, the wave function of a p-electron vanishes at its nucleus. That is why, in shell-1 an electron will be found to occupy only an s-subshell, and not a p-or f-subshell. Keeping this in mind, quantum mechanics has posited a ranking of orbitals of the following form:\n1s \\ 2s \\ 2p \\ 3s \\ 3p \\ 3d\\ Á Á Á\nThe third feature required to specify the orbital of an electron is the magnetic quantum number, m l . The value of m l specifies the individual orbitals within a subshell and represents the different direction of each orbital within that subshell.\n\nThe last element for a complete description of the electrons' orbitals, is derived from Pauli's Principle. Pauli introduced a rule according to which a maximum of two electrons can occupy one orbital; namely an orbital with a specific set of (n,l, m l ) numbers. These two electrons are viewed as if moving on opposite directions on the orbital and they are represented uniquely in chemistry by one more quantum number, namely spin (which takes two possible values; ?1/2, -1/2).",

The data in Fig. 1 indicate that, in some cases (boron, carbon, and oxygen), the application of such constraints reduces the error in the v2RDM energy by more than a factor of two. Moreover, angular momentum constraints also allow us to directly optimize 2-RDMs for excited states that are not otherwise accessible by v2RDM methods. Table II illustrates energy differences between excited spin and orbital angular momentum states and the ground electronic states for all second-row atoms, except lithium and neon. Note that all results tabulated under the heading \"L z \" correspond to the maximum orbital angular momentum projection. First, we consider those states that are accessible without angular momen-  Table II for which numerical values are given under the heading \"real\"). For the beryllium atom, the 1 S → 3 P transition is equally welldescribed by all combinations of angular momentum constraints considered. On the other hand, the description of every other transition energy is improved by the consideration of angular momentum constraints, sometimes dramatically so. In particular, the consideration ofL 2 symmetry improves the almost 1 eV error in the description of the 4 S → 2 D transition in nitrogen by 0.32 eV. The subsequent application of the constraint on L z reduces the error to only 0.15 eV. Now, consider those cases in Table II where no numerical values are given under the heading \"real;\" the excited states in question are inaccessible to the v2RDM approach unless angular momentum constraints are imposed. In one case, the 4 S → 4 P transition in nitrogen, a constraint on the expectation value ofL 2 yields a terrible estimate of the excitation energy; it is too low by 5.78 eV. However, subsequent application of the constraint on L z yields an excitation energy that agrees with that from the full CI to within less than 0.01 eV. We also observe that the application of theL z constraint improves over the consideration of theL 2 constraint alone for the 4 S → 2 P transition in nitrogen, although the improvement is less dramatic in this case. On the other hand, it appears that the application of theL 2 constraint alone gives superior results to the application of bothL",

This second 6 + is about 0.1 MeV higher in energy than the lowest 6 + in the T0JUN45 calculation. It may be that the two lowest 6 + states have switched order in removing the T = 0 matrix elements, allowing us to recapture a strong B(E2:6 → 4) without needing to resort to T = 0 effects. However, one thing clearly missing in the T0JUN45 calculation is a strong B(E2) connecting a J = 8 to a J = 6 state. (There is no such transition even if we expand to looking at the first half-dozen 6 + and 8 + levels in the T0JUN45 calculation.)\n\nWhile the results from [1] would seem to be pointing to the possibility of T = 0 pairing, it would appear that the experimental properties of the J = 8 state are needed to fully settle the question.\n\nNote that as one goes to higher angular momentum, beyond J = 4, the B(E2) values steadily decrease. This is typical of what happens in all shell model calculations and indeed experiment. In ref [3] we show the well known formulas for B(E2) values in the rotational and vibrational models. Both show ready increases with J. There have been attempts to get rotational bands which terminate e.g the work of Brink et al. [31]. Their work is also described in Igal Talmi's book. [32].\n\nQi et al. [33] also point out the importance of looking at electromagnetic transitions. For example they note in the vibrational model the B(E2)'s to the first excited state from the next J = 0, 2, 4 two-phonon triplet should all be the same -0(2) to 2(1), 2(2) to 2(1) and 4(1) to 2(1). However in their shell model calculations even though the energy levels display a harmonic behavior, the B(E2) 0(2) to 2(1) is much weaker than the other two.\n\n\nA Brief Comparison with 48 Cr",

A hybrid non-relativistic/relativistic electronic structure approach was needed to overcome the computational challenges arising from the complexity of their open submerged 4f electronic shell structure partially hidden by a closed 6s 2 shell. This allowed us for the first time to determine a complete set of ground-state potentials for a wide range of interatomic separations.\n\nA non-relativistic coupled-cluster calculation was used to determine the spin-stretched potential energy surfaces with the maximum allowed total electron spin S and projection quantum number Λ of the total electron orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis. Then we used a relativistic multi-configuration-interaction calculation to determine the splittings among the potentials dissociating to two ground state atoms. There are 91 gerade/ungerade potentials for Er 2 (with Ωs from 0 to 12) and 36 potentials for Tm 2 (with Ωs from 0 to 7). We identified the splittings as due to different relative orientations of the angular momenta of 4f shell electrons.",

From this state, the only symmetry allowed transitions are perpendicular and parallel transitions into 2 P u and 2 S + u states, respectively. Within 3 eV, two 2 S + u and two 2 P u states can be found. Among these states, only the 1 2 P u state is bound, the others are dissociative. When accounting for spin-orbit effects (see Table S3 in the ESI †), the S states are only slightly affected, with shifts of up to 5 meV. However, the doubly-degenerate P states split into two states, separated by B10-35 meV (80-280 cm À1 ).\n\nComparison of the calculations with experiment, summarized in Table 1, allows us to assign the three main bands observed in the experiment as 1 2 S + u , 1 2 P u , and 2 2 P u , reproducing the excitation energy to within 0.1 eV. The fourth allowed transition into 2 2 S + u at B3.1 eV (see Table S2, ESI †) is not observed in the experiment due to insufficient laser power in this region.

As the  band center region at about 2057.2cm −1 is not free of spectroscopic signal and hence the first R-and P -branch lines, R(0) and P (2), were not detectable in a straightforward fashion, the initial assignment was performed by manually adjusting the band origin (while keeping B 0 and B 3 fixed at their calculated values) until good visual agreement between experiment and simulation was reached. In a second step, the band origin as well as B 0 and B 3 were then released in the fitting procedure and quantum number assignment to the experimental lines was adjusted such to best reproduce the calculated bestestimate rotational constants (Table 2). Overall, 118 rotational-vibrational transitions -ranging from P(112) to R(110) -were assigned to this isotopologue. The experimental transition wavenumbers were fit to within experimental accuracy by varying only three parameters using a standard linear rotor Hamiltonian: the vibrational band center, the ground-state rotational constant B 0 , and the upper-state rotational constant B 3 , or, alternatively, the corresponding rotation-vibration interaction parameter α 3 . All spectroscopic data were analyzed using Pickett's SPFIT/SPCAT [59] as well as the Pgopher program [60] (see also the supplementary electronic material). In the following, despite a considerable number of (partially) overlapping lines and the resulting spectral complexity, five additional isotopic species were identified in the spectrum. Based on isotopic abundance and spin statistical considerations, the ν 3 band of the 78-80 species is about half as intense as that of the 80-80 species (Table 2), followed by the 78-78 species at about one fourth and the 82-80, 76-80 and 77-80 species whose bands are expected to be weaker by factors of five to seven. Spectroscopic assignment of these species was performed based on their calculated band centers and lower and upper state rotational constants, B 0 and B 3 , all of which were scaled further using correction factors derived from a comparison of the calculated and experimental parameters of the parent 80-80 species (see Table",

This strongly hints that the 2 1 A g state is in some sense composed of two triplets, as suggested also by the work of Tavan and Schulten [10]. From Fig. 3 we see that the 1 3 B u state has the lattice distortion appropriate to two neutral solitons, and the 2 1 A g prefers a 4soliton configuration at N =12. Does this mean that one should view the 2 1 A g state as composed of four solitons? Such an interpretation was proposed in the renormalization group studies of Hayden and Mele [11] but is explicitly contradicted in the configuration interaction studies [10] and (at least apparently) in combined experimental/theoretical studies on octatetraene [12]. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine a definitive answer to this question (see Ref.s [3] and [6] for a more thorough discussion). At present, our data on the fully relaxed geometry and energy of the 2 1 A g state on the largest systems (N = 12,14) are not sufficient to determine the resolution of this question unambiguously. This difficulty arises in part because the 2 1 A g state is not the lowest singlet state of A g symmetry and thus must be extracted from the Lanczös data with considerable care. However, to date our Lanczös results are most consistent with the \"4-soliton\" viewpoint for long polyenes, and not inconsistent with the experiment showing a different geometry for octatetraene.

Because these are atomic orbitals (single electron eigenfunctions) the total spin eigenvalue is 1/2. Writing out the elements of each set we obtain: sA = {sA(0, −1/2), sA(0, 1/2)} sB = {sB(0, −1/2), sB(0, 1/2)} sC = {sC(0, −1/2), sC(0, 1/2)} pA = {pA(−1, −1/2), pA(−1, 1/2), pA(0, −1/2), pA(0, 1/2), pA(1, −1/2), pA(1, 1/2)} (42) Hence there are 12 atomic orbitals here.

All the initial clusters experience fast structure rearrangement during the first 40 ps because the chemical environment is significantly changed when they are separated from the detonation product system. Numerous small molecular fragments are produced with part of the cluster disaggregation (see the snapshots at 40 ps in Figure 1), which can easily collide and react with each other to form the products of CO2, N2, and H2O. As the gas molecules liberate, the large carbon-branched chains are constructed through translational motion, rotation, and the twisting of remaining molecular fragments. Some single molecular rings are generated in this process (see Figure S3 for supporting information), and even a few irregular polycyclics are formed under 50 and 60 GPa. This is similar to the graphene formation process reported by Wen et al. [34]. Further collision and aggregation can directly produce more polycyclic structures, resulting in the formation of small quasi-plane configurations (see the snapshots at 115 ps for 40 and 50 GPa, and 70 ps for 60 GPa in Figures 1 and S3 in supporting information). Up to 190 ps, the initial plane structure is almost completed under 50 GPa, which is really ambiguous for the condition of 40 GPa. It illustrates that it is preferable for the initial carbon layers to be formed under higher pressure. Moreover, the higher pressure can promote the formation of quadruple-coordinated carbon atoms, with the bonding of dangling C atoms between adjacent molecular layers (such as the snapshots of 280 ps under 50 GPa, and 160 ps under 60 GPa). More significantly, we observe the obvious rearrangement phenomenon of the initial layer configuration from 70 to 160 ps under 60 GPa, and the disorder cluster configuration is generated temporarily (see the snapshot of 115 ps in Figure 1c). It illustrates that the carbon layer structure is not stable under such high temperatures and pressure.  Figure 2 shows the bonded features of carbon atoms during the structure deformation. The average coordination numbers of carbon increase gradually as the reaction proceeds, with the ranges from 1.925 to 2.893, 2.333 to 2.950, and 2.650 to 3.230 for the conditions of 40 GPa, 50 GPa, and 60 GPa,",

By the 2D nature, there is a mirror plane symmetry (the basal plane) in each of the 2D systems. The p z orbital is odd with respect to the basal plane, while s, p x , p y orbitals are even. Therefore, there is no mixing between out-of-plane p z π states and in-plane s+p x +p y σ states. The representative PDOSs for BC 2 -I, BC-I, and B 2 C-I are shown in Fig. 10. As mentioned above, the p z π states are partially occupied. We can clearly see that the separation between bonding σ states and anitibonding σ* states. For BC 2 -I [ Fig. 10(a)], the C σ states end at -1.7 eV and the C σ* states start at 7.0 eV; while the B σ states extend up to 6 eV. For BC 2 -I [ Fig. 10(c)], the hybridized C-B σ states are hole-doped with the Fermi level 0.8 eV below the top of the σ bonding states. Interestingly, in BC-I, the σ bonding states are fully occupied, while the anitibonding σ* states are empty [see Fig. 10(a)]. The large energy separation (4.2 eV) between σ and σ* states and the full occupation of the σ bonding states are responsible for the peculiar stability of BC-I. Previously, it was found 11 that boron α-sheet is most stable due to the optimal filling of σ bonding states:\n\nElectrons fill all σ bonding states while leaving all antibonding σ* states empty, and any remaining electrons partially fill out-of-plane π states. The reason why best boron 2D structures are determined by the optimal filling of the in-plane manifold is that σ bonds are stronger than π bonds. In this study, we find that the most stable 2D structures of BC and BC 3 (PDOS for the semiconducting BC 3 -I not shown here) have such an optimal filling of σ bonding states, while the other 2D B-C compounds do not.",

The additional nitrogen electron rests relatively localized and disrupts the local conjugation, reducing the local π-and π * contributions and resulting instead in a strong p z -signal at the Fermi level, which is, not sampled ( Supplementary Fig. S7). Instead there is an exceptionally sharp \"molecular like\" signature at the start of the σ * band, as shown in the partial p x-y -DOS; the rest of the σ * signal is significantly reduced compared to bulk N1s edge EELS measurements for nitrogen doped nanotube samples in the literature (26,31). We note that no apparent damage was observed after the acquisition of this SI ( Supplementary Fig. S2). This is consistent with earlier calculations of electron beam knock-on cross-sections (27) suggesting that substitutional nitrogen and its neighbours should be stable under a 60 kV beam. This suggests that this configuration of substitutional graphitic nitrogen is a minority species in these bulk measurements carried out at higher acceleration voltages",

The CCD equations comprise a set of quadratic equations for the unknown t 2 amplitudes. In the nonorthogonally spinadapted formalism (see, e.g., Ref. 14), the number of t 2 amplitudes is equal to K = n o n u (n o n u + 1)/2, where n o and n u is the number of occupied and unoccupied orbitals, respectively (no symmetry other then the spin one is assumed). According to the Bézout theorem, such a set of quadratic equations may have up to 2 K solutions, a truly astronomical number in most applications. Therefore, finding the complete set of CCD solutions may be attempted only when the number of t 2 amplitudes is very small (e.g., due to the spatial symmetry of the many-electron system). In the homotopy study of the H4 model [3] (corresponding to 6 spin-and spatialsymmetry-adapted t 2 amplitudes), the complete set of CCD solutions numbered 12, which is distinctly smaller than the Bézout limit (64). On the other hand, the application of the homotopy method to the PPP model of benzene [5] (having 8 t 2 amplitudes adapted to spin, spatial, and time-reversal symmetry) has brought in some quite disturbing findings: not only the total number of solutions (230) approached the theoretical limit (256), but some solutions led to the correlation energies much more negative than that of the \"standard\" CCD solution (which approximate the ground-state FCI solution); in addition all the \"nonstandard\" solutions were hardly similar to the FCI ones.",

The half difference of the number of valence electrons occupying bonding MOs and the number of electrons occupying antibonding MOs is the bond order, in general, it is an integer but fractions of integer are also possible if degenerate MOs are not fully occupied or the system is ionized. According to this recipe, the bond order corresponding to electron configuration σ 2 s σ * 2 s π 4 is 2, for σ 2 s σ * 2 s σ 2 p π 2 it is also 2, and for σ 2 s σ 2 p π 4 it is 4. But, if the MOs are energetically close the order of the MOs may change when the geometry changes giving different electron configurations and bond orders. In such situations multiconfigurational wave functions must be used, for which no bond order is defined. The ground state has Σ + g character for C-C distances shorter than 1.70Å, there the CSF derived from the electron configuration σ 2 s σ * s π 2 x π 2 y contributes about 70 percent to the wave function, and the CSF derived from σ 2 s σ 2 p π 2 x π 2 y contributes about 10 percent. Ignoring all CSFs that contribute in total 20 percent to the wave function, what bond order has a system with 70 percent bond order 2 and 10 percent bond order 4? In my opinion, more important than to answer this question is to find out how spins and charges rearrange on the way from two isolated atoms to the molecule, that is, how the interaction of the atoms disturbs their electron distributions during the recombination reaction, or how the electron and spin arrangement in the molecule readjust to that in the free atoms during dissociation.\n\n\nOVB analysis of bonding in C 2",

At the end of the simulation, almost all the single-bonded structures convert into multi-bonded structures, illustrating the high activity and low stability of the dangling atoms. A few numbers of double-bonded atoms remain in the system, whose number becomes smaller when yielding to the higher pressure of 50 GPa (see Figure 2a,b). It denotes that high pressure can promote the conversion from carbon sp-to a sp 2 -hybrid. Although some quadruple-bonded C atoms are observed during the dynamics process, they cannot exist stably, and almost no sp 3 -hybrid carbon remained after the simulation. As for 60 GPa, the fraction evolutions of double-and single-bonded carbon are similar to the conditions of 40, and 50 GPa, but the apparent transformations between triple-and quadruple-bonded structures (sp 2 ↔sp 3 ) are observed for the first time. This process is reversible and happens several times (see Figures 2c and S4a in supporting information), representing a delicately dynamic equilibrium for these two conformations. After 220 ps, a slight advantage is observed for the conversion of sp 2 to sp 3 , with the ratio of sp 3 to sp 2 keeping a relatively large value. And the final fraction of sp 3 -hybridized atoms reaches about 26%. As the bonded structure deforms the carbon cluster, many carbon-based fragments can rearrange into various molecular rings. Figure 3 displays the population evolutions of carbon rings with different sizes. The cluster mainly consists of five, six, seven, and eight-member rings. All the molecular rings increase gradually at an early stage, which indicates that the degree of crystallization of carbon clusters is enhanced [35]. Among them, the hexatomic ring is the most stable unit, which possesses the highest formation rate and population.

Only these states are responsible for the stabilization of the system when the atoms approach, the large weight of LC05 suggests that the bonding situation is dominated by a σ and a π bond, but the weight of LC06, which represents two π bonds without a σ bonds shows, that even at long distances the number and kind of bonds is not definite. At short C-C distances, the weight of LC07 becomes large, this LC describes two singlet coupled atomic quintet states. The weight of LC07 is larger than those of LC05 and LC06, but ionic LCs or LCs describing intra-atomic charge shifts contribute together much more to the ground state wave function than LC07.\n\nThe attempt to claim that C 2 has around the equilibrium distance a quadruple bond ignores the fact, that the occurrence of LC07 at the equilibrium does not mean that the carbon atom is there in a local quintet state. After all, no interacting subsystem of a system is in a pure state but only in a mixed state, which allows only to say with which probability a certain pure state can be expected.

The results with bulk truncated structures are denoted by full (spherical truncation) and open (facetted truncation) circles, respectively. It can be seen that in addition to the general trend of decreasing energy with respect to the total number of atoms, one can also identify some explicit local minima for the spherically truncated clusters. It turns out that some of these local minima correspond either to the bucky-diamond cluster (C 147 ), or bucky-diamond-like clusters (C 275 and C 705 ) (Ref [2]). This is really quite remarkable since it indicates that the relaxation scheme based on the SCED-LCAO Hamiltonian can lead directly from the initial configurations of spherical bulk truncation to buckydiamond-like structures at precisely N=147, 275, and 705, demonstrating the robustness of the SCED-LCAO Hamiltonian. We have also carried out a detailed analysis of the relaxed structures of the clusters of spherical bulk truncation to shed light on the existence of the local minima. In Table 3, relevant quantities characterizing the relaxed structures of carbon clusters of spherical bulk truncations with completed shells are listed. It can be seen that while local minima occur at N = 29,71,147,275,381,465,633,and 705 (see Fig. 2), only those at N = 147, 275, and 705 share the same unique property, namely, the atoms in these clusters have no more than one \"dangling bond\". It should be noted that for a tetravalent atom, the dangling bond associated with the atom is defined with respect to the complete sp 3 bonding nature with the atom having four nearest neighbors. Thus, atoms in a cluster with no more than one dangling bond indicates that atoms in this cluster either have three (one dangling bond) or four nearest neighbors (no dangling bond). Since carbon atoms can form either strong sp 2 bonds (with three nearest neighbors) or sp 3 bonds (with four nearest neighbors), a carbon cluster with its atoms having no more than one dangling bond is therefore a more stable cluster compared to its neighboring clusters with their component atoms having more than one dangling bond.

These states are the first lowest states for all system, but not at the same ordering. The DFT calculations predict a triplet ground state 3 A 2 for all single vacancy structures. The triplet and singlet A 2 and B 1 states comprise the first four lowest states, except for pyrene-1C, and they are separated by no more than 0.35 eV from the ground state. The closed shell A 1 state increases in energy when expanding the graphene flakes; it falls in the range of 0.2-0.6 eV above the ground state in all systems.  The orbitals computed for the relaxed structure resemble the ones of the unrelaxed one ( Figure 2) closely and are displayed in Figure S1. Energy scheme, electronic configuration and optimised bridging bond (C 7 -C 8 ) distances are displayed in Figure 4 and Figure 5 (Table  S7) for the planar relaxed structures of pyrene-1C, Figure 6.

Upping the level of the basis set to aug-cc-pVQZ (close to, but not quite a CBS) reveals further corrections of 20-24 cm -1 .3. Replacing the DFT method with a CCSD(T)-level treatment of the dynamic correlation gives corrections of 34 and 59 cm -1 respectively for ester and ketone.Assuming the corrections can be treated additively, one can apply the first two to the third, producing \"corrected\" CCSD(T)/6-311G(d,p) values which are only about 12-13 cm -1 higher than the observed value.This remaining discrepancy is probably due to the difference between aug-cc-pvQZ and a complete basis set (CBS) and any remaining errors in the correlation modelled by CCSD(T).We can be assured now that our theory is reproducing experiment very well.Now that we can assess the accuracy of our computational methods, we need to try to relate the results to the C=O bond itself.Does turning a ketone into an ester really make it stronger?To directly compare the C=O bond of two different molecules, we need to eliminate the effects of mixing the C=O normal stretching mode with similar energy modes arising from other parts of the molecule.A simple way of estimating this is to set the mass of all but two of the atoms to a very small value (0.00001), leaving only the masses of the C and O as normal; this is shown as a reduced frequency in the table above.The harmonic CCSD(T)/6-311G(d,p) C=O \"pure\" mode reduces to 1764 for methyl ethanoate and 1743 cm -1 for propanone.So after all of this, at least we now know that the force constant for the C=O stretch really is stronger for an ester.The green arrows seem to win out over the blue/red ones.",

We employ the hybrid density functional theoretical method (B3LYP) at the 6-311+G * * level. The standard scaling is applied to the frequencies by employing a scale factor of ∼ 0.9688 (Borowski 2012). Yang et al. (2013) have carried out computations for seven methylated PAH molecules with the B3LYP method in conjunction with a variety of basis sets. These basis sets, in order of increasing computational demand and accuracy, are 6-31G * , 6-31+G * , 6-311+G * , 6-311G * * , 6-31+G * * , 6-31++G * * , 6-311+G * * , 6-311++G * * , 6-311+G(3df,3pd), and 6-311++G(3df,3pd). The second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is widely considered to be more accurate than B3LYP in computing band intensities (see Cramer et al. 2004). To examine the accuracy of the B3LYP method, Yang et al. (2013) have performed calculations with B3LYP and MP2, using the most extensive basis set 6-311++G(3df,3pd) for both methods. It is found that the results computed from B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) closely agree with that from MP2/6-311++G(3df,3pd). On the other hand, Yang et al. (2013) have also found that the results computed with the B3LYP method combined with the four most sophisticated basis sets 6-311+G * * , 6-311++G * * , 6-311+G(3df,3pd), and 6-311++G(3df,3pd) essentially reach the convergence limit. The B3LYP/6-311+G * * method therefore presents an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational demand. Therefore, in",

The vibron number associated with the stretching vibrations is determined from the spectroscopic constants ω e and x e ω e for the CH molecule to be N s = 43 [23]. The vibron number for the bending vibrations, which are far more harmonic than the stretching vibrations, is taken to be N b = 150. We have carried out a least-square fit to the vibrational spectrum of methane including 44 experimental energies from [28]. The values of the fitted parameters are presented in the second column of Table III (Fit 1). In Table IV we compare the results of our calculation with the experimentally observed energies. All predicted levels up to V = 3 quanta are included. We find an overall fit to the observed levels with a r.m.s. deviation which is an order of magnitude better than in previous studies. Whereas the r.m.s. deviations of standard vibron model studies in [14] and [29] are 12.16 and 11.61 cm −1 for 19 energies, we find a value of 1.16 cm −1 for 44 energies.\n\nIn order to address the importance of the α 3 term, which is completely anharmonic in origin and vanishes in the harmonic limit (see Eq. (37)), we have carried out a calculation without this term (Fit 2 of Table III). With one less interaction term the r.m.s. deviation increases from 1.16 to 4.49 cm −1 . This shows the importance of the α 3 term to obtain an accurate description of the anharmonicities that are present in the data. Similarly, the third calculation (Fit 3) shows that, in a fit without the t ij terms, the r.m.s. deviation increases from 1.16 to 7.81 cm −1 .",

The shrinkage of polyenes C-C and lengthening of C = C bonds is also demonstrated by comparison of the estimated values with \"isolated\" bonds in reference moleculesethane, ethylene, and the so-called \"naked\" C-C sp 2 -sp 2 bond [13]. It is apparent from Table 1 that the relative changes in bond lengths predicted with BLYP and B3LYP density functionals are similar. Besides, more significant changes upon increasing the length of the polyene chain are observed for C = C and C-C bonds in the middle of the structure than at the end of the studied molecules. For example, the B3LYP/6-311++G** calculated lengthening of the C = C bond at the end (terminal unit) and in the middle of the molecule in very long all-trans polyenes are about 0.014 and 0.037 Å, respectively. However, the corresponding changes in terminal C-H bond, and the CCH angle at the chain end are almost negligible (not shown). Thus, the two terminal C-H bonds in ethylene In our recent studies on ethylene [39] and its fluorinated derivatives [38], we observed significantly more accurate prediction of experimental frequencies using BLYP rather than B3LYP density functional for calculations of harmonic vibrations. Obviously, the anharmonic B3LYP frequencies of ethylene better reproduce experimental data but are too expensive computationally for longer polyenes. Thus, as a practical compromise between accuracy and calculation expense, in the current study we will only discuss the BLYP/6-311++G**calculated frequencies using a harmonic model. At this point, we would like to mention shortening of cpu timing as another positive aspect of calculating Raman frequencies in the current study using pure BLYP density functional instead of hybrid B3LYP functional. Thus, following the suggestion of a reviewer, the Raman frequencies were calculated on 24 processors and 59 GB memory for a previously optimized alltrans C10 molecule (or C 20 H 22 molecule with 594 basis set functions) with both density functionals and the",

Irder to see what theoretical level would be needed in order to estimate their BDE's, we have calculated D298 for formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde.In one set of calculations, geometry optimizations were carried out at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ level and the energies were calculated at the CCSD(T,full)/aug-cc-pVTZ level.The vibrational frequencies needed for the zero-point energy corrections and correction to 298K were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G* level.In other calculations, the CBS-QB3 and CBS-APNO model procedures were used and include the zeropoint and thermal corrections.9 The D298 values were obtained from the equations\nH2C=O → 3 H2C + 3 O H2C=S → 3 H2C + 3 S\nThe CBS-APNO calculations reproduced the observed dissociation energies very well.CBS-QB3 uses somewhat smaller basis sets for the individual step and as expected gives slightly less satisfactory results.The CCSD calculations also are fairly satisfactory.\n\nThe energies of acetone, thioacetone and triplet dimethylcarbene were calculated in the corresponding fashion and this allowed the calculation of the D298 values.The dissociation energies are about 5 kcal/mol greater than for formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde.\n\n\nForce constants\n\nVibrational force constants are usually obtained via a normal coordinate analysis or a calculation of the vibrational frequencies.This presents problems because there is always coupling between the C=O (or C=S) vibration with other vibrational modes.In order to obtain force constants for local mode stretching of the C=O or C=S bonds, a series of B3LYP/6-311+G* calculations were carried out in which the energies were obtained for structures where the equilibrium double bond lengths were increased and decreased by 0.01 and 0.02 A, without altering the remaining structure.Fitting the data to a third order polynominal gave the force constant and also the cubic term.The harmonic terms along with the corresponding bond lengths are given Table 2.",

Therefore, we need only sum (9) \nto k = k * = min{int [(L − N a)/w] , N }.\nExpanding all terms and explicitly evaluating the residues at s = 0, −ε 0 , we obtain the exact expression,\nZ(N ≥ 1, L) = (−1) N N N !ε 2N −1 0 k * ,N −1 k,p=0 a k b p (L − N a − kw) p ×ε p 0 e −ε0(L−N a) − (−1) p e −kε0w ,(10)where b p ≡ (2(N − 1) − p)!/(p!(N − 1 − p)!).\nNumerically, the asymptotic approximation (6) is accurate to within ∼3% of the exact result (4) provided N 10. Fig. 2a plots the saddle solution s * found from (5). In the fixed N ensemble, the probability distribution for particle i + 1 to be at position x i+1 given that particle i is at position x i is readily computed in the asymptotic limit (L ≫ Λ ≫ a), g (2) \n(x i+1 − x i |N ) ∼ Z(N, L−x)/ Λ a Z(N, L−x)dx = s * e −s * (x−a)",

In order to relate it to γ ( * ) γ ( * ) interactions we have to introduce the photon wave function. In [26] it was shown by model considerations that the lowest-order perturbative expression for the quark-antiquark content of the photon, with chiral symmetry breaking and confinement being simulated by a Q 2 -dependent quark mass, works remarkably well. The quark mass can be determined by comparing the result for the vector-current correlator with the analytically continued phenomenological expression in the Euclidean region. The resulting masses are:\nm u,d = m 0 (1 − Q 2 /1.05) : Q 2 ≤ 1.05 0 : Q 2 ≥ 1.05 (1) m s = 0.15 + 0.16 (1 − Q 2 /1.6) : Q 2 ≤ 1.6 0.15 : Q 2 ≥ 1.6 m c = 1.3\nThe parameter m 0 for the u, d quarks was found to be m 0 = 0.21 ± 0.015 GeV.\n\n\nThe Box Diagram",

The algorithm is based on the following steps: a cubic lattice with a constant l is superimposed on the z-expanded surface. Initially l is set at X/2 (where X is the length of the edge of the surface), resulting in a lattice of 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 cubes. Then N(l) is the number of all cubes that contain at least one pixel of the image. The lattice constant l is thus reduced stepwise by a factor of two and the process repeated until l equals to the distance between two adjacent pixels. The slope of a plot of log(N(l)) versus log(1/l) gives directly the fractal dimension D f .\n\n\nTriangulation\n\nThe triangulation method is similar to the cube counting method and is also based directly on the box-counting fractal dimension definition [54]. The method works as follows: a grid of unit dimension l is placed on the surface. This defines the location of the vertices of a number of triangles. When, for example, l = X/4, the surface is covered by 32 triangles of different areas inclined at various angles with respect to the xy plane. The areas of all triangles are then calculated and summed to obtain an approximation of the surface area S(l) corresponding to l. Next, the grid size is decreased by a successive factor of 2, as before, and the process continues until l corresponds to the distance between two adjacent pixel points. The slope of a plot of log(S(l)) versus log(1/l) gives the number D f − 2.\n\n\nVariance Method\n\nThe variance method (partitioning) is based on the scale dependence of the variance of fractional Brownian motion [56,57]. In practice, one divides the full surface into equal-sized squared boxes, and the variance (power of Root Mean Square (RMS) value of heights), is calculated for particular box size. The fractal dimension D f is evaluated from the slope β of a least-square regression line fit to the data points in the log-log plot of variance as D f = 3 − β/2.\n\n\nPower Spectrum",

In order to determine the charging energy, we applied microwave frequencies of f µ =10-11 GHz to the mw gate while slowly sweeping the dc-gate. Multiphoton resonances occur when mhf µ ≈ 4E C (1 − n g ). From the positions of the multiphoton resonances, we can determine the charging energy [6]. For this device, E C /h = 15.0 ± 0.1 GHz which corresponds to a total capacitance of C Σ = 1.29 fF for the SEB.

We have modified the standard Gouy-Chapman formula, taking into account the finite radius of the Z-ions, which can not approach the surface closer than x = a. It was shown [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] that the Gouy-Chapman solution fails when both σ and Z are large enough. The reason it fails is that, in addition to λ, there is a second length scale in the problem due to the discreteness of charge. When the condensed Z-ions neutralize the charge of the plane, the two-dimensional concentration of Z-ions is n = σ/Ze, and the surface area per ion, the Wigner-Seitz cell, can be approximated as a disc of radius b such that πb 2 = 1/n. Thus, b = (πn) −1/2 = (Ze/πσ) 1/2 and 2b is approximately the distance between Z-ions. We can construct the dimensionless ratio\nb λ = 2Γ , Γ = Z 2 e 2 /ǫb k B T .(2)",

Figure 13a) and accuracy (cf. Figure 13b).Though this is more of a tendency (cf.r 2 values of the linear regression).Hence, the idea is to refine the box dimension to the smallest possible value while keeping the number of levels fixed (cf.Section 3).In that way, by starting from a = 9 a.u.for both test cases, it will end up setting the box dimension to a = 5.38 and a = 6.46 respectively for sodalite and PSII.This value of a = 9 a.u.should also cover similar systems with twice the number of particles since the value of a would then be ≈ 6.5 × 2 1∕3 = 8.1, without incrementing the number of levels.",

This approximation is correct at times t < τ m ≪ τ e because exchange of matter between adjacent boxes is negligible. This box is observed with a uniform observation profile of intensity 1/L and length η, one extremity of which coincides with a box boundary, situated without loss of generality at x = 0. This case includes both the two end-boxes (with η = β or η = γ) and internal boxes that are entirely covered by the observation profile (with η = a). This observation profile is written ι(x) = 1 [0,η] (x)/L. The total box filling, W i , is constant, but can be different from 1 here since it fluctuates slowly at large times. The particle density at the position x in the box, ρ(x, t), is written Wi a ψ i (x, t), this last function ψ i taking into account short-time local fluctuations in the box. It is a Poisson random variable of mean ψ i st = 1 and mean square ψ i (x, t)ψ i (y, t) st = 1 + a Wi δ(x − y). Like free diffusion (Section II D), this case is tackled by Fourier analysis, which requires the calculation of the Fourier modes of the diffusion equation in this special geometry. We shall not detail these calculations here, which can be found in text-books [20], but simply give the final result.

Ahead of the ionization front, the electron density in air is two to three orders of magnitude larger than in N 2 . The long absorption length of the ionizing photons in N 2 with 1 ppm O 2 (260 m) means that most of the photons do not ionize an O 2 molecule before leaving the computational domain, while in air (1.3 mm absorption length), the opposite is true.\n\nIn general, the number of photons that reach a point at a distance r from the streamer head is proportional to S ph × e −r/ l a × r −n where l a is the absorption length and n 0 describes the algebraic falloff of the photon intensity. n depends on the shape of the photon source. For a point-source n = 2, for a planar front n = 0. When the distance r is large, the source of the photons can be approximated by a point source and we get n = 2. For small r, the complex structure of the streamer head will give rise to a smaller value of n. In nitrogen with a 1 ppm admixture of oxygen, the absorption length is so large compared with the size of the domain that the exponential falloff can be neglected. In air, the absorption length is still fairly large compared with the size of the domain, but its contribution can no longer be neglected. This can be seen in figure 9, where the slope of the electron density curve in air is steeper than in nitrogen in the area in front of the streamer head.\n\nWith a naive comparison of the absorption lengths, one expects to see a 2×10 5 times lower electron density in nitrogen with 1 ppm oxygen than in air due to the difference in photoionization intensity: The number of photo-ionization events in a small test volume is proportional to the number of photons entering this test volume multiplied by the number of oxygen molecules in the test volume. Assuming identical photonsources and no loss of photons between the source and the test volume, the number of photons entering the test volume is independent of gas composition and the number of photoionization events is proportional to the oxygen density.",

Similar numerical approaches have been used to energy eigenvalues associated with the oscillating Yukawa potential [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. However, these numerical approaches gave acceptable results for small screening parameters while the numerical accuracy becomes poor close the critical screening parameter, c µ , associated with bound-unbound transition [18]. Despite the short-range behavior of the potential due to the decaying exponential factor r e µ − , the 1 r − singularity at the origin and the 2 r − behavior due to the centrifugal term makes the task of obtaining accurate numerical solutions a non-trivial task.

[39] The latter are constructed employing only the structural information of the OH bond at the respective minimum geometry. In this work the approach was extended to higher dimensions as discussed in \"Numerov's approach to solve Schrödingers equation\" Section and tested with chemical systems containing two XH bonds (X = O,N). The vibrational frequencies are evaluated using the Numerov method, a grid-based approach to numerically solve the Schrödinger equation of the vibrational quantum system. The employed Numerov approach has been derived earlier [36] and is summarized in \"Constructed normal modes\" Section. It has been shown that the respective accuracy mainly depends on the spacing h of the potential energy grid. [36] To guarantee an accurate prediction the individual grid points have to be computed using at least DFT on generalized gradient approximation level [37,38] with suitable basis sets.

The Wigner distribution is often referred to as a quasi probability distribution and can be interpreted as the quantum mechanical probability of finding a particle in the small phase space area dxdp. [31] This means that the expression (6) can be thought of as a sum over all initial phase space configurations weighted by their probabilities and subject to the constraint dictated by the delta function. However, the constraint is equivalent to the Newtonian equations of motion and we can thus regard the time evolution as purely classical. In particular, given an initial state we could calculate ρ(u; t) by sampling all phase space and adding P(u 0 , p 0 ) if u 0 and p 0 is classically connected to u(t). Furthermore, since each such classical trajectory will result in a well defined momentum at time t we interpret the probability of being at a given phase space point u(t), p(t) as being equal to P(u 0 , p 0 ) where (u 0 , p 0 ) is the unique point which is classically connected to (u(t), p(t)).",

By averaging over different binning choices we obtain the data reported in Table. 1 where for y ≥ 5 the fraction α y is smaller than 0.1.  I: αy is the fraction of sampled Λ(y) whose probability is less than the valuef introduced in the text.\n\nComputing the analogous quantity for the data sets E and E we get values larger than 0.4 for y ≥ 5. It is then reasonable to reject the hypothesis that S levels are extracted from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. Note that, because of the large variance of the Poisson samples, it is practically impossible to reject the hypothesis that a series of few levels ( 20) belongs to the Poisson Ensemble, but, as observed above, it is easier to state that they are not of the GOE type.\n\nAs an example in Fig. 3 the sampled distributions for Λ(7) are shown and the experimental values of the S and E sequences. The bin width is equal 0.008.\n\n\nConclusions.\n\nComparing the spectral rigidity of standard S-wave charmonia with that of the unconventional vector resonances recently discovered, we observe that the latter states are more significantly compatible with the hypothesis of being the levels of some multiquark Hamiltonian (whose classical analog exhibits chaotic dynamics and therefore having quantum levels distributed with the Wigner law) than the former, which, on the other hand, could be thought as the levels of some classically integrable one -as the simplest version of the Cornell potential Hamiltonian is. The limit of this analysis is in the small amount of experimental data available both in the standard and unconventional sectors. We have introduced a slight modification of the spectral rigidity estimators used in the literature to improve as much as possible the quality of our analysis with a small number of levels.",

Our procedure is self-contained and implicitly includes detailed explanations to questions that recurrently appear during our courses. We only use standard mathematical tools available in natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines generally from the second college year.

By studying the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO), we will take a step towards to a more realistic scenario. For this case, V( ) will be a continuous position function of the type V( ) = . The QHO can be used to describe almost any system in which a certain entity makes small vibrations with respect to an equilibrium point.\n\nIn Figure 1a, we show a one-dimensional potential that is described with a solid line. This potential has a minimum point, for which it is possible to approximate a parabolic function V( ) represented by the dashed line. (a) A \"realistic\" continuous potential is described by the solid gray line. At the minimum, the \"realistic\" potential can be very well approximated by a quadratic potential (dashed black line).

Quantum mechanically, of course, this system has no bound states, only metastable states, which decay unimolecularly by tunneling through the barriers. Waite and Miller 5 have calculated the energies and lifetimes (the inverse of the unimolecular decay rate) of the individual metastable quantum states of the system, and Figure 1 shows a sample of their results. Because of the C3 symmetry of the system, the calculation is carried out separately for states of A symmetry (solid circles in Figure 1), A2 symmetry (open squares), and E symmetry (open circles). The solid line in Figure 1 is the result given by standard statistical theory, i.e., microcanonical transition state theory, 6\nk(E)= 3 P[E-Vo-(n +1/2)hto*]/[2,rrhp(E)] (2.2)\nHere P is the one-dimensional tunneling probability as a function of the energy along the reaction coordinate, to*= x/g is the frequency of the \"activated complex\", p(E) the density of reactant states, and the factor of 3 is due to the three equivalent transition states. The first thing that one observes in Figure 1 is that the statistical approximation to the rate constants (i.e., Eq. 2.2) is quite good for the A1 and E states, even in the low energy region below --0.11\n\nwhere the classical mechanics is essentially completely quasi-periodic.\n\nOn closer inspection one does see some mode-specificity in the A and E states, i.e., some dispersion about the average curve, but this is more pronounced at higher rather than lower energies. To the extent that there is any trend at all, therefore, it is opposite to what one would predict on the basis of the quasi-periodic/chaotic character of the classical mechanics. The appearance of some degree of modespecificity at high energies is perhaps understandable in that even if the various degrees of freedom are strongly coupled, states with most of the energy in the reaction coordinate will decay essentially instantaneously (i.e., within one vibrational period) while those with most of the energy in inactive modes will require at least a few vibrations for the energy to flow into the reaction coordinate.",

For example, for DBT (dibenzoterrylene) molecules measured values around QE = 30% at room temperature have been observed and the dephasing rate is estimated around γ d /2π = 1.43 THz.Using values for ν p , Γ p , s p derived from ab-initio calculations in the displaced oscillator model [13], we make a gross estimate for C/2π = 1.2 THz and predict an expected QE around 97% at cryogenic temperatures around 4 K or less.\n\nQuantum Langevin equations.-The starting point of our approach is a molecular Hamiltonian H = H 0 + H non where H 0 = T N + V 0 is the Hamiltonian under the Born-Oppenheimer separation, with T N the nuclear kinetic energy operator, V 0 the potential energy, and a nonadiabatic part H non (allowing different electronic states to be coupled through nuclear motion [3,5,14,15]).Considering two PESs, corresponding, e.g., to a ground |g⟩ and excited state |e⟩, this is expressed in matrix form as\nH = T N + V e (R) 0 0 V g (R) + 0 f (R) f (R) 0 ,(2)\nwhere R is the vector containing all nuclear coordinates R p with p = 1, . . ., N , and f (R) describes the nonadiabatic coupling.",

The real part of the nucleon self-energy or optical-model potential can be decomposed into an energy-independent non-local part and a dynamic contribution (energy-dependent), that can also be non-local, i.e.,\nRe Σ (r, r ′ ; E) = Re Σ (r, r ′ ; ε F ) + ∆V(r, r ′ ; E), (8)\nwhere ε F is the Fermi energy. The second term, referred to as the dispersive correction, can be obtained from the imaginary part through the subtracted dispersion relation ∆V(r, r ′ ; E) = (9)\n+ 1 π P Im Σ (r, r ′ ; E ′ ) 1 E ′ − E − 1 E ′ − ε F dE ′ ,\nwhere P stands for the principal value and we note the convention to employ the same sign for the imaginary part of the self-energy above and below the Fermi energy [17]. By definition in Eq. (8), the dispersive correction is zero at the Fermi energy. The dispersive correction varies rapidly around E F and causes the valence singleparticle levels to be focused towards the Fermi energy. Following a long tradition [23], the non-local energyindependent term ReΣ(r, r ′ ; ε F ) is approximated by a local energy-dependent form, generally designated as the Hartree-Fock (HF) potential V HF (r, E). While it does describe mean-field properties, it is not strictly a HF contribution, since it involves the complete self-energy at one particular energy. The energy derivative of V HF encodes a measure of the non-locality, which is related to the momentum-dependent effective mass\nm (r, E) m = 1 − dV HF (r, E) dE ,(10)\nwhere m is the nucleon mass. The local approximation of the HF potential necessitates a scaled imaginary potential given by\nW = m (r, E) m Im Σ(11)",

Firstly, if we have a (discretized) continuum of modes we will have to work with bare masses as already discussed in Sec. 3.2. In dipole approximation the connection between the (single-particle) bare mass m and physical mass m e is known nonperturbatively as 95,137 \nm e = m + 4 3π e 2 4π 0 c c Λ,(50)\nwhere the term in the parenthesis is the fine structure constant and Λ is the ultra-violet cutoff wave number. This already implies that the cutoff should not be chosen too large since else we would need an unphysical negative bare mass, i.e., in dipole approximation nonrelativistic QED is not fully renormalizable (for a single electron the energy where this happens is, however, gigantic 137 ). 22 If we change the mode structure, the connection between bare and physical mass will change in general. In most cases of polaritonic chemistry it is, however, tacitly assumed that the changes in the mode structures are not so severe as to modify this completely. Hence one usually subsumes the continuum of modes in the physical mass and only keeps a few \"enhanced\" modes explicitly in the calculations. Indeed, usually just one mode is kept. 31,32,43 On the other hand, if we use a discretized continuum we have included radiative dissipation and decoherence.\n\nIn other words, since we have very many photonic degrees of freedom, the quantum revival time tends to infinity 117,138,139 and hence we have effectively irreversible processes. This is broken once we use the physical mass of the particles and merely keep a few effective modes.\n\nTo re-introduce the irreversiblity often artificial baths are included in a few mode calculation. But in principle such open-system approaches are not needed in non-relativistic QED as it would contain all dissipation channels explicitly.",

We assume (without theoretical justification) that the Lamb shift is a relativistic charge, mass, and size ratio effect. The reduced mass calculation [18] implicitly assumes that the electron and nucleus are point charges. But they have a finite size hence there needs to be an extra component in the reduced mass calculation. The energy reduction to take account of reduced mass is not simply /( + )((1/2) V 2 ) but should include a function of the charge and the ratio of nuclear to atomic size, and this component is calculated by the following expression:\n= ( + ) ( 2 .67 ) ( 1 2 V 2 ) ( − ) 3.2 1/3 ,(6)",

What the latter does offer is a semiquantitative a priori estimate of the importance of scalar relativistic corrections.\n\nThere is, alas, one notable, clear-cut relativistic effect that a model based on only q s (Z) is intrinsically unable to capture: the scalar relativistic correction to atomic electron affinities [10][11][12] (which for B-F and Al-Cl basically corresponds to the effect of an extra p electron). Since the p parameters for the first row are ill-determined statistically, one could instead assign fixed values from the calculated contributions to electron affinities, ionisation potentials or their average -the latter corresponds [65] to the Mulliken electronegativity except for a constant.\n\nWe As can be seen in Table 2, this model captures 99.3% of variance for the first row and 99.0% for both rows (with SF 6 omitted). It should be noted that the ratio between s and p coefficients for a given element grows with Z from about a factor of 2-15: hence, clamping the p coefficients rather than fitting them does not greatly impact accuracy. As also shown in Table 2, the SSQ recovery for both rows can be increased to 99.2% by adding d parameters; if the outlier point SF 6 is brought back in, we are back at 98.7%. These parameters are not statistically welldetermined, however, and we have chosen to omit them in deference to Occam's law of parsimony.\n\nWith NBO-based charges, things are not as simple. We can recover 99.5% for the first row, but for both rows together, this drops to just 92.2% -deleting HClO 4 and SF 6 as outliers brings us back to 95.2%, which can be lifted up to 98.0% even with HClO 4 included if a q d (Z) term is added.",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter. Y/n. This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

That is, the correction amounts to a −0.019 % change in the measured LS count rate. In order to appreciate the nature of this correction, it can be written in terms of the alpha inefficiency correction, , and the correction for the undesired EC contribution, EC . The log-scale spectra in Fig. A2 illustrate these spectral components, as well as events resulting from the 2.3 keV delayed state, which do not contribute to the correction since they fall below the 3 H threshold. The respective contributions to k are = 0.031 % and EC = −0.050 %.\n\nThe uncertainty on k included 0.02 % from stochastic variability in the Monte Carlo simulation and 0.010 % from decay data. The standard uncertainty in matching the model to the data was judged by adjusting the threshold by ± 10 channels (linear scale), which changed by 0.011 %.\n\nThe value and uncertainty for the spectral correction is therefore, = 0.99981 ± 0.00025. Probably the most challenging aspect of the model was the low-energy scattering of alphas, presumably due to m-scale boundary (wall) effects. To assess the veracity of the Monte Carlo model for this effect, the fraction of simulated alpha counts landing in limbo in the model (0.08 %) was compared to an experimental value of (0.11 ± 0.02) %, with values ranging from 0.05 % to 0.17 %. This result was obtained from 13 carefully examined spectra obtained with the Beckman counter. The uncertainty (0.02 %) is the standard deviation for the 13 evaluated sources. The reasonable agreement between the model and experiment for the fraction of counts in limbo imbues confidence in the model calculation of the smaller fraction of alpha counts below the 3 H threshold.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.6028/jres.120.011  Had the overall correction been more significant, then additional work on the model, and measurements using a pure alpha emitter, would have been warranted. Yet for the present experiment, which was designed to mitigate the effects of and EC , the current model is perfectly adequate.",

                    "contents": "Electron Spin Polarization as a Predictor of Chiroptical Activity in Helical MoleculesBloch sphere and Expectation Values\n\nIn general, the superposition of states can be represented as Bloch vectors residing on the Bloch sphere, where the state Ψ ζ n can be written as |Ψ⟩ = cos (θ ′ /2) |0⟩ + e iφ ′ sin (θ ′ /2) |1⟩. A similar representation can be made for the states ψ ν s , where, for simplicity, we omit the labelsñ and ζ. The influence of SOC and TRS on the states on the Bloch sphere forñ = 1 and ζ = +1 is illustrated in Figure 1c-f. In the simplest case, when SOC is zero and TRS is preserved (Fig. 1c), the angle of inclination θ of the spinors ψ ν s with respect to the vertical z-axis is equal to zero.\n\nEach of these states represents a pure state in the direction of |0⟩, resulting in Ψ being in the direction of (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/ √ 2. The degree of polarization can be defined as P = P 2\nx + P 2 y + P 2 z ,\nwhere P ı represent the expectation values of |Ψ⟩ [62]. Hence, in this case, P = 1, since P x = 1, and P y = P z = 0. The effect of SOC is depicted in Figure 1d. The SO-induced magnetic field B SO causes all the states ψ ν,ζ n,s to rotate by an angle θ, and the spinor Ψ ζ n to tilt by an angle θ ′ with respect to the molecular axis, allowing us to interpret the impact of SOC as a relaxation of the state vector along the direction of the SO field. This rotation results in a decrease in P x and an increase in P z , causing P to be less than 1. and therefore is also reflected in θ ′ . In other words, breaking TRS by a change of the amplitudes in the wavefunction acts as an additional contribution to the magnitude of the SO interaction, causing the angle θ of certain states to increase (or decrease) due to this effect.\n\n\nTime Reversal Symmetry, Voltage Probes and Decoherence Effects",

The letters A, B, C denote different radial dependence, and for each radial dependence and total orbital angular momentum there is one function for each possible combination of the eigenvalues of L z and S z . Because these are atomic orbitals (single electron eigenfunctions) the total spin eigenvalue is 1/2. Writing out the elements of each set we obtain: sA = {sA(0, −1/2), sA(0, 1/2)} sB = {sB(0, −1/2), sB(0, 1/2)} sC = {sC(0, −1/2), sC(0, 1/2)} pA = {pA(−1, −1/2), pA(−1, 1/2), pA(0, −1/2), pA(0, 1/2), pA(1, −1/2), pA(1, 1/2)} (42) Hence there are 12 atomic orbitals here.

First, let us recall the basics of spin eigenfunctions.\n\nWe label spin eigenfunctions for N electrons, total spin S and total spin projection on z axis M S as Θ[S, M S ]. Since it is a spin eigenfunction it must satisfŷ\nS 2 Θ[S, M S ] =S(S + 1)Θ[S, M S ] S z Θ[S, M S ] =M S Θ[S, M S ], −S ≤ M S ≤ S(20)\nThe single-electron spin operators (lowercase) and the total spin operators are related bŷ \nS z = N iŝ z (i) andŜ 2 = S. S = N i,j s(i) · s(j).\nhere i refers to the ith electronic spin coordinate s i ∈ {↑, ↓}.\n\nThe total number linearly independent spin eigenfunctions which gives same eigenvalue forŜ 2 for a given configuration of N is known as the degeneracy of spin eigenfunction denoted by \nf (N, S) = N N 2 − S − N N 2 − S − 1(22)\nIf there are p orbitals with α spin and q orbitals with β spin in θ k , thenŜ z θ = 1 2 (p − q)θ.",

The single-ion term can be written as ∆ i (n i ·d) 2 , whered denotes the easy axis direction. We assume thatd is along lattice c-axis (see Fig. 1). Using GGA+U +SOC with U eff = 5, we calculated the total energy for the FM spin configuration as the angle θ (the angle between the magnetic moment direction and z-axis) varies from 0 to π. Fig. 4 shows the variation of ∆E versus θ. This figure represent that the minimum energy is achieved at θ = 0. The value of ∆ from this calculation is ≈ −0.05 meV, whose sign indicates that z-axis is indeed an easy axis. We also checked that the total energy is independent of the azimuthal angle φ. It should be noted that the two-spin Ising anisotropy (J z S i,z S j,z ) may have contribution to the energy difference curve in Fig. 4. Nevertheless, it is hard to separate its contribution since both single-ion and Ising anisotropy terms have the same angular dependence for uniform rotation of spin direction. Due to this limitation we assign it totally to the single-ion anisotropy.\n\n\nB. Monte Carlo Simulation",

Here comes the third assumption; if there is a spin-imbalance in the molecule (namely a difference in the density of spin-up and spin-down electrons, up and down referring to the directions parallel and anti-parallel to the molecular axis), then this generates an additional effective field (the spin-torque field) which is felt by the surface angular momentum. This assumption relies on the well-known consept of spin-transfer torque, namely the fact that as electrodes cross an interface the total angular momentum must be conserved. Therefore, an additional effective field of the form B st α 1 ∆n s is felt by the surface angular momentm.\n\nThe combined action of these two fields, ef f = B sol + B st works to stabilize the surface angular momentum at a finite tilt angle θ M . The solenoid field is very small, but breaks the symmetry and determines the direction (parallel or anti-parallel to the molecular axis), while the spin-torque field B st is much larger -but is spin-symmetric. Therefore, in the absence of a solenoid field (e.g. in a non-helical molecule) the average tilt angle will be θ M = π/2, meaning that on average the surface orbital magnetization vanishes, i.e. L = 0. Only due to the solenoid field a direction is fixed which allows for L = 0. This requires finite current, reflecting the non-equilibrium nature of te CISS effect.",

We define the anisotropy of the SHE for spin polarization in the yz-plane as ∆ zy = σ z xy − σ y zx . Physically, if σ z xy and σ x yz have the same sign, parameter ∆ zy quantifies the difference in the magnitude of the spin current measured along y and along z axes, when the electric field points along x. For a general angle θ the components of the spin current with spin polarization parallel ton (Q ) and spin polarization perpendicular ton (Q ⊥ ) are given by\nQ =n · Q ·n = − 1 2 ∆ zy sin(2θ)E x , Q ⊥ = (σ y zx + ∆ zy cos 2 θ)E x .(23)\nIf ∆ zy = 0, the spin polarization is perpendicular ton only ifn is along the y or z-direction, otherwise spin polarization and direction of spin current enclose the angle α = arctan(Q ⊥ /Q ) = 90 • , as shown in Fig. 6(b). It follows from Eq. (23) that Q ⊥ is zero at the angle\nθ 0 = arccos −σ y zx /∆ zy(24)\nif σ z xy and σ y zx differ in sign. At this angle θ 0 the spin polarization and the spin current are collinear. This is an interesting constellation, which cannot occur in cubic systems. An analogous situation can also occur for the anomalous Hall effect, i.e. different sign of the AHC for two different high-symmetry directions of the magnetization in the crystal, as we show in section 5.1. In the latter case, there exists a direction of the magnetization in the crystal for which the Hall current (spin current in SHE) and the magnetization (spin-polarization in SHE) are collinear. Motivated by the rotational sense of the Hall current as the magnetization direction is rotated, we call this effect the anti-ordinary Hall effect, see section 5.1.",

In the present case, the z axis of di-Co is perpendicular to the molecular plane, while the spin axis appears to be along x (Figure 3a) such that θ = π/2 and ϕ = 0. Under these conditions, SOC mixes orbitals whose l z differ by one (Δl z = 1). For example, SOC hybridizes the d yz and d z 2 orbitals leading to an orbital moment along x. The degree of hybridization and hence the magnitude of the moment scales with ζ and inversely with the energy splitting between the d yz and d z 2 orbitals. In the following, we consider the impact of H SO on di-Co. DFT calculations (gas-phase molecule, U eff = 0, and without SOC) find each Co atom in a 4s 2 3d 7 configuration with a projected density of states PDOS shown in Figure 3c. We then construct a Hamiltonian H Hyb in a |l, m, s z ⟩ base, which hybridizes and shifts |l, m, s z ⟩ states with parameters adjusted to approximately reproduce the PDOS (left diagram in Figure  3d). The eigenstates of H Hyb + H SO are shown in the right part of Figure 3d. SOC induces small energy shifts and hybridization (indicated with dotted colored lines) of the states. For example, the d yz ↑ orbital, upon SOC becomes approximately | d yz ↑ ⟩ SOC = 0.94|d yz ↑ ⟩ + 0.28i|d z 2 ↑ ⟩ − 0.16i|d xz ↓ ⟩ + 0.11i|d x 2 −y 2 ↑ ⟩ with a substantial orbital moment μ x = 1.1 μ B (collinear with the spin).

Effect of the Weighting Coefficients. The present calculations were carried out while varying the weighting coefficients, and Figure 1 shows the primary configurations of  the electronic states obtained for the H 2 O molecule. The calculated electronic state energies, eigenvalues, and imposed penalties are provided in Table 3. Table 4 summarizes the calculated energies and the assignments of the first, second, and third electronic states: |ψ(θ 0 )⟩, |ψ(θ 1 )⟩, and |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ The costs of these states are summarized in Table 5. Below, we review the results with respect to each coefficient. With regard to condition (i), the core-ionized state represented by |122̅ ⟩ was obtained as the ansatz state |ψ(θ 1 )⟩ with β ≥ 21.0. In contrast, the state was |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ and the ground state |11̅ 2⟩ was obtained as both |ψ(θ 0 )⟩ and |ψ(θ 1 )⟩ with β < 21.0. In the case of β < 21.0, |ψ(θ 1 )⟩ was nonorthogonal to |ψ(θ 0 )⟩ and the penalty of β was imposed on its cost function. However, ⟨11̅ 2|Ĥ|11̅ 2⟩ + β was still less than the cost function for the core-ionized state |122̅ ⟩. Therefore, the ground state |11̅ 2⟩ was obtained again as |ψ(θ 1 )⟩. If |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ is also |11̅ 2⟩, its cost function will be ⟨11̅ 2| Ĥ|11̅ 2⟩ + 2β because |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ is nonorthogonal to both |ψ(θ 0 )⟩ and |ψ(θ 1 )⟩, and so the cost function will be greater than that of the core-ionized state |122̅ ⟩. Thus, the core-ionized state | 122̅ ⟩ was obtained as |ψ(θ 2 )⟩. In the case with β ≥ 21.0, the",

The main reason for including a series of systems with different, and zero, charge is to extract general knowledge extending beyond the specifics of a single system.\n\nFigure 1\n1shows the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of three representative binuclear systems, including and excluding the direct electrostatic repulsion (the results from all five systems are shown inFigure S1). The electrostatic repulsion is modeled by simply subtracting the Coulombic energy for two point charges positioned at the interatomic distance.It is clear that all the heavy main-group atoms excerpt some sort of attraction underneath the direct electrostatic repulsion. The PES shapes are like typical two-atom interaction patterns, and they are characterized by a minimum distance of approximately 2.",

The results are reported in Table 3. Concerning the AuH 2 ground state, the geometry found here matches quite well the one previously calculated by Liu et al. 22 with a bond length of 1.605 Å and a bond angle of 129.2 degrees. Moreover, the ADE value is very close to the one that was determined experimentally also reported in Table 3. We mention that our theoretical estimate of ADE does not include the 0-0 vibrational correction (the difference in the ZPE of the anion AuH − 2 and of AuH 2 at the respective equilibrium geometries). This contribution is relatively small an estimate at DFT level gives about 0.03 eV (see Table S7 in ESI †). Concerning the excited states, even though we have no experimental reference to validate our results, we find that ADEs have only a slightly smaller values compared to the VDEs values. This is consistent with the small geometrical rearrangements of AuH 2 in these electronic states with respect to the anion. The difference between VDE and ADE (∆ V DE−ADE ), can be considered as a stringent test for the ability of our calculations to describe the potential energy surface in a well-balanced and consistent manner. We find that the calculated ∆ V DE−ADE (0.687 eV) agrees extremely well with the experimental one (0.637 eV). The difference is 0.05 eV, which further demonstrates the consistency of the calculated APESs. All the results reported above witness the accuracy of the X2C-EOM-CCSD computational protocol in describing the features of gold dihydride's electronic states, in close agreement with the experiment. The only discrepancy that still remains concerns the first excited state, which was expected to be characterized by a slightly bent equilibrium geometry. Returning to the experimental work of Liu et al. 22 , we have to observe that the bent structure for the first excited state was drawn on the basis",

This method has been successfully applied to collision systems involving lighter ions such as Be 4+ [4]. These small systems require ≈ 200 basis states for the expansion of the electron wavefunction to describe the system convergently. The number of additional states rises significantly for heavier ions, e.g. for Be 4+ n max = 8 was sufficient, for neon at least n max = 14 is require and for argon n max = 18. This leads to roughly 600-700 states in a convergent description of the Ne centre involving all necessary n-shells and to more than 1100 states to reasonably describe the Ar centre.\n\nWe will show data for both Ne q+ + H(1s) and Ar q+ +H(1s) for various charge states of the incident ions. These data not only include total CX cross section, but also nand n -resolved CX cross sections as well as effective emission coefficients. The latter are defined as the emission cross section for the emission line of interest averaged over a velocity distribution and are thus the suitable quantity for the analysis of spectroscopical data obtained from a fusion plasma.\n \n.

We look at the ground and excited state dipole moments in carbon monoxide. We then consider the dipole of NO, the quadrupole of N 2 and of BH. An octupole of methane is also calculated. We consider experimental geometries and also stretched bonds. We show that these nonvariational quantities may be found to relatively good accuracy when compared with full configuration interaction results, yet using only a small fraction of the full configuration interaction space. MCCI results in the aug-cc-pVDZ basis are seen to generally have reasonably good agreement with experiment. We also investigate the performance of MCCI when applied to ionisation energies and electron affinities of atoms in an aug-cc-pVQZ basis. We compare the MCCI results with full configuration interaction quantum ). We show that MCCI could be a useful alternative for the calculation of atomic ionisation energies however electron affinities appear much more challenging for MCCI. Due to the small magnitude of the electron affinities their percentage errors can be high, but with regards to absolute errors MCCI performs similarly for ionisation energies and electron affinities.\n\nIntroduction",

Taking the derivative of the expression (70) and putting it to zero predicts a position of minimum for the ground state potential curve E t = −2.348942 Ry at R = 1.4012 a.u. while the accurate result is E t = −2.3489518628 Ry (rounded) at R = 1.4011 a.u., see [21]. As for the excited state 3 Σ + u , the predicted minimum is E t = −2.0000409 Ry at R = 7.8237 a.u. while the accurate result is E t = −2.0000392 Ry (rounded) at R = 7.85 a.u. [22].

Finally, taking the analytic expression for potential curve for the excited state 3 Σ + u (73), we confirm the non-existence of any vibrational or rotational bound state associated with this state in agreement with [32]. All that indicates the high quality of approximation of the potential curves for 1 Σ + g and 3 Σ + u which do not lead to any extra rovibrational bound state and do not miss any known rovibrational bound state. This feature is definitely absent in all previous attempts (known to the present authors) to build approximations of potential curves.\n\n\nConclusions",

The method is expected to be accurate to describe the PJTE 38,69,70 . The CI-like form of the EOM excitation operator enables access to multi-configurational open-shell wave functions, including degenerate and nearly degenerate states, as well as interacting states of different character 38 . The notorius issue of coupledcluster theory to treat conical intersections [74][75][76] between states of the same symmetry is not expected to play a role here. The numerical examples by Kohn et al. 74 showed that this problem arises only very close to the intersection (within an energy range of ±0.02 eV). This is clearly not the case in point here, in that the involved electronic states have different symmetry for the high symmetry nuclear configuration and their energy gap is above 0.15 eV. For sake of completeness, we mention that the problem of EOM with treating conical intersections between states of the same symmetry has recently found a solution within the framework of similarity-constrained theory 76 . The selected cut of potential energy surface has been worked out by scanning several distances between the two terminal hydrogen atoms (R H−H ) and by varying the single Au-H bond lengths asymmetrically (the asymmetric displacement with respect to the centrosymmetric  Surprisingly, the results support our hypothesis: the ground state APES of gold dihydride is not centrosymmetric around its linear configuration (as demonstrated by the lower sheet in Figure 3, showing a double-well APES for the ground state), whereas the first excited state is linear and centrosymmetric. We find the minimum equilibrium structure to be at R H−H = 3.3 Å with the minimum energy asymmetric displacement being ∆R = 0.06 Å. For a more quantitative perspective on the energies, we also performed calculations with larger basis sets (i.e. vtz, vqz, with n=5 and 6s electrons correlated) and by correlating more electrons (i.e. cvtz, cvqz basis, with n=4, n=5 and 6s electrons correlated) by keeping fixed the overall R H−H distance at 3.3 Å. As shown in Table 4, a SB is always observed, with the minimum energy asymmetric displacement being",

The experimental trend is qualitatively reproduced for bands B-E, although the calculated VDE values are now shifted at lower energies; nevertheless the 4c-∆HF method still fails in providing the correct energy order of the two lowestenergy states (bands X-A). In general, the error in the higher energy states is increased dramatically, probably because the error compensation (between the orbital relaxation and electron correlation contributions), typically expected in the KT framework, is now missing. The 4c-∆KS calculations show how including both orbital relaxation and electron correlation significantly improves the agreement with the experimental values. Unfortunately, the energy swap of the lower-energy states still remains and the method fails to reproduce the correct symmetry of the AuH 2 ground state. This finding suggests that a more accurate treatment of electron correlation is needed for reproducing these quantities. The results reported in Figure 1 and Table 1 show that the X2C-EOM-CCSD method works exceptionally well. First of all, the order of the electronic states found here fully supports the assignment reported in Ref. 22, where, as mentioned in the introduction, a multi-step theoretical recipe was specifically applied to include scalar relativistic effects, electronic correlation and spinorbit coupling in a balanced way. Our results unambiguously confirm that the ground state of AuH 2 at the linear centrosymmetric configuration (i.e. at the minimum energy of the anion) is the electronic state 2 Σ + 1/2u (ungerade symmetry). The computed VDEs are in very good agreement with the experimental data; indeed, as it can be seen, the percent errors for calculated VDEs are in the range 2.9-0.3% (Table 1). In addition to this, it must be pointed out that the results displayed in Table 1 can be consistently improved. Indeed, as shown in Table 2, one can increase both the quality of the basis set and the number of active electrons. It is evident from the data how increasing simultaneously both of these factors can lead to an even more stringent agreement with the experimental results. For instance, when electrons of the shell with n=4 of gold are correlated and a core-valence quadruple-zeta (cvqz) quality basis set is used, the error can be further reduced (the",

For internuclear distances in the range 1.2 ≤ R ≤ 6, our results were compared with the high-precision variational data in [38]. Also, the results obtained by Colin-Rodriguez and Crus [18] are introduced. The results presented in Table 1 clearly indicate that when R increases the role of electrons' interaction becomes less and less, particularly around the nuclei. Each nucleus has an electron and the probability for both being around the same nucleus is small, as one would expect. When R increases, the H 2 molecule tends to separate into two hydrogen atoms in their ground states; therefore, the ground-state energy decreases. A good quantitative agreement is obtained compared to the corresponding accurate values of Ref. [38]. However, one can notice that our results are lower than those computed in [18]. This is due to the fact that in the work of Colin-Rodriguez and Crus, no electronic correlation is included in the wave function. These results validate a good accuracy for the wave function to calculate the ground-state energy of confined H 2 molecule inside a hard prolate spheroidal box.",

In this case, the C/D states (and the B/E states) become degenerate since they correspond to the doublet components of the 2 Π states (and 2 ∆ states). This clearly prevents the proper energy order and the correct assignment states. Although the 4c-KT method has only to be considered as a first approximation it is noteworthy that, the calculated energy splitting for the C/D and B/E states (numerical values are 1.05 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively) agrees surprisingly well with the experimental values (0.96 eV and 1.59 eV). The inclusion of SO coupling has a positive impact on the results for high energy states (i.e. bands from B to E), nevetheless, the situation is different at lower energies (X and A bands). The highest level calculations from Ref. 22 showed that the band X should be related to the electronic state of the ungerade symmetry, corresponding to the 2 Σ + 1/2u state. In our 4c-HF calculations, the AuH − 2 HOMO is an orbital of symmetry σ 1/2g , whereas the HOMO-1 has a σ 1/2u symmetry, thus the application of KT gives a ground state of the incorrect symmetry ( 2 Σ + 1/2g ). Indeed, there is a swap in energy between the HOMO and the HOMO-1 molecular orbitals of the anion. The 4c-KT method is clearly a too simple approach for an accurate estimation of DEs.",

The next excited state is 1 3 u at about 30 eV, which might contribute to the feature we see for S 2+ 2 in both Fig. 4e at 29 ± 3 eV and Fig. 3c at 30.0 ± 0.8 eV. This peak is also present in Fig. 3b, but less easily discernible. The 1 3 u dicationic state has an equilibrium bond length close to the equilibrium bond length of neutral S 2 , and could produce a narrow peak. According to the potential energy curves, this state does not correlate to ground state products, but the S 2+ 2 (1 3 u ) state can be predissociated by the (1 7 + u ) state involving spin-orbit interaction at their crossing (i.e. for energies of ∼ 4.5 eV above S 2+ 2 (X 1 + g )). The septet state correlates adiabatically to the lowest dissociation limit. We deduce from the calculations an appearance energy of ∼ 30.8 eV and a kinetic energy release of ∼ 4.8 eV. This could be the dissociation which we see in Fig. 3a around 31 eV.",

For this system b R = 1.10. The results for g ij and Dg = g + À À g À À are presented in Fig. 7, where they are compared to MC simulations results of Zwanikken and coworkers. 61 As seen in the figure, the MDE-DH approximation gives excellent results that nearly coincide with the MC ones. Note that the resolution of the ordinate scale in frame (d) of the figure is an order of magnitude larger than in frame (a). It is noteworthy that quite intricate details of the pair distribution functions are obtained in agreement with simulations. Our results are, in fact, slightly better than those of both the HNC approximation and Zwanikken's DHEMSA approximation, 61 which is quite remarkable considering the simplicity of the present Ansatz.\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of core-core correlations in this system, the pair distribution g hs (r) of the hard sphere fluid is plotted in Fig. 7a and it is seen that the main oscillation of g ij (r) with a wave length Ea is caused by these correlations. It is also seen in frames (a) and (b) of the figure that there is another oscillatory component with longer wave length superimposed on the main oscillation. This component is equal to the term 8bw el (r) in eqn (56), which is oscillatory here.*** It makes the g +À and g ÀÀ curves to repeatedly intersect with one another and has a wave length 2p/k I = 2.06a. In frames (c) and (d) this component gives the contribution Dg el (r) = 2bw el (r), which is the electrostatic part of Dg in the current approximation. For r \\ 1.3a it is seen that Dg el (r) gives nearly the entire Dg(r).",

In principle, the subspace P has an infinite number of dimensions as there are an infinite number of configurations into which the valence electrons can arrange themselves. Electrons are excited from an appropriate set of valence-electron leading configurations. In order to make the numerical CI treatment of P computationally possible, it is necessary to constrain the number of valence electron configurations and hence CSFs which are included in CI. In our calculations, we limit the configurations to those created by one and two-electron excitations from the leading valence configurations 5d 3 6s 2 , 5d 4 6s, 5d 5 , 5d 3 6s6p and 5d 2 6s 2 6p. We have omitted additional leading configurations such as 5d 3 6p 2 as they had little effect on the resulting energy levels but increased the time taken for the CI calculation significantly. Furthermore we truncate the single-particle basis set. In tantalum, the largest basis set we could use for a standard CI+MBPT calculation was 13spdf . That is, we allow a valence basis with orbitals 6 -13s, 6 -13p, 5 -13d, and 5 -13f (note that the higher energy waves are not spectroscopic since the B splines only extend spatially to 45 Bohr radii). The number of CSFs corresponding to these configurations for a J = 5/2, odd-parity calculation is N = 244752. The Hamiltonian is symmetric, so storing this matrix in memory at double precision requires 240 GB. We solve for the lowest eigenstates using the Davidson method [24] implemented by [25].",

For H2, where the only uncertainty is the validity of a summation over independent excitation contributions, we consider the accuracy satisfactory.\n\nCO Two basis sets for CO are considered: a double -zeta basis and a triple-zeta plus d orbital basis. Results are reported in Table 1. The CI calculation for the small basis accounts for only about 2/3 of the correlation energy compared to the value for the larger basis. The table shows that the present method over estimates the CI correlation energy for this small basis. For the larger basis, the new method gives 78% of the correlation energy compared to the multireference CI calculation using the same basis. A renormalization calculation is included in the table. In this calculation, the density matrix ij w is set zero if a d-type function is involved and the remaining ij w for the s, p basis are renomalized by a common factor to conserve the total charge. The correlation energy recovered increases slightly to 80%. The renormalization calculation reveals what turns out to be a general issue. If d-type functions are added to the basis or if the original basis is uncontracted, the correlation energy from the present method deteriorates. Renormalization helps, but, for an extensively uncontracted basis, the method must be applied to groups of basis functions that resemble physical atomic orbitals. This is handled in the present work by including intact Hartree-Fock atomic orbitals in the basis.",

Given the n 3 N 4 scaling (with n the number of electrons correlated and N the number of basis functions) of CPU time for a CCSD(T) calculation, the large number of valence electrons correlated (n=32) imposes certain restrictions on the size of the basis set for a complete quartic force field. We settled on the standard Dunning cc-pVTZ (correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta) basis set 60,61 (150 contracted Gaussian-type functions, CGTFs) for CF 4 , while for SiF 4 , we opted for the cc-pVTZ+1 basis set (159 CGTFs), where the suffix \"+1\" denotes the addition of a single high-exponent d function on second-row elements 62 to accommodate inner polarization effects. The latter has been repeatedly shown to be essential for accurate computed properties of second-row molecules with polar bonds, 62-64 and the addition of a mere five functions to the basis set increases CPU time insignificantly for our purposes.

This involves passing cathode rays through a uniform electric field (E), measuring the radius (r) of the circular path they take, and then using a uniform magnetic field (B) at right angles to annul the deflection of the beam. Under the first conditions, the electric force on each electron (Eq) is equal to the particle's rate of change of momentum (mv 2 /r); under the second, the electric force is balanced by the magnetic force (Bvq). The second relation gives\nv ¼ E =Bð3Þ\nFrom this and the first relation\nm=q ¼ B 2 r=Eð4Þ\nExperiments with cathode rays of low energy give m/q = -5.69 9 10 -9 g C -1 . Combining this with the charge on an electron (q = -1.602 9 10 -19 C) gives m = 9.11 9 10 -28 g. However, when experiments like this are repeated with cathode rays of high energy, the values of m are found to increase with speed (calculated from Eq. 3). This was investigated by Kaufmann (1901) before Einstein put forward his theory of relativity (see Miller 1997). His results, along with some of those obtained later by Bucherer (1909), are plotted in Fig. 1 (Shankland 1960: Chap. 2, Sect. 4). These show that m rises increasingly rapidly with v, and apparently approaches a limit equal to the speed of light (c = 2.998 9 10 8 m s -1 ). The limits (m = m 0 at v = 0, m = ? at v = c) suggest changing the variables to a = m/m 0 and b = v/c. The variable a then varies from one to infinity as b varies from zero to one.",

The force between these two masses (10 -104 kg 2 ) if separated by the square of Planck's length (10 -70 m 2 ) and multiplied by G (6.6•10 -11 m 3 •kg -1 •s -2 ) would be 10 -45 N.

This is a relevant value for several reasons. First, the quantum is within the same order of magnitude as the essential bond strengths within water associated with proton movements and with the hydrogen bond which determines the majority of aqueous properties. Secondly, the gravitational force between two potassium ions separated by the distance (11 nm) reflecting the density of the layer of these ions that defines the resting membrane potential, is (6.2 •10 -26 kg) 2 divided by (1.1 •10 -8 m) 2 multiplied by G (6.67•10 -11 m 3 kg -1 s -2 ), or, 4.1 •10 -46 International Letters of Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy Vol. 21 N. When multiplied over the distance of 10 26 m, the approximate width of the universe, the energy would be ~10 -20 J.

Therefore, here we concentrate on the expression of the first and second derivatives of the ESPF charge operator and the extra contributions that arise from the grid derivatives.

We can redefine the previous grid points k by a new grid definition of points of a Lebedev sphere centered on quantum atoms A,\nr k = r A + r l := r A,l .(17)\nIn this section, we consider all grid points contribute equally, so that the grid weights are considered all equal to 1. The advantage of using an atom-centred grid is that we can compute the grid derivatives with respect to a quantum atom B is simply given by r x B A,l = δ AB e x , in which e x is the x-axis standard unit vector.

It can be observed that each of the multipoles depends on the distribution of the negative charge (electronic density, (r)). Such distribution is calculated based on quantum mechanics.\n\nThus, the interaction between molecules is not only a matter of interactions between two dipoles, or a dipole and a charge, which would reduce the total interaction to just the first or two first terms in the former expansion, but it is instead an interaction between two complete fields of charge.\n\nOur approach has consisted on using the whole electrostatic potential over both interacting molecules so as to understand interaction forces not as dipole-dipole interactions, but instead as V A (r) vs. V B (r) interactions, where V(r) is the whole electrostatic potential of a molecule. The electrostatic potential is a scalar field in the space associated with the molecule full of heights and valleys, designated as \"the electrostatic potential landscape\".

CONCLUSION\n\nWe have refined a QM/MM method based on new Electrostatic Potential Fitted (ESPF) atomic charge operators that are built to conserve the total molecular charge. This ESPF v2.0 approach is capable of calculating QM/MM energy, gradient and full Hessian. When interacting with any kind of external electrostatic potential, the ESPF operators can be added as expectation values to the total energy in a mechanical embedding approach, or directly included into the Fock operator of any self-consistent field procedure in an electrostatic embedding approach.\n\nThe QM atomic charges are fitted to reproduce electrostatic integrals computed on a grid surrounding the QM atoms. We showed that, unlike other grids, atom-centred grids are superior to produce correct atomic charge and energy derivatives. Indeed, they avoid the numerical instabilities which are frequently appearing with other grid types when the QM geometry is distorted. In addition, the atomic charge derivative sum rules as well as the translational invariance condition are retrieved when atom-centred grids are used. Still, rotational invariance of the QM/MM Hamiltonian is not completely satisfied. This would require, for example, the use of rotational invariant Lebedev's grid. 21 However, this would require the implementation of new types of integrals, beyond the scope of the present work.\n\nWhile some technical improvements are still possible for achieving a better computational efficiency (notably in terms of I/O), we have been able to locate the transition state characterizing a complex two proton transfer reaction occurring in a large cryptochrome protein.\n\nTo conclude, we formulated a general QM/MM method based on ESPF charges without approximations besides the truncation of the multipolar expansion. All the working equations shown here for the lowest order approximation (i.e., atomic charges) can be straightforwardly derived for higher-order terms.\n\nFIG. 1 .\n1ESPF partial atomic charges (in a.u.) along the O-C2-N-H dihedral angle of N-methylacetamide using a parallelepiped grid (1777 grid points) or a Lebedev grid (2572 grid points) using charge conserving operators.

In a QMC calculation based in configuration space, the charge density is a sum of delta functions: ρ(r) ∝ r ′ δ(r − r ′ ), where the sum is over all N e electron positions and all MC samples. We consider separately the electrons within a distance R of the atom and those outside. The contribution to the force from charges outside, F O z , can be calculated directly with the Hellmann-Feynman estimator in Eq. (1). The contribution from inside the sphere is responsible for the large variances in the direct estimator. It is convenient to introduce a \"force density\" defined as the force arising from electron charges at a distance r from the origin:\nf z (r) = Z dΩ ρ(r, θ, φ) cos θ(2)\nThen the force is given as:\nF z = F O z + R 0 f z (r)dr.(3)\nThe force density is a smooth function of r that tends to 0 linearly as r approaches the origin. The force density for H in a LiH molecule computed with Hartree-Fock and two different QMC estimators is shown in Fig.1. As expected the bare force estimator fluctuates wildly at small r. Because the force density is a smooth function, we can represent it in the interval (0, R) with a polynomial\nf z (r) = M k=1 a k r k(4)\nand determine the coefficients, a k , by minimizing\nχ 2 = R 0 dr r m f z (r) − f z (r) 2(5)\nwhere r m is a weight factor used to balance contributions from different values of r.",

See DOI: 10.1039/c5sc00473j Click here for additional data file.The law of conservation of charge, however, states that there should be an equal amount of positive and negative charges generated in the process. In order to explain the unequal amounts of positive and negative charges, we propose that the slab of Teon discharges by transferring its negative charge to gaseous molecules in the atmosphere. This phenomenon may be similar to the results found in previous studies; 4,19,20 when charge accumulates on the solid surface, the electric eld generated may eventually exceed the dielectric breakdown strength of the atmosphere. Under this circumstance, gaseous molecules ionize. The positive gaseous ions are attracted to the solid surface (and deposit on it), while the negative ions are repelled away from the surface.\n\nAs an order-of-magnitude analysis, we assume that the electric eld is homogeneous across the surface of the slab of Teon (this assumption is more accurate for regions away from the edges of the slab). In this case, we can apply Gauss's law to obtain a simple relationship between the electric eld, E, the charge density, s, and permittivity, 3 (eqn (2)).\nE ¼ s 3 (2)\nSince the charge on the slab of Teon is $2 nC, the charge density (for a surface area of 1 cm 2 ), s, is $20 mC m À2 . Accordingly, the electric eld is calculated to be 2.3 MV m À1 . This value is close to the dielectric breakdown strength of the atmosphere, which is 21 $3 MV m À1 . Thus, it is possible for the slab of Teon to discharge by ionizing gaseous molecules, and transfer its charge to the surrounding atmosphere. In short, charge is conserved in the system when water droplets gain positive charge continuously (with a constant supply of water), while the solid surface transfers negative charge continuously to its surrounding atmosphere (Fig. 3c).",

These equations have even been (approximately) extended to larger systems. However, this problem has been treated in the context of the (integral form) of the HK theorems. Below, the aforementioned differential forms are considered with their connection to the integral forms, which -the author thinksis worth to archive in detail. Consider the case N=1, M1, Z A 1 for ground and excited states. This is where one single electron is in the quantum force field of a nuclear frame. It is not in the general interest, except its M=1 subcase, the H-like atom. The latter is a basic problem in quantum mechanics. Solving it for  via Eq.2.1.1 is fully described in university textbooks; however, it is interesting with respect to solving it for  from the nonlinear equation Eq.2.1.23. From Eq.2.1.1 with =  1 f(r 1 ), multiplying by  from the left, integrating for spin coordinate and considering f as real function ((r 1 )= f 2 (r 1 )), Eq.2.1.23 takes the particular form in this case as D[N=1,(r 1 )]  -(1/4) 1 2 (r 1 ) + (1/8)(r 1 ) -1 | 1 (r 1 )| 2 +(r 1 )v(r 1 ) = E electr (r 1 ) (Eq.2.1.31) where the first two terms containing the nabla operator are an evaluation of the kinetic part D  [N=1,(r 1 )] = -(1/2)f 1 2 f = -(1/2) 1/2  1 2 ",

Indeed, in the b T η operator, one could interpret the deexcitation part b T y as a correction to the full CI truncation that constitutes b T x for deriving the properties and objects related above.

This accounts for the physical mechanism of dissipation in the wells and allows an incoherent rate constant to be defined in a one-dimensional system which would otherwise display coherent dynamics. The substitution is equivalent to truncating the integral of the correlation function to the range t ∈ [−π/ω, π/ω]. For simplicity, quantummechanical results were computed only for biases at which the reactant and product vibrational states matched exactly, for which the sinc function takes a value of (hω) −1 , whereas it is 0 for any channel which does not exactly conserve energy.\n\nThe quantum-mechanical calculations required a relatively large number of bridge states to converge because the overlap terms oscillate as functions of the bridge level, as shown in figure 5. The small magnitude of the values also makes computing the sum numerically challenging. For this particular model system, standard double-precision floating-point numbers were found to be adequate, but the nature of the sum means that one may require higher precision arithmetic in some cases.",

(29) and (30) confirm that the conclusion 24 by HA is true only for n = O(1). In fact, this limitation was noted briefly in the Appendix A of Ref. 24, but has not been stated anywhere else. For the case of n = O(P 1/2 ), the term involving g P (q) does not vanish but remains finite. Therefore, the difference between HA-QTST and RPMD-TST can be accounted for by a finite factor. For n = O(P ), both the terms involving T k−1 (q) − T k (q) and g P (q) cause HA-QTST to be different from RPMD-TST. In fact, in this case, it is not clear whether HA-QTST results in a finite value. Neglecting these cases amount to projecting the imaginary time path integral space onto the subspace where the quantum kinetic energy is not fully accounted for, which it seems cannot be overlooked in any QTST that aspires to more fully incorporate quantum effects. As an example, let us consider the case where P is even and n = P/2. Equation (25) in this case becomes\n∂f (q) ∂q k = cos φ P − (−1) k √ 2 sin φ 2P (Q 1 − Q 2 ) (Q 1 − Q 2 ) 2 ,(31)\nwhere Q 1 = P/2 j=1 q 2j−1 and Q 2 = P/2 j=1 q 2j .

INTRODUCTION\n\nTime-dependent one-body reduced density matrix functional theory (TD1MFT), provides an interesting alternative to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The description of excitations while breaking bonds goes catastrophically wrong in TDDFT [1,2]. Double excitations are absent in adiabatic TDDFT, which therefore fails for excited state potential energy surfaces (PES), which rapidly acquire double excitation character at elongated bond lengths, as demonstrated for the lowest excited Σ + g surface of H 2 [1] and for the lowest Π u surface (b 1 Π u ) in N 2 [3]. Both these types of excitations are feasible with TD1MFT [1,4], and also charge-transfer excitations can be described without difficulty with TD1MFT. For practical calculations, the use of an adiabatic approximation is mandatory. However, in the case of TD1MFT the standard adiabatic (SA) approximation as is usually employed in TDDFT, leads to some unphysical results: the occupation numbers become time-independent as demonstrated in Refs [4][5][6][7][8] and the frequency-dependent linear response equations [7,9] are in the static limit (ω → 0) not equal to the static response equations [10,11].\n\nTo avoid these problems, an alternative adiabatic approximation was proposed [5,12]. This adiabatic approximation assumes that the occupation numbers instantaneously relax, so are determined by their ground state equations. This approximation has been given the more descriptive name instantaneous occupation number relaxation (IONR) approximation by Requist and Pankratov [13]. Unfortunately, the occupation numbers are still not dynamic variables, which impairs the description of some dynamic phenomena. An example are the \"diagonal\" double excitations, like the (1σ g ) 2 → (1σ u ) 2 exci- * k.j.h.giesbertz@vu.nl tation of the first 1 Σ + g excited state in H 2 at elongated bond lengths ( 5 Bohr) [4].",

In other words, the translational contamination is a consequence of adopting the absolute coordinates and not a result of the choice of Gaussian functions.

Section 6 is devoted to the analysis of the single-particle-reduced entropy of the system. Finally, the conclusions are drawn.\n\n2 Simulation approach For our calculations, we have employed a multi-configurational self-consistent Green's function (MCSCG) approach [10,11] for a realistic description of discrete resonant states, beyond the mean-field approximation. We make use of a one-band tight-binding description of the channel in the effective mass approximation, represented by a basis of sites 2N localized single-particle spin orbitals. The benefit of the MCSCG approach stems from the self-consistent division of the channel system into a small subsystem of resonantly trapped (relevant) states for which a many-body Fockspace treatment becomes numerically feasible, and the rest of the system which is treated adequately on a conventional mean-field level. The Fock-space description allows for the calculation of few-electron Coulomb charging effects beyond mean-field, as manifested in the Coulomb blockade regime.\n\nIn the following, 1 ρ denotes the single-particle density matrix [14] of the system under non-equilibrium conditions. For the NWFET channel, 1 ρ is a sites\nsites 2 2 N N ¥\nmatrix and is obtained from the NEGF formalism (see Eq. (11) in [10]). The single-particle eigenvectors of 1 ρ are called natural orbitals [14], its eigenvalues are real and within the interval [0 1].\n\n, For the case of a single Slater determinant, 1 ρ would have only eigenvalues 0 and 1.\n\nThe MCSCG approach describes the state of the channel with fluctuating electron number as a weighted mixture of a few relevant many-body states, so-called configurations. In the current approximation, these configurations are assumed to be Slater determinants of resonantly trapped natural orbitals [15]. The corresponding weights are real, restricted to the [0 1]\n\n, interval, and their sum is unity. Thus, the relevant many-body statistical operator consists of a weighted sum of projectors, restricted in our case to a relevant sub-space of the whole Fock-space.",

These equations have even been (approximately) extended to larger systems. However, this problem has been treated in the context of the (integral form) of the HK theorems. Below, the aforementioned differential forms are considered with their connection to the integral forms, which -the author thinksis worth to archive in detail. Consider the case N=1, M1, Z A 1 for ground and excited states. This is where one single electron is in the quantum force field of a nuclear frame.

(29) and (30) confirm that the conclusion 24 by HA is true only for n = O(1). In fact, this limitation was noted briefly in the Appendix A of Ref. 24, but has not been stated anywhere else. For the case of n = O(P 1/2 ), the term involving g P (q) does not vanish but remains finite. Therefore, the difference between HA-QTST and RPMD-TST can be accounted for by a finite factor. For n = O(P ), both the terms involving T k−1 (q) − T k (q) and g P (q) cause HA-QTST to be different from RPMD-TST. In fact, in this case, it is not clear whether HA-QTST results in a finite value. Neglecting these cases amount to projecting the imaginary time path integral space onto the subspace where the quantum kinetic energy is not fully accounted for, which it seems cannot be overlooked in any QTST that aspires to more fully incorporate quantum effects.

INTRODUCTION\n\nTime-dependent one-body reduced density matrix functional theory (TD1MFT), provides an interesting alternative to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The description of excitations while breaking bonds goes catastrophically wrong in TDDFT [1,2]. Double excitations are absent in adiabatic TDDFT, which therefore fails for excited state potential energy surfaces (PES), which rapidly acquire double excitation character at elongated bond lengths, as demonstrated for the lowest excited Σ + g surface of H 2 [1] and for the lowest Π u surface (b 1 Π u ) in N 2 [3]. Both these types of excitations are feasible with TD1MFT [1,4], and also charge-transfer excitations can be described without difficulty with TD1MFT. For practical calculations, the use of an adiabatic approximation is mandatory. However, in the case of TD1MFT the standard adiabatic (SA) approximation as is usually employed in TDDFT, leads to some unphysical results: the occupation numbers become time-independent as demonstrated in Refs [4][5][6][7][8] and the frequency-dependent linear response equations [7,9] are in the static limit (ω → 0) not equal to the static response equations [10,11].\n\nTo avoid these problems, an alternative adiabatic approximation was proposed [5,12]. This adiabatic approximation assumes that the occupation numbers instantaneously relax, so are determined by their ground state equations. This approximation has been given the more descriptive name instantaneous occupation number relaxation (IONR) approximation by Requist and Pankratov [13]. Unfortunately, the occupation numbers are still not dynamic variables, which impairs the description of some dynamic phenomena. An example are the \"diagonal\" double excitations, like the (1σ g ) 2 → (1σ u ) 2 exci- * k.j.h.giesbertz@vu.nl tation of the first 1 Σ + g excited state in H 2 at elongated bond lengths ( 5 Bohr) [4].",

However, it is not the only striking fact because the expectation values of any function of x 2 − x 1 and x 3 − x 1 (like, for example, (\nx 2 − x 1 ) 2 , (x 2 − x 1 ) 4 , (x 2 − x 1 )(x 3 − x 1 ), etc) are\nexact too. In spite of this remarkable agreement the exact and approximate wavefunctions are not the same as follows from the fact thatT CM ψ 00 = 0 and ϕ|T CM |ϕ = √ 3/4. We will explain these curious results later on; for the time being note that the results of Nakai et al [8] for E T RC tot − E T F tot = Φ 0 |T n,T |Φ 0 ≈ Φ 0 |T T |Φ 0 yield the spurious contribution of the kinetic energy of the center of mass to the molecular energy. They state that this problem is due to the fact that the Gaussian functions are unsuitable for describing the translational energy but it is clear that a set of Gaussian functions in relative coordinates will not exhibit such undesirable behavior. In other words, the translational contamination is a consequence of adopting the absolute coordinates and not a result of the choice of Gaussian functions. The same argument applies to the rotational contamination; Bubin et al [6] show how to obtain Gaussian states with zero angular-momentum quantum number (J = 0).",

The simplest would be to get the ground state energy of the chain by letting T → ∞. For numerical work this turns out to be delicate. What one would do is find a semiclassical expression for the total action in Eq. (18) and consider its large T limit. Unfortunately S tends to a constant, and the energy emerges from its derivatives. The same occurs for the simple harmonic oscillator.

This means that one needs extremely accurate values in a second derivative of the action, exponentially small in T .

Section 6 is devoted to the analysis of the single-particle-reduced entropy of the system. Finally, the conclusions are drawn.\n\n2 Simulation approach For our calculations, we have employed a multi-configurational self-consistent Green's function (MCSCG) approach [10,11] for a realistic description of discrete resonant states, beyond the mean-field approximation. We make use of a one-band tight-binding description of the channel in the effective mass approximation, represented by a basis of sites 2N localized single-particle spin orbitals. The benefit of the MCSCG approach stems from the self-consistent division of the channel system into a small subsystem of resonantly trapped (relevant) states for which a many-body Fockspace treatment becomes numerically feasible, and the rest of the system which is treated adequately on a conventional mean-field level. The Fock-space description allows for the calculation of few-electron Coulomb charging effects beyond mean-field, as manifested in the Coulomb blockade regime.\n\nIn the following, 1 ρ denotes the single-particle density matrix [14] of the system under non-equilibrium conditions. For the NWFET channel, 1 ρ is a sites\nsites 2 2 N N ¥\nmatrix and is obtained from the NEGF formalism (see Eq. (11) in [10]). The single-particle eigenvectors of 1 ρ are called natural orbitals [14], its eigenvalues are real and within the interval [0 1].\n\n, For the case of a single Slater determinant, 1 ρ would have only eigenvalues 0 and 1.\n\nThe MCSCG approach describes the state of the channel with fluctuating electron number as a weighted mixture of a few relevant many-body states, so-called configurations. In the current approximation, these configurations are assumed to be Slater determinants of resonantly trapped natural orbitals [15]. The corresponding weights are real, restricted to the [0 1]\n\n, interval, and their sum is unity. Thus, the relevant many-body statistical operator consists of a weighted sum of projectors, restricted in our case to a relevant sub-space of the whole Fock-space.",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

The modern quantum theory of interaction between two complex particles gives a rather complicated expression for the mutual potential energy.*)* We have here two kind of forces corresponding to symmetrical antisymmetrical solutions of the wave equation. Both solutions show a strong repulsion at the distances compared with the dimension of particles. At greater distances the symmetrical solution gives an attraction decreasing exponentially with distance, the antisymmetrical one a repulsion of the same type. For our case of a-particles we have to accept the first solution and write the additional potential energy in the formj :\n-fix)---- (lA )\nExamining the behaviour of a collection of particles attracting one another with the forces very rapidly decreasing with distance (we neglect at first the coulomb forces which are comparatively small at nuclear distances) we can introduce the well-known ideas made use of in the theory of capillarity. Calculating the potential energy of a particle inside a certain space in which the others are distributed nearly uniformly we must take into account only the action of particles inside a small sphere surrounding the particle in question. In fact the potential energy u of our a-particle is given by the integral:\nu = -[ f(r) . 47ir2p dr,(2)\n\nJd\n\nwhere d is the smallest distance between the particles and p the density of particles. In our case, where the forces diminish rapidly with distance, the integral converges rather quickly and practically need be taken only up to a certain distance r*. The sphere of radius r* is well known in the theory of capillarity as \" the sphere of molecular action.\" We can say that the particle inside the liquid has no resultant force acting on it if the distance from the boundary is greater than r*. In the surface region very strong forces arise, trying to drag the particle inside the liquid (surface tension). Such a collection of a-particles will be very like a minute drop of water where the inside pressure, due to the kinetic energy of quantised motion, is in equilibrium with the forces of surface-tension trying to diminish the drop-radius.",

According to an estimate by Slater the best effective nuclear charge for is (Z -0-3)e, where Z is the atomic number. The possible error in this approximation to corresponds to an error in the nuclear charge of no more than a fraction of e. For Cu, e.g., Z is 29, so th a t the error here corresponds to a change in Z of only about 1%. 5 Km depends on the excited state as well as the initial state ^K. Since m is a state of positive energy, the corresponding wave function < \\> m decreases comparatively slowly with increasing distance from the nucleus. I t will, therefore, not be negligible in the regions occupied by the L and outer electrons, and in these regions the effective nuclear charge differs appreciably from Z -0 • 3.

Apart from an effect on the normalizing factor we would, therefore, expect so far as its value in qKm is concerned, to correspond to the same effective nuclear charge as ^K, viz., Z -0 • 3. In other words we would expect a K oscillator of given frequency to have a strength approximately equal to that of a hydrogen-like atom of nuclear charge (Z -0-3)e. Stobbe (loc. cit.) has made calculations of the K photoelectric absorption-which is a direct measure of the oscillator strength-on the assumption of this effective nuclear charge, and finds satisfactory agreement with experiment.

For the pointnucleus case, this equation leads to the binding energy\nE nj − mc 2 = − (αZ) 2 2ν 2 2 1 + (αZ/ν) 2 + 1 + (αZ/ν) 2 mc 2 ,(2)\nwhere ν = n + (j + 1/2) 2 − (αZ) 2 − (j + 1/2), n is the principal quantum number, and j is the total angular momentum. To get the binding energy to a higher accuracy, we have to evaluate the quantum electrodynamic and nuclear corrections. The finite-nuclear-size correction can be obtained by solving the Dirac equation with the potential induced by an extended-charge nucleus and taking the difference between the energies for the extended and the point nucleus model. This can be done either numerically (see, e.g., Ref. [5]) or analytically [6]. To a relative accuracy of ∼ 0.2%, in the range Z=1-100 the finite-nuclear-size correction is given by the following approximate formulas [6] \n∆E ns = (αZ) 2 10n [1 + (αZ) 2 f ns (αZ)] 2 αZ n R (h/mc) 2γ mc 2 ,(3)∆E np 1/2 = (αZ) 4 40 n 2 − 1 n 3 [1 + (αZ) 2 f np 1/2 (αZ)] 2 αZ n R (h/mc) 2γ mc 2 ,(4) where γ = 1 − (αZ) 2 ,",

At small distances, the non-additivity is large; furthermore, the potential changes rapidly and the Thomas-Fermi condition no longer holds (or more precisely is even less accurate) in the region of overlap, whence most of the interaction energy comes. We estimate this region as being R less than about 1. The short-distance region, we could argue, is less important for ensembles of atoms, since close approaches are unlikely because of the strongly repulsive nature of the potential at short distances. As for the asymptotic region, as Harris has shown, it is in fact possible to include induction forces in the electron gas theory--at the price of a fair amount more work in the calculation of the constituent component densities. It may also be possible to make some kind of interpolation between the electron gas results at intermediate distances and the results of perturbative calculations, which are reliable at asymptotic distances.",

In the standard approach the first step in calculating the contribution of the ionic shift is to use the multipole expansion with respect to the ratio r rms /R (in the binary description of the ion microfield) or with respect to the analogous parameter r rms F 1/2 (in the multi-particle description of the ion microfield F), where r rms is the root-mean-square value of the radius-vector of the atomic electron (r rms ~ n 2 /Z 1 , where Z 1 is the nuclear charge), and R is the separation between the nucleus of the radiating atom/ion and the nearest perturbing ion. Here and below we use the atomic units.\n\nIt was quite obvious that the dipole term of the expansion (~ 1/R 2 or ~ F) does not lead to any shift of a hydrogenic SL. This is because each pair of the Stark components, characterized by the electric quantum numbers q and -q, is symmetric with respect to the unperturbed frequency ω 0 of the hydrogenic line-in terms of both the displacement from ω 0 and the intensity. (Here q=n 1 -n 2 , where n 1 and n 2 are the first two of the three parabolic quantum numbers (n 1 n 2 m).) As for the quadrupole term of the expansion (~ 1/R 3 or ~ F 3/2 ), it does not shift the center of gravity of hydrogenic lines, as rigorously proven   [14,16] and their comparison with the shifts from paper by Bengtson and Chester [10].",

For example, we define Z = 128R 3 0 z/9π 2 and Q = 128R 3 0 q/9π 2 , and solve the equation for various values of a. Such a dependence of Q on Z is shown in F ig.4 for z 0 = 0 and a = 0.8, and in F ig.5 for z 0 = 0 and a = 0.9; while in F ig.6 it is shown an almost neutral cluster for z 0 = 0 and a = 0.87. Similar results can also be obtained for z 0 = 0. In F ig.7 the variation of q with R 0 is shown for z O = 0, z = 44 and R = 1.73Å, while in F ig.8 a similar dependence is included for z O = 11, z = 88 and R = 2.75Å.\n\nIn the limit of large number of atoms in the cluster the Thomas-Fermi theory is valid. For a finite number n of atoms disposed on a spherical surface one may estimate the error in the total charge as follows. From the Poisson equation we have that the charge q is proportional to the radial δϕ ′ r and angular δϕ ′ a variations of the potential derivatives in the following way:\nq ∼ δϕ ′ r ∆S + 2δϕ ′ a ∆S ,(47)\nwhere ∆S is the element of area. Assuming the same variation per unit length we find\nδϕ ′ a = δϕ ′ r 4π n .(48)\nOn the other hand, if one neglects the angular variations we have\nq 0 ∼ δϕ ′ r 0 ∆S .(49)\nAs these small variations are proportional to the small variations of the distance we should also have δϕ ′ r 2 + 2 δϕ \n\nwhence ∆q/q ∼ 1 − 1 + 8π/n 1 + 2 4π/n .",

It is slightly more accurate to calculate the square of the overlap integral from the true near-zero-energy (free) state, but it is more convenient to use a bound → bound calculation program such as LEVEL 8.2 [20]. With appropriate scaling, the highest bound vibrational level is nearly identical at short range to the near-zeroenergy scattering state, as shown in Figure 1, due to the steepness of the repulsive wall and the similarity in their energies. At our experimental temperature of ∼ 120 µK, the thermal population distribution has a peak at 2.5 MHz, while the v ′′ = 39 level is bound by 0.007238 cm −1 , or 217 MHz, for a difference of less than ∼ 220 MHz. The scattering state has been calculated using the code developed in [23,24,25]. Franck-Condon factors were calculated from this boxnormalized free wavefunction and were scaled to give the same FCF at v ′ = 2 as produced by the bound state calculation. We show a comparison of such an FCF calculation to experimental data in Section 3.\n\nAs with any use of a Franck-Condon factor, the R-dependence of the transition dipole moment may play an important role that is neglected by our approximation. The 2 1 Σ + g ∼ 2 (0 + g ) state studied in [2,3] is an excellent example. The case (c) transition dipole is constant and large at long range, but at short range (in the region of our experiment) it drops rapidly toward zero [26]. This caused a drop-off in our signal for shorter-range and more deeply-bound vibrational levels, and reflects a transition from the allowed transition in case (c) to a region where case (a) better represents the coupling and the transition is singlet ↔ triplet forbidden.",

However, as explained below, we will use a discretization method to treat the continuum, so that the sum will run over the discrete levels until convergence in equation (6). As the ground state is the only state below the a 3 Σ + state, the sum over f will reduce to only one term.\n\nTo calculate the lifetime of state |i , it is thus necessary to know: (i) its transition moments with all the states |f lower in energy, and (ii) the vibrational wave functions (and energies) of states |i and |f .\n\n\nB.

For the electronic transition energy we can use Eq. (48). If we neglect unharmonicity, we can write the transition frequency between close vibrational levels of the two electronic terms in the form\nω = ω el,0 + qx + (v 2 + 1 2 ) ω vib,2 − (v 1 + 1 2 ) ω vib,1 , (58) where v 2 v 1 .\nThe dependence of this frequency on constants is given by:\nδω ≈ 2q δα α − ω el,0 2 δµ µ ,(59)\nwhere we took into account that ω ω el,0 . A very rough estimate of the factor q can be done in the following way. For the ground state of atomic Cs the q-factor is about 1100 cm −1 , which is close to 1 4 α 2 Z 2 ε 6s , where ε 6s is the ground-state binding energy. If we assume that the same relation holds for the electronic transition in molecule, we get |q| ∼ 1 4 α 2 Z 2 ω el,0 ∼ 120 cm −1 . Using this estimate and Eq. (59) we get:\nδω ≈ −240 δα α − 1600 δµ µ ,(60)\nwhere we assume that relativistic corrections reduce dissociation energy of the molecule, so q is negative. This estimate shows that the experiment with Cs 2 is mostly sensitive to variation of µ.",

The dipole moment calculated for the optimized gas-phase monomer in GAUS-SIAN09 is 3.943 D at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The dipole moment predicted by FFLUX differs by less than 0.1% with a value of 3.941 D, which confirms that the atomic charge and atomic dipole GPR models are capable of reproducing the molecular dipole moment at the training level of theory, as seen in previous work. 45 3.2. FFLUX-Optimized Dimers. 3.2.1. Computational Details. Two sets of dimer optimization were performed using FFLUX. In the first set, ab initio optimized dimers were used as starting geometries. These were obtained by taking structures approximating the five minima identified previously 29 and optimizing them at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory (shown in Figure 1). In the second set, random starting geometries were used. These optimizations allowed us to check that no unexpected minima are found using the chosen nonbonded potential and to probe the intermolecular PES facilitated by the chosen Lennard-Jones parameters. Optimizations were also performed using a rigid-body force field constructed using permanent multipole moments from an IQA analysis of the B3LYP/aug-cc-pvTZ optimized monomer and the same Lennard-Jones parameters (IQA + LJ). This allowed comparison to a force field with a similar form to other multipolar force fields that utilize rigid bodies. The multipole moments for each atom are given in Section 4 in the SI.",

However, the peak height increased with the number of molecules in each subset. When plotting all molecules, outliers became more frequent, which is likely due to the growing number of atom species. This is expected, as calculations tend to be more complex with heavier atoms; few molecules containing heavy atoms are found in PubChem. As a result, the peak values and coefficients of determination remained relatively stable. In any event, a thorough examination is warranted. Fig.7 presents the same data as in Fig.6 but from a 45-degree angle perspective. It clearly reveals that the number of outliers is quite small, and the peaks are well-defined for all sets.   Fig. 6, viewed from a 45-degree angle.

We did not plot For all instances, dipole moments exhibit a strong correlation between PM6//PM6 and B3LYP/6-31G*//PM6. Given that the same molecular geometries were employed for both calculations, this outcome is anticipated, as the dipole moment is predominantly influenced by molecular geometry rather than the disparities in calculation methods.

An analysis considering diverse diatomic speciesDipole moments from experimental geometries\n\nThe dipole moments discussed in previous sections are obtained from optimized computational geometries at the corresponding levels of theory and basis sets. Nevertheless, and despite our exhaustive work, we did not analyze if the performance of the different methods and basis set for the dipole moment were correlated with their performance for the equilibrium geometry. For instance, when we consider the core-correlation, both magnitudes showed a simultaneous improvement. To reach a deeper insight on that question, we have calculated the dipole moment of the molecules in the dataset using experimental geometries taken from Ref. 8 and compare with the ones based on computational optimized geometries, as shown in Figs. 10 and Fig. 11. For these calculations, we employ the def2-QZVPP basis since it has been shown in the previous sections that the def2-QZVPP dipole moments are very closed to the predicted CBS(def2-T/QZVPP). Within the frozen-core approximation, the calculated dipole moments based on experimental geometries are generally smaller than the ones employing computational optimized geometries. Consequently, using experimental geometries can improve the dipole moments of some molecules whose dipole moments are overestimated, for example CuS, some bi-alkali molecules and some of the alkaline halides, but exacerbates the description of some metal/nonmetal halides. However, the RMSE is 0.67 D, which is even larger than the dipole moments for computational optimized geometries (0.61 D). In the case of core-correlations, as the description of dipole moments is already improved compared to the frozen-core results, using experimental geometries can make the predictions of some molecules closer to the experimental results, for example some transition metal compounds whose dipole moments are overestimated with computational optimized geometries. The overall RMSE of dipole moment can be reduced from 0.42 D with computationally optimized ge-ometries to 0.37 D with experimental geometries for 135 molecules.\n\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nIn this study, we have systematically analyzed the performance of CCSD(T) predicting dipole moments and equilibrium distances of diatomic molecules compared with a dataset of 135 experimental dipole moments and equilibrium distances.",

The calculations have been performed using the Gaussian 09 soware package. 20 The uB97XD functional 21 with the 6-311++G** basis set has been employed for the geometry optimizations. Full optimizations have been done for all substrates and then a restricted optimization was performed where the chelating chain was forced to be in the plane of the ring by constraining the dihedral angle (s) to be zero (Scheme 1) without any metal catalyst (M). Solvent effects were not included in the calculations. We assume that the solvents, employed in the experiments where yields were taken, are properly selected (during the optimization studies) for the ideal reactivity of the substrates and the solvents have similar effects on the equilibrium and planar conformers of a given substrate. In this study we will approximate the rotational Gibbs free energy (DG rot ) by the computed Kohn-Sham energy difference of the equilibrium and constrained geometries, where the conformational angle (s) is set to 0 (Scheme 1) and neglect the entropy, vibrational and zero-point energy differences between the equilibrium and constrained structures. We note that when formation of a six-membered metallacycle is expected all the three atoms of DG are forced to be in-plane with the aromatic ring requiring two dihedral angles to be 0 . In the following we will use either the equilibrium dihedral angle s, or the term DG rot when discussing the effect of steric hindrance between DG and ortho groups. In addition, we also express DG rot in RT units (standardized DG rot ; DG 0 rot ¼ DG rot /RT), i.e. we can compare torsional energies at different temperatures.\n\n\nTheory for C-H activation with d 8 metals",

A summary of our results can be found in Fig. S12. Our quantum chemical calculations find six possible αPH minimum geometries, three different rotamers for eq and ax geometries, which we label according to the C3-C1-C2-HISO dihedral angle of the isopropyl group shown in Fig. 2 (i.e. gauche-(G-), trans (T), and gauche+ (G+)). Their S0 minima are at -58.5°/-70.7° (G-), -172.9°/179.4° (T), and 57.0°/48.9° (G+) for ax/eq conformers, respectively. Our calculations find the eq-αPH minimum geometries to be in general more stable than ax-αPH and the thermal equilibrium, thus, dominated by similar fractions of the three eq-αPH rotamers. This is confirmed by a recent study on matrix isolated αPH which could only identify vibrational signatures of equatorial conformers. (21) To quantify the possible amount of axial conformers in our gas phase sample, we fit a linear combination of the simulated sM(s) functions of all six conformers to the experimental sM(s). The coefficients of the axial conformer sM(s) functions are always negative or zero if forced to be positive semidefinite. Thus, we cannot find any direct evidence for the presence of axial conformers in the static diffraction. We estimate the uncertainty of this assessment to be on the order of 10 %, To quantify the contribution of ax-αPH ring-opening to the experimental signal, we create linear combinations of the averaged eq-αPH and ax-αPH and compare the time-dependence of the integrated α, β, and γ regions to the experimental data, analogous to Fig. 3d. A comparison using a linear combination with 20% ax-αPH contribution is plotted in Fig. S13. The α and β regions are only moderately sensitive to the fraction of ax-αPH contribution, since both ax-αPH and eq-αPH open the ring. As expected from Fig. S3, the γ-region is significantly more sensitive to the fraction of ax-αPH contribution. In Fig. S13, the intensity of the γ-signature is reduced far enough to",

We performed the geometry optimization and rotatory strength calculation of methyl α -D-Glc conformers using CAM-B3LYP with the multicomponent scheme (MC_CAM-B3LYP). In MC_CAM-B3LYP calculations, all hydrogen nuclei were treated quantum mechanically. Two isotopologues were investigated; the first isotopologue had only protons as the hydrogen nuclei and four OH groups of the molecule were replaced with the deuterons for the other isotopologue. We used 6-31G(d) electronic basis set for geometry optimization and 6-311+ + G(2d,2p) basis set for rotatory strength calculations. For both types of calculations, [1s] GTF calculations were used with 24.1825 a.u. exponent value for the proton and 35.6214 a.u. for deuteron optimized for the quantum treatment of hydrogen nuclei in the MC_HF scheme 22 . Electronic excitation calculation based on TD-DFT with CAM-B3LYP functional was performed to obtain the rotatory strength of the optimized geometry, where the occupied and virtual Kohn-Sham orbitals were evaluated with the multicomponent scheme and the excitation of the hydrogen nuclei was neglected. 30 rotatory strengths were calculated for each conformer to construct the CD spectrum according to the equation: where σ i is the excitation energy, R i is the corresponding electronic rotatory strength, and σ ∆ is the bandwidth of each signal that was set to 0.30 eV.",

For single-reference closed-shell configurations with at least four electrons, if the effects of quadruple excitations are assumed to be much larger than triple excitations, then the above formula for the Davidson correction (with an expected value of λ DC ∼ 0.5 for closed-shell He-H 2 ) can be derived theoretically [44][45][46][47] . We not only used multiple references, we also used open and mixed shell SCF cases; we therefore obtained values for the parameter λ DC by minimizing the average differences between MRD-CI energy values computed for the same point with different reference sets (which thus had different sizes for the Davidson correction). We used λ (SCF) DC = 0.52, 0.16, and 0.32 for closed, open, and mixed SCF cases, respectively; the average size of ∆E DC was 1.31, 1.90, and 0.60 mE h , respectively, yielding full-CI corrections averaging 0.68, 0.30, and 0.19 mE h , respectively. For the 12 077 cases where the program obtained improved reference sets, and thus two different-sized Davidson corrections were available, the rms difference between the resulting energies was 0.16 mE h . This may be a slight underestimate of the energy uncertainty resulting from the Davidson correction, since on average the initial reference set yielded a Davidson correction only 1.75 times as large as the improved reference set, and we have no information from cases where only one value of the Davidson correction was available. There are suggestions of a systematic uncertainty of order 0.1 in the preferred value of λ (SCF) DC , leading to a systematic uncertainty in the energy correction of order 0.13 mE h . We estimate the total uncertainty in the Davidson-type correction to full-CI to be about 0.3 mE h .",

Effect of the Weighting Coefficients. The present calculations were carried out while varying the weighting coefficients, and Figure 1 shows the primary configurations of  the electronic states obtained for the H 2 O molecule. The calculated electronic state energies, eigenvalues, and imposed penalties are provided in Table 3. Table 4 summarizes the calculated energies and the assignments of the first, second, and third electronic states: |ψ(θ 0 )⟩, |ψ(θ 1 )⟩, and |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ The costs of these states are summarized in Table 5. Below, we review the results with respect to each coefficient. With regard to condition (i), the core-ionized state represented by |122̅ ⟩ was obtained as the ansatz state |ψ(θ 1 )⟩ with β ≥ 21.0. In contrast, the state was |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ and the ground state |11̅ 2⟩ was obtained as both |ψ(θ 0 )⟩ and |ψ(θ 1 )⟩ with β < 21.0. In the case of β < 21.0, |ψ(θ 1 )⟩ was nonorthogonal to |ψ(θ 0 )⟩ and the penalty of β was imposed on its cost function. However, ⟨11̅ 2|Ĥ|11̅ 2⟩ + β was still less than the cost function for the core-ionized state |122̅ ⟩. Therefore, the ground state |11̅ 2⟩ was obtained again as |ψ(θ 1 )⟩. If |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ is also |11̅ 2⟩, its cost function will be ⟨11̅ 2| Ĥ|11̅ 2⟩ + 2β because |ψ(θ 2 )⟩ is nonorthogonal to both |ψ(θ 0 )⟩ and |ψ(θ 1 )⟩, and so the cost function will be greater than that of the core-ionized state |122̅ ⟩. Thus, the core-ionized state | 122̅ ⟩ was obtained as |ψ(θ 2 )⟩. In the case with β ≥ 21.0, the",

The origin of the coordinate system is taken at the center of mass of SrOH. The geometry of SrOH is kept linear and fixed throughout the calculations. The position of the center of mass was calculated using the exact mass of the most abundant isotope 88 Sr. The Jacobi angle θ describes the angular dependence of the PES and the θ = 0 • geometry describes the Li-H-O-Sr collinear arrangement. The linear Sr-O-H geometry is described by the bond lengths r(SrO) = 2.1110Å and r(OH) = 0.9225Å as verified by the geometry optimization at the RCCSD(T) level. The normal modes of SrOH are determined from the vibrational frequency RCCSD(T) calculations with the same basis set as the PES calculations (excluding the bond functions), which show the doubly degenerate SrOH bending mode at 386 cm −1 , the Sr-O stretching mode at 534 cm −1 and the OH stretching vibration at 3919 cm −1 .\n\n\nsp = (0.94, 0.34, 0.12), df = (0.64, 0.23) and g = (0.35).

How many ways exist to pay a total price of value V ¼ 12? Let S v denote the individual sum of coins of value v, hence\nV ¼ S 1 þ S 2 þ S 5 ¼ 12:ð51Þ\nThe values which each individual sum may take are determined and limited in number by the number of available coins of each nominal value.

Number of Wyckoff sequences of a given subdivision complexityA generating polynomial approach to find solutions\n\nOur combinatorial problem stated above is solved in two steps: first, by reducing it, conceptually, to an analogous classical problem of combinatorics, the coin change problem, as can be found in many textbooks on the topic (for instance, Marcus, 1998, p. 89), and second, by adapting the classical problem to the crystallographic one.\n\nThe classical coin change problem is stated in Appendix B, and can be seen as an illustration of the use of generating polynomials, defined in some abstract variable. Notably, the variable is an indeterminate symbol only, entailing no specific meaning other than to allow algebraic operations performed on it; hence it merely acts as a placeholder and bookkeeping device, yet is the decisive one, in order to systematically find a solution.\n\nThis use of generating polynomials has already been described in the first entry of this series (Hornfeck, 2022a) to which the reader, interested in more detailed information, is referred. An introduction to the wider field of generating functions is given by Graham et al. (1994), and a more detailed exposition of the main ideas involved is given by Wilf (2006). Now, adapting the classical coin change problem to our crystallographic one is carried out in three steps: (i) matching the number of distinct types of coins with the number of distinct Wyckoff positions; (ii) identifying the values of distinct types of coins with the pair of values of the Wyckoff position's multiplicity M i and arity A i ; and (iii) treating the pair of values (M i , A i ) in a coupled way, by introducing two abstract variables ðx; yÞ in the generating polynomials, instead of one.\n\nThus, in some way, the crystallographic problem is a coin change problem with a twist, based on imaginary coins with denominations on both their front and back sides and a pair of target values to reach upon summation. Similar combinatorial problems arise for the case of real cards, coupling values denoted by digits or letters with symbolic ones such as diamonds, hearts, spades and clubs.",

Number of Wyckoff sequences of a given subdivision complexityThus, due to these particular restrictions, it is a non-trivial task to describe a macrostate defined by the collective degrees of freedom ðM; AÞ by the composition from or the subdivision into its associated microstates ðM i ; A i Þ. Foremost, it is a natural question to ask, given one macrostate, what is the number of microstates corresponding to it?\n\nThe following section will give the answer to this question, with the main results being a generating polynomial approach (Section 2.4, theory; Section 2.7, algorithm) and a dynamic programming approach (Section 2.8, theory and algorithm).\n\n\nCombinatorics of Wyckoff sequences\n\nTo state the problem succinctly: how many distinct Wyckoff sequences (of optionally fixed length k) exist, given a pair of combinatorial and coordinational degrees of freedom ðM; AÞ together with a choice of space group? (Note that a space group has to be fixed, since this determines the alphabet of Wyckoff letters which can appear in the Wyckoff sequence.)\n\n\nA problem of crystals -exposition\n\nThe problem statement can be translated rather straightforwardly into some algebraic form. Note that two integer values exist for each individual Wyckoff position i, its multiplicity M i and its arity A i (coordinational degree of freedom). Both have to be considered in a coupled way, which will be done in the notation by the use of column vectors. Then, the total multiplicity and arity, M and A, respectively, corresponding to a certain set of Wyckoff sequences of crystal structures, are given as\nM A ! ¼ X n i¼1 i M i A i ! :ð1Þ\nHere, the sum index i runs over all the n existing Wyckoff positions for a given space group, with the integer multipliers i denoting the frequency of occurrence of a given site in the sum of individual multiplicities M i and arities A i of the combined sites. In one general point of view, as mentioned in the Introduction, one can call the pair ðM; AÞ the system variables (describing the macrostate), while the M i and arities A i would be the subsystem variables (describing the microstates).",

This algorithmic way is known under the name dynamic programming. A simple example for the classical univariate and infinite coin change problem is given in Appendix B. In the following, we show the adapted pseudocode for the bivariate and finite coin change problem in its crystallographic application, thus taking into account the case distinction for the multipliers of non-fixed and fixed Wyckoff sites (Fig. 2). The adaptation to the trivariate and finite case including the length k as a parameter follows a straightforward procedure (Fig. 3), as would be the case for any future multivariate generalization, for instance also taking into account chemical degrees of freedom.\n\nIn either case, the approach starts with the trivial base case (there is always one possibility for the null tuple), from which it proceeds bottom-up making use of a tabulation implementation of subsolution values cached into either a matrix (bivariate case) or a tensor (trivariate case), which is updated iteratively until the target case is reached and the solution is returned. Equation (29) shows the solution matrix T for the case defined by the target tuple ðM; AÞ ¼ ð12; 3Þ and the multiset of tuples W ¼ ½ð2; 0Þ; ð2; 0Þ; ð2; 1Þ; ð4; 1Þ; ð4; 2Þ; ð8; 3Þ in which the values for M i and A i increase along the rows and the columns, respectively. Note that for a more economic display, the matrix is shown in its transposed form, with columns and rows interchanged, such that its upper-left corner represents the matrix element T 0;0 and the lower-right corner represents the matrix element T 12;3 , from which the solution, T 12;3 ¼ 6, can be read off:",

Number of Wyckoff sequences of a given subdivision complexityis the generating function of the number-theoretic integer partition function (Alfonsín, 2005, p. 71), and our problem asks for the number of restricted partitions into specified, possibly repeated parts (a finite or infinite number of coins with a finite set of distinct denominations). In this context the number of non-negative integer solutions is known as Sylvester's denumerant (Sylvester, 1857) which has a rich history in number theory, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining exact results (Alfonsín, 2005, ch. 4). Finally, it should be emphasized that an elegant method of solving this problem in practice is given by the concept of dynamical programming. Since the problem again and again reduces to simpler subproblems of the same kind, the solu-tions of these subproblems can be stored whenever they occur for the first time. Moreover, using a bottom-up approach (topdown would be equally feasible), the solutions for subproblems can be systematically generated from the already known solutions. For this purpose the function here given in a Python implementation is initialized with a result vector of length n þ 1 of the form ð1; 0; 0; . . . ; 0Þ. This result vector is subsequently updated in a separate loop for every coin value. The final value at position n of the result vector then is the solution to the (infinite) coin problem described before (for n ¼ 12 the result is equal to 13).",

For the airvelocity curve Geiger deduced from his results the formula V3 = aR, where V is the velocity, a a constant and R the range of the a-particles emerging from the absorbing foil. Putting in the value 6'94 for the total range at 15° and 76 cm. Hg, the values given in Column 6 of Table II were deduced and it will be seen that except for velocities less than 0*41 they show a good agreement with the experimental values. With regard to the velocity curves in other materials the formula does not hold, the curve approaching more nearly to that expressed by V2 = &R for substances of increasing atomic weight. This is indicated by the energy curve for gold shown in fig. 1. Darwin (loc. cit.) first attempted to deduce expressions for the velocity curve in various materials, the assumption being that the a-particle loses energy by setting in motion the electrons in the atoms of the absorbing substance. To avoid, as far as possible, any hypotheses as to the structure of atoms Darwin also assumed that an a-particle only acts on the electrons in an atom when it actually passes through the atom. Bohr has extended Darwin's results and removed the objection of limiting the action of the a-particle. Bohr arrives at a formula which may be reduced to",

For our simulations, all axes of the box are at twice the initial centre-of-mass distance. A convenient choice for the initial distance r 12 is r 12 $ d c þ 2L, where d c is the diameter of the gold core and L is the length of an elongated ligand. At r 12 ¼ d c þ 2L the two NCs start to touch each other. A larger separation distance ensures that the initial forces on the centres of mass of both NCs are zero.\n\nTo calculate the PMF, we measure the average forces acting on the centre of mass of both gold cores, F 1 and F 2 over the course of a simulation run. The mean force between the two NCs is then obtained from\nF m ðr 12 Þ ¼ 1 2 ðF 2 2 F 1 ÞÁr u h i r 12 ;\nwhere r u ¼ r 12 =r 12 is the unit vector connecting two particles and the angular brackets denote the average in the constrained canonical ensemble.

In this study, we take U 0 = 100. Our control test shows that our results are not sensitive to the value of U 0 around 100. The simulation cell is a rectangular cell where periodic boundary condition is applied. To diminish the boundary effect, we always keep the cell size larger than two nanoparticles by six times of the Debye length, and the calculation results are stable as tested against different cell sizes. In the simulations, the radii of nanoparticles and ions are taken as 10Å and 2Å, respectively. The charges Z on nanoparticles are taken as −21e, ensuring the surface charge density is close to that of phosphate groups in nucleic acid (80). Also, the additional calculations are performed for other ion radii (3Å, 4Å) to study the ion size effect, and for other nanoparticle charge Z (= −12e, −24e, −36e) to study the charge density effect. In the calculations of potential of mean force ∆G(x) = G(x) − G(x ref ), for simplicity, the outer reference distance x ref is taken as 40Å for all ion conditions. We used the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm for all simulations in our work, which is a computational approach for generating a set of N configurations of the system by the relative probability proportional to the Boltzmann factor: p(N i ) ∝ e −E(N i )/k B T , and the transition probability p i→ j from configuration i to configuration j is given by p i→ j = e −(E j −E i )/k B T . Starting from an initial configuration with the two nanoparticles in the center and the ions randomly distributed in the simulation box, every particle randomly moves to a trial position and we calculate the energy change ∆E due to the move. If a random number R(∈ [0, 1]) < p = e −∆E/k B T , the trial move is accepted. Repeat the trial move until the system reaches the equilibrium. Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 (in the Supporting Material) shows that the statistical results of our simulations can quickly reach the convergence.",

For fixed m, the particle therefore sees the effective potential\n∆G(ℓ) + γ 2 ℓ 2 ,(5)\ni.e. Eq. (4) determines the variance of the random potential. The spring constant γ is determined by ε as follows. If ∆ε were zero, the unzipping force would take a constant value f 0 (cf. the dashed line in Fig. 2b, which shows the FEC of a homogeneous AU-hairpin). The dependence of f 0 on ε can be calculated analytically by evaluating the sum in Eq. (1) by the saddle point method (see also (D.K. Lubensky and D.R. Nelson, in preparation)). The result is shown in Fig. 4 (solid line). Now γ = l 2 Γ, where Γ is the local spring constant of a nonbinding RNA of m bases at force f 0 (ε). Since the spring constant of a homopolymer scales with the inverse of the number of segments, we write Γ = Γ 0 /m, where Γ 0 depends only on f 0 , but not on m. Graphically, Γ 0 (f 0 ) is the slope at f = f 0 of the dashed line in Fig. 2a (FEC of a homopolymeric RNA), multiplied by 251 (the number of bases in that example). In this way Γ 0 (f 0 ) may also be determined from an experimental FEC. Note that the Gaussian approximation breaks down already at low forces, and the more detailed treatment according to Eq.\n\n(2) is necessary. The stacking energy for AU-pairs at T = 20 • C is 2 ε ≈ 1.21 kcal/mol corresponding to a threshold force f0 ≈ 11 pN, which agrees with the value observed in Fig. 2b (dashed line).",

It turns out that the energy loss E loss (θ ) does not depend on the velocity component v z normal to the plane of the scattering process. Moreover, one can see that, for small angles θ , the v x term (vibrations orthogonal to the incoming electron) dominates and broadening of the energy loss curve will begin linearly in sin(θ ) ≈ θ .",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter. Y/n. This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

The PMF is defined as an effective potential that corresponds to the average force [55] and it is associated with the center of mass (CM) of the molecules (amino acid and dipeptides without the caps). We determine it by implementing the umbrella sampling method [56,57]. It involves two stages. In the first stage, one generates a set of initial conformations for representative values of z by pulling the CM of the object along the z-axis -perpendicular to the surface of the solid. The origin of the z-axis is at the center of the top atoms of gold. Pulling is implemented through a \"dummy particle\" which moves towards the surface with a constant speed of 1 nm/ns from z=2 nm to z=0 and drags the CM by the harmonic force corresponding to the spring constant of 5000 kJ/(mol nm 2 ). We consider 36-39 z-placements of the harmonic centers and generate conformations that are saved every 0.1 ps. The histograms for each centering are found to be overlapping which signifies sufficient statistics. The lateral motion is not constrained so the PMF is averaged laterally. Overall, the average forces are calculated based on between 100 000 and 150 000 conformations for each z-placement.\n\nIn the second stage, these conformations are used for further separate runs where the z-location of the pulling particle is fixed and the CM is observed to move within a sampling window of width ∆z. The elastic parameter is chosen so that ∆z's from neighboring bins overlap. The distribution of the resulting vertical locations of CM in the window has a maximum where the harmonic pulling force balances all forces acting along the z direction. This force is averaged over time and locations within each window and is then integrated over z to get the PMF. The errors in the values of the average forces are determined by the block averaging method [58] and are propagated during integration. Simulations last between 10 ns and 15 ns until the convergence of block averages is achieved. 1 ns corresponds to equilibration. The standard deviations of the average z values within the umbrella sampling intervals are found to be negligible.\n\n\nContact Angle Calculations",

For carbon 12  the range 0°-12°was calculated with higher precision with angular steps of 0.05°. Note the logarithmic color scale, which indicates the rapid decay of intensity with higher scattering angle. for each species. The first noticeable difference between the considered elements is the different energy loss ranges. This is a direct result of the different atomic masses, resulting in electrons to transfer a larger amount of kinetic energy to lighter nuclei than to heavy ones. Indeed, one can see from equation (1) that the smaller the difference between the masses of incident and target particle is, the larger the energy transfer (and therefore the electron energy loss) is. Another remarkable difference between the species taken into account is that the broadening of the EELS spectrum is much larger for lighter atoms and it progressively decreases for heavier ones. The reason for that is directly related to the different rms velocities. The plots in fig. 4a and b are obtained by calculating the energy loss for each individual scattering angle, as if we would detect deflected electrons within an infinitesimal angle dθ . Hence, for a real detector with finite size, a measurement would comprise a weighted sum of spectra from a range of scattering angles. To account for this, we integrate the scattered electrons (including the angle dependence via the Rutherford factor) over a range of scattering angles with 2°(35mrad) width. The result is shown in fig. 4 c-e, where we show the simulated spectra for the four considered species at different angles. The results depend only weakly on the choice of the integration width (2°or more), as the result is dominated by the smallest angles in the sum, due to the rapid decay of intensity at higher angles. It is striking that the curves for 12 C and 13 C -which have a ca. 8% relative difference in mass -appear to be almost on top of each other, due to the large broadening. The peak separation is on the order of 1% of the FWHM at 10°scattering angle, and even for back-scattered electrons is only 20% of the FWHM.",

In our case, A = Γ = 2πγ. Natural spectral width of the transition γ is of 6 MHz. The factor g(F g , F e ) can be expressed by using 6J symbols [13]. The calculated concentrations of the ground state atoms v.s. detuning of the cooling laser are shown in figure 4. Note that the populations of the ground-state 2S 1/2 sub-levels are quite close by magnitude. It can be explained by the fact that the upper state 2P 3/2 sublevels are not resolved (hf-splitting is the same order as the natural width γ). Therefore it is impossible to select the circling transition for the effective optical cooling. Atoms are continuously transferred from F = 2 to F = 1 and back. In the maximum (detuning range from 3γ to 6γ) the estimated population of the excited state 2P 3/2 is order 10 −2 of the total population of the ground state. Therefore the total density of the trapped atoms n in the maximum is near 5 × 10 10 cm −3 . An estimated total number N of the trapped atoms is of 4 × 10 8 . Estimated temperature of the trapped atoms is order of 3 × 10 −4 K. The density n and total number N of atoms can be increased by increasing the magnetic field gradient. The linear dependence of n and N on the magnetic field gradient in the range 20-35 Gauss/cm has been observed [10].",

New Bands ending on 2 p 1Ha J)t Dieke and Hopfield* showed th at the absorption bands of H 2, which are located in the extreme ultra-violet (about 1000-1500 A.U.) were due to transitions up from the ground level of H 2, which they called A, to two higher electronic levels which they called B and C respectively. Two years ago I found the emission bands which go down to the B level and some of them were described and partially analysed in this journal.f In a series of papers! Dr. Davidson and I have been able to show th at these bands comprise a large number of distinct band systems and contain a very large part of the total strength of the visible emission spectrum of H 2. In previous papers I have called this B level of Dieke and Hopfield 2 1S as it has an effective principal quantum number in the neighbourhood of 2 and its properties are those of an S level. In view of recently proposed changes in the nomenclature § for band spectra I propose in this paper to denote this B or 2 X S level by the symbol 2^?1S. In this notation 2 denotes the principal quantum number and < p indicates that the azimuthal or equivalent quantum number of the excited electron is 1. E means that the component of the total angular momentum (or equivalent quantized quantity) about the internuclear axis is 0 and the prefix1 that the state is a singlet state.Various attempts have been made from time to time to discover bands in this spectrum which end on Dieke and Hopfield's C level, but, until recently, nothing at all convincing has resulted from these efforts. I have now found a number of band systems which end on this C state. These systems|| all have * ' P h ys. R e v .,' vol. 30, p . 4 06 (1927). t ' R o y . Soc.

In RT-TDDFT, the occupation number f jk of a KS state is kept fixed to its initial value. As the wavefunctions evolve, they are no longer eigenstates ofĤ(t). It is possible to describe the number of excitations by projecting |ψ ik (t) onto the adiabatic ground state ofĤ(t)'s eigenfunctions [42,11,38] or onto the reference ground state at t = 0 [42,9,41]. We opt here for the latter.

This cw laser system works at a wavelength of 350 nm with an output power up to 100 mW. The ultraviolet laser beam (diameter ≈ 1 cm) is sent onto the atomic cloud. The laser frequency can be scanned. When the laser frequency passes through the Rydberg transition, we observe the reduction of the resonance fluorescence of the trapped atoms. It is gone down to its partial or complete vanishing depending on the ultraviolet laser beam power and on the quantum number of upper state. For the more reliable determination of the transition frequency, in addition to the CCD camera, we install a photodetector for recoding the fluorescence intensity. The frequency of ultraviolet laser is controlled by a high precision wavemeter WSU (High Finesse Angstrom). In our experiment, the wavemeter is calibrated by using a stabilized ECDL, whose frequency is locked to Doppler-free absorption resonance in rubidium-85 atomic vapor. The diagram depicting the working energy levels is shown in figure 1. According to the selection rules, the transitions from the 2P-state are possible only to the nS and nD-states. In the experiment we have measured frequencies ν nl of Rydberg transitions 2P 3/2 -nl. To identify Rydberg states we calculated the quantum numbers nl taking into account the quantum defect ∆n and using the expression [4,11,14]:\nn * = Ry ν i − ν SP − ν nl .\nHere n * is quantum number with quantum defect ∆n, Ry is the Rydberg constant, ν i is the ionization threshold frequency and ν SP is a frequency interval between the centers of gravity of the 2S 1/2 and 2P 3/2 states. The curve in figure 5 is an example of our observations. The dips in the fluorescence, which correspond to transition 2P 3/2 -100D, are shown. The frequency of the spectral component 2P 3/2 -100D is of 856.5727(3) THz. We have recorded also other 2P-nS and 2P-nD transitions and measured the frequencies of transitions. The observed resonances are quite broad.",

The EEL spectra of N2 have shown rather complicated structures with many of the vibrational sublevels in an excited state overlapping with other vibrational sublevels in different excited states [2]. Thus, spectral deconvolution of the measured EEL spectra are necessary in order to obtain the absolute excitation DCSs, because the energy resolution of the electron spectrometer employed in the present measurements is ~40 meV that is not enough to resolve all of the vibrational sublevels in the final electronic states. The detailed of deconvolution procedure has been reported in ref. [2]. Excitation energies and Franck-Condon factors or relative intensity ratio between initial and final vibrational sublevels were referred in the literatures [6]. The GOSs as a function of the momentum transfer squared, 2 , were transformed from the measured absolute excitation DCSs and the scattering angles at each incident energy. Fitting the experimental GOSs at higher incident energies with the Vriens formula [7], where the Born approximation is satisfied, we obtained the optical oscillator strength (OOS) and apparent Born ICS for the excitation to the b 1 Πu state. The present OOS is compared with the quasi-photon absorption measurement [8].\n\nFinally, BEf-scaled Born ICS for b 1 Πu excitation were estimated from the apparent Born ICS using the excitation and binding energies in the b 1 Πu excited state of N2 for the wide energy range. The comparison of the present BEf-scaled ICS with previous experimental data [9,10] for this excitation, shows good agreement in the low energy region.\n \n. H Tanaka, Rev. Mod. Phys. 8825004H.

While these demonstrations are not general, they have provided definitive mechanical interpretations of the two emergent thermodynamic quantities. On the contrary, there is no mechanical interpretation for the ∂U/∂N in (2). It is widely felt that a \"mechanistic\" interpretation of the chemical potential µ i has to be a probabilistic one. We hasten to mention that a living organism is sustained as a nonequilibrium system neither by a difference in T nor p, rather it is a phenomenon driven by ∆µ.

Given an energy value E, the squared value of the wave function, i.e. ψ 2 ( ) x , gives the probability of locating the particle at a certain position inside the box. Since the potential energy V(x) is zero inside the box with dimension L (V(x)=0, 0<x<L) and V(x) is infinite at the walls of the box (V(x)= ∞ , x<0 or x>L) then the Schrödinger equation (7) will be denoted by the following expression:\nψ ψ − = 2 2 1 ( ) ( ) 2 d\nx E x dx (19) The approximate solution of equation (19), i.e. the wave function, was obtained by setting the following values for the parameters of the GA: population size N=44, recombination rate pr=0.65 and mutation rate pm=0.2 (ps=0.1). The termination criteria was a maximum number of 3200 generations or a fitness value equal or greater than 0.87. For the quantum system the potential energy value was V=0 and E= 0.02. The second quantum system simulated is the quantum harmonic oscillator which allows the study of quantum oscillatory systems, e.g. the vibration of molecules. If the system to be studied is the vibration of a diatomic molecule then the classical idea of a constant spring between the two atoms is used. In such case the potential energy is\n= 2 1 ( ) 2 V x\nx . Using this potential energy value in the Schrödinger equation, we obtain the equation for the harmonic oscillator: (20) Similar to the previous experiment the approximated solution of equation (20) was obtained with the GA by choosing the same parameters and termination criteria.

In Section 2.2 we recall the definition of AR-Langevin dynamics proposed in Artemova and Redon (2012) and the alternative definition of the AR-kinetic energy with better stability properties from Stoltz and Trstanova (2016). In Section 3 we give a definition of speed-up and we introduce a formula for the total speed-up with the AR approach. In the next two sections we analyze how this formula depends on the parametrization: in Section 4 we analyze the computational complexity of the method and we express the corresponding algorithmic speed-up. This part is followed by Section 5, in which we give a relation between the restraining parameters and the percentage of restrained particles, as well as an approach for obtaining the linear approximation of the variance with respect to the restraining parameters. By combining all the necessary parts, we propose a practical strategy for the parametrization of the method and we illustrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations in Section 6.\n\n\nModified Langevin dynamics\n\nIn this section we recall the Langevin dynamics and the modified Langevin dynamics.\n\n2.1.

Theory and application to model systems.In order to obtain such a method, we shall need to introduce a constraint functional which is obeyed by instanton configurations.Following Ref. 59, we suggest using a constraint which forces the energy of the reactant and product states to be equal.We therefore propose a new theory, called golden-rule quantum transition-state theory (GR-QTST), in which the rate constant is defined by Eq. ( 2) with the ansatz\nZ ‡ ≈ β e −φ(τ * )/ ,(5)\nwhere, written in path-integral notation, 60 the effective action, φ(τ ), is defined as\ne −φ(τ )/ = e −Sτ [x(t)]/ δ(σ τ [x(t)]) Dx(t).(6)\nThe dimensionless constraint functional, σ τ [x(t)], will be defined below such that it forces the energy of the reactant and product to match for every path in the ensemble.Our derivation will rely on the idea that the method should predominantly sample the instanton trajectory and fluctuations nearby.Therefore only paths in the region around the crossing seam, including the instanton configuration itself, should be located on the constraint hypersurface, σ τ [x(t)] = 0.In this paper, we shall obtain a definition for an appropriate constraint functional which has these required properties.Rather than variationally optimizing a constraint based on centroids and ring-polymer normal modes, we shall use the physically suggestive constraint that the energy of the reactants and products must be equal.We shall show how the resulting method tends to the correct classical limit for high temperatures or heavy masses.A ring-polymer discretization, which makes the method applicable to complex multidimensional systems, will also be presented.We shall investigate a number of model systems for which exact results are available for comparison and will apply the method to atomistic simulations in future work.\n\n\nII.

The random variable D g is used to definep g (m) = p(m)/D g , where the assumption that CV g = O[{E(D g )} −γ ] in (i) of Corollary S4.1 simply assumes that the functionp g concentrates around the non-random function p(m)/ E(D g ). This assumption is quite general, and holds whenever p(m), m ∈ R ⊂ R, is bounded from below for a sufficiently large set R. For example, if R is the range of X g , then γ = 1/2. We derive expressions for E(D g ) and Var(D g ), as well as concentration results for D g , in Lemma S8.4 in Section S8.2. Assumption (ii) is technical and simply assumes that K (the number of m/z's m k ∈ X g we are considering) is small with respect to E(D g ), which is very large.",

This version of Eyring's TST rate is defined as\nπβ = ℏ β ‡ ‡ ‡ − ‡ kQ Q Q Q 1 2 e N V TST r trans rot vib (3)\nwhere the reactant partition function, Q r ,isdefined in terms of translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions from the separated reactant molecules in the usual way, and partition functions with the ‡ symbol refer to a ring polymer collapsed at the transition state configuration,\nx i,j = x j ‡ .\nThe translational partition function describing a ring-polymer of total mass NM,\nwhere M = ∑ a=1 f/3 m a ,i s πβ = ℏ ‡ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ Q NM 2 N trans 2 3/2(4)\nNote that we have chosen to normalize these ring-polymer partition functions differently from the usual expressions. The rotational contribution to the partition function, Q rot ,isdefined using the classical expression as if all the beads in the ring polymer made up a Nf/3-atom \"supermolecule\" at reciprocal temperature β N . The moments-of-inertia tensor is given by \n∑∑ = ⃗ · ⃗ − ⃗ × ⃗ ==  I mrr r r [( ) ]\nwhere r⃗ i,a is the displacement from the center of mass of the ring-polymer of the ath atom (with mass m a ) of the ith replica, and  the 3 × 3 identity matrix. The ring-polymer rotational partition function is computed using the appropriate formula [Note that the symmetry number does not appear here but instead manifests itself in a number of identical transition states.]:",

MULTIDIMENSIONAL GENERALIZATION\n\nIn this section we generalize the theory presented above to treat a system with f nuclear degrees of freedom, x = (x 1 , . . ., x f ).Each electronic state is thus described by the Hamiltonian Ĥn = f j=1 p2 j /2m + V n (x).We have mass-scaled each degree of freedom such that they have the same effective mass, m.\n\n\nA. Definition of the multidimensional theory\n\nAs before, we use generalized coordinates, q = {q 1 , . . ., q f }.The first one is defined similarly to the onedimensional case as\nq 1 (x) = V − (x + ) + ∇V − (x + ) • (x − x + ),(39)\nwhere x + = 1 2 (x + x ) and x = x(0) and x = x(τ ).The other generalized coordinates are chosen to be orthogonal to q 1 (x) and defined as\nq k (x) = v k • (x − x + ), for k = 2, . . . , f ,(40)\nwhere v k form a set of vectors orthogonal to each other as well as to ∇V − (x + ).Using the Einstein summation rule, the Lagrangian for each electronic state can be written L n = 1 2 m ẋj ẋj +",

The activation energy for the reaction H 2 +H −→ H+H 2 is defined as the difference between the energy of the H 3 saddle point and that of the well separated H atom and H 2 molecule. Density functional methods are not very accurate in calculating the activation energy. For example, DFT with an LDA functional gives H 3 as a bound molecule with a binding energy of 0.087 eV at the symmetric configuration with R 1 = R 2 = 1.795 Bohr. DFT/GGA, on the other hand, gives a barrier height of 0.152 eV at the symmetric configuration R = 1.767 Bohr [31]. The experimental barrier height is 9.7 kcal/mol= 0.420632 eV [32].\n\nUsing the AF QMC method, we studied the collinear H 3 system for three configurations with R 1 =R 2 =1.600, 1.757, and 1.900 Bohr. Table III shows the calculated barrier heights and compares these to results from DFT/GGA all-electron and pseudopotential calculations, and to results from recent DMC calculations [29]. The AE and pseudopotential DFT/GGA results are in excellent agreement with each other, a further indication of the good quality of the H pseudopotential. The DMC calculations [29] are exact in this case, through the use of a cancellation scheme [9,33], which is very effective at eliminating the sign problem for small systems. The AF QMC values are in good agreement with the exact calculated results.",

The estimates in this and previous papers from the electron terms all come con sistently low, and I wonder if the value of the heat of dissociation of normal H 2 may not be a little higher than the value found by Langmuir, or, alterna tively, the spectroscopic value of the ionisation potential of H2 might be a little under the experimental value 15-9 volts. Even so, the utmost that could be allowed in this way is probably about 5000 wave-numbers, which would still be insufficient to bridge the discrepancy. This brings us back to the difficulty that the calculated 2S term 33727 is too low to agree with the apparent identity of the final states with Dieke and Hopfield's B states. If their corresponding electronic term 37238 is used instead of 33727, the values in brackets inTable VIII are obtained. The value of the heat of dissociation 24746 is now just about as much below the value estimated from the vibration term data as these estimates from the electronic term data generally seem to run. These difficulties can be avoided by the following re-arrangement of the bands, which, however, can only be regarded as provisional at this stage. I still take the strong A band system as a 3 -> 2 electron transition, but I take out the 0B0, 0Bj, 0B2 and 0B3 bands and the C fragment and assume the jB0, jB,, -jB2 and jB3 lines to be respectively the 0B0, qBj, 0B2 and 0B3 lines of the 4 -> 2 electron transition bands. The electron levels now proposed are shown diagrammatically, but not to scale, in Diagram II. The three lowest levels are the A, B and C levels of Dieke and Hopfield, and the others give the surface of the molecule corresponding to the ionisation potential of normal H 2 and the levels for the new 0B0 Q (1) (jBq Q (1) ofTable VI) and the 0A0 Q (1) lines. The higher levels are getting near the ionisation potential limit, and it is not surprising if they are not found.In what follows the experimental value 128800 of",

Taking the derivative of the expression (70) and putting it to zero predicts a position of minimum for the ground state potential curve E t = −2.348942 Ry at R = 1.4012 a.u. while the accurate result is E t = −2.3489518628 Ry (rounded) at R = 1.4011 a.u., see [21].

Finally, taking the analytic expression for potential curve for the excited state 3 Σ + u (73), we confirm the non-existence of any vibrational or rotational bound state associated with this state in agreement with [32]. All that indicates the high quality of approximation of the potential curves for 1 Σ + g and 3 Σ + u which do not lead to any extra rovibrational bound state and do not miss any known rovibrational bound state.

Table 2 provides the first rows of the datafile. In addition to the quantum numbers involved in the transitions, we display the transition wavenumbers σ in cm −1 and their theoretical estimated accuracy (see Section 2.1), the wavelengths in micron and the resulting accuracy, the electric quadrupole transition probability A qu , the magnetic dipole transition probability A ma , the sum A = A qu + A ma giving the transition probability of the transition, the inverse of the total radiative lifetime τ of the upper energy level of the transition A tot = l A u→l in s −1 . We then report the energy terms of the upper level where the origin 0 is taken for the infinite separation of the two hydrogen atoms and the estimated accuracy in the same units. The next column gives the energy of the upper level expressed in Kelvin, when measured from the ground rovibrational state, as this value is used by astrophysicists when analysing the observed emission spectrum in order to derive excitation temperature, and the last column stands for the statistical weight of the upper level of the transition. We recall that the statistical weight of a particular level is given by (2J + 1) × g I where g I = 1 for even values of J (para levels) and g I = 3 for odd values of J (ortho levels).",

For this reason, we have also included results for the O 2 and O 3 molecules. (The AF QMC value for O 2 is taken Ref. [13].) As seen in the table, the binding energies  (PSP) and without (AE) pseudopotentials, respectively], DMC, and the present AF QMC methods. Experimental results are also shown. DFT/GGA(PSP) and the present AF QMC results were calculated using planewave basis sets with pseudopotentials. DFT/GGA(AE) is calculated using highly converged Gaussian basis sets. The DMC [34] results were also obtained using pseudopotentials. The zero point energy is removed from the experimental data [35]. All energies are in eV. Statistical errors are on the last digit and are shown in parenthesis.  [23]. The pseudopotential is of course used differently in many-body AF QMC calculations. Despite the need for NLCC at the DFT level, the oxygen pseudopotential seems to be of good quality when used in AF QMC. In all the cases, the AF QMC results are in good agreement with DMC and with the experimental values. The largest discrepancy with experiment is ≈ 0.4(2) eV with O 3 , and it is in opposite direction to the NLCC as done at the density functional level.\n\nThe need for the non-linear core correction does not indicate a failure of the frozen-core approximation, but rather is a consequence of the non-linear dependence of the spin-dependent exchange-correlation potential on the total spin-density (valence+core) in density functional theory. The QMC calculations depend only on the bare ionic pseudopotential and do not have this explicit dependence on the (frozen) core-electron spin densities. It is thus reasonable to expect the QMC results to be not as sensitive to this issue.\n\n\nIV. RESULTS USING GAUSSIAN BASIS SETS",

(1) and Eq. ( 2)) to the observed line positions.This compression is possible because the HF dimer behaves like a nearly linear molecule and for a certain vibrational and K a states, the lines of the HF dimer are grouped in regular progressions, similar in structure to the rotational series observed for diatomic or linear molecules.",

This statement is quantified by examining the ratio of Q V T (T vibr ) taken from the simulations and Q V T (T vibr ) obtained with (23). For T =300..600 K this ratio always lies between 0.4 and 1.5. These maximum and minimum are taken over the all modelling runs of section 4 including those with varied T e , p max SSH and f s V V (only points with T vibr > T +100 K are considered). For higher T the upper boundary (maximum) of the ratio above is increased: up to 2.4 for T =800 K and up to 3.4 for T =1000 K. Nonetheless, even in those cases (23) can always be taken as a good order of magnitude estimate. This is an expected result since vibrational distribution function of the lower vibrational levels in the gas discharge simulations was found to be close to Boltzmann, see an example in [15]. The populations of the upper levels near the dissociation limit deviate strongly from the Boltzmann distribution. However, since their populations are relatively small the high energy tail they form has no overwhelming impact on the total energy exchange rate.\n\nAt constant T the term (23) monotonically increases with increased E vibr so that with Q diss =0 the solution of (22) would finally arrive at some required stationary value E * vibr determined by the equality Q = Q V T (T, E * vibr ). Since only the very beginning of the conversion process is considered it can be taken that n = n M = n 0 , where n 0 is the initial value before the process starts. Then the threshold (critical) value of Q/n 2 0 which corresponds to certain E * vibr is readily found as:\nQ n 2 0 crit = R V T (T ) [E * vibr − E eq vibr (T )](25)\nThe criterion (25) has a simple physics meaning. For the vibrationally non-equilibrium process to start the rate of producing the vibrationally excited states has to be at least as fast as the rate with which vibrational energy is transferred into translationalrotational modes.",

The implemented translational partition function in the Gaussian code [127] is the partition function q = q trans , given in Table 1. In this study, q = q trans is computed as a function of T and is used to calculate the translational entropy. In addition to using vibrational modes to identify the true lowest-energy structures from transition states, we used them to compute the vibrational partition function. We considered vibrational modes ν under the harmonic oscillator approximation, and the total vibrational energy consists of the sum of the energies of each vibrational mode. In computing the electronic partition, we considered that the energy gap between the first and higher excited states is greater than k B T; consequently, the electronic partition function q = q elect is given by q elect = ω 0 . q rot , q nl rot , q = q elect and 1q = q trans were used to compute the internal energy (U), and entropy (S) contributions given in Table 2.",

Since our lattice dynamical treatment excludes intramolecular vibrations, each molecule has six vibrational degree of freedom (3 translational and 3 rotational) and the calculated C v ≈ 6R (Fig. 6). This is the expected result at room temperature, since the entire phonon density of states for almost all crystal structures falls below k B T (208.5 cm −1 at 300 K), so that there is significant thermal population of energy levels for all vibrational modes. As a consequence, heat capacity differences between polymorphs are very small (Fig. 5b): in 95% of polymorph pairs, C v differs by less than 0.46 J mol −1 K −1 .",

Quantum mechanically, of course, this system has no bound states, only metastable states, which decay unimolecularly by tunneling through the barriers. Waite and Miller 5 have calculated the energies and lifetimes (the inverse of the unimolecular decay rate) of the individual metastable quantum states of the system, and Figure 1 shows a sample of their results. Because of the C3 symmetry of the system, the calculation is carried out separately for states of A symmetry (solid circles in Figure 1), A2 symmetry (open squares), and E symmetry (open circles). The solid line in Figure 1 is the result given by standard statistical theory, i.e., microcanonical transition state theory, 6\nk(E)= 3 P[E-Vo-(n +1/2)hto*]/[2,rrhp(E)] (2.2)\nHere P is the one-dimensional tunneling probability as a function of the energy along the reaction coordinate, to*= x/g is the frequency of the \"activated complex\", p(E) the density of reactant states, and the factor of 3 is due to the three equivalent transition states. The first thing that one observes in Figure 1 is that the statistical approximation to the rate constants (i.e., Eq. 2.2) is quite good for the A1 and E states, even in the low energy region below --0.11\n\nwhere the classical mechanics is essentially completely quasi-periodic.\n\nOn closer inspection one does see some mode-specificity in the A and E states, i.e., some dispersion about the average curve, but this is more pronounced at higher rather than lower energies. To the extent that there is any trend at all, therefore, it is opposite to what one would predict on the basis of the quasi-periodic/chaotic character of the classical mechanics. The appearance of some degree of modespecificity at high energies is perhaps understandable in that even if the various degrees of freedom are strongly coupled, states with most of the energy in the reaction coordinate will decay essentially instantaneously (i.e., within one vibrational period) while those with most of the energy in inactive modes will require at least a few vibrations for the energy to flow into the reaction coordinate.",

For a given energy parameter X, its variation is determined through the following relation:\n∆ = ∑( ) − ∑( )(3)\nThe optimization of the geometries and the calculation of the frequencies of the free and interacting molecules make it possible to determine the variation of the internal energy at 0 K (∆E 0K ) and at 298 K (∆E 298K ) relative to the relationship studied. The variation of the internal energy at 298 K is a sum of the various electronic contributions of the translation, rotation, vibration, and of the internal energy at 0K through the relation:\n∆ = ∆ é + ∆ + ∆ + ∆ , + ∆(4)\nCalculations of the frequencies of the optimized molecules allow access to all the components of internal energy. In addition, E0K, commonly called ZPVE (Zero Point Vibrational Energy) corresponds to the contribution of the vibration of molecules at 0 K. It reflects the vibrational energy at the zero point induced by the normal modes of vibration of frequency i of the N nuclei at 0 K. It is defined by relation (5):\n= ∑  − =(5)\nWith 3N-6 defined as the number of normal modes of vibration of a non-linear molecule (3N-5 for a linear molecule); k the Boltzmann constant; h the Planck constant and R gas constant). This energy corresponds to the internal energy at 0 K (∆ 0 ). During a temperature rise from 0 K to T (K), it is necessary to consider the additional energy term corresponding to the population of vibrational energy levels during the temperature change. This term is defined by:\n, = ∑  ⁄ (  ( ) ⁄ ) − − = (6)\nAs for the contributions of rotation and translation, they are taken from the ideal gas approximation by this equation:\n= = −(7)\nThe variation of the internal energy ΔE 298K at 298 K can then be written:\n= é + + , −(8)",

Namely, as a shorthand notation, one introduces the orthonormal spin functions aðsÞ and bðsÞ, which depend on a spin variable s. [54,56,58] This spin variable can only assume the values þ 1 2 and À 1 2 , and the spin functions are defined such that\naðþ 1 2 Þ ¼ 1 and aðÀ 1 2 Þ ¼ 0; (9) b þ 1 2 À Á ¼ 0 and b À 1 2 À Á ¼ 1:(10)\nThen, the wavefunction of Eq.

It is important to realize that the spin functions a and b are merely a way of expressing two-component wavefunctions, in which the spin variable s has the role of labeling the different components. Spin-independent operators are then given by a one-component operator acting only on the parts of the wavefunction that depend on the spatial coordinate r, while the spin opera-torsŝ x ,ŝ y ,ŝ z , andŝ 2 act only on the parts depending on the spin variable s.",

This is due to that the neutron orbital contribution is zero and the proton orbital contribution (for the orbitals with a low orbital momentum) is small in comparison with its spin contribution. Neglecting the spin-orbit interaction leads to conservation of the total spin which is equal to the average spin of the neutron above the unpolarized core σ (0) z .

The expressions apply to general spin centers and arbitrary excitation geometry (Voigt, Faraday, and intermediate). They work for linear and circular polarized as well as unpolarized excitation, and for crystals and powders. The expressions are based on the concept of the (complex) magnetic transition dipole moment vector. Using the new theory, we determine the parities of ground and excited spin states of highspin (S = 5/2) Fe III in hemin from the polarization dependence of experimental ground state EPR line intensities. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a spectroscopic technique that yields unique information on structural [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], magnetic [8][9][10] and electronic properties [11][12][13] of paramagnetic states in material systems ranging from proteins to nanomagnets and semiconductors. In addition, EPR methods are increasingly used for controlled manipulation of spin systems, which may form the basis of spin quantum computing [14][15][16][17]. Experimental design, interpretation, prediction and control of the latter require general theoretical tools to calculate EPR transition energies and probabilities. These properties are determined by the spin center under study and the choice of the experimental parameters.\n\nIn a standard EPR experiment, linearly polarized lowfrequency microwave (mw) radiation is coupled into a resonator exposed to a static magnetic field B 0 such that the radiation magnetic field component B 1 (t) of the ensuing standing wave is perpendicular to B 0 . With a linear detector, the measured EPR spectral intensity is proportional to the power absorbed by the sample, which in turn is proportional to the quantum mechanical transition rate. For this standard geometry, compact expressions for the EPR transition rate can be found in the literature [18,19]. Analytical expressions for a single spin without fine or hyperfine interactions are known [20][21][22][23][24][25].",

Unlike the presented Zeeman case, we cannot assume the magnetic field to be oriented along the Z-axis.In fact, this magnetic field obeys a function dependent on the position of particle 2 and its intrinsic magnetic moment.Also, it is important to note that now the term magnetic moment refers to the complete vector magnitude.When we evaluate the product of both the magnetic moment and the magnetic field of a spin particle, we arrive at the following expression:\nE = J ⃗ m 1 ⃗ m 2 .\nIn other words, the energy contribution is proportional to the product of both magnetic moments, being J the interaction amplitude.",

The expressions apply to general spin centers and arbitrary excitation geometry (Voigt, Faraday, and intermediate). They work for linear and circular polarized as well as unpolarized excitation, and for crystals and powders. The expressions are based on the concept of the (complex) magnetic transition dipole moment vector. Using the new theory, we determine the parities of ground and excited spin states of highspin (S = 5/2) Fe III in hemin from the polarization dependence of experimental ground state EPR line intensities.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a spectroscopic technique that yields unique information on structural [1-7], magnetic [8-10] and electronic properties[11][12][13]of paramagnetic states in material systems ranging from proteins to nanomagnets and semiconductors. In addition, EPR methods are increasingly used for controlled manipulation of spin systems, which may form the basis of spin quantum computing[14][15][16][17]. Experimental design, interpretation, prediction and control of the latter require general theoretical tools to calculate EPR transition energies and probabilities. These properties are determined by the spin center under study and the choice of the experimental parameters.In a standard EPR experiment, linearly polarized lowfrequency microwave (mw) radiation is coupled into a resonator exposed to a static magnetic field B 0 such that the radiation magnetic field component B 1 (t) of the ensuing standing wave is perpendicular to B 0 . With a linear detector, the measured EPR spectral intensity is proportional to the power absorbed by the sample, which in turn is proportional to the quantum mechanical transition rate. For this standard geometry, compact expressions for the EPR transition rate can be found in the literature[18,19]. Analytical expressions for a single spin without fine or hyperfine interactions are known[20][21][22][23][24][25].However, the limitation to a resonator, linear mw polarization and orthogonal orientation between static and oscillating magnetic fields restricts the versatility of EPR experiments. Recently, experimental setups that go beyond these limitations have become more prevalent. Novel non-resonant beam EPR setups explore very broad field (up to 30 T) and frequency (up to THz) ranges.

The numerical proportionality between the two magnitudes is simply calculated to be P ≈ c10 −6 g CD .

The results of these measurements are both consistent with zero and their weighted average gives d e = −1.4(3.9)×10 −29 e cm, which sets a 90% confidence interval of |d e | < 7×10 −29 e cm. A stronger limit (or a nonzero measurement of d e ) is necessary to guide Standard-Model extensions.\n\nMeasurements of d e are performed by watching electron spins precess within a magnetic field, and measuring any change in this precession rate due to the presence of an electric field. The angle through which they precess is given by\nφ = (gµ B B ± d e E eff )T / ,(1)\nwhere gµ B is the magnetic moment of the electron, B is the applied magnetic field, E eff is the effective electric field that the electron experiences inside the molecule or molecular ion, and T is the time that the electron is precessing.

The accuracy of d e from such a measurement, assuming the measurement is statistically limited by shot-noise, is\nδd e = 2E eff √ N T ,(2)\nwhere N is the total (integrated) number of electrons whose precession is detected. The value of E eff is between 10 and 100 GV/cm for most polar molecules (and polar molecular ions) used for electron electricdipole-moment studies, and therefore greatly improved measurements can only be obtained by large improvements in N or in T .

Figure 5a shows the circular dichroism signal in Mn L 2,3 XANES measured at 10 K temperature and 5 T external magnetic field. Labels µ + and µstand for the directions of the photon helicity.

In the experiment, the Stokes parameter S3 was equal to 0.9. The XMCD signal was measured for the B values from 0T to 5T with step 0.2T and the saturated value was obtained by fitting with a Brillouin function (see value of 0.02n h .

Instead one has to use correction factors to determine m spin value 64 or compare the results of the sum rules analysis for experimental and simulated spectra.

Below we will obtain such constraints for a simple case of the spherical shell model of a nucleus. This model describes well the nuclei of 129 Xe and 199 Hg. The former contains a neutron in the s 1/2 state and the latter contains a neutron in the p 1/2 state above the closed shells. Although the nuclei in the atoms have a valence neutron it is possible to deduce also the proton contribution to the total nuclear spin using the information on the nuclear magnetic moments. If we assume that the magnetic moment of the nucleus is composed entirely from the spin magnetic moment of the valence neutron and spin magnetism of polarized nuclear core, then As is seen from Table VIII the contribution of the proton spin into the total nuclear spin of 129 Xe is as high as 30%, and therefore the proton couplings C p T and C p P (see the equations below Eq.

Note that the simple shell model of a nucleus considered above is hardly applicable to the nuclei of 171 Yb, 211 Rn, and 225 Ra. The problem is that the nucleus of 171 Yb is quadrupole-deformed and the nuclei of 211 Rn and 225 Ra are octupole-deformed.

This term is usually represented, according to Kurland and McGarvey [42], as the dipolar interaction between the magnetic moment of the nucleus µ I = γ I I and the average induced electron magnetic moment µ el = χ·B 0 µ 0 :\nH = − µ 0 4π 3( γ I I k k · r)( µ el · r) r 5 − γ I k · µ el r 3 = − γ I B 0 4πr 5 I k k · 3r(r · χ) − r 2 χ k (3)\nwhere the nuclear spin operator I is quantized along the direction k of B 0 (I = I k k), γ I is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio, and r is the metal-nucleus distance. This relation was obtained following a semiempirical treatment [36,45], and has been only recently validated by a complete quantum chemical treatment [46]. The dipolar interaction has an orientational dependence and can be described by a rank-2 tensorial quantity, which is called shielding tensor:\nσ PC = − 1 4πr 5 3r(r · χ) − r 2 χ .(4)\nDifferent orientations of the nucleus-metal vector with respect to the magnetic field direction thus result in different values of shift and, if interconversion between different orientations is impeded, such as in a solid, all different shift values of all nuclei will contribute to the spectrum, generating the so-called powder pattern ( Figure 1). calculations can thus be used to provide a physical model for the interpretation of the experimental data.\n\nIn NMR, the magnetic susceptibility leaves its marks on several observables: mainly in pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), but also on relaxation and in other field-dependent effects.",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

Fixing the normal mode coordinates Q y = 0.0 a.u. and Q s = 3.2 a.u. (the equilibrium values for the ground state), the potential energies are calculated in C 2v symmetry, when Q x varies from −1.2 a.u. to 0.6 a.u. The computed potential energy surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3 with symbols connected by filled lines. The ab initio calculations reveal a global minimum on the 1 2 B 2 state (in C 2v symmetry) at the obtuse geometry Q s = 3.2 a.u. and Q x = −0.4 a.u.. This corresponds to a bond length of 2.77Å and an angle of 73 • . The potential energy surface of the 1 2 A 1 electronic state has a local minima at the acute geometry Q s = 3.2 a.u. and Q x = 0.3 a.u., corresponding to a bond length of 3.08Å and a bond angle of 51 • . The minima of the two lowest electronic states are separated by the conical intersection at the totally symmetric configuration. When the symmetric stretch normal mode coordinate Q s is varied, a conical intersection seam at Q x = Q y = 0 a.u. is formed. The dashed lines in Fig. 3 show the potential energy surfaces of the four lowest states of Li 3 computed by Ehara et al. [22] using a MCSCF/MRCI approach with a similar active space in the MCSCF calculation as the one used by us, but with a smaller reference space in the subsequent MRCI calculation. The potential energy surfaces displayed in Fig. 3 are shifted in energy to obtain zero at the equilibrium structure. The energy of the equilibrium structure is E 0 = −22.40196023 H in our calculation, while Ehara and co-workers reported a value of E 0 = −22.357736 H. We obtain a very good agreement with the potential energy surfaces calculated by Ehara for the lowest two electronic states of Li 3 . Our excitation energies for the 1 2 B 1 and 1 2 A 2 are larger than the ones obtained by Ehara et al. [22].",

Two minima can be found on the surface, separated by a sharp cusp at the conical intersection between the lowest two electronic states. When Q y is nonzero, the C 2v symmetry is broken and the system has C s symmetry. Fig. 5 shows the contour plot of the lowest adiabatic potential energy surface of Li 3 when the symmetric normal mode coordinate Q s is fixed at the equilibrium value 3.2 a.u.. The potential intersection located at the totally symmetric configuration has an energy of 0.00235 H relative to the minima of the potential. The heights of the barrier and the relative energy of conical intersection to the minima of the potential were reported as 0.000337 H and 0.00231 H, respectively by Ehara et al. [22]. Meyer and co-workers [33] found barrier heights of 0.000329 H and an energy of the conical intersection of 0.00229 H also by performing ab initio MRCI calculation.",

[1] the convergence of the total energy with respect to the size of the ADHO basis has been verified along the fission path up to the second fission barrier. Since here we consider a region with even larger deformation, we will extend this check and examine the basis truncation up to the third fission barrier. The energy curve of 226 Th is calculated up to β 20 = 2.7 assuming axial symmetry and employing ADHO bases with N f = 16, 18, 20, and 22 shells. In Ref. [1] it has been shown that a basis with N f = 20 produces very accurate results for the height of the second barrier, around which the triaxial deformation is also important. In Fig. 1 one notices that nonaxial shapes do not influence the height of the third barrier, and so the axial symmetry is imposed and we mainly focus on the deformation region beyond the second barrier. Figure 2 shows that the height of the third barrier is lowered when N f increases from 16 to 20. The results obtained with N f = 20 and 22 are almost identical, and this means that N f = 20 should present an sufficient choice. We notice that for the hyperdeformed minimum around β 20 ∼ 1.6, results obtained with N f = 18, 20, and 22 are difficult to differentiate.\n\n\nB. Two-dimensional PES's\n\nWe consider light even-even actinides 232,234,236,238 U and 226,228,230,232 Th. Figure 3 displays the self-consistent MDC-RMF energy surfaces in the (β 20 , β 30 ) plane, calculated with the relativistic functionals PC-PK1 and DD-ME2. The deformation parameters are restricted to the range β 20 ∼ (1.0, 3.0) and β 30 ∼ (0.3, 1.5), in which the second barrier together with the third minimum and the third barrier, if they exist, are located. Note that the contour interval for the PES's plotted in Fig. 3 is 0.5 MeV.",

All the data reported in the original publication for the isolated CH − partner are therefore correct and accurate.\n\nThe ground electronic state of the 3-atom system PES has been calculated at the MRCI level up to the CBS expansion but without including BSSE correction since the latter had very minor effects on the computed total energy values. Within the usual 2D representation of the radial and angular variables of the (R, θ) Jacobi space, the former is centered in the c.o.m. of the diatomic anion and the latter angle rotated from the H atom side to the C atom side from 0°to 180°. The radial range covered from R = 1.59 Å to R = 31.75 Å, with steps 0.102 Å for a total of 295 radial points. The angle values were a total of 19 with steps of 10°. The total number of computed raw points was therefore around 6000.\n\nThe pictorial view in Figure 2 reports the spatial distribution of the correct ground electronic state interaction potential in 3D, where the target anion is placed along the X-coordinate, the latter being centered at the center-of-mass of the diatom, with the He approaching the H atom at 0°. We clearly see that, at the equilibrium geometry, the presence of the excess negative change largely around the C atom provides the stronger interaction with the neutral, closed-shell He atom on that side. Specifically, we found two global minima of the PES were for θ = 170°and for θ = 20°, while the saddle point was located at θ = 80°with a much reduced depth of about −10 cm −1 . The deeper attractive well on the C-end of the target is around −50 cm −1 , while the one on the H-end of the molecule is around −30 cm −1 . These values turn out to be smaller than those found in the earlier calculations which had chosen the incorrect root, thus indicating that we expect, on the whole, a markedly weaker interaction of the electronic ground state of the anion with the impinging He atom.",

From the graph in Figure 2, I roughly estimate that the SB minimum is around 2.4 eV at the xMCQDPT2 level of theory, while the D0 state is (again rough estimate) at 3.5 eV. Thus, unless I made a mistake in reading these numbers, the energy gap is 0.9 eV. With a probe energy of 1.55 eV, the ejected electron would have a kinetic energy of 0.65 eV. However, in the text the authors write (line 154) that the energy is 0.87 eV. While the latter would indeed be very close to the experimental result of ~0.8 eV, the 0.65 estimate is a littel farther off, possibly even beyond the expected error of the underlying theoretical method? Unless I made a mistake, I suggest the authors to check their numbers and, if needed, adjust the text and/or figure.\n\nIt is in fact very difficult to accurately determine where the peak maximum will be. In normal photoelectron spectroscopy, the difference between the energy minima (as suggested by the referee) will yield the adiabatic detachment energy. However, this does shift if we include the energy imparted into the many modes of the system. This means that one does not go from the bottom of one well to the same vertical point on the neutral. For this reason, we have taken essentially the \"maximum\" kinetic energy that we expect to see, rather than the peak which is difficult to determine. The peaks of the photoelectron spectra for all the intermediates is always shifted to the red of these maximal kinetic energies, which is what one would expect. We do not want to claim that the \"static\" calculations can accurately predict the spectrum and have opted instead for the approach we have used as a relatively fair consideration of the energetics. We have added some text to emphasise this.\n\nAlso, please include the structures, and energies as SI, as well as the CASSCF profiles. This would facilitate comparison to previous (and future) works.\n\n\nWe have done this.",

(ii) a and b, are obtained by fitting the basin shape function as a function of E IS , S(E IS ), using Eq.9; see Sec.IV E. (iii) c 2 and c 3 are calculated by using Eq.17; see Sec.IV D.

For these four U isotopes the second saddle point is located at β 20 ∼ 1.2-1.3 and β 30 ∼ 0.3-0.4. With the increase of β 20 the total binding energy decreases monotonically along the lowest fission path. Different results are obtained with DD-ME2, as shown in Fig. 3(b). With the exception of 236 U, we find a third minimum on the PES's of 232,234,238 U. The minimum is rather shallow for 232 U and 234 U and very pronounced for 238 U. These results are very similar to those obtained in recent calculations based on the macroscopicmicroscopic model [24][25][26]67] and the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model [30].\n\nIn the case of Th isotopes, both PC-PK1 and DD-ME2 predict a pronounced third minimum for 226 Th with a depth of 2-3 MeV. As the neutron number N increases, both the energy of the third minimum and the height of the third barrier decrease and the depth of the third well is also reduced. This trend has also been predicted in the macroscopic-microscopic model calculations [26]. For 230 Th only a shallow minimum of depth less than 1 MeV occurs. The third minimum completely disappears for 232 Th when calculated with PC-PK1 and it is very shallow with the functional DD-ME2. Figure 3 clearly shows that the functional DD-ME2 (lower panel) predicts more pronounced third minima when compared to those obtained with PC-PK1 (upper panel). In addition to the lowest fission path on which we focus in this work, there are other possible paths along which there are more shallow minima and saddle points. It would be worthwhile to investigate these fine structures in a future study.\n\n\nC. Pairing strength",

By analyzing the resulting energy curves along the lowest static fission path, the energies of the second barrier, the third minimum, and the third barrier have been determined. In calculations with the functional DD-ME2, a third potential barrier is predicted in all Th nuclei and 238 U. The third well in 230,232 Th is very shallow with a depth of less than 1 MeV, whereas the third well in 226,228 Th and 238 U is rather deep. The functional PC-PK1 predicts a third barrier only in 226,228,230 Th. Therefore we note that the occurrence of a third barrier in constrained mean-field calculations of PES's of actinides depends on the specific choice for the energy density functional.\n\nInsights into the origin of the third minimum on the PES have been obtained by examining the neutron and proton deformed single-particle levels of 226 Th near the Fermi surface along the static fission path, as functions of the quadrupole deformation β 20 . We have shown that the formation of the third minimum is facilitated by the appearance of the Z = 90 proton energy gap in the region β 20 ≈ 1.5 and β 30 ≈ 0.7 and this gap originates from several pairs of single-proton states in the vicinity of the Fermi surface.\n\nFIG. 1 .\n1(Color online) Energy curve of 226 Th computed with the MDC-RMF model using the functional PC-PK1.

Their weighted mean, indicated by the dashed line, is 378 809 479.24 (30) MHz where the statistical uncertainty of 300 kHz corresponds toσ = σ/ √ N , N being the number of independent measurements, which we took to be the number of measurement sets recorded on different days rather than the number of individual measurements (i.e., 6, as indicated by the different symbols in Fig. 4(b), rather than 39).\n\nThe systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis are summarized in Table I and sum up to 224 kHz, dominated by the uncertainty resulting from the possible deviations from a statistical intensity distribution of the unresolved hyperfine structure of the 56p1 1 ← GK(1, 1) line (Line-shape Model entry in Table I). After subtraction of the photon recoil shift of 160 kHz, our final result for the 56p1 1 ← GK(1, 1) interval is shown in Table I.

The rateequation model furthermore includes the BBR temperature, which we estimate to be 300 K with an uncertainty of about 5 K, caused by day-to-day variations of the temperature in the laboratory, and by a possibly elevated temperature of the trap electrodes due to rf current dissipation. If we compare the ν 0,fit values after inserting BBR temperatures of 300 K and 305 K, we obtain a difference of 5 kHz, which we include in the uncertainty budget. Micromotion also causes a shift: by comparing the ν 0,fit value from scenario 1a that includes micromotion (amplitude 11(4) nm) with a the result of a version with zero micromotion, a shift of 0.055 (20) MHz is obtained. Finally, we investigated the effect due to the uncertainty of the spin coefficient E 4 (see Eq. (1)), which is estimated to be 50 kHz [16]. Comparing fits with E 4 values differing by 50 kHz we find that this has a negligibly small effect of ∼1 Hz on the result for ν 0 . 1 a This is a shift with respect to a scenario with a zero effect of q or micromotion, and serves to illustrate the size of the effect. The shift itself, however, is absorbed in the value of ν 0,fit . b The value of these shifts is actually nonzero but negligibly small, and therefore ignored here.  Table 4 shows the error budget, with a total uncertainty of 0.41 MHz that corresponds to 1.1 ppb. This result differs 0.21 MHz (0.6 ppb) from the more accurate theoretical value, ν th = 383,407,177.150(15) MHz [2].

Transition intensities were computed using nuclear motion program DVR3D, 28 the non-adiabatic model of Polyansky and Tennyson 14 with other parameters chosen as in our previous studies of H + 3 VIS transition frequencies. 9,23 Since the major uncertainty in the calculations is given by the fit of the DMS, we used the extremes of plausible fits to estimate uncertainties in our calculated intensities; these uncertainties (see Table 1) are systematic rather than statistical errors and roughly represent a 1-σ confidence level.",

The first method is to vary the binding energy for the descriptor (C, H, and O) on Ni(111) in RMGs' input file, which is described in (12).\n∆E AX Ni = ∆E AX Pt + γ (∆E A Ni + δE A Ni ) − ∆E A Pt(12)\nThe second approach is to assume that the DFT derived binding energy for the descriptor is correct and the heat of formation of the adsorbate in the Pt(111) database is varied, resulting in\n∆E AX Ni = (∆E AX Pt + δE AX Pt ) + γ ∆E A Ni − ∆E A Pt(13)\nThe first method would automatically account for the correlation between the heats of formation, which means that e.g., if the binding energy of C * is increased, the resulting values for CO * and HCO * are increased, which agrees with the d-band model. S19 Whereas the first method is easy to implement and accounts for correlation, it has a severe drawback because the uncertainty is scaled with the LS relation. If we perturbed the binding energy with ± 0.3 eV, C * would have an uncertainty of ± 0.3 eV because γ = 1 but the physisorbed species would not be uncertain at all since γ = 0. This premise is not valid. When we decrease the binding energy of C by 30 kJ mol −1 , the CO binding energy will be decreased by the same amount. On top of that, there can be a small uncertainty but this will describe the general trend. Therefore, we choose the latter method within this work. Figure S11 illustrates the quasi-random sampling and the correlation between the adsorbates according to the LS relations. The three descriptor species H * , C * , and O * are uncorrelated and the quasi-random numbers fill the entire uncertainty range. The uncertainty domain for the C-O parameter space is illustrated in Figure S11a, which shows the uniform distribution inside the boundaries of [-0.3 eV, 0.3 eV]",

Geometry optimization was performed on a (5 × 5 × 1) kpoints at 50 Ry and the single point was calculated for a (7 × 7 × 1) mesh at 63 Ry. An ensemble of 2000 exchange-correlation functionals was created around the BEEF-vdW model parameters using the BEEFensemble command to calculate the uncertainty distribution of the species binding energy self-consistently. The results are displayed in Figure S12. Figure S12a shows a scatter plot of the probability distribution of the C * and O * pair of binding energies. The uncertainty in C * binding energies is significant with values from −8.5 eV to −5 eV. The red box inside Figure S12a-c shows the uniform [-0.3 eV, 0.3 eV] boundary around the average, which was used within this work. This comparison clearly shows that the applied uniform sampling distribution of this narrow uncertainty range stands to reason. We even underestimate the uncertainty in the DFT-derived binding energies for C * and O * . There is a correlation between the C * and H * binding energy. S19,S25 Figure S12d-f displays the uncertainty correlation of C * /CH * , C * /CO * , and O * /OH * . In agreement with the results from a-c, the binding energies of the adsorbed molecules show considerable scatter, in the range of up to 2 eV for CH * . As expected from the linear scaling relations, there is a strong correlation between C * and CH * as well as O * and OH * . Interestingly, the uncertainty in CH * is significant and in the same order as the uncertainty in C * . The correlation between C * and CO * is not that strong, which is related to the unique structure of CO * .

[25]. Dissociation probabilities of D 2 colliding with Pt(1 1 1) for comparison with molecular beam experiments on the same system [15] were calculated with the QCT method [36] in an implementation described in Ref.

Earlier calculations predicted that even for the lighter H 2 molecule the QCT method yields dissociative chemisorption probabilities for hydrogen dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) that are in excellent agreement with quantum dynamics results [24]. For the best comparison with experiments, the calculations include Monte-Carlo averaging over the velocity distributions of the hydrogen beams, and Boltzmann averaging over the rovibrational states of hydrogen, as fully described in Ref. [29]. An important assumption made in our calculations is that the molecular beams used in the experiments of Luntz et al. [15] are quite similar to hydrogen beams produced in experiments of Juurlink and co-workers [41], and we used the beam parameters presented in table 3 of Ref.\n\n[30] to simulate D 2 beams in our work on the basis of this assumption. \n\n\nComputational details",
