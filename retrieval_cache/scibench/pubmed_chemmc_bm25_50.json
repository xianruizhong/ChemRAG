The correlation between the de Broglie wavelength related to the thermal motion and the potential barrier width and height is reported. The stochastic jumps of light atoms (hydrogen, deuterium) between two equilibrium sites A and B (identical geometry) occur via different pathways; one pathway is over the barrier (classical dynamics), and the other one is through the barrier (tunneling). On the over-the-barrier pathway, there are no obstacles for the de Broglie waves, and this pathway exists from high to low temperatures up to 0 K because the thermal energy is subjected to the Maxwell distribution and a certain number of particles owns enough energy for the hopping over the barrier. On the tunneling pathway, the particles pass through the barrier, or they are reflected from the barrier. Only particles with the energy lower than barrier heights are able to perform a tunneling hopping. The de Broglie waves related to these energies are longer than the barrier width. The Schrödinger equation is applied to calculate the rate constant of tunneling dynamics. The Maxwell distribution of the thermal energy has been taken into account to calculate the tunneling rate constant. The equations for the total spectral density of complex motion derived earlier by us together with the expression for the tunneling rate constant, derived in the present paper, are used in analysis of the temperature dependence of deuteron spin-lattice relaxation of the ammonium ion in the deuterated analogue of ammonium hexachloroplumbate ((ND4)2PbCl6). It has been established that the equation CpTtun = EH (thermal energy equals activation energy), where Cp is the molar heat capacity (temperature-dependent, known from literature), determines directly the low temperature Ttun at which the de Broglie wavelength, lambdadeBroglie, related to the thermal energy, CpT, is equal to the potential barrier width, L. Above Ttun, the lambdadeBroglie wavelength related to the CpT energy is shorter than the potential barrier width and not able to overcome the barrier. The activation energy EH equals 7.5 kJ/mol, and therefore, the Ttun temperature for deuterons in ((ND4)2PbCl6 is 55.7 K. The agreement between the potential barrier width following from the simple geometrical calculations (L = 0.722 A) and de Broglie wavelength at Ttun (L = 0.752 A) is good. The temperature plots of the deuteron correlation times for (ND4)2PbCl6 reveal comparable values of the correlation times of the tunneling, (tau(T)), and over-the-barrier jumps (tau(H)) near 34.8 K. Matsuo, on the basis of the molar heat capacity study, found the first-order phase transition at this temperature.",

However, the TICC approach is difficult for systems with a large number of channels because of its steep numerical scaling laws. Here, a recently proposed quantum wave packet (WP) approach for solving adiabatic reactive scattering problems at low collision energies is extended to include nonadiabatic transitions. To impose the outgoing boundary conditions, the total scattering wavefunction is split into three parts, the interaction, the asymptotic, and the long-range regions. Each region is associated with a different set of basis functions, which could be optimized separately. In this way, an extremely long grid can be used to accommodate the characteristic long de Broglie wavelengths in the scattering coordinate.

UGED is a promising method to investigate molecular dynamics in the gas phase because electron pulses can probe the structure with a high spatial resolution. Until recently, however, it was not possible for UGED to reach the relevant timescale for the motion of the nuclei during a molecular reaction. Using MeV electron pulses has allowed us to overcome the main challenges in reaching femtosecond resolution, namely delivering short electron pulses on a gas target, overcoming the effect of velocity mismatch between pump laser pulses and the probe electron pulses, and maintaining a low timing jitter. At electron kinetic energies above 3 MeV, the velocity mismatch between laser and electron pulses becomes negligible. The relativistic electrons are also less susceptible to temporal broadening due to the Coulomb force. One of the challenges of diffraction with relativistic electrons is that the small de Broglie wavelength results in very small diffraction angles. In this paper we describe the new setup and its characterization, including capturing static diffraction patterns of molecules in the gas phase, finding time-zero with sub-picosecond accuracy and first time-resolved diffraction experiments. The new device can achieve a temporal resolution of 100 fs root-mean-square, and sub-angstrom spatial resolution. The collimation of the beam is sufficient to measure the diffraction pattern, and the transverse coherence is on the order of 2 nm. Currently, the temporal resolution is limited both by the pulse duration of the electron pulse on target and by the timing jitter, while the spatial resolution is limited by the average electron beam current and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detection system. We also discuss plans for improving both the temporal resolution and the spatial resolution.",

Molecular dynamics simulations, within the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, require the definition of a force field. The ability to calculate the forces on the nuclei in bio-systems when autoionization takes place seems to rely on an understanding of radiative damages in RNA and DNA arising from the release of slow moving electrons which have long de Broglie wavelengths. This work addresses calculation of the real forces on the nuclei moving on the CPES.

It was proved that the force on the nuclei of the metastable molecules is time independent although the probability to detect metastable molecules exponentially decays. The classical force is obtained from the transformed Schrödinger equation when ℏ=0 and the Schrödinger equation is reduced to the classical (Newtonian) equations of motion.

First, we use path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to estimate the thermodynamic/static properties of our model quantum fluid, i.e. low-density 4He at 10 K. With PIMC we obtain the experimental equation of state, the single-particle mean kinetic energy, the single-particle density matrix and the single-particle momentum distribution of this system at low densities. We show that our PIMC results are in full agreement with experimental data obtained with deep inelastic neutron scattering at high momentum transfers (D. Colognesi, C. Andreani, R. Senesi, Europhys. Lett., 2000, 50, 202). As expected, in this region of the 4He phase diagram, quantum effects modify the width of the single-particle momentum distribution but do not alter its Gaussian shape. Knowing the exact values of density, pressure and single-particle mean kinetic energy for our model quantum fluid, we investigate the limitations of the semiclassical FH effective potentials. We show that commonly used 'short-time' approximations to the high-temperature density matrix due to Feynman and Hibbs can only be applied in a very limited range of the 4He phase diagram. We found that FH effective potentials reproduce the experimental densities of 4He at 10 K for Lambda/a &lt; 0.45 (Lambda = 2.73 A denotes the thermal de Broglie wavelength, a = rho(-1/3) is the mean nearest-neighbor distance in the fluid and rho denotes fluid density). Moreover, semiclassical FH effective potentials are able to correctly predict the single-particle mean kinetic energy of 4He at 10 K in a very limited range of fluid densities, i.e.Lambda/a &lt; 0.17. We show that the ad hoc application of the semiclassical FH effective potentials for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of dense liquid-like para-hydrogen (para-H2) adsorbed in nanoporous materials below 72 K is questionable.",

The charge carrier required for the emissions is determined to be an accelerating electron driven by an ATP-induced reverse electron transfer. The radial velocity component, the emission trajectory, of the moving charges traversing helical protein structures in a cyclotron-type mechanism is proposed to be imposed by the ferromagnetic field components of the iron in the iron-sulfur proteins.

The spin pairs of the protons or deuterons of the methyl group perform a complex motion consisting of three component motions. Two of them involve mass transportation over the barrier and through the barrier. They are characterized by k((H)) (Arrhenius) and k((T)) (Schrödinger) rate constants, respectively. The third motion causes fluctuations of the frequencies (nomega(I)+/-omega(T)) and it is related to the lifetime of the methyl spin at the energy level influenced by the rotor-bath interactions. These interactions induce rapid transitions, changing the symmetry of the torsional sublevels either from A to E or from E(a) to E(b). The correlation function for this third motion (k((omega)) rate constant) has been proposed by Müller-Warmuth et al. The spectral densities of the methyl group hindered rotation (k((H)), k((T)) and k((omega)) rate constants) differ from the spectral densities of the proton transfer (k((H)) and k((T)) rate constants) because three compound motions contribute to the complex motion of the methyl group. The recently derived equation [Formula: see text] , where [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are the fraction and energy of particles with energies from zero to E(H), is taken into account in the calculations of the spectral densities. This equation follows from Maxwell's distribution of thermal energy. The spectral densities derived are applied to analyse the experimental temperature dependencies of proton and deuteron spin-lattice relaxation rate in solids containing the methyl group. A wide range of temperatures from zero Kelvin up to the melting point is considered. It has been established that the motion characterized by k((omega)) influences the spin-lattice relaxation up to the temperature T(tun) only. This temperature is directly determined by the equation C(p)T=E(H) (thermal energy=activation energy), where C(p) is the molar heat capacity. Probably the cessation of the third motion is a result of the de Broglie wavelength related to this motion becoming too short. As shown recently, the potential barrier can be an obstacle for the de Broglie wave. The theoretical equations derived in this paper are compared to those known in the literature.",

This study reports on the electron slowing-down spectra and mean energy per ion pair, the W-value, in water for monoenergetic electron and photon sources calculated with Geant4-DNA. These quantities depend on electron energy, but not on spatial or angular variables which makes them a good choice for testing the model of energy transfer processes. The spectra also have a scientific value for radiobiological modeling as they describe the energy distribution of electrons entering small volumes, such as the cell nucleus. Comparisons of Geant4-DNA results with previous studies showed overall good agreement. Some differences in slowing-down spectra between Geant4-DNA and previous studies were found at 100 eV and at approximately 500 eV that were attributed to approximations in models of vibrational excitations and atomic de-excitation after ionization by electron impact. We also found that the high-energy part of the Geant4-DNA spectrum for a 1 keV electron source was higher, and the asymptotic high-energy W-value was lower than previous studies reported.",

An off axis and focus intensity investigation.\nOptical elements based on Fresnel zones are used in a range of applications, from X-ray telescopy to microscopy and recently also in the manipulation of de Broglie matter waves. In 1992 Beynon and co-workers presented a binary Gabor type zone plate (henceforth referred to as the Beynon Gabor zone plate). Because this zone plate has no higher order foci, it is in principle a very attractive candidate for focusing of de Broglie matter waves and in some cases X-rays. So far the Beynon Gabor zone plate investigations presented in the literature have concentrated on the intensity distribution along the optical axis and in the focal plane. Here we present a detailed numerical investigation of the Beynon Gabor zone plate, including an investigation of the off-optical axis, off focal plane intensity distribution for point source illumination. We show that at integer fractions of the focal length, the beam becomes nearly toroidal (doughnut-shaped). This offers potentially interesting new possibilities for de Broglie matter wave and X-ray optics, for example in STED-like applications. We further show that the increased intensity at the focal point predicted in the literature for a particular Beynon Gabor zone plate transmission function configuration is an artifact due to the lack of sampling nodes. We support our calculations with experimental measurements in the visible light range, using a Beynon Gabor zone plate fabricated with electron beam lithography. ",

The energy storage of the linear electron transfer process in photosynthesis, of cyclic photosystem (PS) I, and possibly of PSII was determined by selection of excitation wavelength and of flash interval. At 695 nm excitation, a rather large cyclic PSI energy storage of 0.68 +/- 0.04 eV/quantum of energy at 8 ms after a 1-mus flash was obtained. This energy remained the same at flash intervals of 0.35 to 60 s and was independent of the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. We tentatively assign this energy to the ferredoxin-NADP-reductase-ferredoxin and oxidized cytochrome b(6)/f complexes. An efficient distribution of energy between cyclic and linear systems is obtained with the simple assumption that the turnover time of the cyclic system is slower than that of the linear system. The energy storage of linear electron flow was determined by 655 nm excitation of Chlorella with a short flash interval of 0.35 s per flash. It was calculated to be 0.50 +/- 0.03 eV/hv, close to that expected for oxygen and NADPH formation. The energy storage of PSII is determined by excitation of Chlorella at 655 nm with a long flash interval of 60 s per flash. It was calculated to be 1.07 +/- 0.05 eV/hv, consistent with the energy storage being in S-states and the secondary electron acceptor of PSII with a calculated redox energy of 1.03 eV/hv. In the presence of 1 mum 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, the calculated energy storage in PSII is still significant, 0.53 +/- 0.04 eV/hv.

Using the technique of multiple collision expansions we provide a first-principle analytical calculation of the time-dependent autocorrelation function for the wave packet in the high-energy diffraction regime, in which the particle's de Broglie wavelength, while being small compared to the size of the scatterers, is large enough to prevent the formation of geometric shadow over distances of the order of the particle's free flight path. The hard-disk or hard-sphere scattering system must be sufficiently dilute in order for this high-energy diffraction regime to be achievable. Apart from the overall exponential decay, the autocorrelation function exhibits a generally complicated sequence of relatively strong peaks corresponding to partial revivals of the wave packet. Both the exponential decay (or escape) rate and the revival peak structure are predominantly determined by the underlying classical dynamics. A relation between the escape rate, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the counterpart classical system, previously known for hard-disk billiards, is strengthened by generalization to three spatial dimensions.

DFB (distributed feedback) laser diode with its small size, low power consumption, long service life, narrow linewidth, tunable wavelength has become the main choice of the TDLAS system. Performance of laser tuning characteristics is a key factor restricting TDLAS's measuring performance. According to TDLAS oxygen measuring system's working requirements, a simple experimental method was used to test and analyze tuning characteristics such as wavelength current, power current and wavelength temperature of a 764 nm DFB laser diode in the system. Nonlinear distortion of tuning curves was obvious, which affects oxygen measuring accuracy. The laser spectra's characteristics such as narrow linewidth, high side mode suppression ratio and wide wavelength tuning range are obvious, while its wavelength-current tuning curve with a tuning rate of about 0.023 nm x mA(-1) is not strictly linear. The higher the temperature the greater the threshold current, the PI curve is not strictly linear either. Temperature tuning curve is of good linearity, temperature-wave-length tuning rate keeps constant of about 0.056 nm/DEG C. Temperature tuning nonlinearity can be improved by high temperature control accuracy, and current power nonlinearity can be improved by setting the reference light path. In order to solve the wavelength current tuning nonlinear problems, the method of DA controlling injection current was considered to compensate for non-linear wavelength current tuning according to DFB laser diode tuning mechanism and polynomial fitting of test results. In view of different type of lasers, this method needs only one polynomial fitting process before the system's initial work. The compensation scheme is reasonable and the realization is simple, what's more, it does not affect the measuring process. The experiments prove that XI curve's linear fit residuals are less than 1 μm after compensation, far less than those of before compensation 22 pm, the compensation effect is obvious, which provided a basis for various oxygen parameters' TDLAS measuring and inversion.",

The simulation shows that the maximum optical trapping force of the 120 nm particle is 38.7 pN/mW, and that of the 30 nm particle is 10.8 pN/mW. It is calculated that the trapping threshold power of the 120 nm particle is 35.3 µW, and that of the 30 nm particle is 41.6 µW. Because the width of the slot is 100 nm, when the input power is between 35.3 µW and 41.6 µW, only the 120 nm particle can be trapped in the upper cladding of the slotted-PCNC. When the input power is greater than 41.6 µW, the 120 nm particle is still trapped in the upper cladding of the slotted-PCNC, while the 30 nm particle is trapped inside the slot of the slotted-PCNC. By properly controlling the input power and the direction of flow in the microfluidic channel, the sorting of particles can be achieved. In addition, trapping of the particles causes different redshifts of peak wavelengths. Thus, the proposed slotted-PCNC can detect particle trapping and sorting by monitoring the resonant wavelength shifts. What is the most important, compared with previous reported single particle trapping work, is that the proposed work can realize both trapping and sorting. Therefore, provided with the ultra-compact footprint and excellent performance, the proposed slotted-PCNC shows great potential for a multifunctional lab-on-a-chip system.",

Here, the release of CE-induced electrostatic charges on a dielectric surface under photon excitation is studied by varying the light intensity and wavelength, but under no significant raise in temperature.

Systematical simulations were first carried out to optimize the cavity parameters of a short-wavelength fiber oscillator at 1007 nm, and subsequently, the performance of the 1007 nm fiber laser in tandem pumping was simulated and compared with that of the 1018 nm fiber laser pumped results.

This \"UV hazard function\" is cited in many safety standards, and UV survey instruments are designed to have a fitting spectral response. The UV hazard function was developed to preclude acute injury and minimize chronic effects but was based upon the best available experimental data of that time. With more experimental data and easier computer methods available today, the action spectrum can be re-examined. Therefore, the published experimental thresholds for damage to the cornea and skin were studied as a function of wavelength to revalidate this action spectrum. A key step relates to the proper consideration of the spectral bandwidth used to determine each threshold and the assignment of an effective wavelength for each narrow-band. We methodically analyzed the uncertainties introduced by employing 1-, 5-, and 10-nm spectral bandwidths by comparing published biological threshold data. The errors introduced by using broader bandwidths become enormous within the critical spectral region of 300-320 nm. By convoluting the threshold data and weighting them with trial, or reference, action spectra, it is possible to determine the wavelengths in each bandwidth that are contributing most of the effective dose and correct the experimental action spectrum.

This makes it extremely difficult to obtain substantial absorption from thin metal films, in contrast to 2D materials such as graphene. Luckily, however, from a practical point of view, metal conductivity is drastically reduced as the film becomes sub-100 nm, to make it a race between the thinnest possible metal thickness experimentally achievable vs the conductivity reduction.

However, conventional methods for depositing patterned metals such as lift-off or etching leave behind contamination. This contamination has been demonstrated to deteriorate the interesting properties of graphene such as its carrier mobility.

Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone.

The authors estimated longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA), modulation transfer functions (MTFs), and the impact of interactions between chromatic and monochromatic aberrations on retinal image quality. Ten patients (age: 68.4 ± 3.21 years) were measured in two experiments: (1) Hartmann-Shack wave aberrations at five visible wavelengths (480 to 700 nm) and (2) best subjective focus at each wavelength. Objective and psychophysical LCAs were obtained from the Zernike defocus and psychophysical best focus, respectively. MTFs were calculated for the closest wavelengths to the peak sensitivity of the three cone classes (S [480 nm], M [555 nm], and L [564 nm]) using the measured aberrations and chromatic difference of focus. The degradation produced by LCA was estimated as the visual Strehl ratio for green divided by the visual Strehl ratio for blue and red. The root mean square for higher order aberrations (HOAs) ranged from 0.0622 to 0.2084 µm (700 nm, 4.3-mm pupil). Monochromatic visual Strehl ratio was above 0.35 in all patients. LCA was 1.23 ± 0.05 diopters (D) (psychophysical) and 0.90 ± 0.11 D (objective). Visual Strehl ratio decreased by a factor ranging from 1.38 to 3.82 on chromatic defocus from green to blue. There was a significant correlation between native visual Strehl ratio and the degradation produced by LCA (ie, visual Strehl<sub555</sub/visual Strehl<sub480</sub). The Clareon IOL compensates for spherical aberration, with postoperative wave aberrations dominated by astigmatism and other HOAs, being highly subject-dependent.

Its dependence on the configuration and refractive index is investigated numerically. A micro-shell with the outer and inner radii of 5 and 2.5 µm and the refractive index of 1.5 can focus the incident light of 400 nm wavelength 2.7 µm away from the micro-shell flat surface, although the photonic jet intensity decreases to 25.8% compared to the solid hemisphere. Meanwhile, the photonic jet length of the micro-shell under the incident light of 400 nm and 1000 nm wavelengths are 1.7 µm and 4.3 µm, respectively, because its hollow core region tends to reduce the angle variation of the Poynting vectors in the photonic jet. With the long working distance and long photonic jet, the micro-shell could be used to scan over a sample to obtain a large area image when coupled with a conventional microscope, which is especially useful for the samples with the rough surfaces.

PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRC stem cells (CRCSCs) display high self-renewal, metastatic properties, high activity of PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways with chemoresistant phenotypes. Recently, RGD peptide (containing Arg-Gly-Asp motif)-based therapy of solid tumor cells has attracted much attention. However, little is known whether this method can target self-renewal capacity, key effectors of PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways such as metastasis-driver gene CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes with caspase-3 reactivation in CRCSCs overexpressing RGD-dependent integrins. The sea anemone Actinia fragacea produces a water-soluble RGD-peptide fragacea toxin C (FraC) suggesting the possible activity of FraC against PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs. Recombinant FraC was expressed via pET-28a(+)-FraC in E. coli and purified through affinity chromatography followed by performing SDS-PAGE and hemolytic activity assay. Next, PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant HCT-116 cells that serve as an attractive model for CRCSCs were treated with FraC. Thereafter, cell numbers, viability, proliferation, LDH activity, cytotoxicity index, CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes expression, self-renewal capacity, caspase-3 activity with apoptosis were evaluated. Caspase-1, -2, -3,…, -9 sequences were analyzed for RGD-binding motifs. FraC sequence and structure were also evaluated by bioinformatics software. FraC altered cellular morphology to round shapes and disrupted cell connections. 48 h post-treatment with 0.056- to 7.2 μM FraC resulted in 12 %-99 % and 8 %-97.6 % decreases in cell numbers and viabilities respectively and increased LDH activity by 0.2 %-66.7 % in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the cytotoxicity index showed that FraC induces significant toxicity on HCT-116 cells compared to PBMCs and Huvec cells. FraC dramatically decreased the expression of CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes Bmi-1, Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog followed by remarkable decreases in self-renewal capacity ranged from 91- to 0 colonies per well for 0.056- to 3.6 μM FraC after 2 weeks. Caspase-3 was found to contain an RGD-binding motif and its activity increased with increasing FraC concentrations followed by apoptosis induction. Potential RGD-binding motifs for FraC were also found in caspase-1, -7, -8 and -9. Unique advantages of FraC peptide, such as low molecular weight, water solubility, high sensitivity of CRC stem-like cells with more selective toxicity to this compound, targeting tumor cell membrane and self-renewal capacity along with the modulation of CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes as upstream and downstream effectors of undruggable PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways may open up avenues for FraC peptide-based therapy of PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs with lower toxicity on healthy cells.",

It is shown that in the [Y(bpy)(3)](m) series the central ion possesses an invariant +III oxidation state and that the three successive one-electron redox processes that comprise the series are solely ligand-based, yielding three (bpy(•))(1-) radical anions in the neutral complex through to three diamagnetic dianions (bpy(2-))(2-) in the trianion. The same is true for the [Ti(bpy)(3)](n) series where the neutral complex contains 3(bpy(•))(1-) and the trianion 3(bpy(2-))(2-) anions. Hence, the central ion always possesses a central Ti(III) (d(1)) ion that intramolecularly antiferromagnetically couples to any (bpy(•))(1-) ligands present. In contrast, the central metal ions in the series [Zr(bpy)(3)](p) and [Hf(bpy)(3)](p) always possess a +IV oxidation state; hence, the dianions contain three (bpy(2-))(2-) ligands and yield an S = 0 ground state. The electronic structures of the neutral Nb and Ta analogues possessing S = (1)/(2) ground states are best described as [Nb(IV)(bpy(2-))(2)(bpy)(0))](0) and [Ta(V)(bpy(•))(bpy(2-))(2)](0), and their S = 0 monoanions as [Nb(IV)(bpy(•))(bpy(2-))(2)](1-) and [Ta(V)(bpy(2-))(3)](1-). The central metal ion in the Nb series maintains a +IV oxidation state, while in the Ta series the central metal ion displays a +V oxidation state throughout.",

L represents a generic designation of the tetradentate macrocycle 2,12-dimethyl-3,7,11,17-tetraazabicyclo[11.3.1]-heptadeca-1(17),2,11,13,15-pentane where the true oxidation level is not specified; (L(Ox))(0) represents its neutral form, (L )(1-) is the one-electron reduced pi radical anion, and (L(Red))(2-) is the singlet (or triplet) diradical dianion of this ligand. It is shown that the above series consists of square planar [Ni(III)(L(Ox))](3+) (S = 1/2), [Ni(II)(L(Ox))](2+) (S = 0), [Ni(II)(L )](1+) (S = 1/2), [Ni(II)(L(Red))](0) (S = 0). The structure of [Ni(II)(L(Red))](0) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The electrochemistry of [Ni(II)(L(Ox))](PF(6))(2) in the presence of hard chloride anions shows the presence of trans-[Ni(III)(L(Ox))Cl(2)](+), the EPR spectrum of which has been recorded and calculated, and of trans-[Ni(II)(L(Ox))Cl(2)](0) (S = 1). Upon further reduction the coordinated Cl(-) ligands dissociate and [Ni(II)(L )](1+) and [Ni(II)(L(Red))](0) are successively generated. Similarly, in the presence of good pi-acceptor ligands such as CO or P(OCH(3))(3) the following five-coordinate, square base pyramidal species are found to be stable: [Ni(I)(L(Ox))(X)](1+) (S = 1/2), [Ni(I)(L )(X)](0) (S = 0, 1) (X = CO, P(OCH(3))(3)). As shown by EPR spectroscopy in the work of J. Lewis and M. Schröder, J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans., 1982, 1085, the monocations consist of a central nickel(i) ion (d(9), S(Ni) = 1/2). These spectra have been faithfully reproduced by the calculations. The neutral complexes [Ni(I)(L )(X)](0) are singlet or triplet diradicals comprising a central nickel(i) ion and a pi radical anion (L )(1-). Interestingly, six-coordinate species trans-[Ni(L)(X)(2)](n) (n = 2+, 1+, 0) are computationally not stable in the gas phase or in solution. No experimental evidence has been found for their existence.",

The sequences are H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)(l)-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)(m)-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)(n)-OH, where (l, m, n) = (9, 0, 0), (4, 1, 4), (3, 2, 4), (3, 3, 3), (1, 7, 1) and (0, 9, 0). All peptides showed triple-helical CD spectra at room temperature and thermal transition curves. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis showed that peptide H-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)(9)-OH is a trimer. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that replacement of Pro residues with 3(S)Hyp residues decreased the transition enthalpy, and the transition temperature increases by 4.5 degrees C from 52.0 degrees C for the peptide with no 3(S)Hyp residues to 56.5 degrees C for the peptide with nine 3(S)Hyp residues. The refolding kinetics of peptides H-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)(9)-OH, H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)(9)-OH and H-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)(9)-OH were compared, and the apparent reaction orders of refolding at 10 degrees C were n = 1.5, 1.3 and 1.2, respectively. Replacement of Pro with 3(S)Hyp or 4(R)Hyp has little effect on the refolding kinetics. This result suggests that the refolding kinetics of collagen model peptides are influenced mainly by the residue in the Yaa position of the -Gly-Xaa-Yaa- repeated sequence. The experiments indicate that replacement of a Pro residue by a 3(S)Hyp residue in the Xaa position of the -Gly-Xaa-4(R)Hyp- repeat of collagen model peptides increases the stability, mainly due to entropic factors.",

It is shown by chromium K-edge and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) that the oxidation state of the central Cr ion in each compound is the same (+III, d(3)) and that all one-electron redox processes are ligand-based, involving one, two, or three ligand pi radical monoanions.

It is suggested that the neutral complexes [Cr(dithiolene)(3)](0) S = 0 possess octahedral rather than trigonal prismatic CrS(6) polyhedra. Three ligand pi radicals (S(rad) = (1)/(2)) couple antiferromagnetically to the central Cr(III) ion (d(3)) yielding the observed diamagnetic ground state.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry in conjunction with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations allowed us to assign the electronic transitions in the redox series, revealing mostly ligand-centered electron transfer: [(acac)(2)Ru(III)(L(0))](+) ⇌ [(acac)(2)Ru(III)(L(•-))] ⇌ [(acac)(2)Ru(III)(L(2-))](-)/[(acac)(2)Ru(II)(L(•-))](-), and [(bpy)(2)Ru(III)(L(•-))](2+)/[(bpy)(2)Ru(II)(L(0))](2+) ⇌ [(bpy)(2)Ru(II)(L(•-))](+) ⇌ [(bpy)(2)Ru(II)(L(2-))](0).

The reactions of Fe(+) with N(2)O, N(2) and O(2) were studied in order to benchmark this new technique. Extending measurements of the rate coefficient for Fe(+) + N(2)O from 773 K to 185 K shows that the reaction exhibits marked non-Arrhenius behaviour, which appears to be explained by excitation of the N(2)O bending vibrational modes. The recombination of Fe(+) with CO(2) and H(2)O in He was then studied over a range of pressure and temperature. The data were fitted by RRKM theory combined with ab initio quantum calculations on Fe(+).CO(2) and Fe(+).H(2)O, yielding the following results (120-400 K and 0-10(3) Torr). For Fe(+) + CO(2): k(rec,0) = 1.0 x 10(-29) (T/300 K)(-2.31) cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1); k(rec,infinity) = 8.1 x 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). For Fe(+) + H(2)O: k(rec,0) = 5.3 x 10(-29) (T/300 K)(-2.02) cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1); k(rec,infinity) = 2.1 x 10(-9) (T/300 K)(-0.41) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The uncertainty in these rate coefficients is determined using a Monte Carlo procedure. A series of exothermic ligand-switching reactions were also studied at 294 K: k(Fe(+).N(2) + O(2)) = (3.17 +/- 0.41) x 10(-10), k(Fe(+).CO(2) + O(2)) = (2.16 +/- 0.35) x 10(-10), k(Fe(+).N(2) + H(2)O) = (1.25 +/- 0.14) x 10(-9) and k(Fe(+).O(2) + H(2)O) = (8.79 +/- 1.30) x 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), which are all between 36 and 52% of their theoretical upper limits calculated from long-range capture theory. Finally, the role of these reactions in the chemistry of meteor-ablated iron in the upper atmosphere is discussed. The removal rates of Fe(+) by N(2), O(2), CO(2) and H(2)O at 90 km altitude are approximately 0.1, 0.07, 3 x 10(-4) and 1 x 10(-6) s(-1), respectively.

The hyperfine structure in l=0-3 Rydberg states of H2 located below the X 2Sigmag+(v+=0,N+=1) ground state of ortho H2+ has been measured in the range of principal quantum number n=50-65 at sub-MHz resolution by millimeter wave spectroscopy following laser excitation to np and nd Rydberg states using a variety of single-photon and multiphoton excitation sequences. The np1(1), nd1(1), and the nf1(0-3) Rydberg states were found to be metastable and to have lifetimes of more than 5 micros beyond n=50. Members of other series, such as the nd1(2), nd1(3), and the np1(0) series, were found to have lifetimes of more than 1 mus. Local perturbations induced by low-n Rydberg states belonging to series converging on rovibrationally excited levels of H2+ reduce the lifetimes in narrow ranges of n values. The hyperfine structure is strongly dependent on the value of the orbital angular momentum l. In the penetrating s and p states at n approximately 50 the exchange interaction dominates over the hyperfine interaction and the levels can be labeled by the total electron spin angular momentum quantum number S (S=0 or 1). In the less penetrating d and f Rydberg states, the hyperfine interaction between the core nuclear and electron spins is larger than the exchange interaction and the Rydberg states are of mixed singlet and triplet character. A procedure based on the Stark effect and on the systematic analysis of selection rules and combination differences was developed to determine the orbital and the total angular momentum quantum numbers l and F and to construct an energy map of p and f Rydberg levels between n=54 and 64 with relative positions of an accuracy of better than 1 MHz. Multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) was extended to treat the hyperfine structure in molecular Rydberg states and was used to analyze the observed hyperfine structure of the p and f Rydberg states of H2. The frame transformation between the Born-Oppenheimer channels described by the angular momentum coupling scheme (abetaJ) and the asymptotic channels described by the (e[bbetaS+]) coupling scheme was derived and enables an elegant treatment of all intermediate coupling cases. Purely ab initio quantum defect theory reproduced the experimentally determined positions to within 40 MHz for the p levels and 13 MHz for the f levels. By slight adjustments of the quantum defect functions and their energy dependences and by consideration of the p-f interaction, of the singlet-triplet splittings of the f levels, and of the departure of the ionic levels from pure coupling case (bbetaS+), the agreement between theory and experiment could be improved to 600 kHz. By comparing the results of MQDT calculations of the hyperfine structure of f Rydberg levels with those of coupled equations calculations, the frame transformation approximation of MQDT was shown to be accurate to within 300 kHz. The extrapolated ionic hyperfine structure of the X 2Sigmag+(v+=0,N+=1) ionic level corresponds to the ab initio prediciton of Babb and Dalgarno [Phys. Rev. A 46, R5317 (1992)] within the experimental error.",

Values of kcat and Km for each substrate have been obtained from kinetic measurements at pH 8.00 and 25.0 degrees C.

Although it is clear that the N-terminal is the most variable sequence in this protein family, the role of their hydrophobic segment in not fully understood. Here we show a comparison of StI, StII, EqtII, and FraC activities with that of their respective N-terminal synthetic peptides. The hemolytic and permeabilizing activity of the peptides reproduce qualitatively the behavior of their respective parental proteins and are particularly related to the hydrophobicity of the corresponding 1-10 segment. Furthermore, the dendrogram analysis of actinoporins' N-terminal sequence allows relating differences in alignment with differences in activity among the four toxins. We have also evaluated the penetration depth of the N-terminal segment of StI and StII by using Trp-containing peptide-analogs. Our data suggest that the N-terminus of StII is more deeply buried into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer than that of StI. We hypothesize that the highest activity of StII could be ascribed to a larger hydrophobic continuum, an uninterrupted sequence of non-charged mainly hydrophobic amino acid residues, of its N-terminus promoting a highest ability to partially insert in the membrane core. Moreover, as we show for four related peptides that a higher hydrophobicity contributes to increase the activity, we reinforce the notion that this property must be taken into account to design new potent membranotropic agents.",

The one-electron reduction of [Zn(gma)] and [Ni(gma)] is strictly ligand centered and differences in the physical properties of [Zn(gma(*))](-) and [Ni(gma(*))](-) are readily accounted for in terms of a model that features enhanced back-bonding from the metal to the gma LUMO in the case of [Ni(gma(*))](-). In the case of [Fe(gma)(PH(3))], [Fe(gma)(py)], and [Fe(gma)(CN)](-) an electron transfer from the iron to the gma LUMO takes place to give strong antiferromagnetic coupling between an intermediate spin Fe(III) (S(Fe) = 3/2) and (gma(*))(3)(-) (S(gma) = 1/2), yielding a total spin S(t) = 1. Broken symmetry DFT calculations take properly account of this experimentally calibrated electronic structure description. By contrast, the complexes [Fe(gma)(PH(3))(2)] and [Fe(PhBMA)] feature closed-shell ligands with a low-spin Fe(II) (S(Fe) = S(t) = 0) and an intermediate spin central Fe(II) (S(Fe) = S(t) = 1), respectively. The most interesting case is provided by the one-electron oxidized species [Fe(gma)(py)](+), [Fe(gma)I], and [Fe(gma)(CN)]. Here the combination of theory and experiment suggests the coupling of an intermediate spin Fe(III) (S(Fe) = 3/2) to the dianionic ligand (gma)(2)(-) formally in its first excited triplet state (S(gma) = 1) to give a resulting S(t) = 1/2. All physical properties are in accord with this interpretation. It is suggested that this unique \"excited state\" coordination is energetically driven by the strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the metal and the ligand, which cannot occur for the closed-shell form of the ligand.",

Part 1 of this series was devoted to isotropic heptanuclear clusters; herein, we discuss the nuclearity and the structural anisotropy of nickel(II) derivatives. By changing either the stoichiometry, the nature of the terminal ligand, or the counterion, it is possible to tune the nuclearity of the polynuclear compounds and therefore to control the structural anisotropy.

In total, 188 Botrytis isolates were obtained from flowers and fruit collected from the states of Maryland (n = 35), Virginia (n = 38), North Carolina (n = 46), South Carolina (n = 41), and Georgia (n = 28). Only 13 of these were fruit samples and came from South Carolina (n = 5) and Georgia (n = 8). B. fragariae made up 35.1% of the entire collection, and composed close to half of the Botrytis population in North Carolina (43.4%), South Carolina (61.0%), and Georgia (42.9%). One isolate of B. mali was also found, and the rest of the isolates were B. cinerea (sensu lato). B. fragariae and B. cinerea were found coexisting in 11 fields, while other field samples consisted of only B. fragariae (n = 3) or only B. cinerea (n = 10) isolates. B. fragariae isolates with resistance to one or more fungicides were found, and resistance profiles differed from those of B. cinerea, in that no resistance to cyprodinil (FRAC 8) or boscalid and other FRAC 7 botryticides was detected. We detected B. fragariae resistance to the active ingredients thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, fludioxonil, and fenhexamid. We also detected B. fragariae isolates with resistance to up to four chemical classes of fungicides, though most isolates were resistant to one or two chemical classes. In conclusion, isolates of the newly detected species B. fragariae were commonly found on strawberry flowers in the Mid-Atlantic United States, and have developed resistance to many of the most commonly used botryticides. Though the relevance of this species to pre- and postharvest fruit infections is unknown, fludioxonil applications may give this species a competitive advantage over B. cinerea. Controlling this fungus with FRAC 7 fungicides may be an effective way of limiting its spread in strawberry fields.",

Aryl and aralkyl Y moieties deviate from these correlation lines. KappSS also depends on the hydrophobicity of Y but no quantitative correlation is obvious.

Intracellular recordings were made in brain slices from 63 neurons in layers 2-4 in bicuculline-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Twenty-nine cells (n = 25 from pigmented guinea pigs and 4 from cats) were taken through a complete series of control and test protocols to evaluate the covariance hypothesis. Some (n = 7) cells that were taken through the complete experimental protocols were also filled intracellularly with biocytin. Compound postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were evoked by low-frequency (0.2-1.0 Hz), weak (20% of threshold intensity) stimulation of the cortical white matter and/or intracortical sites in layers 2-3. 3. In one series of experiments we paired PSPs with imposed coincident depolarizing (S+) or hyperpolarizing (S-) pulses (mean +/- 2.8 nA for 50-80 ms) of the postsynaptic neuron (n = 54 PSPs; &gt; 1 pairing protocol was often run on an individual cell). Controls consisted of analyzing the same number of S+ or S- pairings but with long temporal delays [called fixed delay pairings (FDPs)] between the test pathway stimulation and the onset of the intracellular current pulse (120 ms) and pseudopairings (PP) consisting of evoked PSPs and delivery of intracellular current injection pulses in a phase-independent manner. Twenty-one of 54 PSPs subjected to pairing were significantly modified by the protocol. The S+ protocol significantly (P &lt; 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) increased the peak amplitudes of 8 of 22 PSPs (+20 to +55%); the S- protocol significantly decreased the peak amplitudes of 13 of 32 PSPs (-15 to -88%), whereas the FDP and PP protocols generally did not cause significant changes in the PSPs (0% and 4%, respectively). Significant changes in PSPs persisted in most cases for 10-20 min. 4. Another series of experiments consisted of evaluating for the same cell the effects of evoking a PSP from one stimulation site without concomitant postsynaptic activation and alternately evoking a PSP from the other stimulation site with S+ or S- pairing (n = 25 PSPs).

By utilizing method of Linearization, local dynamics along with topological classifications about fixed points have been investigated. Existence of prime period and periodic points of the model are also investigated. Further for $3\\times3$ model, we have explored the occurrence of possible bifurcations about each fixed point, that gives more insight about the under consideration model. It is proved that the model cannot undergo any bifurcation about $P_{000}(0,0,0)$ and $P_{x0z}\\left(\\frac{d}{e},0,\\frac{a}{b}\\right)$, but the model undergo P-D and N-S bifurcations respectively about $P_{0y0}\\left(0,\\frac{r-1}{r},0\\right)$ and $P_{0yz}\\left(0,\\frac{d}{f},\\frac{rf-f-dr}{cf}\\right)$.

Further, theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations. We have also presented the bifurcation diagrams and corresponding maximum Lyapunov exponents for the $3\\times3$ model. The computation of the maximum Lyapunov exponents ratify the appearance of chaotic behavior in the under consideration model. Finally, the hybrid control strategy is applied to control N-S as well as P-D bifurcations in the discrete-time model.",

Methods Cross-sectional study to CML chronic-phase patients treated with imatinib 400 mg daily or nilotinib 400 or 800 mg daily for ≥12 months. The exclusion criteria were therapy discontinuation within 29 days (imatinib) or 8 days (nilotinib) before the sampling day. Blood samples were drawn 1 h before the next dose.

The most studied atinoporins are sticholysins I and II (StI/StII) from Stichodactyla helianthus, equinatoxin II (EqtII) from Actinia equina, and fragaceatoxin C (FraC) from Actinia fragacea. Their N-terminal sequences encompassing residues 1-30 seem to be the best candidates for pore formation. This segment comprises an amphipathic α-helix preceded by a more or less hydrophobic segment, depending on the toxin, of around 10 amino acid residues. Although it is clear that the N-terminal is the most variable sequence in this protein family, the role of their hydrophobic segment in not fully understood. Here we show a comparison of StI, StII, EqtII, and FraC activities with that of their respective N-terminal synthetic peptides. The hemolytic and permeabilizing activity of the peptides reproduce qualitatively the behavior of their respective parental proteins and are particularly related to the hydrophobicity of the corresponding 1-10 segment. Furthermore, the dendrogram analysis of actinoporins' N-terminal sequence allows relating differences in alignment with differences in activity among the four toxins. We have also evaluated the penetration depth of the N-terminal segment of StI and StII by using Trp-containing peptide-analogs. Our data suggest that the N-terminus of StII is more deeply buried into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer than that of StI. We hypothesize that the highest activity of StII could be ascribed to a larger hydrophobic continuum, an uninterrupted sequence of non-charged mainly hydrophobic amino acid residues, of its N-terminus promoting a highest ability to partially insert in the membrane core. Moreover, as we show for four related peptides that a higher hydrophobicity contributes to increase the activity, we reinforce the notion that this property must be taken into account to design new potent membranotropic agents.",

Evaluation of the isothiocyanates for their capacity to produce wash-resistant inhibition of mu, delta, and kappa sites in vitro was performed using rat and guinea pig brain membranes. None of the compounds was able to irreversibly inhibit binding of [3H]bremazocine to guinea pig and rat brain membranes (depleted of functional mu and delta receptors by pretreatment with acylating agents BIT and FIT).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 1 and 2 performed at 100(2) K reveal a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment at the iron centers, as a result of the intramolecular pi-pi interactions between C(6)F(5) rings. The electronic structures of 1 and 2 were unambiguously determined by a combination of (57)Fe Mössbauer and electronic spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility measurements, X-ray crystallography, and DFT calculations.

Two observers independently analyzed the presence of bronchiectasis and associated abnormalities in group-1 and group-2 lung images.

Both kinetic and thermodynamic compounds can exist as endo or exo isomers, depending on the reciprocal orientation of the allyl cuspids.

Moreover, diffractometric modeling agrees with the presence of both isomers in the solid state even when the alkyl substituent is an achiral alkyl group. In a chloroform solution, endo and exo isomers undergo isomeric conversion owing to the apparent allyl rotation that follows the Pd-N bond rupture in the (η(3)-allyl)Pd(N^N) frame of kinetic compounds or in the (η(3)-allyl)Pd(N^S) frame of thermodynamic compounds.

Synthesis and evaluation of 1-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)-N,N-dialkylcyclohexylamines at dopamine uptake and phencyclidine binding sites.\nWe previously reported (J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 1188-1193) that changes to the ring size of the piperidine and cyclohexyl rings of the high-affinity and selective dopamine (DA)-uptake inhibitor 1-[1-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (BTCP, 2) caused different, and in some cases opposite, changes in affinity for sites on the DA transporter labeled by [3H]BTCP and [3H]-cocaine. These results suggested that the radioligands label different sites on the transporter. In the present study, we extend the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of BTCP by studying the binding characteristics of a series of N,N-disubstituted 1-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexylamines 7-32 at the DA transporter. Cyclohexyl was selected as opposed to other ring sizes since it corresponds to BTCP. The binding results indicate that a considerable degree of structural variation is permitted for the N-substituents, while still retaining nanomolar affinity for sites on the transporter (studied in rat forebrain homogenates). As observed in our earlier study, the differential effects of structural change on binding to sites on the DA transporter labeled by these radioligands suggests that they are different and distinct binding sites. In general, and up to a point, increasing the size and lipophilicity of the N substituents resulted in improvements in binding but appeared to have less predictable effects on DA-uptake inhibition (as measured in rat brain synaptosomes). The binding of these compounds to sites labeled by [3H]BTCP appeared to correlate best with IC50 for DA-uptake inhibition. To our surprise, the monoalkyl N-substituted BTCP derivatives displayed the highest affinity for the DA transporter of all the compounds in this series. For example, the N-(cyclopropylmethyl) derivative 14 displayed IC50's = 23 nM ([3H]cocaine) and 1 nM ([3H]-BTCP), and the N-butyl derivative 10 showed IC50's = 60 nM ([3H]cocaine) and 0.3 nM ([3H]-BTCP). BTCP exhibited IC50's of 39 nM ([3H]cocaine) and 5 nM ([3H]BTCP) in this assay. The observation that N,N-dibutyl derivative 31 exhibited low ratios of IC50 [3H]cocaine/IC50 DA reuptake and IC50 [3H]BTCP/IC50 DA reuptake suggests that it may be a potential candidate for cocaine antagonism studies. The effect of additional amino, amide, and aromatic groups on the N-substituents was examined, and the results are discussed. The failure of all of the compounds in this series to bind phenycyclidine receptors coupled with their high affinity and range of selectivities at the DA transporter identifies many of them as useful tools for probing the mode of action of BTCP at this site.",

The corresponding 2-(1-alkynyl) derivatives of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and Ado are used as reference compounds. Binding studies demonstrated that the activities of 2-alkynylAdos were slightly increased for the adenosine A(1) receptor and slightly decreased for both A(3) and A(2B) subtypes compared to those of their corresponding NECA derivatives, whereas the A(2A) receptor affinities of the two series of nucleosides were similar. The presence of a methyl group on N(6) of the 2-alkynyladenosines, inducing an increase in affinity at the human A(3) receptor and a decrease at the other subtypes, resulted in an increase in A(3) selectivity. In particular, 2-phenylethynyl-N(6)-methylAdo (8b) showed an A(3) affinity in the low nanomolar range (K(i)(A(3)) = 3.4 nM), with a A(1)/A(3) and A(2A)/A(3) selectivity of about 500 and 2500, respectively. These findings motivated us to search for the preparation of new selective radioligands for the A(3) subtype; hence, a procedure to introduce a tritiated alkylamino group in these molecules was carried out. As far as the potency at the A(2B) receptor, the type of 2-alkynyl chain and the presence of the ethylcarboxamido group on the sugar seem to be very important; in fact, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynylNECA [(S)-PHPNECA, 1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM] proved to be one of the most potent A(2B) agonist reported so far. On the other hand, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyl-N(6)-ethylAdo (9e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.73 microM) showed a significantly increase of potency at the A(2B) subtype in comparison with the N(6)-methyl, N(6)-isopropyl, and the unsubstituted adenosine derivatives, although it resulted in being less potent than (S)-PHPNECA (1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM). These observations suggest that the introduction of an ethyl group in the N(6)-position and an ethylcarboxamido substituent in the 4'-position of (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyladenosine could lead to a compound endowed with high potency at the A(2B) receptor.",

All structures were characterized at least at the RCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z level of theory. Both differences and similarities were observed between SCl(n) and our previous results on SF(n-1)Cl and SF(n). Several minimum structures that exist in SF(n) and SF(n-1)Cl are absent in SCl(n). For example, the optimized structure of SCl(2)((3)A(2)) is a transition state in C(s) symmetry, whereas the analogous states are minima in SF(n) and SF(n-1)Cl. Second, we found a continuation of a trend discovered in the SF(n-1)Cl series, where Cl substitution has a destabilizing effect that weakens bonds with respect to SF(n). This effect is much stronger in the SCl(n) series than it is in the SF(n-1)Cl series, which is why SCl(2) is the most stable observed species in the family and why SCl(4), SCl(5), and SCl(6) are unstable (SCl(n-2) + Cl(2) additions are endothermic for n = 4-6).",

This has allowed us to  define the correct electronic structures of these early transition metal tris(2,2'-bipyridine) complexes. It is shown that in the [Y(bpy)(3)](m) series the central ion possesses an invariant +III oxidation state and that the three successive one-electron redox processes that comprise the series are solely ligand-based, yielding three (bpy(•))(1-) radical anions in the neutral complex through to three diamagnetic dianions (bpy(2-))(2-) in the trianion. The same is true for the [Ti(bpy)(3)](n) series where the neutral complex contains 3(bpy(•))(1-) and the trianion 3(bpy(2-))(2-) anions. Hence, the central ion always possesses a central Ti(III) (d(1)) ion that intramolecularly antiferromagnetically couples to any (bpy(•))(1-) ligands present. In contrast, the central metal ions in the series [Zr(bpy)(3)](p) and [Hf(bpy)(3)](p) always possess a +IV oxidation state; hence, the dianions contain three (bpy(2-))(2-) ligands and yield an S = 0 ground state.

Iglesias, et al. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 123, 247-252] was shown by equilibrium dialysis to be bivalent for 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside. Upon binding to the lectin, this ligand showed a difference absorption spectrum with two maxima (at 322 and 336 nm) of equal intensity (delta epsilon = 1.2 X 10(3) M-1 cm-1). A similar spectrum with a comparable value of delta epsilon was obtained with 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminide. Binding of methyl-alpha-D-galactoside, lactose, and N-acetyllactosamine all produced small but equally intense protein difference spectra with a maximum (delta epsilon = 2.8 X 10(2) M-1 cm-1) at 291.6 nm. Upon binding of N-dansyl-D-galactosamine to the lectin, there was a fivefold increase in fluorescence intensity of this ligand. The association constant for N-dansyl-D-galactosamine was caused by a very favorable delta S degree of the dansyl group without affecting the strictly carbohydrate-specific character of binding. N-Dansyl-D-galactosamine was employed as a fluorescent indicator ligand in substitution titrations. This involved the use of simple carbohydrates, N-acetyllactosamine, and oligosaccharides which occur in the carbohydrate units of N-glycoproteins; the latter were Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----2)Man, Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----6)Man, and Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----6)[Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----2)]Man. The titrations were performed at two temperatures to determine the thermodynamic parameters. In the series N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, methyl-alpha-D-galactoside, and lactose, -delta H degrees increased from 24 to 41 kJ mol-1; it increased further for N-acetyllactosamine and then remained unchanged for the N-acetyllactosamine-containing oligosaccharides (55 +/- 1 kJ mol-1. This indicated that the site specifically accommodated the disaccharide structure with an important contribution of the 2-acetamido group in the penultimate sugar. Beyond this, no additional contacts seemed to be formed. This conclusion also followed from considerations of delta S degrees values which became more unfavorable in the above series (-23 to -101 +/- 4 J mol-1 K-1); the most negative value of delta S degrees was observed with N-acetyllactosamine and the three N-acetyllactosamine-containing oligosaccharides.",

Structure-activity relationship studies in a series of 1-benzyl-4-alkyl-2-(4',5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazines resulted in the identification of 1-methyl-4-(2', 4'-dichlorobenzyl)-2-(4',5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazine, PMS 812 (S-21663), as a highly potent antidiabetic agent on a rat model of diabetes, mediated by an important increase of insulin secretion independently of alpha2 adrenoceptor blockage. These studies were extended to find additional compounds in these series with improved properties. In such a way, substitution of both piperazine N atoms was first optimized by using various alkyl, branched or not, and benzyl groups. Second, some modifications of the imidazoline ring and its replacement by isosteric heterocycles were carried out, proceeding from PMS 812, to evaluate their influence on the antidiabetic activity. The importance of the distance between the imidazoline ring and the piperazine skeleton was studied third. Finally, the influence of the N-benzyl moiety was also analyzed compared to a direct N-phenyl substitution. The pharmacological evaluation was performed in vivo using glucose tolerance tests on a rat model of type II diabetes. The most active compounds were 1,4-diisopropyl-2-(4', 5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazine (41a), PMS 847 (S-22068), and 1,4-diisobutyl-2-(4',5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazine (41b), PMS 889 (S-22575), which strongly improved glucose tolerance without any side event or hypoglycemic effect.

Inverted Delta c, where V(E) is the Eulerian mean tracer velocity, c the average particle concentration, and D(s) the effective diffusivity.

The microscale mean particle velocity, in turn, is the sum of the mean fluid velocity and the ballistic tracer velocity, which is due to the local nonuniformity of the concentration field and is therefore structurally different from the tracer drift velocity. In the limit of large Peclet numbers, D(s) coincides with the self-diffusion dyadic, as it measures the local temporal growth of the mean square displacement of a tracer particle from its average position. In this case, the motion of a tracer particle is a random process in the manner of Stratonovich, where the smoothly varying mean tracer velocity equals the microscale mean tracer velocity and the fluctuating term is described through the cross diffusion dyadic D(r(1),r(2),t).",

The motion of a particle is dominated at short times by memory effects and at longer times by the potential.

Furthermore, these calibration errors increase in a nontrivial fashion with particle size, trap stiffness, and sampling frequency.

Commonly monitored ambient pollutants include PM(2.5), CO, SO(2), O(3), 10-500-nm particle number, and black carbon (BC).

These variables were continuously monitored during July 1-7, 2005-2010, in Rochester, New York. High delta-C values are normally associated with biomass combustion particles. However, statistically higher delta-C values were observed on Independence Day compared to the other period. Back trajectory analysis showed transport of local fireworks smoke to the sampling site on the night of July 4. An enhanced correlation between delta-C and BC during the fireworks episodes suggests changes from the usual BC sources. Fireworks emissions changed the ambient carbonaceous particulate species during these intervals.

This allows us to track tracer particles embedded in the system and obtain three-dimensional trajectories [r(t),theta(t),z(t)] as a function of time. We study the probability distribution function of the vertical and radial displacements, finding Gaussian and exponential distributions, respectively. For slow shear rates, the mean-square fluctuations in all three directions are found to be dependent only on the angular displacement of the Couette cell, Delta theta e, (Delta z 2) approximately Delta theta e, (Delta r2) approximately Delta theta e alpha, Delta theta 2 approximately Delta theta e beta, where alpha and beta are constants. With Delta theta e proportional to the time between measurements, the values of the constants, alpha and beta , are found to be subdiffusive and superdiffusive, respectively. ThFe linear relation between (Delta z 2) and angular displacement implies a diffusive process, from which we can calculate an \"effective temperature,\" T eff, in the vertical direction, through a fluctuation-dissipation relation. It is of interest to determine whether these systems can be described by analogous equilibrium statistical mechanics concepts such as \"effective temperature\" and \"compactivity.\" By studying the dynamics of tracer particles, we find the effective temperature defined by the Stokes-Einstein relation to be independent of the tracer particle characteristic features, such as density and size, and dependent only on the packing density of the system. For slow shear rate, both the diffusivity and mobility of tracer particles are proportional to the shear rate, giving rise to a constant effective temperature, characteristic of the jammed system.

A lower cost version (the Dylos Air Quality Monitor) has recently been introduced, but it requires appropriate calibration to reflect the mass concentration units required for exposure assessment. We conducted a total of 64 experiments with a suite of instruments including a Dylos DC1100, another real-time laser photometer (TSI SidePak™ Model AM-510 Personal Aerosol Monitor), and a gravimetric sampling apparatus to estimate Dylos calibration factors for emissions from 17 different common indoor sources including cigarettes, incense, fried bacon, chicken, and hamburger. Comparison of minute-by-minute data from the Dylos with the gravimetrically calibrated SidePak yielded relationships that enable the conversion of the raw Dylos particle counts less than 2.5 μm (in #/0.01 ft(3)) to estimated PM2.5 mass concentration (e.g. μg m(-3)). The relationship between the exponentially-decaying Dylos particle counts and PM2.5 mass concentration can be described by a theoretically-derived power law with source-specific empirical parameters. A linear relationship (calibration factor) is applicable to fresh or quickly decaying emissions (i.e., before the aerosol has aged and differential decay rates introduce curvature into the relationship). The empirical parameters for the power-law relationships vary greatly both between and within source types, although linear factors appear to have lower uncertainty. The Dylos Air Quality Monitor is likely most useful for providing instantaneous feedback and context on mass particle levels in home and work situations for field-survey or personal awareness applications.

Teflon filters loaded with 24 ng to 20 μg of SOM were analyzed by SFG. The SFG spectra obtained from particles formed under condensational and coagulative growth conditions were found to be quite similar, indicating that the distribution of SFG-active C-H oscillators is similar for particles prepared under both conditions. The spectral features of these flow-tube particles agreed with those prepared in an earlier study that employed the Harvard Environmental Chamber. The SFG intensity was found to increase linearly with the number of particles, consistent with what is expected from SFG signal production from particles, while it decreased at higher mass loadings of 10 and 20 μg, consistent with the notion that SFG probes the top surface of the SOM material following the complete coverage of the filter. The linear increase in SFG intensity with particle density also supports the notion that the average number of SFG active oscillators per particle is constant for a given particle size, that the particles are present on the collection filters in a random array, and that the particles are not coalesced. The limit of detection of SFG intensity was established as 24 ng of mass on the filter, corresponding to a calculated density of about 100 particles in the laser spot. As established herein, the technique is applicable for detecting low particle number or mass concentrations in ambient air. The related implication is that SFG is useful for short collection times and would therefore provide increased temporal resolution in a locally evolving atmospheric environment. ",

To properly perform nanoparticle inhalation toxicology studies, the aerosols in a chamber housing the experimental animals must have: 1) a steady concentration maintained at a desired level for the entire exposure period; 2) a homogenous composition free of contaminants; and 3) a stable size distribution with a geometric mean diameter &lt; 200 nm and a geometric standard deviation σg &lt; 2.5 (5). The generation of aerosols containing nanoparticles is quite challenging because nanoparticles easily agglomerate. This is largely due to very strong inter-particle forces and the formation of large fractal structures in tens or hundreds of microns in size (6), which are difficult to be broken up. Several common aerosol generators, including nebulizers, fluidized beds, Venturi aspirators and the Wright dust feed, were tested; however, none were able to produce nanoparticle aerosols which satisfy all criteria (5). A whole-body nanoparticle aerosol inhalation exposure system was fabricated, validated and utilized for nano-TiO2 inhalation toxicology studies. Critical components: 1) novel nano-TiO2 aerosol generator; 2) 0.5 m(3) whole-body inhalation exposure chamber; and 3) monitor and control system. Nano-TiO2 aerosols generated from bulk dry nano-TiO2 powders (primary diameter of 21 nm, bulk density of 3.8 g/cm(3)) were delivered into the exposure chamber at a flow rate of 90 LPM (10.8 air changes/hr). Particle size distribution and mass concentration profiles were measured continuously with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), and an electric low pressure impactor (ELPI). The aerosol mass concentration (C) was verified gravimetrically (mg/m(3)). The mass (M) of the collected particles was determined as M = (Mpost-Mpre), where Mpre and Mpost are masses of the filter before and after sampling (mg). The mass concentration was calculated as C = M/(Q*t), where Q is sampling flowrate (m(3)/min), and t is the sampling time (minute). The chamber pressure, temperature, relative humidity (RH), O2 and CO2 concentrations were monitored and controlled continuously. Nano-TiO2 aerosols collected on Nuclepore filters were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. In summary, we report that the nano-particle aerosols generated and delivered to our exposure chamber have: 1) steady mass concentration; 2) homogenous composition free of contaminants; 3) stable particle size distributions with a count-median aerodynamic diameter of 157 nm during aerosol generation. This system reliably and repeatedly creates test atmospheres that simulate occupational, environmental or domestic ENM aerosol exposures.",

In order to clarify this problem, three-dimensional patterns of mucociliary particle clearance have to be generated at pre-defined time points after particle exposure. Here, we present a mathematical method for the generation of respective clearance patterns. Three-dimensional transport paths of inhaled particles as well as spatial deposition patterns were generated by determining spatial information of all airway tubes passed by the particles and the particle deposition sites. Three-dimensional data were converted to a coordinate system, within which the trachea represented the z-axis. Visualization of stored data was realized with the help of a freely available program code that is specialized in processing huge data sets. Mucociliary clearance of deposited particular mass was computed by assuming (1) an interrelationship between mucus velocity and airway caliber and (2) an average tracheal mucus velocity of 5.5mm min(-1). Position of cleared particles within the spatial TB tree was determined at t=0 h (immediately after exposure), t=12 h and t=24 h. Spatial patterns of mucociliary clearance were computed for particles with a uniform geometric diameter of 5μm and a density of 1g cm(-3). Inhalation of the aerosol loaded with those particles took place under sitting breathing conditions (breathing frequency: 15min(-1), tidal volume: 750 ml). As demonstrated by the generated clearance patterns, mucociliary transport of 5μm particles is completed after 30 h. Within the first 12 h following aerosol exposure, about 75% of the initially deposited particular mass is removed from the TB tree. After 24 h, 95% of the particles have been cleared. Clearance patterns are characterized by a successive transition of maximal particle concentrations towards more proximal airway generations. For 0.1μm particles and 1μm particles clearance times are significantly prolonged, whilst 10μm particles are even faster removed from the TB tree than the 5μm particles. Based on the results of this study the time span between initial deposition of particular matter and complete evacuation of deposited particles ranges from several hours to some days and depends on (1) the preferential deposition site of the inhaled material and (2) the mean mucus velocities in the bronchial airway generations.",

The contribution of buoyancy, hemodynamic forces, van der Waals, electrostatic and steric interactions between the circulating particle and the endothelium lining the vasculature has been considered. For practical applications, the contribution of buoyancy, hemodynamic forces and van der Waals interactions should be only taken into account, whilst the effect of electrostatic and steric repulsion becomes important only at very short distances from the endothelium (1-10 nm). The margination speed and the time for margination t(s) have been estimated as a function of the density of the particle relative to blood delta rho, the Hamaker constant A and radius R of the particle. A critical radius Rc exists for which the margination time t(s) has a maximum, which is influenced by both delta rho and A: the critical radius decreases as the relative density increases and the Hamaker constant decreases. Therefore, particles used for drug delivery should have a radius smaller than the critical value (in the range of 100 nm) to facilitate margination and interaction with the endothelium. While particles used as nanoharvesting agents in proteomics or genomics analysis should have a radius close to the critical value to minimize margination and increase their circulation time.",

A probe particle with time-dependent mass m( t;β) and dipole μ( r, t;β) is evolved classically on the potential energy surface V( r) coupled to an electric field E( t;β), as described by the time-dependent density of states represented on a grid, or otherwise as a linear combination of Gaussians generated by the k-means clustering algorithm. Control parameters β defining m( t;β), μ( r, t;β), and E( t;β) are optimized by following the gradients of the energy with respect to β, adapting them to steer the particle toward the global minimum energy configuration. We find that the resulting COCO algorithm is capable of resolving near-degenerate states separated by large energy barriers and successfully locates the global minima of golf potentials on flat and rugged surfaces, previously explored for testing quantum annealing methodologies and the quantum optimal control optimization (QuOCO) method. Preliminary results show successful energy minimization of multidimensional Lennard-Jones clusters. Beyond the analysis of energy minimization in the specific model systems investigated, we anticipate COCO should be valuable for solving minimization problems in general, including optimization of parameters in applications to machine learning and molecular structure determination.",

We examine the contributions of fine (PM-2.5) and coarse (PM-2.5 to -10) fraction of typical urban aerosols to particle doses in different lung airways resulting from 24-h exposure to the standard concentration of 150 microg m-3. The aerosol is assumed to have a bimodal lognormal mass distribution with mass median diameters of 0.2 and 5 microm, and geometric standard deviation of 1.7 and 57% of the mass in the fine (PM-2.5) mode. The daily mass dose from exposure to 150 microg m-3 of PM-10 in the nasopharyngeal (NPL) region is 20-51 microg day-1 (1.5% of inhaled fines) and 377-687 microg day-1 (30% of inhaled coarse), respectively, of fine and coarse mass filtered in the nose. Similar daily mass doses from fine and coarse fractions, respectively, to the tracheobronchial (TBL) region are 28-38 (1.5%) and 40-52 (4%) microg day-1 and to the pulmonary (PUL) region are 18-194 (6%) and 32-55 microg day-1 (2%). The daily number dose in the NPL region is 5-15 x 10(8) (0.06% of inhaled fines) and 5-10 x 10(6) day-1 (13% of inhaled coarse) respectively, of fine and coarse particles. Similar number doses to the TBL region are 2.2-3.1 x 10(10) (2%) and 7.1-11. 1 x 10(5) (2%) day-1 and to the PUL region are 1.6-16.7 x 10(10) (9%) and 2.9-17.0 x 10(5) (3%) day-1. The daily surface mass dose (microg cm-2 day-1) from coarse fraction particles is large in generations 3-5. The daily number dose (particles day-1) and surface number dose (particles cm-2 day-1) are higher from the fine than the coarse fraction, by about 10(3) to 10(5) times in all lung airways. Fine fraction particles result in 10,000 times greater particle number dose per macrophage than coarse fraction particles. Particle number doses do not follow trends in mass doses, are much larger from fine than coarse fraction, and must be considered in assessing PM health effects. For the assumed fine fraction ratio of 0.57, the estimated increase in protection from the new PM-2.5 standards is a 25% and 47% lower dose, respectively, at the 24-h and annual standard in comparison with the respective PM-10 standards. The mass fraction in the fine mode depends upon the local sources, will vary with different extents of control of various source types, and will influence the choice of control strategy to meet the revised standard.",

Particularly in developing countries, plenty of concentrated organic wastewaters treated noneffectively are discharged into aquatic environments from chemical, textile, paper-making, and other industries to seriously threaten the surface and drinking water. The conventional wastewater treatment techniques are often helpless due to high cost with multilevel processing. Adsorption as an efficient method is often applied to the treatment of wastewater. The aim of this work is to develop an eco-friendly and cost-effective wastewater-sorbing material with weak acidic pink red B (APRB) and calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) by reusing highly concentrated dye wastewater. On the basis of the chemical coprecipitation of APRB with growing CaCO(3) particles, an inclusion material was prepared. The composition of material was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-energy dispersive X-ray, and its morphology characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, TEM, and particle-size analysis. Two cationic dyes, ethyl violet (EV) and methylene blue (MB), and four POPs, phenanthrene (Phe), fluorene (Flu), biphenyl (Bip), and biphenol A (Bpa), were used to investigate the adsorption selectivity, capacity, and mechanism of the new material, where spectrophotometry, fluorophotometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography were used for determination. An APRB-producing wastewater was reused for preparing the cost-effective wastewater-sorbing material instead of the APRB reagent and then treating cationic dye wastewaters. The remove rates of colority and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were evaluated. The CO(3) (2-)-APRB-Ca(2+) addition sequence is most favorable for the occlusion of APRB into the growing CaCO(3) particles, and the occlusion of APRB corresponded to the Langmuir isothermal adsorption with the binding constant (K) of 5.24 x 10(4) M(-1) and the Gibbs free energy change (Delta G) of -26.9 kJ/mol. The molar ratio of Ca(2+) to CO(3) (2-) and APRB was calculated to be 1:0.94:0.0102, i.e., approximately 92 CaCO(3) molecules occluded only one APRB. Approximately 78% of the inclusion aggregates are between 3 and 20 mm and the particles are global-like with 50-100 nm. The element mapping on Ca, S, and C indicated APRB distributed a lot of CaCO(3), i.e., the APRB layer may be pressed between both sides of CaCO(3) layers. The molar ratio of Ca to S was calculated to 44, i.e., 88 CaCO(3) molecules carried one APRB, according to the above data. During the growing of CaCO(3) particles, APRB may be attracted into the temporary electric double layer in micelle form by the strong charge interaction between sulfonic groups of APRB and Ca(2+) and the hydrophobic stack of long alkyl chains. Four dyes were adsorbed: reactive brilliant red X-3B and weak acid green GS as anionic dyes and EV and MB as cationic dyes. The removals of EV and MB are extremely obvious and the saturation adsorption of EV and MB just neutralized all the negative charges in the inclusion particles. The selectivity demonstrated the ion-pair attraction, i.e., the cationic adsorption capacity depends on the negative charge number of the inclusion material. By fitting the Langmuir isotherm model, the monolayer adsorptions of EV and MB were confirmed. Their K values were calculated to be 2.4 x 10(6) and 7.3 x 10(5) M(-1), and Delta G was calculated to be 36.4 and -33.4 kJ/mol. The adsorption of four POPs on the material obeyed the lipid-water partition law, and their partition coefficients (K (pw)) were calculated to be 9,342 L/kg for Phe, 7,301 L/kg for Flu, 1,226 L/kg for Bip, and 870 L/kg for Bpa. The K (pw) is the direct ratio to their lipid-water partition coefficients (K (ow)) with 0.314 of slope. Besides this, a cost-effective CaCO(3)/APRB inclusion material was prepared with an APRB-producing wastewater instead of APRB reagent, and it was used in the treatment of two practical cationic dye wastewaters (samples A and B). The colority and COD in sample B are 18 and 13 times high as those of sample A. The decolorization of sample A is over 96%, and the removal of COD is between 70% and 80% when more than 0.3% adsorbent was added. However, those of sample B are over 98% and 88% in the presence of over 1% adsorbent. The adsorbent added in sample B, which was only two to three times as high as that in sample A, brought a similar removal rate of colority and COD. The inclusion material is more efficient for treatment of a highly concentrated dye wastewater because it may adsorb the most cationic dye up to saturation. A cost-effective onion-like inclusion material was synthesized with the composition ratio 90 +/- 2 of CaCO(3) to APRB, and it carried a lot of negative charges and lipophilic groups. It has a high adsorption capacity and rapid saturation for cationic dye and POPs. The adsorption of cationic dyes corresponded to the Langmuir isothermal model and that of POPs to the lipid-water partition law. The adsorbent is suitable for treatment of concentrated cationic dye and POPs wastewater in neutral media. The addition quantity of the calcium carbonate-APRB adsorbent was suggested below: only 3-5 kg per ton of wastewater (&lt;1,000 colority or &lt;2 mg/L POPs) and 20-30 kg per ton of highly concentrated wastewater (&gt;20,000 colority or &gt;50 mg/L POPs). The skeleton reactants are low-cost, easily available, and harmless to the ecological environment; additionally, the APRB reactant can reuse APRB-producing wastewater. The dye-contaminated sludge can potentially be reused as the color additive in building material and rubber and plastics industries. However, the APRB and dye contaminant would be released from the sludge when exposed to an acidic media (pH &lt;4) for long time. This work has developed a simple, eco-friendly and practical method for the production of a cost-effective wastewater-sorbing material.",

In considering the hydrophobicity of intramembranous protein (IMP) H-bonds which cross the phospholipid bilayer of plasma membranes, and the necessity for photonic recycling in cell surface interactions after dissipation of energetic states, present models lack structure and thermodynamic properties to maintain (DeltaE) sufficient energy sources necessary for amplifications by factors of 10(12). Even though one accepts that the ligand-receptor association alters the conformation of extracellular, extruding portions of IMP's at the cell surface, and that this change can be transmitted to the cytoplasm by the transmembranous helical segments by nonlinear vibrations of proteins with generation of soliton waves, one is still unable to account for repair and balanced function. Indeed, responses of critical molecules to certain magnetic field signals may include enhanced vibrational amplitudes, increased quanta of thermal energies and order inducing interactions. We may accept that microtrabecular reticulum-receptor is associated with actin filaments and ATP molecules which contribute to the activation of the cyclase enzyme system through piezoelectricity. Magnetic fields will pass through the membrane which sharply attenuates the electric field component of an EM field, due to its high impedance. Furthermore, EM oscillations are converted to mechanical vibrations; i.e., photon-phonon transduction, to induce molecular vibrations of frequencies specifically responsible for bioamplifications of weak triggers at the membrane surface, as well as GAP junctions. The hydrogen bonds of considerable importance are those in proteins (10(12)Hz) and DNA (10(11)Hz) and may be viewed as centers of EM radiation emission in the range from the mm microwaves to the far IR. However, classical electrodynamical theory does not yield a model for biomolecular resonant responses which are integrated over time and account for the connection between the phonon field and photons. Jacobson Resonance does supply an initial physical mechanism, as equivalencies in energy to that of Zeeman Resonance (i.e., zero-order magnetic resonance) and cyclotron resonance may be derived from the DeBroglie wave particle equation. For the first time, we view the introduction of Relativity Theory to biology in the expression, mc(2)=BvLq, where m is the mass of a particle in the 'box' or 'string' (molecule in a biosystem), c is the velocity of electromagnetic field in space, independent of its inertial frame of reference, B is the magnetic flux density,v is the velocity of the carrier or 'string' (a one or two dimensional 'box') in which the particle exists, L is its dimension (length) and q represents a unit charge q=1C, by defining electromotive force as energy per unit charge. Equivalencies suggest that qvBL is one of the fundamental expressions of energy of a charged wave-particle in magnetic fields, just as Zeeman and cyclotron resonance energy expressions, gbetaB and qhB/2pim, and is applicable to all charged particles (molecules in biological systems). There may exist spontaneous, independent and incessant interactions of magnetic vector B and particles in biosystems which exert Lorentz forces.

The goals of the present study were to: (1) develop and characterize the physical properties of an aerosolized form of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), the major psychoactive constituent present in marijuana; and (2) assess the pharmacological effects of cannabinoid inhalation in mice. A Small Particle Aerosol Generator (SPAG) nebulizer, used to generate the aerosol, had an output of approximately 0.154 mg/l of aerosolized Delta(9)-THC with a 2.0 microm mass median aerodynamic diameter and a 2.2 geometric standard deviation (GSD). Virtually all the particles were less than 5.0 microm in diameter suggesting that they were sufficiently small to penetrate deeply into the lungs. Inhalation exposure to aerosolized Delta(9)-THC in mice elicited antinociceptive effects that were dependent on concentration and exposure time with an estimated Delta(9)-THC dose of 1.8 mg/kg. On the other hand, inhalation exposure to Delta(9)-THC failed to produce two other indices indicative of cannabinoid activity, hypothermia and decreases in spontaneous locomotor activity. The antinociceptive effects occurred within 5 min of exposure and lasted approximately 40 min in duration. The cannabinoid receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide HCl (SR 141716A), but not naloxone, blocked these antinociceptive effects (AD(50)=0.09 mg/kg) indicating a cannabinoid receptor mechanism of action. Similarly, inhalation exposure to a water soluble cannabinoid analog, 3-(5'-cyano-1', 1'dimethylheptyl)-1-(4-N-morpholinobutyrloxy)-Delta(8)-te trahydrocann abinol (O-1057), produced antinociception that was blocked by SR 141716A. These results demonstrate that the development of an aerosolized form of cannabinoids for human medicinal use is feasible.",

The concentrations of beta-FeOOH and added NaCl varied between 0.00111 and 0.0555 g/L and 0.03 and 2.0 mM, respectively. Except for the suspensions with high salt concentrations, each RPEB signal showed a dip or minimum in the reverse process upon electric field reversal, together with a smooth rise in the buildup and a fall in the decay process. The observed signals were analyzed with a new RPEB theory, which takes into account not only the permanent electric dipole moment (µ) but also the root-mean-square ionic dipole moment (&lt;m(2)&gt;(1/2)) due to the ion fluctuation in ion atmosphere, in addition to the field-induced electronic (covalent) dipole moment Deltaalpha' E. The results showed that the slowly fluctuating moment of &lt;m(2)&gt;(1/2) is by far the most predominant one for the field orientation of the beta-FeOOH particle, though the permanent dipole moment µ may not be completely excluded. The rotational relaxation time of the whole particle was evaluated from the decay signal, while the relaxation time for fluctuating ions was estimated from RPEB signal fitting. The sign of the steady-state birefringence for beta-FeOOH suspensions was positive without exception under the present conditions. The birefringence signals in the steady state (delta/d) were proportional to the second power of the applied field strength (E) in the low field region; thus, the Kerr law was verified to hold for beta-FeOOH suspensions. The specific Kerr constant was evaluated for each suspension by extrapolating the values of delta/d to zero field (E--&gt;0). Copyright 2000 Academic Press.",

SAX provided information on composition (in terms of elemental X-rays), shapes, number concentration, size distribution, and projected area concentration (PAV(m)) of particle populations. Mie theory calculations based on SAX results were used to estimate the scattering coefficient and the mean scattering efficiency at a wavelength of 660 nm [b(m)(660) and &lt;Q(b)(m)(660)&gt;].

Patterns of particle size contributions to b(m)(660) (and T(n)) remained relatively invariant over a wide range of T(n) (more than 200-fold difference). The median size for these contributions was most often approximately 2.5 microm. The credibility of the SAX characterizations of the light-scattering features of the minerogenic particles and the calculations based on Mie theory for the study system was supported by (1) the strength of the T(n)-PAV(m) relationship, (2) the reasonable closure between T(n) measurements and calculated values of b(m)(660), and (3) the closeness of &lt;Q(b)(m)(660)&gt; to the limiting value of 2 for polydispersed particle populations.

Mass spectra of the precursor particles formed in an ethene diffusion flame have indicated the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the m/z range of 202-300 and higher mass peaks extending out to m/z 472. The mass resolution of the time-of-flight mass spectrometer used did not provide conclusive identification of PAHs because of ambiguities in assignment for the relative amounts of carbon and hydrogen (C(x)H(y)) for each PAH peak and the possibilities of spectral interferences. To determine the chemical formula that can be assigned to each molecular ion peak, an isotopically pure deuterated ethene (C(2)D(4)) fuel was burned in place of normal ethene (C(2)H(4)) in the diffusion flame. For the normal ethene fuel, mass peaks tentatively identified as C(16)H(10) to C(38)H(16) were obtained. Accordingly, deuterated PAH peaks ranging from C(16)D(10) to C(38)D(16) were found when C(2)D(4) was burned. These m/z values correspond to molecular ion, M•(+), peaks for an array of PAH compounds. The deuterated PAH mass peaks (C(x)D(y)) were entirely consistent with a mass shift of y mass units with respect to the normal PAH mass peaks.

This collective phenomenon has been characterized by measurements of a dynamic susceptibility χ_{4}(t), which is sometimes interpreted in terms of the size of those relaxing regions and the intensity of the fluctuations. We show that the results of those measurements can be affected not only by the collective fluctuations in the relaxation rate, but also by density fluctuations in the initial state and by single-particle fluctuations. We also show that at very long times the average overlap C(t) probing the similarity between an initial and a final state separated by a time interval t decays as a power law C(t)∼t^{-d/2}. This is much slower than the stretched exponential behavior C(t)∼e^{-(t/τ)^{β}} previously observed at times within one or two orders of magnitude of the α-relaxation time τ_{α}. We find that for times longer than 10-100τ_{α}, the dynamic susceptibility χ_{4}(t) is dominated by single-particle fluctuations, and that χ_{4}(t)≈C(t)∼t^{-d/2}. Finally, we introduce a method to extract the collective relaxation contribution to the dynamic susceptibility χ_{4}(t) by subtracting the effects of single-particle fluctuations and initial state density fluctuations. We apply this method to numerical simulations of two glass-forming models: a binary hard sphere system and a Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones system. This allows us to extend the analysis of numerical data to timescales much longer than previously possible, and opens the door for further future progress in the study of dynamic heterogeneities, including the determination of the exchange time.",

J. 95, 5317 (2008)] may be rationalized by a model of chain dynamics based on the anomalous diffusion of a particle moving in a harmonic well in the presence of a delta function sink. The experiments of Wiggin et al. found, among other things, that the occasional occurrence of unusually long escape times in the distribution of chain trapping events led to nonexponential decays in the survival probability, S(t), of the DNA molecules within the nanopore. Wiggin et al. ascribed this nonexponentiality to the existence of a distribution of trapping potentials, which they suggested was the result of stochastic interactions between the bases of the DNA and the amino acids located on the surface of the nanopore. Based on this idea, they showed that the experimentally determined S(t) could be well fit in both the short and long time regimes by a function of the form (1+t/tau)(-alpha) (the so called Becquerel function). In our model, S(t) is found to be given by a Mittag-Leffler function at short times and by a generalized Mittag-Leffler function at long times. By suitable choice of certain parameter values, these functions are found to fit the experimental S(t) even better than the Becquerel function. Anomalous diffusion of DNA within the trap prior to escape over a barrier of fixed height may therefore provide a second, plausible explanation of the data, and may offer fresh perspectives on similar trapping and escape problems.",

In capture and release detection, charged particles are electrophoretically driven to the opening of a small pore ( approximately 60 nm diameter) in a membrane; capture of a single particle at the pore opening at time tau is signaled by a decrease in the flux of a redox species (Fe(CN)(6)4-) through the pore. The captured particle is then released by applying an electrophoretic current in the opposite direction, and the process is repeated to acquire sufficient statistical data to determine the solution particle concentration (Cp) based on the relationship between Cp and the average particle counting rate (tauavg(-1)). Both tauavg(-1) and the method sensitivity are shown, for the detection of 90 nm diameter polystyrene particles, to depend strongly on the applied current waveform. The observed dependence is a consequence of the nonequilibrium distribution of particles in the analyte solution that results from electrostatic forces acting on the particle whenever iapp has a nonzero value. Stochastic capture rates corresponding to an initial uniform distribution of particles are more closely achieved using an applied current waveform that includes an equilibration period (iapp=0) prior to electrophoretic capture.

The secondary organic material (SOM) was produced in a continuous-flow chamber, with steady-state organic particle mass concentrations M(org) ranging from 1.4 to 37 μg m(-3). Particles exiting in the outflow were heated to temperatures T of up to 100 °C in a thermodenuder. The oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) and hydrogen-to-carbon (H:C) ratios were measured by on-line mass spectrometry. The observed elemental ratios were fit by a linear function, given by (H:C) = -0.8 (O:C) +1.8 for 0.38 &lt; O:C &lt; 0.50. This fit included the dependence on both M(org) and T, meaning that the single variable of post-thermodenuder M(org) was sufficient as an accurate predictor for O:C(M(org)(T)) and H:C(M(org)(T)). This result suggests that equilibrium partitioning theory largely governed the initial volatilization in the thermodenuder. By comparison, the CCN activity had a different dependence on thermodenuder treatment. At 25 °C, the CCN activity was independent of M(org), having an effective hygroscopicity parameter κ(org) of 0.103 ± 0.002. At 100 °C, however, κ(org) varied from 0.105 for M(org) = 1.4 μg m(-3) to 0.079 for M(org) = 37 μg m(-3), indicating that for high mass concentration the CCN activity decreased with heat treatment. The interpretation is that the oligomer fraction of the SOM increased at elevated T, both because of particle-phase reactions that produced oligomers under those conditions and because of the relative enrichment of lower-volatility oligomers in the SOM accompanying the evaporation of higher-volatility monomers from the SOM. Oligomers have high effective molecular weights and thereby significantly influence CCN activity. The production rates of different types of oligomers depend on the types and concentrations of functional groups present in the SOM, which in turn are strongly influenced by M(org). We conclude with a hypothesis, which is supported by a detailed molecular kinetic model, that the changes in κ(org) at high T were more significant at high compared to low M(org) because particle-phase SOM at high M(org) contained a mix of functional groups favorable to oligomerization, such as carbonyl groups.",

Each bacterium is understood as a carrier of a phenotypic parameter p. The central objective is the calculation of the probability density with respect to p, Phi(p,t;p(0)), of the carriers living at time t&gt;0, provided that initially at t(0)=0, all bacteria carried the phenotypic parameter p(0)=0. The theory involves two small parameters: the mutation probability mu and a parameter gamma involved in a function w(p) defining the fitness of the bacteria to survive the generation time tau and give birth to an offspring. The mutation from a state p to a state q is defined by a Gaussian with a dispersion sigma(2)(m). The author focuses our attention on a function phi(p,t) which determines uniquely the function Phi(p,t;p(0)) and satisfies a linear equation (Waxman's equation). The Green function of this equation is mathematically identical with the one-particle Bloch density matrix, where mu characterizes the order of magnitude of the potential energy. (In the x representation, the potential energy is proportional to the inverted Gaussian with the dispersion sigma(2)(m)). The author solves Waxman's equation in the standard style of a perturbation theory and discusses how the solution depends on the choice of the fitness function w(p). In a sense, the function c(p)=1-w(p)/w(0) is analogous to the dispersion function E(p) of fictitious quasiparticles. In contrast to Waxman's approximation, where c(p) was taken as a quadratic function, c(p) approximately gammap(2), the author exemplifies the problem with another function, c(p)=gamma[1-exp(-ap(2))], where gamma is small but a may be large. The author shows that the use of this function in the theory of the population genetics is the same as the use of a nonparabolic dispersion law E=E(p) in the density-matrix theory. With a general function c(p), the distribution function Phi(p,t;0) is composed of a delta-function component, N(t)delta(p), and a blurred component. When discussing the limiting transition for t--&gt; infinity, the author shows that his function c(p) implies that N(t)--&gt;N( infinity ) not equal 0 in contrast with the asymptotics N(t)--&gt;0 resulting from the use of Waxman's function c(p) approximately p(2).",

However, potential risks of the passive exposure to the aerosol exhaled by e-cig users have been raised in the last decade. In this study, the aerosols with diameter less than 1 μm (PM<sub1</sub) produced by vaping of various e-cig liquids were compared to those generated by smoking conventional cigarettes in real time. The mass and number concentration along with the number size distribution were measured in a closed room of 35 m<sup3</sup volume. Our results showed that aerosols emitted from e-cig liquids had a different profile compared to those from conventional cigarettes. Although e-cigs initially produced higher particle mass and number concentrations, their emissions had much shorter lifetime of approximately 10-20 s, in comparison with the conventional and hand-rolling cigarette particulate emissions which had a dissipation time of approximately 1.4 h in a 35 m<sup3</sup room.

We implemented sets of open electron and ion lenses to time stretch and velocity map the charged particles. Time switched voltages are operated on the particle lenses to enable optimal electric field strengths for velocity map focusing conditions of electrons and ions separately. The position and time sensitive detectors employ microchannel plates (MCPs) in front of delay line detectors. A special effort was made to obtain the time-of-flight (TOF) of the electrons at high temporal resolution using small pore (5 microm) MCPs and implementing fast timing electronics. We measured the TOF distribution of the electrons under our typical coincidence field strengths with a temporal resolution down to sigma=18 ps. We observed that our electron coincidence detector has a timing resolution better than sigma=16 ps, which is mainly determined by the residual transit time spread of the MCPs. The typical electron energy resolution appears to be nearly laser bandwidth limited with a relative resolution of DeltaE(FWHM)/E=3.5% for electrons with kinetic energy near 2 eV. The mass resolution of the ion detector for ions measured in coincidence with electrons is about Deltam(FWHM)/m=14150. The velocity map focusing of our extended source volume of particles, due to the overlap of the molecular beam with the laser beams, results in a parent ion spot on our detector focused down to sigma=115 microm.",

Many virus capsids are icosahedral, and assembly is thought to occur by the sequential addition of capsid protein subunits to a nucleus, with the final step completing the icosahedron. Almost nothing is known about the final (completion) step because the techniques usually used to study capsid assembly lack the resolution. In this work, charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) has been used to track the assembly of the T = 4 hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid in real time. The initial assembly reaction occurs rapidly, on the time scale expected from low resolution measurements. However, CDMS shows that many of the particles generated in this process are defective and overgrown, containing more than the 120 capsid protein dimers needed to form a perfect T = 4 icosahedron. The defective and overgrown capsids self-correct over time to the mass expected for a perfect T = 4 capsid. Thus, completion is a distinct phase in the assembly reaction. Capsid completion does not necessarily occur by inserting the last building block into an incomplete, but otherwise perfect icosahedron. The initial assembly reaction can be predominently imperfect, and completion involves the slow correction of the accumulated errors.",

Another feature believed to be novel is simplifying the design by elimination of the need for cooling the blackbody for subambient temperature range by use of a second blackbody, strategically located, which is heated to achieve radiation balance. Detailed theoretical analysis is given, showing that the IRT can measure remotely the total emissivity or even the electric current or voltage.

This technology relies on the drastic enhancement of radiative heat transfer (compared to conventional blackbody radiation) that occurs when objects at different temperatures are brought to deep subwavelength distances (typically &lt;100 nm) from each other. Achieving such radiative heat transfer between a hot object and a photovoltaic (PV) cell could allow direct conversion of heat to electricity with a greater efficiency than using current solid-state technologies (e.g., thermoelectric generators). One of the main challenges in the development of this technology, however, is its incompatibility with conventional silicon PV cells. Thermal radiation is weak at frequencies larger than the ∼1.1 eV bandgap of silicon, such that PV cells with lower excitation energies (typically 0.4-0.6 eV) are required for NFTPV. Using low bandgap III-V semiconductors to circumvent this limitation, as proposed in most theoretical works, is challenging and therefore has never been achieved experimentally. In this work, we show that hot carrier PV cells based on Schottky junctions between silicon and metallic films could provide an attractive solution for achieving high efficiency NFTPV electricity generation. Hot carrier science is currently an important field of research and several approaches are investigated for increasing the quantum efficiency (QE) of hot carrier generation beyond conventional Fowler model predictions. If the Fowler limit can indeed be overcome, we show that hot carrier-based NFTPV systems-after optimization of their thermal radiation spectrum-could allow electricity generation with up to 10-30% conversion efficiencies and 10-500 W/cm<sup2</sup generated power densities (at 900-1500 K temperatures). We also discuss how the unique properties of thermal radiation in the extreme near-field are especially well suited for investigating recently proposed approaches for high QE hot carrier junctions.

Not accounting for those costs has led to waste on a grand scale. But now a few farsighted companies are finding powerful business opportunities in conserving resources on a similarly grand scale.

In the second stage, companies adopt closed-loop production systems that yield no waste or toxicity. The third stage requires a fundamental change of business model--from one of selling products to one of delivering services. For example, a manufacturer would sell lighting services rather than lightbulbs, thus benefitting the seller and customer for developing extremely efficient, durable lightbulbs. The last stage involves reinvesting in natural capital to restore, sustain, and expand the planet's ecosystem. Because natural capitalism is both necessary and profitable, it will sub-sume traditional industrialism, the authors argue, just as industrialism sub-sumed agrarianism.

This paper provides absolute intensity measurements, quantum efficiencies and signal-to-blackbody radiation ratios at peak emission wavelengths, at various temperatures (20-1400°C), for Y(2)O(3):Eu, YAG:Tb and YAG:Tm thermographic phosphors under 266 and 355 nm excitation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These terms are beneficial in a number of ways for engineers wanting to use a phosphor thermometry solution at high temperatures. They may also provide additional insight to the physical luminescence processes of phosphors at high temperatures. The phosphor signal:blackbody radiation ratio is useful because it combines the effects of blackbody radiation and phosphor emission intensities at various temperatures, providing a valuable quantitative evaluation that can be used as a design aid for phosphor selection. A figure of merit is the temperature when the blackbody radiation equals the phosphor emission (ratio = 1); this is the cross-over temperature at which the blackbody radiation rapidly starts to overtake and mask out phosphor emissions. To the best of our knowledge no such work exists previously. The results presented show a variation in phosphor intensity with increasing temperature, and although the intensity and quantum efficiencies for Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb were much greater than YAG:Tm at low temperatures, YAG:Tm was found to be the most efficient phosphor investigated at higher temperatures (&gt;900°C). With a peak emission wavelength of 458 nm, YAG:Tm experienced the lowest proportion of blackbody radiation therefore its advantage at higher temperatures was further amplified and was found to offer an advantage of approximately +350°C and +250°C increased upper temperature capability compared to Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb phosphors, respectively.",

Alumina/W/alumina multiwalled, submicron cavity arrays were fabricated sequentially using nanoimprinting lithography, thin film deposition, and calcination processes.

Previous studies proposed a weighted average method which can be indicated by a priori to calculate the reference temperature. However, these studies did not mention how to define the weight function but used some arbitrary temperature or the temperature of a fixed position like the central bottom of the cavity as the reference temperature. In this study, a quantitative analysis and calculation method, which is implemented in the Monte Carlo method based optical simulation software Tracepro, is proposed to define the weight coefficients and optimize the reference temperature. To do so, in the Tracepro software, a surface source is placed in front of the cavity opening and emits radiation to the blackbody cavity. The radiation from this surface source can be absorbed or reflected many times in the cavity, and finally the incident radiation distribution in the cavity can be obtained. According to the principle of light path reversibility, the normalized incident radiation can be considered as the contribution of its position to the effective emissivity. In the experiment, the actual temperatures of two different-shaped blackbody cavities are measured with the non-contact method in 873 K temperature. By dividing the inner surface of each blackbody cavity into several regions based on the positions of the actually measured temperature points, the incident radiation from the surface source to each segmented region is calculated and normalized to the total incident radiation across all regions as its weight coefficient; the reference temperature is the sum of the weighted temperature (by multiplying each weight coefficient with its measured temperature) in each region. Different from previous studies, this study optimizes the reference temperature by considering the contribution of the whole cavity to the effective emissivity, which should be more consistent with the actual situation. Moreover, the influences of different shapes of the blackbody cavities, different radiation characteristics of the inner surface materials and different viewing conditions of the effective emissivity on the reference temperature are discussed and compared. The results suggest that the optimization of reference temperature has close link with above factors and thus should be calculated individually.",

It is shown that simply using the index of refraction of air at laboratory conditions is not sufficient. A combination of the index of refraction of the media used inside the blackbody radiator and for the optical path between blackbody and detector has to be used instead. A worst case approximation for the introduced error when neglecting these effects is presented, showing that the error is below 0.1 % for wavelengths above 200 nm. Nevertheless, for the determination of the spectral radiance for the purpose of radiation temperature measurements the correct consideration of the refractive index is mandatory.

Interventions for IPV male perpetrators are an essential component of an early and effective response. Yet little is known about how to engage men in interventions for help-seeking. Using the theory of planned behavior (TPB), we explored men's perceptions of seeking help for an unhealthy relationship and how they could be supported to recognize their behavior and undertake change at an early stage. We recruited 23 men who were currently attending a men's behavior change program in Australia to take part in focus groups. These were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. The TPB concepts of behavioral beliefs, perceived control, and subjective norms were found throughout the data. Behavioral beliefs covered four subthemes: self-awareness, self-reflection and agency, the influence of others to change, and needing the right message in the right place. Perceived control was connected to these men's understandings of what it means to be a man. Subjective norms were rarely raised, but there was some indication that men's perceptions of societal norms about men as violent influenced a perceived lack of agency to change behavior. Our findings highlight the complexity of, and challenges in, engaging men who may use violence before they reach crisis point and justice intervenes. Despite this, participating men could find acceptable an appropriately developed and easy-to-access intervention that enhances recognition of behaviors and provides links to supports. Health professionals or researchers developing early interventions targeting these men need to take the engagement challenges into account.",

We then investigate solutions to mitigate thermal effects, such as radiative cooling or the decrease of the emissivity or the temperature of the radiator. Without extending the radiating area beyond that of the cell, gains by radiative cooling are marginal. However, for a given radiator temperature, decreasing its emissivity is beneficial to conversion efficiency and, in cases of limited conductive-convective cooling capacities, even leads to larger electrical power outputs.

PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRC stem cells (CRCSCs) display high self-renewal, metastatic properties, high activity of PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways with chemoresistant phenotypes. Recently, RGD peptide (containing Arg-Gly-Asp motif)-based therapy of solid tumor cells has attracted much attention. However, little is known whether this method can target self-renewal capacity, key effectors of PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways such as metastasis-driver gene CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes with caspase-3 reactivation in CRCSCs overexpressing RGD-dependent integrins. The sea anemone Actinia fragacea produces a water-soluble RGD-peptide fragacea toxin C (FraC) suggesting the possible activity of FraC against PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs. Recombinant FraC was expressed via pET-28a(+)-FraC in E. coli and purified through affinity chromatography followed by performing SDS-PAGE and hemolytic activity assay. Next, PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant HCT-116 cells that serve as an attractive model for CRCSCs were treated with FraC. Thereafter, cell numbers, viability, proliferation, LDH activity, cytotoxicity index, CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes expression, self-renewal capacity, caspase-3 activity with apoptosis were evaluated. Caspase-1, -2, -3,…, -9 sequences were analyzed for RGD-binding motifs. FraC sequence and structure were also evaluated by bioinformatics software. FraC altered cellular morphology to round shapes and disrupted cell connections. 48 h post-treatment with 0.056- to 7.2 μM FraC resulted in 12 %-99 % and 8 %-97.6 % decreases in cell numbers and viabilities respectively and increased LDH activity by 0.2 %-66.7 % in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the cytotoxicity index showed that FraC induces significant toxicity on HCT-116 cells compared to PBMCs and Huvec cells. FraC dramatically decreased the expression of CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes Bmi-1, Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog followed by remarkable decreases in self-renewal capacity ranged from 91- to 0 colonies per well for 0.056- to 3.6 μM FraC after 2 weeks. Caspase-3 was found to contain an RGD-binding motif and its activity increased with increasing FraC concentrations followed by apoptosis induction. Potential RGD-binding motifs for FraC were also found in caspase-1, -7, -8 and -9. Unique advantages of FraC peptide, such as low molecular weight, water solubility, high sensitivity of CRC stem-like cells with more selective toxicity to this compound, targeting tumor cell membrane and self-renewal capacity along with the modulation of CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes as upstream and downstream effectors of undruggable PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways may open up avenues for FraC peptide-based therapy of PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs with lower toxicity on healthy cells.",

Under the same pressure resistance index, the outer diameter and the total length of the frac plug are small, the inner diameter is big, and the pressure resistance downhole passing performance are better. (2) Using dissolvable magnesium-based powder, hydrogenated butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber, fluororubber polyglycolic acid, and the cellulose fiber and coating process, the solubility of the frac plug is observed to be more reliable. (3) Using the structural modular design, the frac plug has outstanding advantages in terms of on-site installation, preventing early seat sealing, self-separation after release, less dissolvable matter, and so on. (4) The finite element simulation and physical simulation experiments show that 121.36 mm ID casing with the frac plug can tolerate deformation in the range of 15 mm, which meets the needs for the casing usage. The temperature increases from 60 to 98 °C, and the maximum sustainable pressure differential decreases from 7.6 to 11.2 h at 70 MPa without any leakage.

We previously demonstrated that membrane-associated Mmp2 is expressed in exit glia and contributes to motor axon targeting. To identify possible substrates, we undertook a yeast interaction screen for Mmp2-binding proteins and identified the novel ECM protein faulty attraction (Frac). Frac encodes a multidomain extracellular protein rich in epidermal growth factor (EGF) and calcium-binding EGF domains, related to the vertebrate Fibrillin and Fibulin gene families. It is expressed in mesodermal domains flanking Mmp2-positive glia. The juxtaposition of Mmp2 and Frac proteins raises the possibility that Frac is a proteolytic target of Mmp2. Consistent with this hypothesis, levels of full-length Frac are increased in Mmp2 loss-of-function (LOF) and decreased in Mmp2 gain-of-function (GOF) embryos, indicating that Frac cleavage is Mmp2 dependent. To test whether frac is necessary for axon targeting, we characterized guidance in frac LOF mutants. Motor axons in frac LOF embryos are loosely associated and project ectopically, a phenotype essentially equivalent to that of Mmp2 LOF. The phenotypic similarity between enzyme and substrate mutants argues that Mmp2 activates Frac. In addition, Mmp2 overexpression pathfinding phenotypes depend on frac activity, indicating that Mmp2 is genetically upstream of frac. Last, overexpression experiments suggest that Frac is unlikely to have intrinsic signaling activity, raising the possibility that an Mmp2-generated Frac fragment acts as a guidance cue cofactor. Indeed, we present genetic evidence that Frac regulates a non-canonical LIM kinase 1-dependent bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway in motoneurons necessary for axon pathfinding during embryogenesis.",

Therefore, there is a need for a multiparametric approach to study sperm function. Recently, we developed a Fluorescence-Based Ratiometric Analysis of Sperm Centrioles (FRAC) assay to determine sperm centriole quality. Here, we perform a pilot study of sperm from 10 fertile men and 10 men in couples with unexplained infertility, using three centriolar biomarkers measured at three sperm locations from two sperm fractions, representing high and low sperm quality. We found that FRAC can identify men from couples with unexplained infertility as the likely source of infertility. Higher quality fractions from 10 fertile individuals were the reference population. All 180 studied FRAC values in the 10 fertile individuals fell within the reference population range. Eleven of the 180 studied FRAC values in the 10 infertile patients were outliers beyond the 95% confidence intervals (P = 0.0008). Three men with unexplained infertility had outlier FRAC values in their higher quality sperm fraction, while four had outlier FRAC values in their lower quality sperm fraction (3/10 and 4/10, P = 0.060 and P = 0.025, respectively), suggesting that these four individuals are infertile due, in part, to centriolar defects. We propose that a larger scale study should be performed to determine the ability of FRAC to identify male factor infertility and its potential contribution to sperm multiparametric analysis.",

In the present study, we analyzed the efficacy of an ethyl acetate fraction from the tuber extract of Pueraria tuberosa (fraction rich in antioxidant compounds, FRAC) against menopausal osteoporosis, and breast and ovarian cancer cells. The FRAC from Pueraria tuberosa was characterized for its phenolic composition (total phenolic and flavonoid amount). Antioxidant property (in vitro assays) of the FRAC was also carried out followed by the analysis of the FRAC for its antiosteoporotic and anticancer potentials. The antiosteoporotic activity of FRAC was investigated in ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats. The cytotoxicity effect was determined in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the FRAC was performed to determine its various phytoconstituents. Docking analysis was performed to verify the interaction of bioactive molecules with estrogen receptors (ERs). The FRAC significantly improved various biomechanical and biochemical parameters in a dose-dependent manner in the ovariectomized rats. FRAC also controlled the increased body weight and decreased uterus weight following ovariectomy in rats. Histopathology of the femur demonstrated the restoration of typical bone structure and trabecular width in ovariectomized animals after treatment with FRAC and raloxifene. The FRAC also exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity in the breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (SKOV-3) cancer cells. Furthermore, genistein and daidzein exhibited a high affinity towards both estrogen receptors (α and β) in the docking study revealing the probable mechanism of the antiosteoporotic activity. GC/MS analysis confirmed the presence of other bioactive molecules such as stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, and stigmasta-3,5-dien-7-one. The FRAC from Pueraria tuberosa has potential for treatment of menopausal osteoporosis. Also, the FRAC possesses anticancer activity.",

The influence of experimental parameters, such as pollutant concentration, contact time, and pH, on the adsorption properties of M-FRAC was studied in detail. The adsorption process was highly dependent on pH and initial contaminant concentration. All pollutant adsorption was favorable under acidic conditions.

The adsorption processes of pollutants on M-FRAC were in accordance with the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetics model. In addition, M-FRAC could be readily separated from solution by applying an external magnetic field.

Shoots with cankers, pycnidia, and dieback were collected from six locations around the state. Isolates obtained from these samples were identified as Botryosphaeria obtusa, Phomopsis amygdali, Leucostoma persoonii, and Cytospora sp., based on colony morphology, conidia size and shape, and ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. L. persoonii was the most prevalent species and was isolated in five of the six locations, followed by P. amygdali and B. obtusa. The sensitivity of representative isolates of B. obtusa, P. amygdali, and L. persoonii to fungicides of different FRAC codes was evaluated. All species tested were sensitive to thiophanate-methyl (FRAC 1) and pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin (both FRAC 11), whereas all species were resistant to boscalid and fluopyram (both FRAC 7). P. amygdali and B. obtusa were sensitive to difenoconazole and propiconazole (both FRAC 3), whereas L. persoonii was moderately resistant. L. persoonii was the most virulent species based on expansion of mycelium in the cambium layer of 2-year-old, detached twig pieces. Bacterial spot (BS)-sensitive cultivar 'O'Henry' was most susceptible to B. obtusa compared with BS-sensitive 'Summerprince', brown rot (BR)-resistant 'Contender', and BR-sensitive 'Coronet' but was least susceptible to L. persoonii. Coronet was most susceptible to L. persoonii. There were no significant differences between susceptibility of the cultivars to P. amygdali. This study established that L. persoonii is currently the most frequent twig blight pathogen in South Carolina, perhaps owing to its superior fitness. Some fungicides were effective in controlling all twig blight pathogens and may therefore be useful for chemical management strategies. Our study also provides the first evidence that the genetic basis of resistance to BS and BR in peach trees is not necessarily linked to tolerance to wood pathogens.",

Preferential siting of new industrial facilities in poor areas or in areas with few regulatory restrictions can have implications for environmental sustainability, human health, and social justice. This study focuses on frac sand mining-the mining of high-quality silica sand used in hydraulic fracturing processes for gas and oil extraction. Frac sand mining gained prominence in the 2000s in the upper midwestern United States where nonmetallic mining is regulated primarily by local zoning. I asked whether frac sand mines were more commonly sited in rural townships without formal zoning regulations or planning processes than in those that undertook zoning and planning before the frac sand boom. I also asked if mine prevalence was correlated with socioeconomic differences across townships. After creating a probability surface to map areas most suitable for frac sand mine occurrence, I developed neutral landscape models from which to compare actual mine distributions in zoned and unzoned areas at three different spatial extents. Mines were significantly clustered in unzoned jurisdictions at the statewide level and in 7 of the 8 counties with at least three frac sand mines and some unzoned land. Subsequent regression analyses showed mine prevalence to be uncorrelated with land value, tax rate, or per capita income, but correlated with remoteness and zoning. The predicted mine count in unzoned townships was over two times higher than that in zoned townships. However, the county with the most mines by far was under a county zoning ordinance, perhaps indicating industry preferences for locations with clear, homogenous rules over patchwork regulation. Rural communities can use the case of frac sand mining as motivation to discuss and plan for sudden land-use predicaments, rather than wait to grapple with unfamiliar legal processes during a period of intense conflict.

Despite years of focused research knowledge of falls aetiology is poor. This may be partly due to classification approaches which conventionally report fall frequency. This nosology is blunt, and does not take into account causality or the circumstances in which the fall occurred. For example, it is likely that people who fall from a postural transition are phenotypically different to those who fall during high level activities. Recent evidence supports the use of a novel falls classification based on fall related activity, however its clinimetric properties have not yet been tested. This study describes further development of the Fall-Related Activity Classification (FRAC) and reports on its inter-rater reliability (IRR). Descriptors of the FRAC were refined through an iterative process with a multidisciplinary team. Three categories based on the activity preceding the fall were identified. PD fallers were categorised as: (1) advanced (2) combined or (3) transitional. Fifty-five fall scenarios were rated by 23 raters using a standardised process. Raters comprised 3 clinical subgroups: (1) physiotherapists, (2) physicians, (3) non-medical researchers. IRR analysis was performed using weighted kappa coefficients and included sub group analysis based on clinical speciality. Excellent agreement was reached for all clinicians, κ=0.807 (95% CI 0.732 to 0.870). Clinical subgroups performed similarly well (range of κ=0.780 to 0.822). The FRAC can be reliably used to classify falls. This may discriminate between phenotypically different fallers and subsequently strengthen falls predictors in future studies.",

Three technical processes should be differentiated when evaluating human health risks, namely (1) drilling of the borehole, (2) hydraulic stimulation, and (3) gas or oil production. During the drilling phase, emissions such as NO<subx</sub, NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds) as precursors for tropospheric ozone formation, and SO<subx</sub have been shown to be higher compared to the subsequent phases. In relation to hydraulic stimulation, the toxicity of frac fluids is of relevance. More than 1100 compounds have been identified as components. A trend is to use fewer, less hazardous and more biodegradable substances; however, the use of hydrocarbons, such as kerosene and diesel, is still allowed in the USA. Methane in drinking water is of low toxicological relevance but may indicate inadequate integrity of the gas well. There is a great concern regarding the contamination of ground- and surface water during the production phase. Water that flows to the surface from oil and gas wells, so-called 'produced water', represents a mixture of flow-back, the injected frac fluid returning to the surface, and the reservoir water present in natural oil and gas deposits. Among numerous hazardous compounds, produced water may contain bromide, arsenic, strontium, mercury, barium, radioactive isotopes and organic compounds, particularly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX). The sewage outflow, even from specialized treatment plants, may still contain critical concentrations of barium, strontium and arsenic. Evidence suggests that the quality of groundwater and surface water may be compromised by disposal of produced water. Particularly critical is the use of produced water for watering of agricultural areas, where persistent compounds may accumulate. Air contamination can occur as a result of several HF-associated activities. In addition to BTEX, 20 HF-associated air contaminants are group 1A or 1B carcinogens according to the IARC. In the U.S., oil and gas production (including conventional production) represents the second largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions. High-quality epidemiological studies are required, especially in light of recent observations of an association between childhood leukemia and multiple myeloma in the neighborhood of oil and gas production sites. In conclusion, (1) strong evidence supports the conclusion that frac fluids can lead to local environmental contamination; (2) while changes in the chemical composition of soil, water and air are likely to occur, the increased levels are still often below threshold values for safety; (3) point source pollution due to poor maintenance of wells and pipelines can be monitored and remedied; (4) risk assessment should be based on both hazard and exposure evaluation; (5) while the concentrations of frac fluid chemicals are low, some are known carcinogens; therefore, thorough, well-designed studies are needed to assess the risk to human health with high certainty; (6) HF can represent a health risk via long-lasting contamination of soil and water, when strict safety measures are not rigorously applied.",

Tank mixes of demethylation-inhibiting (DMI; Fungicide Resistance Action Committee [FRAC] group 3) or quinone outside inhibitor (QoI; FRAC group 11) fungicides with chlorothalonil (FRAC group M5) at full or reduced rates were evaluated for effectiveness against A. anomala. The use of chlorothalonil in a mix with a DMI or QoI fungicide was an effective treatment for EFB even if each component of the mix was at half the labeled rate. Different liquid or dry formulations of chlorothalonil were equally effective in a tank mix for EFB control. The combination of propiconazole (FRAC group 3) tank mixed with trifloxystrobin (FRAC group 11) was not effective, whereas trees treated with propiconazole tank mixed with pyraclostrobin (FRAC group 11) resulted in significantly fewer EFB cankers compared with nontreated trees. When using tank mixes for EFB management, DMI fungicides should remain at full rates while mixing with a half-rate of chlorothalonil. In contrast, QoI fungicides and chlorothalonil could both be used at half-rates and still maintain acceptable EFB control. Tank mixing chlorothalonil with fungicides at risk of resistance development can help maintain consistent EFB control and should help prevent or delay the emergence of fungicide-resistant A. anomala isolates.",

Availability of original observations enabled individual participant data meta-analysis. Differences in control of powdery mildew on leaves and cones were apparent among fungicide FRAC groups when individual products were evaluated over the course of a growing season. FRAC groups 13, 3, and U13 provided the most efficacious control of powdery mildew on leaves. Percent disease control on cones was influenced by midseason foliar disease and fungicide mode-of-action. FRAC 13 provided significantly better disease control on cones than all other groups except U13, 3, and premixes of 7 with 11. Disease control on leaves was similar when a rotational program of fungicides was used, independent of the modes of action, but improved on cones if FRAC groups 13 and 3 were both included compared with programs consisting of FRAC groups 11 and 3, 11 and 5, or 3 and 5. Disease control on cones was improved from 32 to 52%, on average, when the fungicide quinoxyfen (FRAC 13) was applied at least once during the early stages of cone development, defined in this analysis as 20 July to 10 August, as compared with all other treatments. Efficacy of disease control on cones by quinoxyfen was moderated by and interacted with the incidence of leaves with powdery mildew. Disease control on cones was further improved if two applications of quinoxyfen were made during this period. Collectively, these findings suggest that disease control during juvenile stages of cone development largely influences the success of fungicide programs and point to the critical importance of focusing management efforts during this stage of development, independent of what actual management strategy is employed.",

Resistance to FRAC-1 (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee-1) chemistries is associated with mutations in amino acid position 198 in the β-tubulin gene. In our study, we conducted a meta-analysis of β-tubulin sequences to infer temporal, spatial, plant host, and pathogen genus patterns of fungicide resistance in postharvest fungal pathogens. In total, data were acquired from 2,647 specimens from 12 genera of fungal phytopathogens residing in 53 countries on &gt;200 hosts collected between 1926 and 2020. The specimens containing a position 198 mutation were globally distributed in a variety of pathosystems. Analyses showed that there are associations among the mutation and the year an isolate was collected, the pathogen genus, the pathogen host, and the collection region. Interestingly, fungicide-resistant β-tubulin genotypes have been in a decline since their peak between 2005 and 2009. FRAC-1 fungicide usage data followed a similar pattern in that applications have been in a decline since their peak between 1997 and 2003. The data show that, with the reduction of selection pressure, FRAC-1 fungicide resistance in fungal populations will decline within 5 to 10 years. Based on this line of evidence, we contend that a β-tubulin position 198 mutation has uncharacterized fitness cost(s) on fungi in nature. The compiled dataset can inform end users on the regions and hosts that are most prone to contain resistant pathogens and assist decisions concerning fungicide resistance management strategies.",

Good solutions to this task have applications in fraud and intrusion detection. The unsupervised anomaly detection task is different: Given unlabeled, mostly-normal data, identify the anomalies among them. Many real-world machine learning tasks, including many fraud and intrusion detection tasks, are unsupervised because it is impractical (or impossible) to verify all of the training data. We recently presented FRaC, a new approach for semi-supervised anomaly detection. FRaC is based on using normal instances to build an ensemble of feature models, and then identifying instances that disagree with those models as anomalous. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of FRaC experimentally and explain why FRaC is so successful.

The fraC operon transcript partially overlaps gene all2395, which lies in the opposite DNA strand and ends 1 bp beyond fraE. Gene all2395 produces transcripts of 1.35 kb (major transcript) and 2.2 kb (minor transcript) that overlap fraE and whose expression is dependent on the N-control transcription factor NtcA. Insertion of a gene cassette containing transcriptional terminators between fraE and all2395 prevented production of the antisense RNAs and resulted in an increased length of the cyanobacterial filaments. Deletion of all2395 resulted in a larger increase of filament length and in impaired growth, mainly under N2-fixing conditions and specifically on solid medium. We denote all2395 the fraF gene, which encodes a protein restricting filament length. A FraF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein accumulated significantly in heterocysts. Similar to some heterocyst differentiation-related proteins such as HglK, HetL, and PatL, FraF is a pentapeptide repeat protein. We conclude that the fraC-fraD-fraE←fraF gene cluster (where the arrow indicates a change in orientation), in which cis antisense RNAs are produced, regulates morphology by encoding proteins that influence positively (FraC, FraD, FraE) or negatively (FraF) the length of the filament mainly under conditions of nitrogen deprivation.

However, it is becoming more evident that there are multiple layers of post-transcriptional gene regulation that greatly impact protein output (Battle et al., Science 347:664-667, 2014; Khan et al., Science 342:1100-1104, 2013; Vogel et al., Mol Syst Biol 6:400, 2010). Alternative splicing (AS) impacts the expression of protein coding genes in several ways. Firstly, AS increases exponentially the coding-capacity of genes generating multiple transcripts from the same genomic sequence. Secondly, alternatively spliced mRNAs are subjected differentially to RNA-degradation via pathways such as nonsense mediated decay (AS-NMD) or microRNAs (Shyu et al., EMBO J 27:471-481, 2008). And thirdly, cytoplasmic export from the nucleus and translation are regulated in an isoform-specific manner, adding an extra layer of regulation that impacts the protein output of the cell (Martin and Ephrussi, Cell 136:719-730, 2009; Sterne-Weiler et al., Genome Res 23:1615-1623, 2013). These data highlight the need of a method that allows analyzing both the nuclear events (AS) and the cytoplasmic fate (polyribosome-binding) of individual mRNA isoforms.In order to determine how alternative splicing determines the polyribosome association of mRNA isoforms we developed Frac-seq. Frac-seq combines subcellular fractionation and high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Frac-seq gives a window onto the translational fate of specific alternatively spliced isoforms on a genome-wide scale. There is evidence of preferential translation of specific mRNA isoforms (Coldwell and Morley, Mol Cell Biol 26:8448-8460, 2006; Sanford et al., Genes Dev 18:755-768; Zhong et al., Mol Cell 35:1-10, 2009; Michlewski et al., Mol Cell 30:179-189, 2008); the advantage of Frac-seq is that it allows analyzing the binding of alternatively spliced isoforms to polyribosomes and comparing their relative abundance to the cytosolic fraction. Polyribosomes are resolved by sucrose gradient centrifugation of cytoplasmic extracts, subsequent reading and extraction. The total mRNA fraction is taken prior ultracentrifugation as a measure of all mRNAs present in the sample. Both populations of RNAs are then isolated using phenol-chloroform precipitation; polyadenylated RNAs are selected and converted into libraries and sequenced. Bioinformatics analysis is then performed to measure alternatively spliced isoforms; several tools can be used such as MISO, RSEM, or Cufflinks (Katz et al., Nat Methods 7:1009-1015, 2010; Li and Dewey, BMC Bioinformatics 12:323, 2011; Trapnell et al., Nat Protoc 7:562-578, 2012). Comparison of total mRNAs and polyribosome-bound mRNAs can be used as a measure of the polyribosome association of specific isoforms based on the presence/absence of specific alternative splicing events in each fraction. Frac-seq shows that not all isoforms from a gene are equally loaded into polyribosomes, that mRNA preferential loading does not always correlate to its expression in the cytoplasm and that the presence of specific events such as microRNA binding sites or Premature Termination Codons determine the loading of specific isoforms into polyribosomes.",

Here, we present a series of new experiments and a modification to this equation to model the dissolution of a two-component oil-mixture microdroplet into a second immiscible solvent in which the two materials of the droplet have different solubilities. The model is based on a reduced surface area approximation and the assumption of ideal homogeneous mixing [mass flux d(m(i))/dt = A(frac(i))D(i)(c(i) - c(s)){(1/R) + (1/(πD(i)t)(1/2)}] where A(frac(i)) is the area fraction of component i, c(i) and c(s) are the initial and saturation concentrations of the droplet material in the surrounding medium, R is the radius of the droplet, t is time, and D(i) is the coefficient of diffusion of component i in the surrounding medium. This new model has been tested by the use of a two-chamber micropipet-based method, which measured the dissolution of single individual microdroplets of mutually miscible liquid mixtures (ethyl acetate/butyl acetate and butyl acetate/amyl acetate) in water.

We conducted a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled, clinical trial in subjects with a history of colonic neoplasia who manifested altered SPEC/FRAC in histologically normal colonic mucosa. Subjects (n=79) were randomised to 325 mg aspirin or placebo. The primary endpoint changed in FRAC and SPEC spectral markers after 3 months. Mucosal levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A6 genotypes were planned secondary endpoints. At 3 months, the aspirin group manifested alterations in SPEC (48.9%, p=0.055) and FRAC (55.4%, p=0.200) with the direction towards non-neoplastic status. As a measure of aspirin's pharmacological efficacy, we assessed changes in rectal PGE2 levels and noted that it correlated with SPEC and FRAC alterations (R=-0.55, p=0.01 and R=0.57, p=0.009, respectively) whereas there was no significant correlation in placebo specimens. While UGT1A6 subgroup analysis did not achieve statistical significance, the changes in SPEC and FRAC to a less neoplastic direction occurred only in the variant consonant with epidemiological evidence of chemoprevention.

The three regions use different numbers of ro-vibrational basis functions, especially the long-range region, which uses only one function corresponding to the initial ro-vibrational state. Thus, a very large grid range can be used to characterize long de Broglie wavelengths in scattering coordinates.

The correlation between the de Broglie wavelength related to the thermal motion and the potential barrier width and height is reported. The stochastic jumps of light atoms (hydrogen, deuterium) between two equilibrium sites A and B (identical geometry) occur via different pathways; one pathway is over the barrier (classical dynamics), and the other one is through the barrier (tunneling). On the over-the-barrier pathway, there are no obstacles for the de Broglie waves, and this pathway exists from high to low temperatures up to 0 K because the thermal energy is subjected to the Maxwell distribution and a certain number of particles owns enough energy for the hopping over the barrier. On the tunneling pathway, the particles pass through the barrier, or they are reflected from the barrier. Only particles with the energy lower than barrier heights are able to perform a tunneling hopping. The de Broglie waves related to these energies are longer than the barrier width. The Schrödinger equation is applied to calculate the rate constant of tunneling dynamics. The Maxwell distribution of the thermal energy has been taken into account to calculate the tunneling rate constant. The equations for the total spectral density of complex motion derived earlier by us together with the expression for the tunneling rate constant, derived in the present paper, are used in analysis of the temperature dependence of deuteron spin-lattice relaxation of the ammonium ion in the deuterated analogue of ammonium hexachloroplumbate ((ND4)2PbCl6). It has been established that the equation CpTtun = EH (thermal energy equals activation energy), where Cp is the molar heat capacity (temperature-dependent, known from literature), determines directly the low temperature Ttun at which the de Broglie wavelength, lambdadeBroglie, related to the thermal energy, CpT, is equal to the potential barrier width, L. Above Ttun, the lambdadeBroglie wavelength related to the CpT energy is shorter than the potential barrier width and not able to overcome the barrier. The activation energy EH equals 7.5 kJ/mol, and therefore, the Ttun temperature for deuterons in ((ND4)2PbCl6 is 55.7 K. The agreement between the potential barrier width following from the simple geometrical calculations (L = 0.722 A) and de Broglie wavelength at Ttun (L = 0.752 A) is good. The temperature plots of the deuteron correlation times for (ND4)2PbCl6 reveal comparable values of the correlation times of the tunneling, (tau(T)), and over-the-barrier jumps (tau(H)) near 34.8 K. Matsuo, on the basis of the molar heat capacity study, found the first-order phase transition at this temperature.",

The spin pairs of the protons or deuterons of the methyl group perform a complex motion consisting of three component motions. Two of them involve mass transportation over the barrier and through the barrier. They are characterized by k((H)) (Arrhenius) and k((T)) (Schrödinger) rate constants, respectively. The third motion causes fluctuations of the frequencies (nomega(I)+/-omega(T)) and it is related to the lifetime of the methyl spin at the energy level influenced by the rotor-bath interactions. These interactions induce rapid transitions, changing the symmetry of the torsional sublevels either from A to E or from E(a) to E(b). The correlation function for this third motion (k((omega)) rate constant) has been proposed by Müller-Warmuth et al. The spectral densities of the methyl group hindered rotation (k((H)), k((T)) and k((omega)) rate constants) differ from the spectral densities of the proton transfer (k((H)) and k((T)) rate constants) because three compound motions contribute to the complex motion of the methyl group. The recently derived equation [Formula: see text] , where [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are the fraction and energy of particles with energies from zero to E(H), is taken into account in the calculations of the spectral densities. This equation follows from Maxwell's distribution of thermal energy. The spectral densities derived are applied to analyse the experimental temperature dependencies of proton and deuteron spin-lattice relaxation rate in solids containing the methyl group. A wide range of temperatures from zero Kelvin up to the melting point is considered. It has been established that the motion characterized by k((omega)) influences the spin-lattice relaxation up to the temperature T(tun) only. This temperature is directly determined by the equation C(p)T=E(H) (thermal energy=activation energy), where C(p) is the molar heat capacity. Probably the cessation of the third motion is a result of the de Broglie wavelength related to this motion becoming too short. As shown recently, the potential barrier can be an obstacle for the de Broglie wave. The theoretical equations derived in this paper are compared to those known in the literature.",

This is attributed to the difference in the de Broglie wavelengths of the isotopes. Once inside the crystals, transport of both isotopes can be described by classical diffusion, albeit with unexpectedly fast rates comparable to that of protons in water.

We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect on Na/Ca exchange of interventions affecting Ca2+ flux through SR. Experiments were performed in single, isolated myocytes of guinea-pig and rat hearts loaded with Indo 1-AM and free Ca2+ concentration was assessed by measuring the ratio of fluorescence at 405 and 495 nm wavelength. In guinea-pig 1.0 microM ryanodine (Ry), expected to increase Ca2+ flux through the SR, decreased the amplitude of electrically stimulated Ca2+ transients by 35% and inhibited their initial, rapid phase. Responses of these cells to brief superfusions with 15 mM caffeine were inhibited which suggests that 1.0 microM Ry depleted the SR Ca2+ stores. Diastolic Ca2+ concentration was slightly increased, but it dropped below control during prolonged rest. Decrease of the amplitude of the transients in these ryanodine-treated cells were reversed by 2 x 10(-7) M thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase, by 1.0 mM Ry, a blocker of the SR Ca2+ release channels and by low Na+ (50.0 mM) superfusion. This suggests that the decreased transients in 1.0 microM Ry result from uptake of Ca2+ by the SR and its rapid release to the subsarcolemmal (cleft) space where a fraction is diverted out of the cell via Na/Ca exchange before it can diffuse to the myofilaments. Removal of the SR from the pathway (addition of TG on 1.0 mM Ry) or reversal of Na/Ca exchange diverts more transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx to the myofilaments and increases the Ca2+ transient. Decrease of the resting Ca2+ concentration was blocked by 2 x 10(-7) M TG, 1.0 mM Ry, and by 5.0 mM Ni2+, a blocker of Na/Ca exchange. This result suggests that the effect of 1.0 microM Ry on resting Ca2+ concentration also resulted from increase of flux of Ca2+ through the SR and out of the cell by Na/Ca exchange. In rat 1.0 microM Ry decreased amplitude of the transients by approximately 75% but did not affect their kinetics. TG and 1.0 mM Ry decreased the rate of rise of the transients and greatly delayed their decay. This result suggests that normal kinetics of the transients in the cells treated with 1.0 microM Ry depended on the preserved Ca2+ flux through the SR. As SR was not able to retain Ca2+ in these cells, decay of the transients must have depended on stimulated Na/Ca exchange. The results in guinea-pig and rat taken together are compatible with the proposal that Ca2+ released from the SR interacts with the cell's Na/Ca exchanger most probably within the newly defined subsarcolemmal \"Na/Ca exchange-dependent Ca2+ compartment\".",

These couplings shift the wave phases, often in an uncontrolled way, and the resulting decoherence, or loss of phase integrity, is thought to be a main cause of the transition from quantum to classical behavior. How much interaction is needed to induce this transition? Here we show that a photoelectron and two protons form a minimum particle/slit system and that a single additional electron constitutes a minimum environment. Interference fringes observed in the angular distribution of a single electron are lost through its Coulomb interaction with a second electron, though the correlated momenta of the entangled electron pair continue to exhibit quantum interference.",

In the imaginary time path integral formalism, each atom is mapped onto a \"ring polymer\" whose spread is related to the quantum mechanical uncertainty in the particle's position, i.e., its thermal wavelength. A number of metrics have previously been used to investigate and characterize this spread and explain effects arising from quantum delocalization, zero-point energy, and tunneling. Many of these shape metrics consider just the instantaneous structure of the ring polymers. However, given the significant interest in methods such as centroid molecular dynamics and ring polymer molecular dynamics that link the molecular dynamics of these ring polymers to real time properties, there exists significant opportunity to exploit metrics that also allow for the study of the fluctuations of the atom delocalization in time. Here we consider the ring polymer delocalization from the perspective of computational topology, specifically persistent homology, which describes the 3-dimensional arrangement of point cloud data, (i.e. atomic positions). We employ the Betti sequence probability distribution to define the ensemble of shapes adopted by the ring polymer. The Wasserstein distances of Betti sequences adjacent in time are used to characterize fluctuations in shape, where the Fourier transform and associated principal components provides added information differentiating atoms with different NQEs based on their dynamic properties. We demonstrate this methodology on two representative systems, a glassy system consisting of two atom types with dramatically different de Broglie thermal wavelengths, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of an aqueous 4 M HCl solution where the H-atoms are differentiated based on their participation in proton transfer reactions.",

For purposes of establishing the reaction, ignore the final stages and concentrate on the initial 10-20% of the reaction at first. A globally optimized model may be based on a faulty assumption for the initial steps. Thus, although the whole data set may look reasonably well fit, the reaction could be misrepresented, and thus the fit unhelpful if accuracy at the later stages has come at the expense of the initial phase of the reaction. 2. What is the time course of the initial reaction? (A) Is the reaction exponential? Exponential growth gives dramatic lag times (see Fig. 3), whereas nonexponential \"lag times\" have a visible signal from time 0 (i.e., Fig. 2). If the data set shows the abrupt appearance of signals after a period of quiescence, the chances are excellent that the time course is exponential. High sensitivity measurement of the signal at times during the lag phase should be used to confirm the exponential nature quantitatively. Exponential reactions mean a secondary pathway is operative. (a) A cascade (tn) can look similar to an exponential, but may proceed from a multistep single-path reaction. Thus the exponential needs to be ascertained with some accuracy. (b) It is possible that some or all of the lag results from a stochastic process, i.e., formation of a single nucleus being observed. This, however, is likely to be accompanied by a secondary process, as few techniques are sensitive enough to detect a single polymer at a time, and having one nucleus form many polymers is a hallmark of a secondary process. Thus, the reproducibility of the kinetics must be established to rule out stochastics. If data show wide variation, stochastic methods as described earlier may be employed. (c) Given a secondary process, one must separate the primary nucleation process from the secondary process (by stochastic means or by use of the product B2A, as described earlier). (B) If the reaction does not begin with an exponential, is it parabolic? If so, it falls in the general class of linear polymerizations. 3. What is the concentration dependence of the reaction(s)? This will separate nucleation processes from growth, and so on. 4. If the initial reaction is neither exponential nor parabolic, a reaction mechanism needs to be proposed and evaluated. Solving the resulting equations is best done by linearization, which has the best chance of giving equations whose solutions and their sensitivity to parameters are readily understood. If this proves fruitful, full numeric solutions may be useful. 5. At this point, the full reaction may be considered to completion. 6. The physical basis of the description (sizes of parameters and their dependencies) needs to be finally considered to ensure that the mathematical success of the description rests on tenable physical grounds.",

Exchange of extracellular free calcium with the bathing medium takes several minutes and closely parallels contractile response in this preparation. Under conditions favoring a rapid positive force staircase response during repetitive stimulation after a long rest period (2-10 minutes), cumulative depletions of extracellular calcium can clearly be differentiated from motion artifact due to muscle movement by multiple-wavelength spectrophotometry. Responses of similar magnitude and characteristics are obtained with both dyes employed. In the presence of 10(-7) M isoproterenol, the mean extracellular calcium concentration falls by at least 5% (0.25-0.8 mM total calcium concentration) in four beats at 0.5 Hz; extracellular calcium replenishes during rest with an apparent t1/2 of 25-60 seconds. A 10-minute pretreatment with 10(-8) M ryanodine greatly reduces the contraction force and motion artifact of the first beat after a rest period, whereby the magnitude of depletion response to one post-rest stimulation is increased 2- to 3-fold. With further ryanodine treatment, the magnitude of depletion responses remains stable, and the rate of calcium replenishment during rest increases many-fold. After ryanodine treatment and 10(-7) M isoproterenol, at least 10% of total dye accessible calcium (0.25-1.0 mM) is lost during two to five rapid stimulations, and returns to the extracellular space within 20 seconds of rest. Cumulative extracellular calcium depletion responses are strongly suppressed by 10(-6) M nifedipine. Cumulative depletion responses are also inhibited by 10 mM caffeine, whereby contraction and corresponding motion artifacts are increased at post-rest stimulation.",

This work was prompted by the recent observations that small numbers of patients treated with hypertension develop QTc prolongation, rarely associated with torsades de pointes. At 1.0 Hz stimulation, ketanserin, 10(-5) and 10(-4) M, prolonged the action potential duration (APD) (by 20% and 29%, respectively) and voltage-dependent refractoriness.

Chronic administration of ketanserin (40 mg/kg/day, intramuscularly) caused a significant prolongation of APD (106%; p less than 0.01) and voltage-dependent refractoriness without effects on the action potential amplitude, resting membrane potential, and Vmax.

We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans.

It endows particles with definite positions at all times. Their evolution is governed by a deterministic dynamics. By construction, however, the individual particle trajectories generically defy detectability in principle. Of late, this lore might seem to have been called into question in light of so-called weak measurements. Due to their characteristic weak coupling between the measurement device and the system under study, they permit the experimental probing of quantum systems without essentially disturbing them. It is natural therefore to think that weak measurements of velocity in particular offer to actually observe the particle trajectories. If true, such a claim would not only experimentally demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics: it would provide support of dBBT in its standard form, singling it out from an infinitude of empirically equivalent alternative choices for the particle dynamics. Here we examine this possibility. Our result is deflationary: weak velocity measurements constitute no new arguments, let alone empirical evidence, in favour of standard dBBT; One must not naïvely identify weak and actual positions. Weak velocity measurements admit of a straightforward standard quantum mechanical interpretation, independent of any commitment to particle trajectories and velocities. This is revealed by a careful reconstruction of the physical arguments on which the description of weak velocity measurements rests. It turns out that for weak velocity measurements to be reliable, one must already presuppose dBBT in its standard form: in this sense, they can provide no new argument, empirical or otherwise, for dBBT and its standard guidance equation.",

The effects of tetraethylammonium (TEA) and zinc ions on the resting conductance of frog muscle were examined using a method which permitted control of the membrane potential near the end of a muscle fibre and measurement of an approximation of the membrane current.2. TEA reduced the amplitude of the inactivating inward current obtained on hyperpolarizing, both when this was measured as initial current [I(m)(0)] less the estimated chloride current and as [I(m)(0) - I(m)(infinity)]. 115 mM-TEA reduced the amplitude of [I(m)(0) - I(m)(infinity)] by about 85%.3. TEA had little effect on the time constant with which the inward potassium currents inactivated. This finding appeared to be in conflict with the view that the inactivation is due to depletion of potassium from the T-system, though the results in standard Ringer were in good agreement with such an hypothesis.4. In the standard chloride Ringer, the resting membrane resistance was 3530 Omega cm(2). 115 mM-TEA increased this 1.6 times to 5580 Omega cm(2).5. The effect of TEA on voltage-current relations obtained in high K(2)SO(4) solutions was also examined. With large pulses, the voltage-current relations in TEA and control solutions tended to become linear. This linear part could be extrapolated and subtracted from the voltage-current relation.6. TEA, at a concentration of 150 mM, reversibly reduced by 88% the amplitude of the currents obtained during both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing pulses; this figure was obtained after subtraction of the linear part of the relation, which was itself unaffected by TEA and which represented a resistance of 5600 Omega cm(2).7. The reductions in the inactivating potassium current and in the current flowing through the inwardly rectifying potassium channel in high K(2)SO(4) solutions fit, fairly closely, a concentration-effect relation for TEA with a dissociation constant of 20 x 10(-3)M.8. Also investigated were the slow time-dependent changes in membrane potential occurring when [K](o) is altered from 2.5 to 10 mM at constant chloride (120 mM). The findings were consistent with the view that TEA reduced the potassium conductance without much effect on the chloride conductance. In particular, when muscles equilibrated for 1 hr in 10 mM-K Ringer were returned to 2.5 mM-K, the initial rate of repolarization was reduced, even though the driving force on K was slightly larger than in the control experiment.9. Zinc ions appeared to be without effect either on the amplitude of the inactivating potassium current obtained when square hyperpolarizing pulses were applied to the fibre membrane, or on its time constant.10. In standard Tris-buffered Ringer, the membrane resistance was 3350 Omega cm(2). Zinc Ringer (2.5 mM) increased this rather more than twice to 6830 Omega cm(2).11. It is concluded that the two agents, TEA(+) and Zn(2+), which both reduce delayed potassium currents in muscle, act in different ways on the resting conductance of frog muscle.",

On large scales, it behaves gravitationally like cold dark matter deviating only by a cutoff in the initial power spectrum and can be studied using N-body methods. In contrast, wave interference effects near the de Broglie scale result in new phenomena unique to FDM. Interfering modes in filaments and halos yield a stochastically oscillating granular structure which condenses into solitonic cores during halo formation. Investigating these highly nonlinear wave phenomena requires the spatially resolved numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. In previous papers we introduced a hybrid zoom-in scheme that combines N-body methods to model the large-scale gravitational potential around and the mass accretion onto pre-selected halos with simulations of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation to capture wave-like effects inside these halos. In this work, we present a new, substantially improved reconstruction method for the wave function inside of previously collapsed structures. We demonstrate its capabilities with a deep zoom-in simulation of a well-studied sub-L_{*}-sized galactic halo from cosmological initial conditions. With a particle mass of m=2.5×10^{-22}  eV and halo mass M_{vir}=1.7×10^{11}  M_{⊙} in a (60  h^{-1} comoving Mpc)^{3} cosmological box, it reaches an effective resolution of 20 comoving pc. This pushes the values of m and M accessible to simulations significantly closer to those relevant for studying galaxy evolution in the allowed range of FDM masses.",

Ventilation was obtained breath-to-breath by integration of a pneumotachygraph signal, and cardiac output beat-to-beat by a new development of the Doppler technique. Results were bin-averaged in 4 s bins over the first 20 s, and compared to resting values. Both ventilation and cardiac output increased significantly in the first 2 s. This initial rise in ventilation was due entirely to an increase in rate, the subsequent rise mainly to increase in tidal volume. Cardiac output increased predominantly through change in rate with smaller increases in stroke volume. A striking feature was a tendency for ventilation and cardiac output responses to be biphasic with an initial rise followed by a slight fall at the 14 s mark, and a subsequent rise, at all work loads. Overall correlation between ventilation and cardiac output was therefore high (r = 0.92). Six normal subjects hyperventilated for 45 s voluntarily, (a) at rate 24/min and normal tidal volume; (b) at normal rate and tidal volume of 1.5 l; (c) at rate 24/min and tidal volume of 1.5 l.

The activity of creatine kinase in intact anaerobic frog muscle at 4 degrees C at rest and during contraction was investigated by using saturation-transfer 31P n.m.r. 2. At rest, the measured forward (phosphocreatine to ATP) reaction flux was 1.7 X 10(-3) M . s-1 and the backward flux was 1.2 X 10(-3) M . s-1. The large magnitude of both fluxes shows that creatine kinase is active in resting muscle, so the observed constancy of [phosphocreatine] demonstrates that the enzyme and its substrates are at equilibrium. 3. The apparent discrepancy between the fluxes must arise largely from an underestimation of the backward flux resulting from interaction of ATP with other systems, e.g. via adenylate kinase. For purposes of further calculation we have therefore adopted 1.6 X 10(-3) M . s-1 as an estimate of both fluxes. 4. During contraction, when the creatine kinase reaction is no longer at equilibrium, the net rate of phosphocreatine breakdown, estimated directly from the change in area of the inorganic phosphate peak, was 0.75 X 10(-3) M . s-1. Saturation transfer indicates that the forward reaction flux remains at approx. 1.6 X 10(-3) M . s-1 and the backward flux decreases to about 0.85 X 10(-3) M . s-1. 5. The activity of creatine kinase during contraction is large enough to account for the well-established observation that, during contraction, the concentration of ATP falls by less than 2-3%. The reaction catalysed by creatine kinase is driven forward during contraction by the large relative increase in the concentration of free ADP, which is more than doubled. 6. The observation that the forward flux does not increase during contraction and that the backward flux decreases can most simply be explained on the basis of competition of reactants for a limited amount of enzyme.",

First, we use path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to estimate the thermodynamic/static properties of our model quantum fluid, i.e. low-density 4He at 10 K. With PIMC we obtain the experimental equation of state, the single-particle mean kinetic energy, the single-particle density matrix and the single-particle momentum distribution of this system at low densities. We show that our PIMC results are in full agreement with experimental data obtained with deep inelastic neutron scattering at high momentum transfers (D. Colognesi, C. Andreani, R. Senesi, Europhys. Lett., 2000, 50, 202). As expected, in this region of the 4He phase diagram, quantum effects modify the width of the single-particle momentum distribution but do not alter its Gaussian shape. Knowing the exact values of density, pressure and single-particle mean kinetic energy for our model quantum fluid, we investigate the limitations of the semiclassical FH effective potentials. We show that commonly used 'short-time' approximations to the high-temperature density matrix due to Feynman and Hibbs can only be applied in a very limited range of the 4He phase diagram. We found that FH effective potentials reproduce the experimental densities of 4He at 10 K for Lambda/a &lt; 0.45 (Lambda = 2.73 A denotes the thermal de Broglie wavelength, a = rho(-1/3) is the mean nearest-neighbor distance in the fluid and rho denotes fluid density). Moreover, semiclassical FH effective potentials are able to correctly predict the single-particle mean kinetic energy of 4He at 10 K in a very limited range of fluid densities, i.e.Lambda/a &lt; 0.17. We show that the ad hoc application of the semiclassical FH effective potentials for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of dense liquid-like para-hydrogen (para-H2) adsorbed in nanoporous materials below 72 K is questionable.",

Applying de- or hyperpolarizing direct currents through one of the two intracellular micro-electrodes the effect of ACh or adrenaline could be observed at different lvels of resting potential.

Quantum chemistry packages enable calculation of complex potential energy surfaces (CPESs). The imaginary part of the CPES is associated with the autoionization decay rate, which is a function of the molecular structure. Molecular dynamics simulations, within the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, require the definition of a force field. The ability to calculate the forces on the nuclei in bio-systems when autoionization takes place seems to rely on an understanding of radiative damages in RNA and DNA arising from the release of slow moving electrons which have long de Broglie wavelengths. This work addresses calculation of the real forces on the nuclei moving on the CPES. By using the transformation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, previously used by Madelung, we proved that the classical forces on nuclei moving on the CPES correlated with the gradient of the real part of the CPES. It was proved that the force on the nuclei of the metastable molecules is time independent although the probability to detect metastable molecules exponentially decays. The classical force is obtained from the transformed Schrödinger equation when ℏ=0 and the Schrödinger equation is reduced to the classical (Newtonian) equations of motion. The forces on the nuclei regardless on what potential energy surface they move (parent CPES or product real PESs) vary in time due to the autoionization process.",

Because the responsible perpendicular third Ω = 1 (1(III)) excited state correlating adiabatically to this product channel has only a weak absorption, the parallel component flux yielding the same products must be comparatively weak, even though the responsible parallel excitations to the 0(+)(III) and/or 0(+)(IV) excited states have strong absorptions. In the present theoretical study, the branching ratios and the anisotropy parameters have been obtained using the spin-orbit configuration interaction method combined with the quantum mechanical wavepacket and semiclassical approaches. Significant quantum interference effect between the two dissociative de Broglie waves on the 0(+)(III) and 0(+)(IV) potential curves has been found through the avoided crossing, and the weak parallel flux to the ground-state product channel has been explained by their destructive interference character.

The decomposition of formic acid consists of two competing pathways, dehydration, and decarboxylation. We use the Gaussian 4 method of the Gaussian09 software to locate and optimize a transition state of the decomposition reaction and obtain the activation energy. The decomposition starts by transferring a proton of a formic acid to a water molecule. The de Broglie wavelength of a proton is similar to the width of the potential barrier of the decomposition reaction at low temperature. The tunneling, in which a proton penetrates the potential barrier, enhances the decomposition rate. Water molecules serve as the catalyst in the decomposition and reduce the activation energy. The relay of a proton from a water molecule to a neighboring water molecule is accomplished with little change of the geometry of a molecule, resulting in the reduction of the activation energy. Two water molecules are actively involved in the decomposition reaction to reduce the activation energy. We have also examined the effect of water clusters with three, four, and five water molecules on the decomposition reaction. The noncovalent distance between a hydrogen atom of a water molecule and an oxygen atom of a neighboring water molecule decreases in a water cluster due to the cooperative many-body interactions. A water molecule in a water cluster becomes a better proton donor as well as a better proton acceptor. The activation energy of the decomposition is further decreased by the catalytic effect of a water cluster. We calculate the reaction rate using the transition state theory corrected by the tunneling effect of a proton. The calculated reaction rate of the decarboxylation is smaller than that of the dehydration when less than three water molecules are included in the simulation. However, the major product of the decomposition of a formic acid becomes carbon dioxide and hydrogen molecule formed by the decarboxylation when a water cluster with more than four water molecules serves as catalyst in the decomposition of formic acid.

Whether the actual migration of neutrophils alters the epithelial permeability is unknown. Through the use of an in vitro model system it was possible to directly determine the effect of neutrophil emigration on the transepithelial electrical resistance of the monolayer. Human neutrophils (5 X 10(6) cells/ml) were placed in the upper compartment of a combined chemotaxis/resistance chamber and stimulated for 40 min by a gradient of 10(-7) M n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine to traverse a confluent monolayer of canine kidney epithelial cells grown on micropore filters. Neither the chemoattractant alone (10(-5)-10(-9) M) nor the accumulation of an average of eight neutrophils per millimeter of epithelium lowered the transepithelial electrical resistance. However, under certain conditions the migration of neutrophils temporarily increased the permeability of the monolayer. The resistance fell approximately 48% within 5 min if the migratory cells were stimulated to reverse their migration across the same monolayer. As re-migration continued, the resistance returned to its initial levels within 60 min. Doubling the initial neutrophil concentration to 10 X 10(6) cells/ml resulted in the accumulation of an average of 66 neutrophils per millimeter of epithelium and an average fall in resistance of 46% (r = 0.98; P less than 0.001) in 40 min. If the resistance had fallen less than 45%, removal of the neutrophils remaining in the upper compartment resulted in a return of the transepithelial electrical resistance to its initial level within 65 min. However, when the fall was greater than 45%, the resistance only recovered to 23.5% of its initial levels within the same time frame. Thus, these results suggest that the integrity of an epithelium can, under certain conditions, be affected by the emigration of neutrophils, but that this effect is either completely or partially reversible within 65 min.",

The preferential orientation of bacteriorhodopsin in opposite directions in the envelope and lipid vesicles allows us to show that uptake of protons occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the purple membrane and release on the exterior side. In suspensions of isolated purple membrane, approximately one proton per cycling bacteriorhodopsin molecule appears transiently in the aqueous phase with a half-rise time of 0.8 ms and a half-decay time of 5.4 ms at 21degreesC. In cell envelope preparations which consist of vesicles with a preferential orientation of purple membrane, as in whole cells, and which pump protons out, the acidification of the medium has a half-rise time of less than 1.0 ms, which partially relaxes in approx. 10 ms and fully relaxes after many seconds. Phospholipid vesicles, which contain bacteriorhodopsin preferentially oriented in the opposite direction and pump protons in, show an alkalinization of the medium with a time constant of approximately 10 ms, preceded by a much smaller and faster acidification. The alkalinization relaxes over many seconds. The initial fast acidification in the lipid vesicles and the fast relaxation in the envelope vesicles are accounted for by the misoriented fractions of bacteriorhodopsin.

The fluorofullerenes therefore set the new mark in complexity and mass (1632 amu) for de Broglie wave experiments, exceeding the previous mass record by a factor of 2.",

This system eliminated the problem of the inaccessible cytoplasmic layer, while preserving many of the electrical characteristics of the intact cells. In 0.1 millimolar external K concentration (K(o) (+)), the resting conductance (membrane conductance G(m), 0.85 +/- 0.25 Siemens per square meter (+/-standard error)) of the single membrane samples, was dominated by the proton pump, as suggested by the response of the near-linear I-V characteristic to changes in external pH. Initial cytoplasmic K(+) activities (a(K+)), judged most reliable, gave values of 117 +/- 67 millimolar; stable a(K+) values were 77 +/- 31 millimolar. Equilibrium potentials for K(+) (Nernst equilibrium potential) (E(K)) calculated, using either of these data sets, were near the mean membrane potential (V(m)). On a cell-to-cell basis, however, E(K) was generally negative of the V(m), despite an electrogenic contribution from the Chara proton pump. When K(o) (+) was increased to 1.0 millimolar or above, G(m) rose (by 8- to 10-fold in 10 millimolar K(o) (+)), the steady state I-V characteristics showed a region of negative slope conductance, and V(m) followed E(K). These results confirm previous studies which implicated a K(o) (+)-induced and voltage-dependent permeability to K(+) at the Chara plasma membrane. They provide an explanation for transitions between apparent K(o) (+)-insensitive and K(o) (+)-sensitive (;K(+) electrode') behavior displayed by the membrane potential, as recorded in many algae and higher plant cells.",

Striking changes occur to the shape of the spikes, to membrane resistance, to the synaptic delay, and to the evoked synaptic potentials. In the presynaptic FETi motor neuron, raising the temperature reduces the amplitude of an antidromic spike recorded in the soma by a factor of 10 (40 mV to 4 mV), reduces the time taken to reach peak amplitude by 5 (3.5 to 0.7 ms) and decreases the duration at half maximum amplitude by 0.5. The conduction velocity of the spike in the axon is increased by 50% from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. Orthodromic spikes are affected by temperature in a similar way to the antidromic spikes. The membrane resistance of both pre- and postsynaptic motor neurons falls as the temperature is raised. The membrane resistance of FETi falls by a factor of 4 (about 4 M omega at 10 degrees C to 1 M omega at 40 degrees C). A contributory component to this fall could be the increase in the frequency of synaptic potentials generated as a result of inputs from other neurons. No temperature dependence could be demonstrated on the voltage threshold relative to resting potential for evoking orthodromic spikes, but because the resistance changes, the current needed to achieve this voltage must be increased at higher temperatures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We carried out a number of quantum chemical simulations to study the decomposition of methanediol in aqueous solution. The decomposition of a methanediol proceeds by transferring a proton from a hydroxyl to an oxygen atom of the other hydroxyl in the methanediol. The decomposition of the methanediol completes after the cleavage of the bond between the formaldehyde and the water molecule. The probability of the proton transfer increases by the quantum mechanical tunneling at the low temperature because the width of the potential barrier for the decomposition becomes similar to the de Broglie wavelength of the proton. We consider the catalytic effect of water molecules in aqueous solution. The structure of the methanediol is not required to change significantly when undergoing decomposition due to the active role of water molecules to transfer a proton. We consider three types of arrangement for water molecules with respect to a methanediol: (1) a ring structure formed by a methanediol and water molecules; (2) a water cluster attracted to a methanediol by hydrogen bonds; and (3) a water cluster and additional water molecules, both of which are attracted to a methanediol by hydrogen bonds. The activation energy for the decomposition is reduced by a water cluster more efficiently than water molecules in a ring structure. However, the activation energy reduced by a water cluster is still larger than that obtained from laboratory experiments. We include water molecules that are attracted to a methanediol by hydrogen bonds during the water-cluster-catalyzed decomposition of a methanediol. The hydrogen bonds with the water molecules permit little change in the structure of the methanediol during the decomposition and play a significant role to reduce the activation energy for the decomposition. The rate constant obtained from the theoretical simulation agrees well with that determined by the laboratory experiment. ",

Intracellular Cl- activity (aiCl) and membrane potential (Em) were measured in frog dorsal root ganglion neurones (DRG neurones) using double-barrelled Cl- -selective microelectrodes. In standard Ringer solution buffered with HEPES (5 mM), equilibrated with air or 100% O2, the resting membrane potential was -57.7 +/- 1.0 mV and aiCl was 23.6 +/- 1.0 mM (n = 53). The value of aiCl was 2.6 times the activity expected for an equilibrium distribution and the difference between Em and ECl was 25 mV. 2. Removal of external Cl- led to a reversible fall in aiCl. Initial rates of decay and recovery of aiCl were 4.1 and 3.3 mM min-1, respectively. During the recovery of aiCl following return to standard Ringer solution, most of the movement of Cl- occurred against the driving force for a passive distribution. Changes in aiCl were not associated with changes in Em. Chloride fluxes estimated from initial rates of change in aiCl when external Cl- was removed were too high to be accounted for by electrodiffusion. 3. The intracellular accumulation of Cl- was dependent on the extracellular Cl- activity (aoCl). The relationship between aiCl and aoCl had a sigmoidal shape with a half-maximal activation of about 50 mM-external Cl-. 4. The steady-state aiCl depended on the simultaneous presence of extracellular Na+ and K+. Similarly, the active reaccumulation of Cl- after intracellular Cl- depletion was abolished in the absence of either Na+ or K+ in the bathing solution. 5. The reaccumulation of Cl- was inhibited by furosemide (0.5-1 x 10(-3) M) or bumetanide (10(-5) M). The decrease in aiCl observed in Cl- -free solutions was also inhibited by bumetanide. 6. Cell volume changes were calculated from the observed changes in aiCl. Cells were estimated to shrink in Cl- -free solutions to about 75% their initial volume, at an initial rate of 6% min-1. 7. The present results provide direct evidence for the active accumulation of Cl- in DRG neurones. The mechanism of Cl- transport is electrically silent, dependent on the simultaneous presence of external Cl-, Na+ and K+ and inhibited by loop diuretics. It is suggested that a Na+:K+:Cl- co-transport system mediates the active transport of Cl- across the cell membrane of DRG neurones.",

An off axis and focus intensity investigation.\nOptical elements based on Fresnel zones are used in a range of applications, from X-ray telescopy to microscopy and recently also in the manipulation of de Broglie matter waves. In 1992 Beynon and co-workers presented a binary Gabor type zone plate (henceforth referred to as the Beynon Gabor zone plate). Because this zone plate has no higher order foci, it is in principle a very attractive candidate for focusing of de Broglie matter waves and in some cases X-rays. So far the Beynon Gabor zone plate investigations presented in the literature have concentrated on the intensity distribution along the optical axis and in the focal plane. Here we present a detailed numerical investigation of the Beynon Gabor zone plate, including an investigation of the off-optical axis, off focal plane intensity distribution for point source illumination. We show that at integer fractions of the focal length, the beam becomes nearly toroidal (doughnut-shaped). This offers potentially interesting new possibilities for de Broglie matter wave and X-ray optics, for example in STED-like applications. We further show that the increased intensity at the focal point predicted in the literature for a particular Beynon Gabor zone plate transmission function configuration is an artifact due to the lack of sampling nodes. We support our calculations with experimental measurements in the visible light range, using a Beynon Gabor zone plate fabricated with electron beam lithography. ",

Failure to do so may lead to invalid results even if they are mathematically correct. This fact has been previously emphasized (Luo, W.; Feldberg, S. W.; Rudolph, M. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1994, 368, 109 - 113; Rudolph, M. Digital Simulation in Electrochemistry. In Physical Electrochemistry; Rubenstein, I., Ed.; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1995; Chapter 3) and existing computer software for electrochemical simulations, such as DigiSim (Rudolph, M.; Reddy, D. P.; Feldberg, S. W. Anal. Chem. 1994, 66, 589A; http://www.basinc.com/products/ec/digisim/), offer the option of enforcing the so-called \"pre-equilibration\" which evaluates thermodynamic concentrations of all species prior to beginning a voltammetric scan. Although this approach allows setting consistent thermodynamic values it may result in a nonrealistic initial concentrations set because it corresponds to the whole solution status at infinite time for infinite kinetic constants. However, the perturbation created by the working electrode poised at its rest potential is necessarily limited by the size of the electrode, reaction kinetics, and duration of the rest period. Furthermore, natural convection limits even more the importance of the perturbation. This is analyzed theoretically through comparison of simulation results by DigiSim and KISSA-1D software for certain common electrochemical mechanisms in order to illustrate the importance of correct prediction of initial concentrations.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009±0.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01± 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients.

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

Computational models are particularly well suited for these investigations. The electric field can be accurately described by mathematical formalisms, and the population-based neural responses to the electrical stimulation can be investigated at resolutions well beyond those achievable by current state-of-the-art biological techniques. In this study, we used a biophysically-and morphologically-detailed RGC model to explore the ability of high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) to preferentially activate ON and OFF RGC subtypes, the two major information pathways of the retina. The performance of a wide range of electrical stimulation amplitudes (0 - $100~\\mu \\mathbf {A}$) and frequencies (1 - 10 kHz) on functionally-distinct RGC responses were evaluated. We found that ON RGCs could be preferentially activated at relatively higher stimulation amplitudes $( &gt; 50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ and frequencies $( &gt;2$ kHz) while OFF RGCs were activated by lower stimulation amplitudes (10 to $50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ across all tested frequencies.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician. In a cohort of 28 subjects with a history of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, we compared the PeriVib performance with two established threshold sensing systems: (1) a Biothesiometer device and (2) a tuning fork. We found that the sensation threshold estimated by PeriVib correlated well with the Biothesiometer ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.68) but less well with the tuning fork ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.15). Functional gait and balance metrics did not correlate with peripheral neuropathy severity.",

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

These objects are not of galactic size or nature, and are not associated with galaxies or clusters of galaxies. The continuing energy source for such enormous powers for a period of 10(6) to 10(7) years has not been clearly revealed. The absence of the expected absorption for the Lyman-alpha spectral line of hydrogen is a new difficulty. Because of the relativistic limit on the diameter which can produce rapid fluctuations of light output, there may not be enough surface to radiate the required light.A similar and perhaps more serious difficulty exists for the fluctuating radio output. Calculations given here for synchrotron radiation self-absorption lead to a reasonably accurate formula for the angular diameter of a radio source. For the quasar 3C 273B these relations indicate a conflict with the usually assumed distance. However, the discrepancy may be explained in terms of strong variation of radio diameter with frequency. For CTA 102 the conflict is more serious, and could be explained -for cosmological distance-only by rejecting the data of Sholomitskii. These difficulties are removed by the hypothesis that the observed quasars were ejected from a gravitational collapse at the center of our own galaxy, which may have occurred roughly 5 million years ago. The resultant distances, of the order of a million lightyears, reduce the energy problem by a factor of 10(6) or 10(7). On this basis the optical diameter would be less than a light-hour, about the size of the earth's orbit. A rotating mass of a few thousand solar masses with this diameter would account for the unusual line width, could easily produce the required radiated energy, and could readily account for observed short fluctuation periods and variations in spectrum. It is suggested that the radio output may be produced by high-speed passage of the quasar through intergalactic gas. This would probably correspond to a radio size of a few light-years or less, in agreement with the fluctuations. Since the radio power would be considerably less than that of radio galaxies, it is suggested that radio galaxies may have ejected groups of quasars. This would explain the peculiarly distant locations of the radio sources for many such galaxies. The objections to this model that have been raised are apparently not fatal. In particular, the receding hydrogen cloud discovered by Koehler to be in the line of sight to 3C 273 is more plausibly interpreted as having been ejected from our own galaxy, in the manner observed for other galaxies, than as being associated with the Virgo cluster of galaxies. The latter interpretation, which would place 3C 273 further away, is in conflict with Lyman-alpha absorption data for 3C 9 and other quasars. Thus the local model seems to give a reasonable explanation not only of quasars but also of radio galaxies, bothv of which seem largely to defy explanation on other grounds. Whether or not this model is valid, it is clear that an understanding of quasars will radically change our understanding of the universe.",

A ratio of reflectivities for s- and p-polarized light, R(s):R(p) approximately , and a resolving power of lambda/Dlambda approximately 6 at 304 A were obtained. These characteristics and the use of a VYNS (a copolymer material composed of 90% vinyl chloride and 10% vinyl acetate) spectral filter were sufficient to allow a detailed polarization study of the first two members of the Lyman series of He(+) at wavelengths of 304 A (HeII p --&gt; s) and 256 A (HeII p --&gt; s) for impact-electron energies ranging from threshold to 1500 eV.

Studying this 'epoch of reionization' involves looking for the spectral signatures of ancient galaxies that are, owing to the expansion of the Universe, now very distant from Earth and therefore exhibit large redshifts. However, finding these spectral fingerprints is challenging. One spectral characteristic of ancient and distant galaxies is strong hydrogen-emission lines (known as Lyman-α lines), but the neutral intergalactic medium that was present early in the epoch of reionization scatters such Lyman-α photons. Another potential spectral identifier is the line at wavelength 157.4 micrometres of the singly ionized state of carbon (the [C ii] λ = 157.74 μm line), which signifies cooling gas and is expected to have been bright in the early Universe. However, so far Lyman-α-emitting galaxies from the epoch of reionization have demonstrated much fainter [C ii] luminosities than would be expected from local scaling relations, and searches for the [C ii] line in sources without Lyman-α emission but with photometric redshifts greater than 6 (corresponding to the first billion years of the Universe) have been unsuccessful. Here we identify [C ii] λ = 157.74 μm emission from two sources that we selected as high-redshift candidates on the basis of near-infrared photometry; we confirm that these sources are two galaxies at redshifts of z = 6.8540 ± 0.0003 and z = 6.8076 ± 0.0002. Notably, the luminosity of the [C ii] line from these galaxies is higher than that found previously in star-forming galaxies with redshifts greater than 6.5. The luminous and extended [C ii] lines reveal clear velocity gradients that, if interpreted as rotation, would indicate that these galaxies have similar dynamic properties to the turbulent yet rotation-dominated disks that have been observed in Hα-emitting galaxies two billion years later, at 'cosmic noon'.",

Recent technological advances have allowed us to focus on antihydrogen-the antimatter equivalent of hydrogen. The Standard Model predicts that there should have been equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the primordial Universe after the Big Bang, but today's Universe is observed to consist almost entirely of ordinary matter. This motivates the study of antimatter, to see if there is a small asymmetry in the laws of physics that govern the two types of matter. In particular, the CPT (charge conjugation, parity reversal and time reversal) theorem, a cornerstone of the Standard Model, requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Here we report the observation of the 1S-2S transition in magnetically trapped atoms of antihydrogen. We determine that the frequency of the transition, which is driven by two photons from a laser at 243 nanometres, is consistent with that expected for hydrogen in the same environment. This laser excitation of a quantum state of an atom of antimatter represents the most precise measurement performed on an anti-atom.

We studied a data set of all 30 M-H and 30 M<sup+</sup-H bonds of the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition series; 50 of these systems have experimentally known bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). To probe both the limit of low and high coordination number, we also studied a data set of 19 ML <subn</subH complexes. The BDEs were computed using Hartree-Fock (HF), MP2, CCSD, CCSD(T), and 10 diverse density functionals including local, GGA, hybrid GGA, meta hybrid, range-separated, and double hybrids. Our ten most important findings are as follows: (1) HF fails completely to describe the metal hydrogen bond due to its lack of static correlation; (2) this makes post-HF methods such as MP2 and even CCSD(T) perform worse than many density functionals; (3) DFT requires much more HF exchange (∼35% on average) to describe the pure M-H bonds than to describe other metal ligand bonds (0-20%); (4) we design a test to determine if self-interaction error (SIE) is important by correlating DFT errors against a one-electron SIE metric; (5) we show that SIE correlates directly with the DFT errors and thus causes most of the problem; (6) HF-DFT cannot handle these systems because the HF method is too pathological already at the density level; (7) instead, we define and apply a simple metric of electronic abnormality as the difference in PBE energy computed at the self-consistent PBE0 and SVWN densities, and this metric gives appropriate spread and effectively captures density-derived errors; (8) the low electronegativity of the metal enforces a diffuse hydride-like electron density, which make the metal hydrides primary examples of many-electron systems exhibiting SIE already at equilibrium geometries; (9) in the coordinatively saturated ML <subn</subH systems, much less HF exchange is required; i.e., the HF exchange requirements vary drastically with coordination number. Accordingly, DFT is unbalanced for any catalytic process involving both M-H and M-L bonds and changing coordination numbers; (10) importantly, the range-separated and double-hybrid functionals CAM-B3LYP and B2PLYP alone perform well for both M-H and M-L systems and in both limits of low and high coordination number, and at least as well as CCSD(T). This lends hope to a balanced treatment of computational chemistry for all types of M-L bonds at variable coordination number, as required for real catalytic reactions.",

The new multilayers combine layers of Al, LiF, and SiC, in an Al/LiF/SiC/LiF multilayer design (four layers, starting with the innermost layer). Among these materials, Al and LiF are deposited by evaporation and SiC by ion-beam-sputtering.

This combined performance is demanded in space instrumentation for astrophysics and solar physics observations among others, where imaging the sky at the important diagnostic spectral line of Lyman β line requires rejecting the frequently much more intense background at Lyman α line. Such is the case for solar corona observations at Lyman β, which is masked by the strong Lyman α line. The multilayer peak is placed close to another important diagnostic tool: the OVI doublet at 103.2 and 103.8 nm. The target of small reflectance at 121.6 nm was seen to be the most critical. The best strategy in multilayer preparation was to prepare it with such minimum reflectance at slightly shorter wavelengths so that the coating evolved to shift it longwards over time. Multilayers kept a remarkable 102.6 nm/121.6 nm reflectance ratio over time in spite of some performance degradation. Hence, a multilayer coating aged of 4 years kept a reflectance of 43% at 102.6 nm and 0.2% at 121.6 nm.",

The optical design features an instantaneous field of view (FOV) of 20 arc min in diameter and a moderate and adjustable spectral resolution of 500-2000. A highly dispersive monochromator system is used to split the incident light into several wavelength channels, each with a full-field imaging capability and adjustable bandwidth, and the ensuing imaging optics form the individual channel images on different areas of the same microchannel plate detector. Channel wavelengths are tunable and a continuous wavelength scanning across the entire band of interest is proposed, which yields spectrally resolved 3D images with moderate spectral resolutions.",

In dark matter (DM)-dominated models of the early Universe, massive DM halos are predicted to attract the surrounding gas, which falls towards their centres.

Given these neutral hydrogen columns, the actual contribution to the density of neutral species from the immediate solar environment (the \"local fluff\") would only cover a distance of approximately 2-3 pc (assuming an average density n(H I) = 0.1 cm-3) leaving these lines of sight almost entirely within the hot phase of the ISM. A preliminary examination of the complete EUVE long-wavelength survey indicates that these lines of sight are exceptional and set a minimum column density in the solar environment.",

Our calculations indicate that the lowest energy singlet transition occurs at 8.42 eV with an oscillator strength of 0.01. The lowest energy triplet state occurs at 8.24 eV. Thus, the cross section of sulfuric acid in the actinic region is likely to be very small and smaller than the upper limit put on this cross section by previous experimental investigations. We estimate the cross section of sulfuric acid in the atmospherically relevant Lyman-alpha region ( approximately 10.2 eV) to be approximately 6 x 10 (-17) cm (2) molecule (-1), a value approximately 30 times larger than the speculative value used in previous atmospheric simulations. We have calculated the J values for photodissociation of sulfuric acid with absorption of visible, UV, and Lyman-alpha radiation, at altitudes between 30 and 100 km. We find that the dominant photodissociation mechanism of sulfuric acid below 70 km is absorption in the visible region by OH stretching overtone transitions, whereas above 70 km, absorption of Lyman-alpha radiation by high energy Rydberg excited states is the favored mechanism. The low lying electronic transitions of sulfuric acid in the UV region do not contribute significantly to its dissociation at any altitude.",

Anisotropy spectra are used to identify the electronic character of the initially populated excited state(s). S-H bond fission is found to occur via the dissociative S2(1(1)πσ*) state, which can be populated directly, or by ultrafast nonradiative transitions from the S3(2(1)ππ*) state, or by very efficient tunneling from the S1(1(1)ππ*) state, depending on the excitation wavelength, in line with conclusions from previous gas-phase studies of this same molecular photodissociation (Oliver, T. A. A.; King, G. A.; Tew, D. P.; Dixon R. N.; Ashfold, M. N. R. J. Phys. Chem. A 2012, 116, 12444). p-MePhS radicals are observed on a time scale faster than the instrument response at all wavelengths, but the available time resolution affords a rare opportunity to explore the branching between different electronic states of a product (the Ã and X̃ states of the p-MePhS radical in this case). The present study provides estimates of this branching in the products formed immediately after the first pass through the conical intersection (CI) between the S2 and S0 states. At 270 nm, for example, we identify a marked population inversion in the radical products, in contrast to the reported gas phase behavior. The finding that the contrast in branching ratio is largest between cyclohexane solution and the gas phase, with ethanol being intermediate, can be rationalized by recognizing the differing distributions of the S-H torsion angle (relative to the ring plane) in a room temperature solution compared with those in a jet-cooled molecular beam. The available time resolution also allows exploration of the electronic quenching of nascent Ã state radicals as solvent motion encourages recrossing of the S2/S0 CI. The average separation distance, &lt;r0&gt;, between the H + p-MePhS products arising in successful dissociation events is seen to increase with decreasing photolysis wavelength. This finding accords with the previous gas phase results, which determined that most of the excess energy following population of the dissociative S2 state (directly, or by ultrafast coupling from the S3 state) is released as product translation, and the expectation that &lt;r0&gt; should scale with the total kinetic energy release. The present work also confirms that geminate recombination of the H + p-MePhS products leads not just to reformation of parent p-MePhSH molecules but also to alternative adducts wherein the H atom bonds to the benzene ring. Analysis of the present data and results of high level ab initio calculations together with recent UV-IR pump-probe measurements (Murdock, D.; Harris, S. J.; Karsili, T. N. V.; Greetham, G.

The emission spectrum consists of at least four overlapping single emission bands. For methane adsorption, the PhICL phenomenon is seen only if the solid is preirradiated in the presence of oxygen. Emission decay kinetics of the PhICL effect for gamma-Al2O3 reveal two wavelength regimes: a short wavelength regime at lambda = 300-370 nm (decay time tau = 1.1 +/- 0.2 s; signal width = 2.8 s), and a longer wavelength regime at lambda = 380-700 nm (decay time tau = 2.1 +/- 0.1 s; signal width = 4.3 s). A model is proposed in which there exist two different emission centers and, thus, two different pathways for emission decay. In the first, emission originates with electron trapping by such deep energy traps as anion vacancies {e- + Va --&gt; F+ + hv1} to yield electron F-type color centers, whereas in the second, emission originates from electron/trapped hole recombination {e- + Os*- --&gt; Os2- + hv2}. The first common step of the pathways is homolytic dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen and methane upon interaction with surface-active hole centers Os*-, produced upon preirradiation of alumina, to give atomic hydrogen H* and methyl radicals CH3*. Thermoprogrammed desorption spectra of photoadsorbed or postsorbed oxygen show that adsorbed oxygen interacts with atomic hydrogen and methyl radicals.

This study sought to determine the theoretical basis and clinical evidence for the effectiveness of helium-neon lasers in treating vitiligo. Cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts were irradiated with 0.5-1.5 J per cm2 helium-neon laser radiation. The effects of the helium-neon laser on melanocyte growth and proliferation were investigated. The results of this in vitro study revealed a significant increase in basic fibroblast growth factor release from both keratinocytes and fibroblasts and a significant increase in nerve growth factor release from keratinocytes. Medium from helium-neon laser irradiated keratinocytes stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake and proliferation of cultured melanocytes. Furthermore, melanocyte migration was enhanced either directly by helium-neon laser irradiation or indirectly by the medium derived from helium-neon laser treated keratinocytes. Thirty patients with segmental-type vitiligo on the head and/or neck were enrolled in this study. Helium-neon laser light was administered locally at 3.0 J per cm2 with point stimulation once or twice weekly. The percentage of repigmented area was used for clinical evaluation of effectiveness. After an average of 16 treatment sessions, initial repigmentation was noticed. Marked repigmentation (&gt;50%) was observed in 60% of patients with successive treatments. Basic fibroblast growth factor is a putative melanocyte growth factor, whereas nerve growth factor is a paracrine factor for melanocyte survival in the skin. Both nerve growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor stimulate melanocyte migration. It is reasonable to propose that helium-neon laser irradiation clearly stimulates melanocyte migration and proliferation and mitogen release for melanocyte growth and may also rescue damaged melanocytes, therefore providing a microenvironment for inducing repigmentation in vitiligo.",

This equivalence allows interpolation from experiments with 647-nm, exposures at power levels that are unavailable with the He-Ne laser. To simulate He-Ne laser scanner exposures, 40-microseconds pulses of 647-nm light transmitted through a revolving disk with holes in the periphery were used to expose the retinas of monkeys under deep anesthesia at pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) of 100, 200, 400, and 1,600 Hz for exposure durations of 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 s. The thresholds between laser exposure at 488 nm (Ar-Kr) and between laser exposure at 647 nm (Kr) are compared to assess thermal versus photochemical effects on the retina. The threshold for 488-nm pulses was consistently lower than that for 647-nm pulses at all PRFs and exposure times. The difference in thresholds increased with exposure time and PRF. The sharp decreases in 488-nm thresholds at 100-s exposure times for each PRF can be interpreted as a basically photochemical effect. The radiant exposure required for damage at 647 nm was several orders of magnitude above the radiant exposure from typical He-Ne scanner applications.

Recently, lights at visible region have been used for regenerative purposes. Using the process of vitiligo repigmentation as a research model, we focused on elucidating the pro-differentiation effects induced by visible light. We first showed that helium-neon (He-Ne) laser (632.8 nm) irradiation stimulated differentiation of primitive pigment cells, an effect not replicable by UVB treatment even at high and damaging doses. In addition, significant increases of mitochondrial DNA copy number and the regulatory genes for mitochondrial biogenesis were induced by He-Ne laser irradiation.

The impact on cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondria is responsible for the efficacy of He-Ne laser in promoting melanoblast differentiation.

Healing rates were evaluated clinically and photographically. Sixty-nine percent of the irradiated incisions healed faster than the control incisions. No significant difference in healing was noted when patients were compared by age, gender, race, and anatomic location of the incision. This study concludes that helium-neon diode lasers, at the previously mentioned energy level, increase the rate of gingival wound healing in 69 percent of patients, without any side effects. For the last 30 years, low-power lasers in dentistry have appeared to stimulate healing rates and increase the rate of repair of injured tissue. Helium-neon and similar lasers emit light in the red (600-700 nm) spectrums and produce energy densities (fluences) below 20 Joules/cm2. They have been studied in a variety of animal tissue culture and human evaluations to determine their ability to increase the rates of wound healing by biostimulation. Over the last three decades, researchers have found that ruby and gas helium-neon (low-power laser radiation) have a biostimulatory effect on living tissue. Studies show that under specific conditions, red spectrum laser light speeds the healing of wounds. Photons from the red light lasers, which include ruby lasers (694 nm), helium-neon gas lasers (632 nm), and helium-neon diode lasers (650-670 nm), appear to stimulate rapid epithelialization and fibroblast (collagen) proliferation in animal and human tissue cultures. Low-power lasers have been reported to reduce post-extraction pain and swelling and to increase rates of wound healing (including scar formation, phagocytosis) in cell culture, animal, and human clinical studies. The new, compact, and inexpensive (under $50) helium-neon diode lasers have produced similar effects. These FDA Class IIIa lasers have no hazards associated with them, although one should avoid direct exposure to the eye for a prolonged period of time. In the past, many biostimulation studies using red spectrum lasers produced confusing data and conflicting results. Some studies reported that the biostimulation effect did not occur in all cases of laser irradiation, while other research reported that it did. Results seem to depend on the delivery of appropriate energy fluence levels (between 1 and 20 J/cm2) and the type of laser (wavelength) used. Several of these studies never described the levels of laser energy used to promote the described biostimulatory results. This caused controversy when determining whether or not helium-neon lasers influence wound healing. Studies suggest that low-power laser exposure can significantly increase the healing rate during the first few days of the healing process; however, studies do not show appreciable net benefit as compared to controls toward the end of a two-week wound repair cycle. The increased healing effect appears to be centered around the early, most sensitive stages of the healing process. Several studies showed optimum tissue healing rates at helium-neon laser exposure levels between 1 J/cm2 and 20 J/cm2. Laser-enhanced biostimulation has been reported to produce metabolic changes within the cells. This results in faster cell division, rapid matrix production (increased collagen, myofibroblasts, etc.), and cell movement. There have been few controlled studies using adequate numbers of human subjects in identifying the beneficial effects of helium-neon laser biostimulation. Ethical concerns, bulky equipment, and problems with biased study designs have frustrated a practical evaluation of laser biostimulation for general dental practice.

Recent studies have implicated the role of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) in mediating these processes. In astrocytes, oligomeric Aβ induces the assembly of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complexes resulting in its activation to produce anionic superoxide. Aβ also promotes production of pro-inflammatory factors in astrocytes. Since low energy laser has previously been reported to attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation in biological systems, the objective of this study was to examine whether this type of laser light was able to abrogate the oxidative and inflammatory responses induced by Aβ. Primary rat astrocytes were exposed to Helium-Neon laser (λ=632.8 nm), followed by the treatment with oligomeric Aβ. Primary rat astrocytes were used to measure Aβ-induced production of superoxide anions using fluorescence microscopy of dihydroethidium (DHE), assembly of NADPH oxidase subunits by the colocalization between the cytosolic p47(phox) subunit and the membrane gp91(phox) subunit using fluorescent confocal microscopy, phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) cPLA(2) and expressions of pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) using Western blot Analysis.

On the 5th week, well-defined trabecula undergoing remodeling process was detected for the most intense pattern in tibia only. Morphometric analysis revealed significant statistical differences (p &lt; 0.05) in the bone tissue for the laser-exposed group on 1st and 3rd weeks. After 5th week, bone formation was increased to tibia only. Taken together, such findings suggest that helium-neon laser is able to improve bone repair in rabbits being the most pronounced effect in tibia. ",

This study aimed to establish if the dose and/or wavelength influenced the biological responses of irradiated in vitro fibroblasts--1 h after laser irradiation. This study aimed to establish cellular responses of normal and wounded human skin fibroblasts to helium-neon (632.8 nm), diode (830 nm) and Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser irradiation using one exposure of 5 or 16 J/cm(2) on day 1 and again on day 4. Wounded cells exposed to 5 J/cm(2) using 632.8 nm showed an increase in cell migration and haptotaxis, a stable increase in the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a decrease in caspase 3/7 activity, an increase in ATP viability and an increase in cell proliferation--1 h after the final exposure. The results confirm that changes in parameters such as ATP viability, cytokine expression (IL-6), cell proliferation (alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity) and DNA damage can be observed directly after the laser irradiation. The amount of DNA damage and cytotoxicity may be related to duration of the laser irradiation, which is dependent on the power density (mW/cm(2)) of each laser. The results indicate that 5 J/cm(2) using 632.8 nm results in a stimulatory effect that is more effective than 830 and 1064 nm. The results suggest possible mechanisms by which the wavelength may potentially influence the cellular responses of wounded cells.",

The experimental procedures were carried out on five anaesthetised rabbits. The cortical tissue was exposed by means of a small burr hole and illuminated by a helium neon laser (632.8 nm). Reflected light was detected using a silicon photodiode, and CBF was calculated continuously from the power of the frequency weighted Doppler spectrum in the reflected light. Three successive measurements of CBF were made using the microsphere technique. Following an initial baseline measurement, CBF was increased by an infusion of metaraminol and then reduced by controlled haemorrhage. Laser Doppler spectroscopy provided continuous monitoring of blood flow fluctuations and during the haemorrhage it was possible to demonstrate CBF autoregulation until the mean blood pressure fell below 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg). A regression analysis was performed between the simultaneous CBF measurements from the two techniques using a least squares best fit straight line analysis (r = 0.92, P less than 0.001). It was concluded that the flow computed from laser Doppler spectroscopy varied linearly with CBF and offers the unique advantage of continuous and instantaneous measurements even during nonsteady state flow.",

As a result of irradiation, increase of the mitochondrial membrane potential was found to occur in irradiated hepatocytes both in the presence or in the absence of CaCl2. The hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is assumed to cause an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake that was measured in isolated mitochondria. Finally, an increase in c-fos expression was found in irradiated hepatocytes when incubated in the presence of CaCl2.

We have previously shown that the helium-neon laser (He-Ne laser, 632.8 nm) is a therapeutic option for treatment of this depigmentary disorder. Addressing the intricate interactions between melanocytes, the most important cellular component in the repigmentation scheme of vitiligo, and their innate extracellular matrix collagen type IV, the current study aimed to elucidate the effects of the He-Ne laser on melanocytes. Cultured melanocytes were irradiated with the He-Ne laser. Relevant biological parameters including cell attachment, locomotion and growth were evaluated. In addition, the potentially involved molecular pathways were also determined. Our results show that in addition to suppressing mobility but increasing attachment to type IV collagen, the He-Ne laser stimulates melanocyte proliferation through enhanced alpha2beta1 integrin expression. The expression of phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB), an important regulator of melanocyte growth, was also upregulated by He-Ne laser treatment. Using a specific mitochondrial uncoupling agent [carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP)], the proliferative effect of the He-Ne laser on melanocytes was abolished and suppression of melanocyte growth was noted. In summary, we have demonstrated that the He-Ne laser imparts a growth stimulatory effect on functional melanocytes via mitochondria-related pathways and proposed that other minor pathways including DNA damage may also be inflicted by laser treatment on irradiated cells. More importantly, we have completed the repigmentation scheme of vitiligo brought about by He-Ne laser light in vitro and provided a solid theoretical basis regarding how the He-Ne laser induces recovery of vitiligo in vivo.",

Our previous studies demonstrated that He-Ne irradiation induced an increase in cell proliferation, but not migration, in the melanoma cell line A2058 cell. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in photostimulatory effects induced by an He-Ne laser. Using the A2058 cell as a model for cell proliferation, the photobiologic effects induced by an He-Ne laser were studied. He-Ne irradiation immediately induced an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(mt)), ATP, and cAMP via enhanced cytochrome c oxidase activity and promoted phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein-1 (AP-1) expressions. He-Ne irradiation-induced A2058 cell proliferation was significantly abrogated by the addition of delta psi(mt) and JNK inhibitors. Moreover, treatment with an He-Ne laser resulted in delayed effects on IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta1 release from A2058 cells. These results suggest that He-Ne irradiation elicits photostimulatory effects in mitochondria processes, which involve JNK/AP-1 activation and enhanced growth factor release, and ultimately lead to A2058 cell proliferation.",

Our data show that a diode laser scanning device using a light source emitting 675.2 nm increases the accuracy of a GafChromic MD-55 film readout.

The increase of irradiation dose by prolongation of the exposure duration up to 180 s induced a significant decrease in NO production and natural killer cell activity, but IL-2 production was not different from the control level. A remarkable decrease in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production was observed following laser light exposure of cells for 60 or 180 s, whereas under lower doses (exposure for 5 or 30 sec) IFN-gamma production increased.

Thus, upon in vitro exposure of cells to extremely low-power laser light, a basic tendency was observed: short-term irradiation predominantly induced stimulation in secretory activity of cells, whereas prolongation of exposure mainly induced immunosuppression.

PBM therapy has important clinical applications in regenerative medicine. Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentary disorder resulting from disappearance of functional melanocytes in the involved skin. Vitiligo repigmentation depends on available melanocytes derived from (a) melanocyte stem cells located in the bulge area of hair follicles and (b) the epidermis at the lesional borders, which contains a pool of functional melanocytes. Since follicular melanoblasts (MBs) are derived from the melanocyte stem cells residing at the bulge area of hair follicle, the process of vitiligo repigmentation presents a research model for studying the regenerative effect of PBM therapy. Previous reports have shown favourable response for treatment of vitiligo with a low-energy helium-neon (He-Ne) laser. This review focuses on the molecular events that took place during the repigmentation process of vitiligo triggered by He-Ne laser (632.8 nm, red light). Monochromatic radiation in the visible and infrared A (IRA) range sustains matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), improves mitochondrial function, and increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and O<sub2</sub consumption, which lead to cellular regenerative pathways. Cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria was reported to be the photoacceptor upon which He-Ne laser exerts its effects. Mitochondrial retrograde signalling is responsible for the cellular events by red light. This review shows that He-Ne laser initiated mitochondrial retrograde signalling via a Ca<sup2+</sup -dependent cascade. The impact on cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondria, an event that results in activation of CREB (cyclic-AMP response element binding protein)-related cascade, is responsible for the He-Ne laser promoting functional development at different stages of MBs and boosting functional melanocytes. He-Ne laser irradiation induced (a) melanocyte stem cell differentiation; (b) immature outer root sheath MB migration; (c) differentiated outer root sheath MB melanogenesis and migration; and (d) perilesional melanocyte migration and proliferation. These photobiomodulation effects result in perifollocular and marginal repigmentation in vitiligo.",

A 5-pulse flash train at the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) dose from a collimated Q-switched frequency-doubled neodymium laser (532 nm) was superimposed on the foveal stimulus and the subsequent disruption and recovery of the VEP measured. Minimal disruption of the response signal magnitude was demonstrated (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) which recovered within 300 ms of the termination of the pulse train. A small but significant (p less than 0.01) disruption of phase entrainment was also noted that recovered within the same period. This is contrasted with a second experiment with three monkeys in which an argon (514 nm) laser served both as the speckle stimulus source and as the shuttered flash. Exposure to collimated MPE argon radiation for 250 ms immediately depressed the VEP (97%, p less than 0.01) and showed recovery to 70% of the pre-flash baseline only after 3 s. Phase lock was also severely degraded for several seconds. These results imply that visual processing of nonacuity-limited medium contrast stimuli with broad spatial frequency content will probably not be materially affected by ultra-short pulsed laser exposure at these energy levels and frequencies.

Changes in normal and wounded fibroblast cell morphology were evaluated by light microscopy. Changes following laser irradiation were evaluated by assessing the mitochondrial activity using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) luminescence, cell proliferation using neutral red and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, membrane integrity using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and percentage cytotoxicity and DNA damage using the Comet assay. Morphologically, wounded cells exposed to 5 J/cm(2) migrate rapidly across the wound margin indicating a stimulatory or positive influence of phototherapy. A dose of 5 J/cm(2) has a stimulatory influence on wounded fibroblasts with an increase in cell proliferation and cell viability without adversely increasing the amount of cellular and molecular damage. Higher doses (10 and 16 J/cm(2)) were characterized by a decrease in cell viability and cell proliferation with a significant amount of damage to the cell membrane and DNA. Results show that 5 J/cm(2) stimulates mitochondrial activity, which leads to normalization of cell function and ultimately stimulates cell proliferation and migration of wounded fibroblasts to accelerate wound closure. Laser irradiation can modify cellular processes in a dose or fluence (J/cm(2)) dependent manner.",

We report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. In particular, the pathogenic Gram-positive porphyrin producing ATCC strains Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. In addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. Non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mW/cm2 light intensity and 360 J/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. The survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of Propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in Actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/- 0.10 in Porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. No photoeffect was found for the bacterium Streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. Red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species Prevotella intermedia. Taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.",

Quantum theory dictates that uncertainties on the position and energy-momentum four-vectors of radiation quanta obey Heisenberg's uncertainty relation; however, these uncertainties are neglected in \"classical\" MC simulations of radiation transport in which position and momentum are known precisely. Using the quantum uncertainty relation and electron mean free path, the magnitudes of uncertainties on electron position and momentum are calculated for different kinetic energies; a validity bound on the classical simulation of electron transport is derived. In order to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, uncertainties of 5% must be assigned to position and momentum for 1 keV electrons in water; at 100 eV, these uncertainties are 17 to 20% and are even larger at lower energies. In gaseous media such as air, these uncertainties are much smaller (less than 1% for electrons with energy 20 eV or greater). The classical Monte Carlo transport treatment is questionable for sub-1 keV electrons in condensed water as uncertainties on position and momentum must be large (relative to electron momentum and mean free path) to satisfy the quantum uncertainty principle. Simulations which do not account for these uncertainties are not faithful representations of the physical processes, calling into question the results of MC track structure codes simulating sub-1 keV electron transport. Further, the large difference in the scale at which quantum effects are important in gaseous and condensed media suggests that track structure measurements in gases are not necessarily representative of track structure in condensed materials on a micrometer or a nanometer scale.",

Electrons in solids are characterized by energy (ω) and momentum (k) and the probability to find them in a particular state with given ω and k is described by the spectral function A(k, ω). This function can be directly measured in an experiment based on the well-known photoelectric effect, for the explanation of which Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize back in 1921. In the photoelectric effect the light shone on a surface ejects electrons from the material. According to Einstein, energy conservation allows one to determine the energy of an electron inside the sample, provided the energy of the light photon and kinetic energy of the outgoing photoelectron are known. Momentum conservation makes it also possible to estimate k relating it to the momentum of the photoelectron by measuring the angle at which the photoelectron left the surface. The modern version of this technique is called Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and exploits both conservation laws in order to determine the electronic structure, i.e. energy and momentum of electrons inside the solid. In order to resolve the details crucial for understanding the topical problems of condensed matter physics, three quantities need to be minimized: uncertainty* in photon energy, uncertainty in kinetic energy of photoelectrons and temperature of the sample. In our approach we combine three recent achievements in the field of synchrotron radiation, surface science and cryogenics. We use synchrotron radiation with tunable photon energy contributing an uncertainty of the order of 1 meV, an electron energy analyzer which detects the kinetic energies with a precision of the order of 1 meV and a He(3) cryostat which allows us to keep the temperature of the sample below 1 K. We discuss the exemplary results obtained on single crystals of Sr2RuO4 and some other materials. The electronic structure of this material can be determined with an unprecedented clarity.",

According to De Finetti, probabilities are necessarily subjective, and quantify our belief in the truth of events in the real world. Given evidence of a shared feature of a trace and an accused, we apply this framework to assign an evidential value to this correspondence. Dividing 1 by the objectively existing proportion of the population sharing that feature would give that evidential value - expressed as a likelihood ratio (LR) - only if that proportion were known. As in practice the proportion can only be estimated, this leads some to project their sampling uncertainty - or precision - associated with the estimated proportion onto the likelihood ratio, and to report an interval. Limited data should limit our LR however, because as we will demonstrate the LR is given by what we know about the proportion rather than by the unknown proportion itself. Encapsulating all uncertainty - including sampling uncertainty of the proportion - our LR reflects how much information we have retrieved from the feature regarding the trace's origin, based on our present knowledge. Not an interval but a number represents this amount of information, equal to the logarithm of the LR.

Given constant changes in the concentration and the composition of atmospheric aerosol, uncertainty exists as to whether the current focus on PM<sub2.5</sub mass or individual components may fully characterize the health burden of PM<sub2.5</sub.

We here present a formative case from Norway. The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision was faced with a cancer patient, who had improved after treatment with a drug in the private health sector but was refused continued treatment in the public health service due to lack of clinical trial evidence. The Board overturned this decision, arguing that the drug had been unambiguously documented to work in the individual case. We aim to provide an in-depth analysis of this case and The Board's decision and thereby to illustrate and elucidate key epistemological and ethical issues and developments in PM. We provide our analysis and discussion using tools of critical thinking and concepts from philosophy of science and medicine, such as uncertainty, evidence, forms of inference and causation. We also examine the case in light of the history of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The case reflects an epistemological shift in medicine where PM puts greater emphasis on evidence that arises in individual patients after the treatment is provided over pre-existing population-based evidence. PM may rely more heavily on abduction to decide what works and qualitative, rather than quantitative judgements. The case also illustrates a possible shift in the concept of causation from regularity accounts to mechanistic and process accounts. We discuss the ethical implications of a shift from more 'traditional' to 'personalised EBM'. A framework that is more based on abductions and evidence arising in the individual case has problems in creating quantifiable, reliable and generalisable evidence, and in promoting transparency and accountability. PM currently lacks clear criteria for deciding what works in an individual, posing ethical challenges.",

However, this is not required in general; for example, position information can instead be extracted at the cost of noise in momentum. Using random, partial projections in position followed by strong measurements in momentum, we efficiently determine the transverse-position and transverse-momentum distributions of an unknown optical field with a single set of measurements. The momentum distribution is directly imaged, while the position distribution is recovered using compressive sensing.

Next, participants played a golf match against an opponent, in which the first to take a lead of 5 points would win the match. Participants were told that they could win a point by making the putt or by being closest to the hole. They wore visual occlusion goggles to prevent them from seeing the actual result, and the experimenter manipulated the scoring pattern to induce positive or negative PM. Participants in the positive momentum condition came back from a four-point lag to a four-point lead, whereas those in the negative momentum condition underwent the opposite scenario. We then asked the participants again to indicate their maximum puttable distance from the hole and to judge the hole size. After the manipulation, participants judged the maximum puttable distance to be longer in the positive momentum condition and shorter in the negative momentum condition. For the hole-size judgments, there were no significant effects.

In the process of genetic counseling, diagnostic uncertainties have to be managed even when test results for an individual client are either positive or negative because of differential implications for family members. Previous studies have investigated diagnostic uncertainties in relation to clients wanting to know or not know the test results; here, we extend this line of research by addressing how genetic counselors and clients account for the management of diagnostic uncertainties vis-à-vis the attendant ethical tensions in the complex communicative environment in the clinic setting. Our dataset from the Norwegian context is longitudinal, consisting of ten audio-recorded pre-test genetic counseling sessions. It involves one extended family with a high burden of colorectal cancer. Through theme-oriented discourse analysis, we demonstrate how diagnostic uncertainties give rise to tensions concerning risks and benefits of knowing in both professional and familial spheres, which then map onto accounts of various role responsibilities. For instance, in looking for certainty via advanced genomic testing to reduce diagnostic uncertainty for clients, genetic counselors are confronted with tensions regarding what can be communicated and made known because of their role responsibilities toward what may be regarded as scientific others and clinical others. Likewise, clients are faced with tensions concerning wanting to know/not know, which invokes various familial others and may align or not align with genetic counselors' preferences, especially relating to management of diagnostic uncertainties and secondary findings.",

Maximum likelihood estimates of the relative rate of mortality associated with PM(10)and the degree of statistical uncertainty were obtained for each of the 88 cities by fitting a separate log-linear regression of the daily mortality rate on air pollution level and potential confounders. We obtained Bayesian estimates of the relative rates by fitting a hierarchical model that takes into account spatial correlation among the true city-specific relative rates. We found that daily variations of PM(10) are positively associated with daily variations of mortality. In particular, the relative rate estimates of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality associated with PM(10) are larger on average than the relative rate estimates of all-cause and other-cause mortality. The estimated increase in the relative rate of death from cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, all-cause mortality, and other-cause mortality were 0.31% (95% posterior interval, 0.15-0.5), 0.22% (95% posterior interval, 0.1-0.38), and 0.13% (95% posterior interval, -0.05 to 0.29), respectively.

The model follows Ritchie's extended-Drude algorithm and is particularly effective at the region of the Bethe ridge, substantially improving previous models. The present development allows for a more accurate simulation of the inelastic scattering and energy deposition process of low-energy electrons in liquid water and other biomaterials. As an example, we calculate the stopping power of liquid water for electrons over the 0.1-10 keV range where direct experimental measurements are still impractical and the Bethe stopping formula is inaccurate. The new stopping power values are up to 30-40% lower than previous calculations. Within the range of validity of the first Born approximation, the new values are accurate to within the experimental uncertainties (a few percent). At the low end, the introduction of Born corrections raises the uncertainty to perhaps approximately 10%.

We focused on 3 key challenges: (1) the need for a broader concept of value for PM/PrM; (2) the development of appropriate concepts and methods for measuring and splitting the innovation reward for PM/PrM; and (3) the application of this expanded concept to align value assessment in the hierarchy of related decision contexts, from formulary inclusion and value-based pricing to shared patient-provider decision making. Our working assumption was that the goal of policy affecting PM/PrM technologies should be to promote \"dynamic efficiency\"-the optimal development, adoption, and use of these technologies. For this purpose, we laid out 6 basic cross-cutting policy principles. First, rewards for innovation should be value-based and flexible over time and across indications as new evidence emerges. Second, the concept of value should be based on the microeconomic concept of willingness to pay and should include, at its core, the value of health gain-in terms of the length and quality of life- but also going beyond this to include other uncertainty-related elements. Third, innovation rewards should be modifiable given new real-world evidence and knowledge. Fourth, the scientific information embedded in PM and PrM technologies is a global public good that should be financed globally through differential pricing. Fifth, reward systems need to recognize that the diagnostic technologies that make PM and PrM possible are technically \"economic complements.\" Sixth, splitting the rewards among complementary inputs is arbitrary in a static sense but matters dynamically. For PM/PrM value assessment, we argue for including the \"value of knowing\"; the need for indication-specific pricing; the importance of updating the economic evaluation and pricing over the product life cycle; addressing the new challenge posed by next-generation sequencing and high-cost combination therapies; and aligning value metrics across different decision contexts based on health benefit and patient-centered utility.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

What does it take to be successful? Is success simply a matter of better performance, and if so, what specifically is it about performance that determines success? A long research tradition suggests that psychological momentum (PM) plays a critical role in goal pursuit and achievement. Accordingly, sequential runs of success are an essential feature of high levels of performance, meaning that better performers perceive and experience momentum of success more frequently, ride it as long as they can, and as a result, become more successful in the end. Theoretically, momentum is a principle vehicle of performance that will significantly augment future success and facilitate goal achievement. Consequently, an overall performance consists of occurrences of momentum that vary in frequency and duration. The higher the frequency and the higher the duration, the more likely is success. Research suggests that the main psychological processes that underpin momentum effects are confidence, perceived competence, and internal (ability-skill) attributions. Based upon related research, it is hypothesized that PM starts as a conscious process but subsequently becomes a major facilitator of nonconscious automatic execution of human behavior and performance.

This idea has gained considerable momentum due to the development of biomarkers, the recent FDA and EMA approval of three amyloid tracers, and the failure of a number of recent therapeutic trials conducted in the early dementia phase. On the one hand, an early etiological diagnosis can lead to early and more efficacious intervention. On the other hand, it is questioned how early an etiological diagnosis is beneficial to the patient. Here we consider ethical issues related to the process of biomarker testing and the impact on the diagnostic disclosure to patients with mild cognitive impairment due to prodromal Alzheimer's disease. A systematic review of the theoretical bioethics literature was performed by using electronic databases. The review was limited to articles published in English between 2003 and 2016. A total of twenty articles were included in our effort to make an analysis of the ethical challenges. One of the biggest challenges was the uncertainty and the predictive value of the biomarker-based diagnosis where patients can be amyloid positive without full certainty whether or when they will develop symptomatic decline due to Alzheimer's disease. Another challenge was the tension between the right to know versus the wish not to know, the limited efficacy of currently available treatment options, and the opportunities and consequences after receiving such an early diagnosis. Based on the results and the additional comments in the discussion, several unanswered questions emerged. Therefore, careful consideration of all these ethical issues is required before the disclosure of a biomarker-based diagnosis to the patient with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.",

We then review more than 30 years (1984-2018) of empirical PM research vis-à-vis this model, leading to conclusions about what the literature has studied and what we do and do not know about PM effectiveness as a result. The final section of this article further elucidates the key \"value chains\" or mediational paths that explain how and why PM can add value to organizations, framed around three pressing questions with both theoretical and practical importance (How do individual-level outcomes of PM emerge to become unit-level outcomes?

In addition, the time-out led to a loss of PM in the positive momentum condition, but to a recovery of PM in the negative momentum condition. The instructions during the time-out did not make a significant difference. Together, these results suggest that scoring patterns in a table tennis game significantly affect the PM of players. Furthermore, a player or coach could benefit from calling a time-out in a negative momentum situation, as this provides an opportunity to psychologically recover.",

To isolate the dosimetric effects of Doppler broadening by the transport algorithm and Compton momentum profiles, we varied the choice of the above photon databases, in the same simulation geometry, using either version of MCNP5 or MCNP4 (no Doppler algorithm). We computed dose rate constants and dose distributions for r = 0.2-10 cm from a point source in a 50-cm-diameter sphere of water. Nine discrete energies for primary photon sources were chosen in the range of 10-150 keV. The results from both versions of MCNP with MCPLIB04 agreed with those of PENELOPE within statistical uncertainties (+/-1%) over the entire ranges of energies and radial distances investigated. MCNP5 with either MCPLIB03 or MCPLIB02 yielded almost identical data within statistical uncertainties (+/-1%) over the entire ranges of energies and radial distances investigated. This implies that in spite of the spectral broadening of scattered photons due to the orbital electron motion, the dosimetric effect of Doppler broadening for Compton interactions in water appears to be insignificant in the energy range investigated. The spectral dose analysis with and without the Doppler broadening supported this conclusion.",

Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05).

Experienced soccer coaches imagined being the coach of the team involved in a highly important match that was displayed on a wall in a lecture hall.

Perceived PM globally evolved linearly, while strategic choice displayed a dynamical pattern of \"critical boundary\" (thus showing a nonlinear change). Nonetheless, both variables displayed asymmetrical effects, in the sense that: (1) the strength of positive PM appeared to be easier to decrease than to increase; and (2) the greater the positive PM (or the negative PM), the lesser (or the greater) the coaches' tendency to make a change in the organization of their teams.

To carry out his or her job, each employee has to know the answers to four basic questions: What resources do I control to accomplish my tasks? What measures will be used to evaluate my performance? Who do I need to interact with and influence to achieve my goals? And how much support can I expect when I reach out to others for help? The questions correspond to what the author calls the four basic spans of a job-control, accountability, influence, and support. Each span can be adjusted so that it is narrow or wide or somewhere in between. If you get the settings right, you can design a job in which a talented individual can successfully execute on your company's strategy. If you get the settings wrong, it will be difficult for an employee to be effective. The first step is to set the span of control to reflect the resources allocated to each position and unit that plays an important role in delivering customer value. This setting, like the others, is determined by how the business creates value for customers and differentiates its products and services. Next, you can dial in different levels of entrepreneurial behavior and creative tension by widening or narrowing spans of accountability and influence. Finally, you must adjust the span of support to ensure that the job or unit will get the informal help it needs.",

This is justified by adopting the corpuscular representation of light and resorting to Heisenberg's uncertainty relation applied to the photon's canonically conjugate variables momentum and position. This approach gives a deep and comprehensive representation of scattering phenomena, and also the limit of what can be meaningfully calculated and measured. Numerical examples of grating profiles demonstrate that results obtained under the widely used Beckmann-Kirchoff approximation are matched.

Bayesian networks (BNs) have gained popularity in ERA, primarily because they can combine variables from different models and integrate data and expert judgment. This paper highlights potential gaps in the treatment of uncertainty when using BNs for ERA and proposes a consistent framework (and a set of methods) for treating epistemic uncertainty to help close these gaps. The proposed framework describes the treatment of epistemic uncertainty about the model structure, parameters, expert judgment, data, management scenarios, and the assessment's output. We identify issues related to the differentiation between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty and the importance of communicating both uncertainties associated with the assessment predictions (direct uncertainty) and the strength of knowledge supporting the assessment (indirect uncertainty). Probabilities, intervals, or scenarios are expressions of direct epistemic uncertainty. The type of BN determines the treatment of parameter uncertainty: epistemic, aleatory, or predictive. Epistemic BNs are useful for probabilistic reasoning about states of the world in light of evidence. Aleatory BNs are the most relevant for ERA, but they are not sufficient to treat epistemic uncertainty alone because they do not explicitly express parameter uncertainty. For uncertainty analysis, we recommend embedding an aleatory BN into a model for parameter uncertainty. Bayesian networks do not contain information about uncertainty in the model structure, which requires several models. Statistical models (e.g., hierarchical modeling outside the BNs) are required to consider uncertainties and variability associated with data. We highlight the importance of being open about things one does not know and carefully choosing a method to precisely communicate both direct and indirect uncertainty in ERA.

For regulatory risk analysis, this relationship is described quantitatively by a concentration-response (C-R) function that relates exposure to ambient concentrations with the risk of premature mortality. Four data synthesis techniques develop the basis for, and derive, this function: systematic review, expert judgment elicitation, quantitative meta-analysis, and integrated exposure-response (IER) assessment. As part of an academic workshop aiming to guide the use of research synthesis approaches, we developed criteria with which to evaluate and select among the approaches for their ability to inform policy choices. These criteria include the quality and extent of scientific support for the method, its transparency and verifiability, its suitability to the policy problem, and the time and resources required for its application. We find that these research methods are both complementary and interdependent. A systematic review of the multidisciplinary evidence is a starting point for all methods, providing the broad conceptual basis for the nature, plausibility, and strength of the associations between PM exposure and adverse health effects. Further, for a data-rich application like PM2.5 and premature mortality, all three quantitative approaches can produce estimates that are suitable for regulatory and benefit analysis. However, when fewer data are available, more resource-intensive approaches such as expert elicitation may be more important for understanding what scientists know, where they agree or disagree, and what they believe to be the most important areas of uncertainty. Whether implicitly or explicitly, all require considerable judgment by scientists. Finding ways for all these methods to acknowledge, appropriately elicit, and examine the implications of that judgment would be an important step forward for research synthesis. ",

This paper suggests that the risks of low birth weight associated with air pollution exposure changes significantly as the distance interval (around the monitoring stations) used for exposure estimation changes. For example, when the analysis was restricted within 3 miles distance of the monitoring stations the odds of LBW (births &lt; 2500g) increased by a factor of 1.045 (±0.0285 95% CI) with a unit increase in the average daily exposure to PM(10) (in μg/m(3)) during the gestation period; the value dropped to 1.028 when the analysis was restricted within 6 miles distance of air pollution monitoring stations. The effect of PM(10) exposure on LBW became null when controlled for confounders. But PM(2.5) exposure showed a significant association with low birth weight when controlled for confounders. These results must be interpreted with caution, because the distance to monitoring station does not influence the risks of adverse birth outcomes, but uncertainty in exposure increases with the increase in distance from the monitoring stations, especially for coarse particles such as PM(10) that settle with gravity within short distance and time interval. The results of this paper have important implications for the research design of environmental epidemiological studies, and the way air pollution (and potentially other environmental) and health data are collocated to compute exposure. The paper also calls for time-space resolved estimate of air pollution to minimize uncertainty in exposure estimation.",

A drawback of AR however is related to uncertainty regarding the AR user's focus of attention in social-collaborative settings: an AR user looking in our direction might either be paying attention to us or to augmentations positioned somewhere in between. In two psychophysical experiments, we assessed what impact assumptions concerning the positioning of virtual content attended by an AR user have on other people's sensitivity to their gaze direction. In the first experiment we found that gaze discrimination was better when the participant was aware that the AR user was focusing on stimuli positioned on their depth plane as opposed to being positioned halfway between the AR user and the participant.

The effect of silicon substitution on the unimolecular dissociation processes and the threshold photoelectron spectrum has been investigated. Both molecular ions dissociate at low internal energies.

Appearance energy values for higher-energy fragmentation channels up to 36 (for MTBE) and 32 eV (for MTMSE) are reported and compared to literature values. An investigation of fragment ion peak broadening at high internal energy indicated that the two doubly charged molecular ions are not stable on the microsecond time scale. Each was found to dissociate into two singly charged ions along one or more neutral species.",

Upon formation, radical 1 gains vibrational excitation through Franck-Condon effects and rapidly dissociates by loss of a hydrogen atom, so that no survivor ions are observed after reionization. Two conformers of 1, syn-1 and anti-1, were found computationally as local energy minima that interconverted rapidly by inversion at one of the amine groups with a &lt;7 kJ mol-1 barrier. The lowest energy dissociation of radical 1 was loss of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom from anti-1 with ETS = 65 kJ mol-1. The other dissociation pathways of 1 were a hydroxyl hydrogen migration to an amine group followed by dissociation to H2N-C=O* and NH3. Ion 2+ was generated by protonation of gas-phase guanidine with a PA = 985 kJ mol-1. Electron transfer to 2+ was accompanied by large Franck-Condon effects that caused complete dissociation of radical 2 by loss of an H atom on the experimental time scale of 4 mus.

Part I.\nThe inner-sphere reorganization energy of the electron self-exchange of the couple cyclooctatetraene/cyclooctatetraene radical anion has been investigated by quantum mechanical calculations. The more stable Jahn Teller distorted B2g conformation of the radical anion has been used in this study. Two different theories have been applied in this first part. The harmonic approximation in the classical Marcus scheme has been modified by using projected force constants, which are obtained from the complete force constant matrix and the geometry changes of the molecule during the ET (introduced by Mikkelsen). A different approach (introduced by Nelsen) combines the different energies of the neutral and radical anion with and without relaxation corresponding to the vertical ionization potential and the vertical electron affinity. The electronic energies of the neutral molecule and the radical anion differ dramatically applying three different levels of quantum mechanical calculations (UAM1, UB3LYP, PMP2 with three different basis sets with and without diffuse functions). Nevertheless the Nelsen method gives almost consistent results for the inner-sphere reorganization energies: 120.1 kJ/mol for semiempirical UAM1 method, 159.3 kJ/mol, 156.4 kJ/mol and 158.3 kJ/mol for density functional UB3LYP/6-31G*, UB3LYP/6-31++G* and UB3LYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ calculations and 192.5 kJ/mol for ab-initio PMP2/6-31G* investigations, respectively. These values are in agreement with earlier experimental work supposing the total reorganization energy to be larger than 38 kcal/mol assuming an electron self-exchange rate of 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). The simple harmonic approximation of Marcus relation has not yet been applied for a molecule like cyclooctatetraene with large torsional geometry changes. Using the projected force constants after scaling, considerably different results for the inner-sphere reorganization energy have been calculated: 738.1 kJ/mol for the UB3LYP/6-31G*, 743.3 kJ/mol for UB3LYP/6-31++G* and 759.1 kJ/mol for UB3LYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Comparison with our concentration dependent EPR experiments are controversial to the earlier experimental results, but the latter supports the assumption that the electron self-exchange occurs in a time scale so that the molecules cannot complete their vibrational motions. Therefore the projected Marcus relation is not valid for cyclooctatetraene/cyclooctatetraene radical anion including a large torsional change during the electron transfer.",

It is argued that the dense manifold of electronic states present in these molecules causes prompt dissociation when the bond dissociation energy (BDE) is exceeded, allowing their respective predissociation thresholds to provide precise values of their bond energies. The BDEs were measured as 2.015(3) eV (ScSi), 2.450(2) eV (YSi), 2.891(5) eV (LaSi), 3.042(10) eV (ScC), 3.420(3) eV (YC), 4.718(4) eV (LaC), 3.899(13) eV (CoC), and 4.102(3) eV (Y-CH).

The CCSDTQ∕CBS calculations presented here involve the approximation to the CBS limit at the coupled cluster level up to full quadruple excitations along with the zero-point vibrational energy, high-order correlation, core-valence (CV) electronic, spin-orbit coupling, and scalar relativistic effect corrections. The present calculations provide the correct symmetry, (1)Σ(+), for the ground state of CoC(+). The CCSDTQ∕CBS IE(CoC) = 7.740 eV is found in good agreement with the experimental IE value of 7.73467 ± 0.00007 eV, determined in a two-color laser photoion and pulsed field ionization-photoelectron study. This work together with the previous experimental and theoretical investigations support the conclusion that the CCSDTQ∕CBS method is capable of providing reliable IE predictions for 3d-transition metal carbides, such as FeC, CoC, and NiC. Among the single-reference based coupled-cluster methods and multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach, the CCSDTQ and MRCI methods give the best predictions to the harmonic frequencies ωe (ωe (+)) = 956 (992) and 976 (1004) cm(-1) and the bond lengths re (re (+)) = 1.560 (1.528) and 1.550 (1.522) Å, respectively, for CoC (CoC(+)) in comparison with the experimental values.

In this work, we examine the dissociation energies of related aniline⋯(CH<sub4</sub)<subn</sub (n = 1, 2) van der Waals clusters, where both C/H⋯π and C/H⋯N interactions are possible. Using a combination of theory and experiments that include mass-selected two-color resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy, two-color appearance potential (2CAP) measurements, and velocity-mapped ion imaging (VMI), we derive the dissociation energies of both complexes in the ground (S<sub0</sub), excited (S<sub1</sub), and cation radical (D<sub0</sub) states. As the amide group is non-planar in the ground state, the optimized ground state geometry of the aniline⋯CH<sub4</sub 1:1 complex shows two isomers, each with the methane positioned above the aniline ring. The observed redshift of the electronic origin from the aniline monomer is consistent with TDDFT calculations for the more stable isomer, where the methane sits on the same face as the amino hydrogens. The dissociation energies of the 1:1 complex, obtained from 2CAP measurements, are in good agreement with the calculated theoretical values from selected density functional theory methods. VMI data for the 1:1 complex gave a binding energy value overestimated by ∼179 cm<sup-1</sup when compared to the 2CAP results, indicating that dissociative ionization selectively populates an excited vibrational level of the aniline cation radical. Given that the electron donating ability of aromatic substituents trends as -NH<sub2</sub &gt; -OCH<sub3</sub &gt; -CH<sub3</sub, it is noteworthy that the strength of methane binding also trends in this order, as found by experiment (dissociation energies in kJ/mol: 6.6 &gt; 5.8 &gt; 4.5) and predicted by theory (PBE0-D3/def2-QZVPPD, in kJ/mol: 6.9 &gt; 6.0 &gt; 5.0). For the 1:2 complex of aniline and methane, calculations predict that the more stable conformer is the one where the two methane molecules lie on opposite faces of the ring, consistent with the observed redshift of the electronic origin. Unlike the anisole-methane 1:2 complex, which shows an enhanced dissociation energy for the loss of one methane in comparison with the 1:1 complex, here, we find that the energy required to remove one methane from the ground state aniline-methane 1:2 complex is smaller than that of the 1:1 complex, consistent with theoretical expectations.",

An adiabatic ionization energy of 9.445 +/- 0.010 eV has been derived from the onset of the TPES spectrum. Threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy was used to explore the loss of a hydrogen atom from ionized THF over the photon energy range of 9.9-10.4 eV. RRKM fitting of the resulting breakdown curves yields an E(0) of 0.85 +/- 0.03 eV (82 +/- 3 kJ mol(-1)) (AE = 10.30 +/- 0.04 eV). If the G3 IE of 9.48 eV is used to convert the experimental data from photon energy to THF ion internal energy, E(0) = 0.81 +/- 0.01 eV (78 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1)). The latter value is closer to the G3 E(0) of 72 kJ mol(-1) for the formation of the cyclic ion 1. A variety of ring-opening reactions were also probed at the B3-LYP/6-31+G(d) and G3 levels of theory.

The dissociation energies of the new species were determined by second- and third-law analyses of both the direct dissociation reactions and isomolecular exchange reactions involving homonuclear molecules. The selected values of the dissociation energies at 0 K (D0 degrees) are 165.1+/-7.3 and 141.6+/-6.9 kJ/mol, respectively, for SiPb and GePb, and the corresponding enthalpies of formation (DeltafH0 degrees) are 476.4+/-7.3 and 419.3+/-6.9 kJ/mol. The ionization efficiency curves of the two species were measured, giving the following values for the first ionization energies: 7.0+/-0.2 eV (SiPb) and 7.1+/-0.2 eV (GePb). A computational study of the species SiPb and GePb was also carried out at the CCSD(T) level of theory using the relativistic electron core potential approach. Molecular parameters, adiabatic ionization energies, adiabatic electron affinities, and dissociation energies of the title species were calculated, as well as the enthalpy changes of the exchange reactions involving the other Pb-containing diatomics of group 14.

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039 kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57 $\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mol}/{\\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30 000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",

Methylperoxy (CH(3)OO) and ethylperoxy (C(2)H(5)OO) radicals are produced by the reaction of pulsed, photolytically produced alkyl radicals with molecular oxygen, and the mass spectrum of the reacting mixture is monitored in time by using synchrotron-photoionization with a double-focusing mass spectrometer. The kinetics of product formation is used to confirm the origins and assignments of ionized species. The photoionization efficiency curve for CH(3)OO has been measured, and an adiabatic ionization energy of (10.33 +/- 0.05) eV was determined with the aid of Franck-Condon spectral simulations, including ionization to the lowest triplet and singlet cation states. Using the appearance energy of CH(3)(+) from CH(3)OO, an enthalpy of formation for CH(3)OO of Delta(f) (CH(3)OO) = (22.4 +/- 5) kJ mol(-1) is derived. The enthalpy of formation of CH(3)OO(+) is derived as Delta(f) = (1019 +/- 7) kJ mol(-1) and the CH(3)(+)-OO bond energy as (CH(3)(+) - O(2)) = (80 +/- 7) kJ mol(-1). The C(2)H(5)OO(+) signal is not detectable; however, the time profile of the ethyl cation signal suggests its formation from dissociative ionization of C(2)H(5)OO.

Properties of the triatomic systems studied include structures and energies of ground and excited states (bent and linear geometries), dissociation energies, ionization energies, and vertical electron detachment energies.

Low-LET ions are described in a perturbative frame, whereas heavy ions with a very high stopping power are treated using the Lindhard local density approximation and the Russek and Meli statistical method. Ionization cross sections singly differential with energy compare well with the experiment. As an illustration of the non-perturbative interaction of high-LET ions, a comparison between the ion tracks of light and heavy ions with the same specific energy is presented (1.4 MeV/nucleon helium and uranium ions). The mean energy for ejected electrons was found to be approximately four times larger for uranium than for helium, leading to a much larger track radius in the first case. For electrons, except for the excitation cross sections that are deduced from experimental fits, cross sections are derived analytically. For any orientation of the target molecule, the code calculates multiple differential cross sections as a function of the ejection and scattering angles and of the energy transfer.

Quantum chemical calculations are presented for the ionization energy and cation stability of several alkenylperoxy radicals. Experimental measurements of 1-cyclopentenylperoxy (1-c-C5H7OO) and propargylperoxy (CH2=C=CHOO) photoionization are presented as examples. These radicals are produced by reaction of an excess of O2 with pulsed-photolytically produced alkenyl radicals.

Electronic structure calculations are employed to give structural parameters and energetics that are used in a Franck-Condon (FC) spectral simulation of the photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves. The calculations also serve to identify the isomeric species probed by the experiment. Adiabatic ionization energies (AIEs) of 1-c-C5H7OO (8.70 +/- 0.05 eV) and CH2=C=CHOO (9.32 +/- 0.05 eV) are derived from fits to the experimental PIE curves.

The average binding energies for each LiNH(2) unit increase gradually from 142 kJ mol(-1) up to about 180 kJ mol(-1) with increasing n.

Regardless of the mode of precursor ion preparation, the radicals underwent complete dissociation on the time scale of 5.15 micros. Deuterium isotope labeling and product analysis pointed out several competitive and convergent dissociation pathways that were not completely resolved by experiment. Ab initio calculations, which were extrapolated up to the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,2p) level of theory, provided the proton affinity and gas-phase basicity of BANMA as PA = 971 kJ mol-1 and GB = 932 kJ mol-1 to form the most stable ion structure 1c+ in which the protonated ammonium group was internally solvated by hydrogen bonding to the amide carbonyl. Ion 1c+ was calculated to have an adiabatic recombination energy of 3.33 eV to form ammonium radical 1c*. The potential energy surface for competitive and consecutive isomerizations and dissociations of 1c* was investigated at correlated levels of theory and used for Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) calculations. RRKM unimolecular rate constants suggested that dissociations starting from the ground electronic state of radical 1c* were dominated by loss of an ammonium hydrogen atom. In contrast, dissociations starting from the B excited state were predicted to proceed by reversible isomerization to an aminoketyl radical (1f*). The latter can in part dissociate by N-Calpha bond cleavage leading to the loss of the amide methyl group. This indicates that apparently competitive dissociations observed for larger amide and peptide radicals, such as backbone cleavages and losses of side-chain groups, may originate from different electronic states and proceed on different potential energy surfaces.",

These modifications eliminate the need for empirical corrections that are incorporated in standard CBS-QB3 to compensate for spin contamination when spin-unrestricted wave functions are used. We employ an initial test set of 19 severely spin-contaminated species including doublet radicals and both singlet and triplet biradicals. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) from experiment for the new ROCBS-QB3 model (3.6+/-1.5 kJ mol(-1)) is slightly smaller than that of the standard unrestricted CBS-QB3 version (4.8+/-1.5 kJ mol(-1)) and substantially smaller than the MAD for the unrestricted CBS-QB3 before inclusion of the spin correction (16.1+/-1.5 kJ mol(-1)). However, when applied to calculate the heats of formation at 298 K for the moderately spin-contaminated radicals in the G2/97 test set, ROCBS-QB3 does not perform quite as well as the standard unrestricted CBS-QB3, with a MAD from experiment of 3.8+/-1.6 kJ mol(-1) (compared with 2.9+/-1.6 kJ mol(-1) for standard CBS-QB3).

Spin-orbit and nonadiabatic couplings among the multitudes of potential curves allow predissociation to occur on a rapid timescale when the molecule is excited to states lying above the ground separated atom limit.

Focus is on the advances recently made in the investigation of the dynamics of elementary multichannel radical-molecule and radical-radical reactions, as they have become possible using an improved crossed molecular beam scattering apparatus with universal electron-ionization mass spectrometric detection and time-of-flight analysis. These improvements consist in the implementation of (a) soft ionization detection by tunable low-energy electrons which has permitted us to reduce interfering signals originating from dissociative ionization processes, usually representing a major complication, (b) different beam crossing-angle set-ups which have permitted us to extend the range of collision energies over which a reaction can be studied, from very low (a few kJ mol(-1), as of interest in astrochemistry or planetary atmospheric chemistry) to quite high energies (several tens of kJ mol(-1), as of interest in high temperature combustion systems), and (c) continuous supersonic sources for producing a wide variety of atomic and molecular radical reactant beams. Exploiting these new features it has become possible to tackle the dynamics of a variety of polyatomic multichannel reactions, such as those occurring in many environments ranging from combustion and plasmas to terrestrial/planetary atmospheres and interstellar clouds. By measuring product angular and velocity distributions, after having suppressed or mitigated, when needed, the problem of dissociative ionization of interfering species (reactants, products, background gases) by soft ionization detection, essentially all primary reaction products can be identified, the dynamics of each reaction channel characterized, and the branching ratios determined as a function of collision energy. In general this information, besides being of fundamental relevance, is required for a predictive description of the chemistry of these environments via computer models. Examples are taken from recent on-going work (partly published) on the reactions of atomic oxygen with acetylene, ethylene and allyl radical, of great importance in combustion. A reaction of relevance in interstellar chemistry, as that of atomic carbon with acetylene, is also discussed briefly. Comparison with theoretical results is made wherever possible, both at the level of electronic structure calculations of the potential energy surfaces and dynamical computations. Recent complementary CMB work as well as kinetic work exploiting soft photo-ionization with synchrotron radiation are noted. The examples illustrated in this article demonstrate that the type of dynamical results now obtainable on polyatomic multichannel radical-molecule and radical-radical reactions might well complement reaction kinetics experiments and hence contribute to bridging the gap between microscopic reaction dynamics and thermal reaction kinetics, enhancing significantly our basic knowledge of chemical reactivity and understanding of the elementary reactions which occur in real-world environments.",

From product angular and velocity distribution measurements of the HCCO and CH2 products in the laboratory frame, product angular and translational energy distributions in the center-of-mass frame were determined. Measurements on the CH2 product were made possible by employing for product detection the recently implemented soft electron-ionization (EI) technique with low-energy, tunable electrons, which has permitted suppressing interference coming from the dissociative ionization of reactants, products and background gases. It has been found that the title reaction leads only to two competing channels: H + HCCO (ketenyl) and CO + CH2 (triplet methylene). The branching ratio of cross sections between the two competing channels has been determined to be σ(HCCO)/[σ(HCCO) + σ(CH2)] = 0.79 ± 0.05, independent of collision energy within the experimental uncertainty. This value is in line with that obtained in the most recent and accurate kinetics determination at room temperature as well as with that predicted from recent theoretical calculations based on statistical rate theory and weak-collision master equation analysis and on dynamics surface-hopping quasiclassical trajectory calculations on-the-fly on coupled triplet/singlet ab initio potential energy surfaces.

The S0 → S1 vibrationless transitions of P·4ClE and P·(4ClE)2 are shifted by δν = -451 and -858 cm(-1) relative to perylene, translating to excited-state dissociation energy increases of 5.4 and 10.3 kJ/mol, respectively. The red shift is ∼30% larger than that of perylene·trans-1,2-dichloroethene; therefore, the increase in chlorination increases the excited-state stabilization and CT character of the interaction, but the electronic excitation remains largely confined to the perylene moiety. The 2C-R2PI and fluorescence spectra of P·4ClE exhibit strong progressions in the perylene intramolecular twist (1au) vibration (42 cm(-1) in S0 and 55 cm(-1) in S1), signaling that perylene deforms along its twist coordinate upon electronic excitation. The intermolecular stretching (Tz) and internal rotation (Rc) vibrations are weak; therefore, the P·4ClE intermolecular potential energy surface (IPES) changes little during the S0 ↔ S1 transition.

We have exploited the capability of (a) generating continuous intense supersonic beams of C(3P, 1D), (b) crossing the two reactant beams at different intersection angles (45, 90, and 135 degrees ) to attain a wide range of collision energies, and (c) tuning the energy of the ionizing electrons to low values (soft ionization) to suppress interferences from dissociative ionization processes. From angular and TOF distribution measurements of products at m/z=37 and 36, the primary reaction products of the C(3P) and C(1D) reactions with C2H2 have been identified to be cyclic (c)-C3H + H, linear (l)-C3H + H, and C3 + H2. From the data analysis, product angular and translational energy distributions in the center-of-mass (CM) system for both the linear and cyclic C3H isomers as well as the C3 product from C(3P) and for l/c-C3H and C3 from C(1D) have been derived as a function of collision energy from 3.6 to 49.1 kJ mol-1. The cyclic/linear C3H ratio and the C3/(C3 + c/l-C3H) branching ratios for the C(3P) reaction have been determined as a function of collision energy. The present findings have been compared with those from previous CMB studies using pulsed beams; here, a marked contrast is noted in the CM angular distributions for both C3H- and C3-forming channels from C(3P) and their trend with collision energy. Consequently, the interpretation of the reaction dynamics derived in the present work contradicts that previously proposed from the pulsed CMB studies. The results have been discussed in the light of the available theoretical information on the relevant triplet and singlet C3H2 ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). In particular, the branching ratios for the C(3P) + C2H2 reaction have been compared with the available theoretical predictions (approximate quantum scattering calculations and quasiclassical trajectory calculations on ab initio triplet PESs and, very recent, statistical calculations on ab initio triplet PESs as well as on ab initio triplet/singlet PESs including nonadiabatic effects, that is, intersystem crossing). While the experimental branching ratios have been corroborated by the statistical predictions, strong disagreement has been found with the results of the dynamical calculations.

The 127mXe is swept out continuously, as it is produced, by bubbling helium upward through the solutions. Up to approximately 100 mci/l are obtained from the resulting mixture of gases. The 127mXe + helium is admixed with about five volumes of air (or oxygen) and then driven continuously to a scintillation camera located approximately 200 yd distant. When the mixture of gases is inhaled, high quality images of the lungs are obtained by means of an Anger scintillation camera.",

Besides the γ rays emitted in the decay of the known neutron single-particle states in ^{133}Sn additional γ strength in the energy range 3.5-5.5 MeV was observed for the first time. Since the neutron-separation energy of ^{133}Sn is low, S_{n}=2.402(4)  MeV, this observation provides direct evidence for the radiative decay of neutron-unbound states in this nucleus. The ability of electromagnetic decay to compete successfully with neutron emission at energies as high as 3 MeV above threshold is attributed to a mismatch between the wave functions of the initial and final states in the latter case. These findings suggest that in the region southeast of ^{132}Sn nuclear structure effects may play a significant role in the neutron versus γ competition in the decay of unbound states. As a consequence, the common neglect of such effects in the evaluation of the neutron-emission probabilities in calculations of global β-decay properties for astrophysical simulations may have to be reconsidered.",

In a boron neutron capture therapy, a very serious unsolved problem exists, namely that the treatment effect for BNCT cannot be known during irradiation in real time. Therefore, we have been developing a so-called BNCT-SPECT with a CdTe detector, which can obtain a three-dimensional image for the BNCT treatment effect by measuring 478 keV gamma-rays emitted from the excited state of (7)Li nucleus created by the (10)B(n,α) reaction. However, no practical uses were realized at present, because BNCT-SPECT requires very severe conditions for spatial resolution, measuring time, statistical accuracy and energy resolution. The design study was performed with numerical simulations carried out by a 3-dimenaional transport code, MCNP5 considering the detector assembly, irradiation room and even arrangement of arrayed CdTe crystals. The estimated count rate of 478 keV gamma-rays was sufficiently large being more than the target value of over 1000 counts/h. However, the S/N ratio did not meet the target of S/N &gt; 1. We confirmed that deterioration of the S/N ratio was caused by the influence of Compton scattering especially due to capture gamma-rays of hydrogen. Theoretical calculations were thereafter carried out to find out whether anti-Compton measurement in an array-type CdTe detector could decrease the noise due to Compton scatterings. The calculation result showed that the anti-coincidence would possibly increase the S/N ratio. In the next phase, an arrayed detector with two CdTe crystals will be produced to test removal possibility of the anti-coincident event.",

Currently, there is no report of tomographic imaging based on radioluminescence.

Their interaction, however, leads to other important effects, such as providing an additional decay mode for excited nuclear states, whereby the nucleus releases energy by ejecting an atomic electron instead of by emitting a γ-ray. This 'internal conversion' has been known for about a hundred years and can be used to study nuclei and their interaction with their electrons. In the inverse process-nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC)-a free electron is captured into an atomic vacancy and can excite the nucleus to a higher-energy state, provided that the kinetic energy of the free electron plus the magnitude of its binding energy once captured matches the nuclear energy difference between the two states. NEEC was predicted in 1976 and has not hitherto been observed. Here we report evidence of NEEC in molybdenum-93 and determine the probability and cross-section for the process in a beam-based experimental scenario. Our results provide a standard for the assessment of theoretical models relevant to NEEC, which predict cross-sections that span many orders of magnitude. The greatest practical effect of the NEEC process may be on the survival of nuclei in stellar environments, in which it could excite isomers (that is, long-lived nuclear states) to shorter-lived states. Such excitations may reduce the abundance of the isotope after its production. This is an example of 'isomer depletion', which has been investigated previously through other reactions, but is used here to obtain evidence for NEEC.",

The 212Pb is taken up quickly by the cells, reaching saturation levels in 1.25 h. When the cells are washed, the intracellular activity is retained with a biological half-life of 11.6 h.

This state is the one formed directly upon capture of a proton, and hence most of the capture radiation is emitted quickly in the direct-interaction mode. Some of the energy that is contained in the giant-resonance state is shared with the more-complicated states of the compound nucleus (that is, with states having many excited nucleons). This sharing, in turn, gives rise to the fine structure that is observed within the giant-resonance envelope.

But these multi-gamma radionuclides cannot be used alone, because the gamma-rays of high intensity are irregularly distributed across the energy spectrum. 166mHo is a more suitable single source for such calibrations, because this radionuclide decays by beta(-)emission to the excited states of 166Er with the subsequent emission of about 20 strong and well distributed gamma-rays ever the energy range 50-1000 keV. Moreover, with a relatively long half-life (1200 yr) and characteristic X-rays between 40 and 50 keV, this nuclide is a good standard for the calibration of germanium detectors.

In contrast to the well-known single-gamma (γ)-decay, the γγ-decay is characterized by the simultaneous emission of two γ quanta, each with a continuous energy spectrum. In nuclear physics, this exotic decay mode has only been observed for transitions between states with spin-parity quantum numbers J(π) = 0(+) (refs 1-3). Single-gamma decays-the main experimental obstacle to observing the γγ-decay-are strictly forbidden for these 0(+) → 0(+) transitions. Here we report the observation of the γγ-decay of an excited nuclear state (J(π) = 11/2(-)) that is directly competing with an allowed γ-decay (to ground state J(π) = 3/2(+)). The branching ratio of the competitive γγ-decay of the 11/2(-) isomer of (137)Ba to the ground state relative to its single γ-decay was determined to be (2.05 ± 0.37) × 10(-6). From the measured angular correlation and the shape of the energy spectra of the individual γ-rays, the contributing combinations of multipolarities of the γ radiation were determined.

It should thus be regarded as the overall temporal response of the whole upconversion system to the excitation function rather than the intrinsic lifetime of the luminescence emitting state. Only under certain conditions, such as when the effective lifetime of the sensitizer's excited state is significantly shorter than that of the UCL emitting state and of the absence of cross-relaxation processes involving the emitting energy level, the UCL decay time approaches the intrinsic lifetime of the emitting state. Subsequently, Stokes excitation is generally preferred in order to accurately quantify the intrinsic lifetime of the emitting state. However, possible cross-relaxation between doped ions at high doping levels can complicate the decay characteristics of the luminescence and even make the Stokes-excitation approach fail.

J. Burdett, A. M. Muller, D. Gosztola, and C. J. Bardeen, J. Chem. Phys. 133, 144506 (2010)]. A study of the intensity dependence of the singlet state decay is conducted to understand the origins of the discrepancy between the broadband transient absorption and fluorescence experiments seen previously. High-sensitivity single channel transient absorption experiments allow us to compare the transient absorption dynamics to the fluorescence dynamics measured at identical laser fluences. At high excitation densities, an exciton-exciton annihilation rate constant of ~1 × 10(-8) cm(3) s(-1) leads to rapid singlet decays, but at excitation densities of 2 × 10(17) cm(-3) or less the kinetics of the transient absorption match those of the fluorescence. At these lower excitation densities, both measurements confirm that the initially excited singlet state relaxes with a decay time of 80 ± 3 ps, not 9.2 ps as claimed in the earlier paper. In order to investigate the origin of the singlet decay, the wavelength-resolved fluorescence dynamics were measured at 298 K, 77 K, and 4 K. A high-energy J-type emitting species undergo a rapid (~100 ps) decay at all temperatures, while at 77 K and 4 K additional species with H-type and J-type emission lineshapes have much longer lifetimes. A global analysis of the wavelength-dependent decays shows that the initial ~100 ps decay occurs to a dark state and not via energy transfer to lower energy bright states. Varying the excitation wavelength from 400 nm to 510 nm had no effect on the fast decay, suggesting that there is no energy threshold for the initial singlet relaxation. The presence of different emitting species at different temperatures means that earlier interpretations of the fluorescence behavior in terms of one singlet state that is short-lived due to singlet fission at high temperatures but long-lived at lower temperatures are probably too simplistic. The presence of a rapid singlet decay at all temperatures indicates that the initially created J-type singlet exciton decays to an intermediate that only produces free triplets (and delayed fluorescence) at high temperatures.",

A pyridyl radical-pyridine (dimer) complex produced in the pulse radiolysis of neat liquid pyridine is detected at lambda = 390 nm and is consistent with iodine scavenging effects. Formation of the pyridiniumyl radical cation-pyridine charge-transfer complex is proposed to be insignificant in liquid pyridine.",

In this paper the correlation between radioactivity induced inside the treatment room and the undesirable thermal and resonance neutron radiation generated by the therapeutic accelerator X-rays was studied. The thermal and resonance neutron fluence determined in chosen places inside the bunkers was 1.0x10(5)-3.4x10(5)cm(-2)Gy(-1) and 1.0x10(5)-1.6x10(6)cm(-2)Gy(-1) at thermal energies (&lt;0.1eV) and 3.9x10(4)-1.3x10(5)cm(-2)Gy(-1) and 1.0x10(5)-1.1x10(6)cm(-2)Gy(-1) at epithermal energies (0.1eV-10keV), for the 15MV and 20MV beams, respectively.

However, as a heavy atom, selenium substitution may easily alter the photophysical properties of a nucleic acid by red-shifting the absorption spectra and introducing effective intersystem crossing to triplet excited states. In present work, the excited state dynamics of a naturally occurring selenium substituted uracil (2-selenuracil, 2SeU) is studied by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemistry calculations. Ultrafast intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet state (T<sub1</sub) and effective non-radiative decay of this state to the ground state (S<sub0</sub) are demonstrated in the neutral form 2SeU. However, the triplet lifetime of the deprotonated form 2SeU is found to be almost one order of magnitude longer than that in the neutral one. Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that the short triplet lifetime in 2SeU is due to excited state population decay through a crossing point between T<sub1</sub and S<sub0</sub. In the deprotonated form, shortening the N1-C2 bond length makes the structural distortion more difficult and brings a larger energy barrier on the pathway to the T<sub1</sub/S<sub0</sub crossing point, resulting in one order of magnitude increase of the triplet state lifetime. Our study reveals one key factor to regulate the triplet lifetime of 2SeU and sets the stage to further investigate the photophysical and photochemical properties of 2SeU-containing DNA/RNA duplexes.",

The aim of this work is to provide a complete set of background energy spectra, due to the scintillator intrinsic radioactivity, for a wide range of crystal sizes. An analytical model, developed and validated in a previous work, was used to obtain the background energy spectra of square base cuboids of different dimensions. The model uses the photon absorption probabilities of the three gamma rays (88, 202, and 307 keV) emitted following the beta decay of <sup176</sup Lu to <sup176</sup Hf excited states. These probabilities were obtained for each crystal size considered in this work from Monte Carlo simulations using the PENELOPE code. The probabilities are then used to normalize and shift the beta spectrum to the corresponding energy value of the simultaneous detection of one, two, or three gamma rays in the scintillator. The simulated cuboids had side lengths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mm and crystal thickness T = 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm. From these results a complete set of energy spectra, including intermediate dimensions, were obtained. In addition, LYSO and LSO were compared in terms of their analytical background energy spectra for two crystal sizes. The analytical spectra were convolved using a variable Gaussian kernel to account for the energy resolution of a typical detector. A parameterization of the photon absorption probabilities for each gamma ray energy as a function of the cuboid volume to surface area ratio was obtained. A data set of L(Y)SO background energy spectra was obtained and is available for the reader as 2D histograms. The model accurately predicts the structure of the energy spectra including the relative peak and valley intensities. The data allow visualizing how the structure evolves with increasing crystal length and thickness. Lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate and LSO present very similar background energy spectra for the range of sizes studied in this work and therefore the data generated can be confidently used for both scintillator materials. The filtered spectra showed a variable shift in the main peaks, depending on crystal size, alerting that to achieve a correct detector calibration using the background spectrum is not straight forward and requires precise data analysis and measurements. In addition, we found that square base L(Y)SO cuboids with same volume to surface area ratio have background spectra with the same structure. We present the energy spectra of L(Y)SO crystal of different sizes which will be very useful for industry and research groups developing and simulating detectors for positron imaging applications in terms of calibration, quality assurance, crystal maps, detector fine gain tuning, background reduction and other applications using the long-lived <sup176</sup Lu source.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of a few ground state conformations of three Pt(II) diacetylide structures showed similar total energy for each geometry-optimized rotamer but some differences in the vertical excitation energies and in the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer character. The wavelengths of the calculated excitations were found to be red-shifted compared with peaks in the optical absorption spectra, but the general trends and shifts of wavelengths between the different structures are well reproduced. Static emission spectra for degassed samples in THF solution of the larger compounds showed small Stokes shifts and low fluorescence quantum yields, indicating fast intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold. More pronounced differences between the compounds were displayed in the phosphorescence data, in terms of spectral emission wavelengths and decay times. For instance, the phosphorescence decay of the compound with the thiophene ring close to the Pt center was found to be significantly faster than for the other compounds.

We demonstrate the approach on experimental coherent Bragg diffraction data measured with 52 keV x-rays from a nanocrystalline sample. From this sample, we resolve the fine fringe detail of a high-energy x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction pattern to an upsampling factor of 16 of the native pixel pitch of 30 μm of a charge-integrating fastCCD detector. This was accomplished by analysis of individual photon locations in a series of \"nearly-dark\" instances of the diffraction pattern that each contain only a handful of photons. Central to our approach was the adaptation of the UNLOC photon fitting routine for PALM/STORM to the hard x-ray regime to handle much smaller point spread functions, which required a different statistical test for photon detection and for sub-pixel localization. A comparison to a photon-localization strategy used in the x-ray community (\"droplet analysis\") showed that XR-UNLOC provides significant improvement in super-resolution. We also developed a metric by which to estimate the limit of reliable upsampling with XR-UNLOC under a given set of experimental conditions in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of a photon detection event and the size of the point spread function for guiding future x-ray experiments in many disciplines where detector pixelation limits must be overcome.",

The fourth band CIS spectrum showed structure in the 12.9-14.1 eV photon energy range, which is also seen in the first band CIS spectra.

These atomic iodine CIS spectra show reasonably good agreement with the equivalent spectra obtained for atomic bromine.

These plots are interpreted in terms of an angular momentum transfer model with the positive values of beta obtained on resonances corresponding to parity allowed j(t)=1 and 3 channels and the off-resonance negative beta values corresponding to parity unfavored channels, where j(t) is the quantum number for angular momentum transfer between the molecule, and the ion and photoelectron. The beta-plots recorded for iodine are significantly different from those obtained for atomic bromine. Comparison of the experimental CIS spectra and beta-plots with available theoretical results highlights the need for higher level calculations which include factors such as configuration interaction in the initial and final states, relativistic effects including spin-orbit interaction, and autoionization via resonant Rydberg states.",

Theory and spectroscopic properties.\nThe excitation of a fluorescent molecule by a beta-decay electron (radioluminescence) depends upon the electron energy, the distance between radioactive 'donor' and fluorescent 'acceptor', and the excitation characteristics and solvent environment of the fluorophore. The theory for calculation of single photon radioluminescence (SPR) signals is developed here; in the accompanying paper, measurement methods and biological applications are presented. To calculate the three-dimensional spatial profile for electron energy deposition in an aqueous environment, a Monte Carlo calculation was performed incorporating theories of electron energy distributions, energy loss due to interactions with matter, and deflections in electron motion due to collisions. For low energy beta emitters, 50% of energy deposition occurs within 0.63 micron (3H, 18.5 keV), 22 microns (14C, 156 keV), 25 microns (35S, 167 keV), and 260 microns (36Cl, 712 keV) of the radioisotope. In close proximity to the beta emitter (100 nm, 3H; 10 microns, 14C) the probability for fluorophore excitation is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the beta emitter and fluorophore. To investigate the other factors that determine the probability for fluorophore excitation, SPR measurements were carried out in solutions containing 3H and a series of fluorophores in different solvents. In water, the probability of fluorescence excitation was nearly proportional to the integrated absorbance over a &gt; 1,000-fold variation in absorbances. The probability of fluorescence excitation was enhanced up to 2,600-fold when the fluorophore was in a \"scintillant\" aromatic or hydrocarbon solvent. SPR emission spectra were similar to fluorescence emission spectra obtained with photon excitation. The single photon signal due to Bremsstrahlung increased with wavelength in agreement with theory. The distance dependence for the SPR signal predicted by the model was in good agreement with measurements in which a 14C donor was separated by known thicknesses of water from a fluorescently-coated coverglass. Quantitative predictions for radioluminescence signal as a function of donor-acceptor distance were developed for specific radioisotope-fluorophore geometries in biological samples.",

All undergo O-H bond fission following excitation at wavelengths λ ≲ 240 nm, on repulsive ((n∕π)σ∗) potential energy surfaces (PESs), yielding fast H atoms with mean kinetic energies ∼11,000 cm(-1). For Y = I and Br, this process occurs in competition with prompt C-I and C-Br bond cleavage on another (n∕π)σ∗ PES, but no Cl∕Cl∗ products unambiguously attributable to one photon induced C-Cl bond fission are observed from 4-ClPhOH. Differences in fragmentation behaviour at longer excitation wavelengths are more marked. Prompt C-I bond fission is observed following excitation of 4-IPhOH at all λ ≤ 330 nm; the wavelength dependent trends in I∕I∗ product branching ratio, kinetic energy release, and recoil anisotropy suggest that (with regard to C-I bond fission) 4-IPhOH behaves like a mildly perturbed iodobenzene. Br atoms are observed when exciting 4-BrPhOH at long wavelengths also, but their velocity distributions suggest that dissociation occurs after internal conversion to the ground state. O-H bond fission, by tunnelling (as in phenol), is observed only in the cases of 4-FPhOH and, more weakly, 4-ClPhOH. These observed differences in behaviour can be understood given due recognition of (i) the differences in the vertical excitation energies of the C-Y centred (n∕π)σ∗ potentials across the series Y = I &lt; Br &lt; Cl and the concomitant reduction in C-Y bond strength, cf. that of the rival O-H bond, and (ii) the much increased spin-orbit coupling in, particularly, 4-IPhOH.

The 355 nm spectrum consists of a band assigned to a transition from the ground state of the anion to the ground state of the neutral. Its onset at ∼1.8 eV corresponds to the adiabatic electron affinity (EA) of oxalyl chloride, in agreement with the coupled-cluster calculations predicting an EA of 1.797 eV. The observed vertical detachment energy, 2.33(4) eV, is also in agreement with the theory predictions. The 532 nm spectrum additionally reveals a sharp onset near the photon-energy limit. This feature is ascribed to autodetachment via a low-energy anionic resonance. The results are discussed in the context of the substitution series, which includes glyoxal, methylglyoxal (single methyl substitution), biacetyl (double methyl substitution), and oxalyl chloride (double chlorine substitution). The EAs and anion detachment energies follow the trend: biacetyl &lt; methylglyoxal &lt; glyoxal ≪ oxalyl chloride. The electron-donating character of the methyl group has a destabilizing effect on the substituted anions, reducing the EA from glyoxal to methylglyoxal to biacetyl.

Tool design is based on comparing the effect of k-edge discontinuity of the attenuation coefficient for a series of element filters. Compatibility with the mammography accreditation phantom (MAP) to obtain a single quality control film is a second design objective. When the attenuation of a series of sequential elements is studied simultaneously, differences in the absorption characteristics due to the k-edge discontinuities are more evident. Specifically, when the incident photon energy is higher than the k-edge energy of a number of the elements and lower than the remainder, an inflection may be seen in the resulting attenuation data. The maximum energy of the incident photon spectra may be determined based on this inflection point for a series of element filters. Monte Carlo photon transport analysis was used to estimate the photon transmission probabilities for each of the sequential k-edge filter elements. The photon transmission corresponds directly to optical density recorded on mammographic x-ray film. To observe the inflection, the element filters chosen must have k-edge energies that span a range greater than the expected range of the end point energies to be determined. For the design, incident x-ray spectra ranging from 25 to 40 kVp were assumed to be from a molybdenum target. Over this range, the k-edge energy changes by approximately 1.5 keV between sequential elements. For this design 21 elements spanning an energy range from 20 to 50 keV were chosen. Optimum filter element thicknesses were calculated to maximize attenuation differences at the k-edge while maintaining optical densities between 0.10 and 3.00.

The average difference between the kVp determination and the calibrated dial setting was 0.8 and 1.0 kV for a Senographe 600 T and a Senographe DMR, respectively.

The laser wavelength is varied in a narrow range around 243 nm, so that the photoionization is resonant with the metastable 2S(1/2) state. The ion yield, the ion time-of-flight spectra, and the yield of Lyman-alpha photons have been measured as a function of laser intensity (from 1 to 340 MW/cm(2)) and laser detuning around the 1S(1/2)-2S(1/2) two-photon resonance. During and shortly after the laser pulse, collective effects resulting from the mutual interaction of the photoelectrons and the ions affect the spatial and temporal distribution of the ions. Because of the near-degeneracy of the 2S(1/2), 2P(1/2), and 2P(3/2) states, the resonant multiphoton ionization is affected by the Stark mixing of these states in the collective field. As a result, the time-dependent yields of ions and of Lyman-alpha photons are modulated by the interplay of the multiphoton ionization of the atoms and the collective effects in the plasma. From the measurements it is deduced that collective effects are important above a critical charge density of 3x10(8) ions/cm(3). An asymmetry is observed in the line profile of the total ion yield as a function of laser detuning. This asymmetry is interpreted to be due to the effect of the collective field upon the intermediate resonant 2S(1/2) state of the photoionization process.",

All these stable heterocyclic compounds are fully characterized, and exhibit intense single- and two-photon excited fluorescence (SPEF and TPEF) over a wide spectral range from blue to red, with the spectral peak position of the SPEF being basically the same as that of the TPEF. The well-conjugated pi-systems, observed from the crystal structure, indicate the charge transfer feature of the ground state. Meanwhile, the theoretical and experimental studies indicate that the charge transfer from donor to acceptor is greatly enhanced in the excited states and the different substituted donor groups on the pyrimidine have a large effect on the optical and electrochemical properties. Based on typical structure data and comprehensive spectral data, the following structure-property relationships can be determined: for such bent-shaped chromophores, the absorption and the fluorescence wavelength maximum of the SPEF and TPEF, and two-photon absorption cross sections show a similar trend with increasing electron-donating strength of the corresponding terminal group and the number of branches, while the average bond lengths of the pi-linkage and HOMO-LUMO energy levels show an inverse trend. Experimental data and theoretical calculation provide a coherent picture. With these findings, bent-shaped quadrupolar chromophores combining peak TPA cross sections (up to 2280 GM), broad TPA bands throughout the whole 700-900 nm range, and high fluorescence quantum yields could, thus, be obtained. Such compounds are of particular interest for TPEF microscopy, as well as optical data storage in the visible and NIR regions.

Coevolution with other stars and the atmosphere on extrasolar worlds.\nAs photosynthesis on Earth produces the primary signatures of life that can be detected astronomically at the global scale, a strong focus of the search for extrasolar life will be photosynthesis, particularly photosynthesis that has evolved with a different parent star. We take previously simulated planetary atmospheric compositions for Earth-like planets around observed F2V and K2V, modeled M1V and M5V stars, and around the active M4.5V star AD Leo; our scenarios use Earth's atmospheric composition as well as very low O2 content in case anoxygenic photosynthesis dominates. With a line-by-line radiative transfer model, we calculate the incident spectral photon flux densities at the surface of the planet and under water. We identify bands of available photosynthetically relevant radiation and find that photosynthetic pigments on planets around F2V stars may peak in absorbance in the blue, K2V in the red-orange, and M stars in the near-infrared, in bands at 0.93-1.1 microm, 1.1-1.4 microm, 1.5-1.8 microm, and 1.8-2.5 microm. However, underwater organisms will be restricted to wavelengths shorter than 1.4 microm and more likely below 1.1 microm. M star planets without oxygenic photosynthesis will have photon fluxes above 1.6 microm curtailed by methane. Longer-wavelength, multi-photo-system series would reduce the quantum yield but could allow for oxygenic photosystems at longer wavelengths. A wavelength of 1.1 microm is a possible upper cutoff for electronic transitions versus only vibrational energy; however, this cutoff is not strict, since such energetics depend on molecular configuration. M star planets could be a half to a tenth as productive as Earth in the visible, but exceed Earth if useful photons extend to 1.1 microm for anoxygenic photosynthesis. Under water, organisms would still be able to survive ultraviolet flares from young M stars and acquire adequate light for growth.",

The FCLA molecule can react with ROS and, after a series of reactions that result in the release of additional chemical energy, releases photons. Depending on the probe used, the photons are typically in visible wavelength range and easily measurable with conventional optical detectors. The binding reaction of FCLA with human serum albumin (HSA) was studied with spectroscopy techniques. It was found that HSA fluorescence was partially quenched by FCLA. The binding constants were obtained with quenching results. According to the Forster energy transfer mechanism, the energy efficiency and the distance between FCLA and HSA were calculated.

The substituent, R = NH(2), OCH(3), N(phenyl)(2), t-butyl, CH(3), H, F, benzothiazole, CF(3), CN, and NO(2), was chosen for a systematic variation in electron-donating and -withdrawing properties as described by the Hammett parameter σ(p). UV/vis, fluorescence, and phosphorescence spectra, transient absorption spectra on the fs-ps time scale, and longer time scale flash photolysis on the ns time scale were collected. DFT and TDDFT calculations of the T(1) and S(1) energies were performed. The E(S) and E(T) values measured from linear spectra correlate well with the calculated results, giving evidence for the delocalized MLCT character of the S(1) state and confinement of the T(1) exciton on one ligand. The calculated T(1) state dipole moment ranges from 0.5 to 14 D, showing the polar, charge-transfer character of the T(1) state. The ultrafast absorption spectra have broad absorption bands from 575 to 675 nm and long wavelength contribution, which is shown from flash photolysis measurements to be from the T(1) state. The T(1) energy obtained from phosphorescence, the T(1)-T(n) transition energy obtained from flash photolysis measurements, and the triplet-state radiative rate constant are functions of the calculated spin density distribution on the ligand.

The relation between the intersystem crossing rate constant and the S(1)-T(1) energy gap shows a Marcus relationship with a reorganization energy of 0.83 eV.

Second, there is strong Lyman alpha emission from extended 'blobs' with little or no associated apparent ionizing continuum.

We show that the calculated Δμ correlate well with the values obtained from the 2PA spectroscopy. The Δμ values obtained from the solvatochromic shifts agree well with the above two methods for the chromophores with neutral or weak EW or ED substituents.

F(x) was a diffracted and redundant function; F(0)(x) is neither; it is euclidian like f(u), and the cycle of corpuscular optics is thus closed. We term information points the points of F(0)(x); the function we call a punctuated function. If phi is spread over its maximum field 2/lambda, the distance between the points is lambda/2, and in coherent as well as incoherent imagery they are at the limit of the resolving power for the wavelength used. It is therefore impossible to distinguish the photons in a linear diffracted distribution, but its spectrum, being euclidian directed and consequently dispersive, always isolates the photons in space and in time.

The vibrationally structured fluorescence property of the single-crystal organic microdisks brings dual-wavelength lasing at different vibronic bands. Their relative optical gain intensity was modulated by controlling the population on the certain vibronic level of the ground state with varied temperature, which consequently enabled the reversible switching of the dual-wavelength vibronic lasing.

Lyman-α photolysis of pure amorphous FA ice grown at 70 K and crystalline FA ice produced by annealing to 165 K gives spectral signatures between 2120 and 2195 cm(-1) that we assign primarily to OCN(-) and CO. The OCN(-) and CO yields are ∼25% less abundant for crystalline FA ice. Photon and electron processing also produces H2 that is released from the ice between ∼90 and 140 K. A decrease in the H2 TPD peak is seen for irradiated crystalline HCONH2 ice. Lyman-α photolysis of H2O:HCONH2 mixed ices increases OCN(-) and CO production, suggesting a catalytic role of H2O. Also, for pure FA, 1 keV electron irradiation slightly increases the yield of OCN(-), while CO decarboxylation is selectively prevented. CO is also not produced in H2O:HCONH2 ices upon electron irradiation. Dissociative ionization, direct dissociative excitation, and dissociative electron attachment (DEA) channels are accessible in the Lyman-α (121.6 nm) photon and 1 keV electron-beam energy range. DEA energetically favors OCN(-) and H(-) formation, with the latter leading to H2 formation. The FA fragment product identities, yields, and branching ratios are considerably different relative to the gas phase and depend upon the radiation type, ice structure, and the presence of SiO2 nanoparticles. The latter may increase ion-electron recombination and radical recombination rates. The main products observed suggest very different condensed-phase dissociation channels from those reported for gas-phase dissociation. Formation of ions/products from FA is not negligible upon Lyman-α photolysis or electron irradiation, both of which could process ices in interstellar regions as well as in Titan's atmosphere. ",

However, triplet excited-state lifetimes of Os(II) complexes are often too short (τ &lt; 1 μs) to transfer their energy to neighboring molecules. While the covalent conjugation of chromophores has been known to extend the net excited-state lifetimes through an intramolecular triplet energy transfer (IMET), heavy-atom effects of the central metals on the attached chromophore units have rarely been discussed. Here, we investigate the relationship between the spin-density contribution of the heavy metals and the net triplet excited-state lifetimes for a series of Os(II) and Ru(II) bis(terpyridine) complexes modified with perylene units. Phosphorescence lifetimes of these compounds strongly depend on the lifetimes of the perylenyl group-localized excited states that are shortened by the heavy-atom effect. The degree of heavy-atom effect can be largely circumvented by introducing <imeta</i-phenylene bridges, where the perylene unit retains its intrinsic long excited-state lifetime. The thermal activation to the short-lived excited states is suppressed, thanks to sufficient but still small energy losses during the IMET process. Involvement of the metal center was also confirmed by the prolonged lifetime by replacing Os(II) with Ru(II) that possesses a smaller spin-orbit coupling constant. These results indicate the importance of ligand structures that give a minimum heavy-atom effect as well as the sufficient energy gap among the excited states and fast IMET for elongating the triplet excited-state lifetime without sacrificing the excitation energy.",

Some questions, however, remain about the nature of the receiver triplet states, which have been in principle assigned to specific triplets of a different electronic configuration from T(1). In particular, it could be suggested that even a small degree of n-π* character of the T(1) state may be enough to allow the S(1) state to couple to upper vibronic states of the lowest energy triplet, without the requirement for specific upper triplet states. In this report, we show that there are, in fact, nitroaromatic compounds that do not show the ultrafast intersystem crossing channel but instead have S(1) states that are two to three orders of magnitude longer lived. Our studies focused on the time resolution of the emission from singly nitrated pyrenes, which show a strong photophysical dependence on the position of the NO(2) group: Whereas S(1) in 1-nitropyrene is short-lived (up to 3 ps), in 4-nitropyrene and 2-nitropyrene this state has 0.41 and 1.2 ns lifetimes, respectively, in acetonitrile solution. Computational work at the TD-DFT level of theory indicates that such remarkable increase in the first excited singlet lifetime can indeed be explained by a loss of the energy coincidence between the S(1) state with specific upper triplet states formed from transitions that involve the nonbonding orbitals at the oxygen atoms. These results are in strong support of the previous descriptions about the requirement for intermediacy of specific triplet states in the ultrafast decay of the fluorescent state present in most nitroaromatics.

Transient absorption at visible probe wavelengths was used to directly observe relaxation of the lowest excited singlet state (S(1) state) populated by a UV pump pulse. In H(2)O, transient absorption signals from adenine decay biexponentially with lifetimes of 0.18 +/- 0.03 ps and 8.8 +/- 1.2 ps. In contrast, signals from monomethylated adenines decay monoexponentially. The S(1) lifetimes of 1-, 3-, and 9-methyladenine are similar to one another and are all below 300 fs, while 7-methyladenine has a significantly longer lifetime (tau = 4.23 +/- 0.13 ps). On this basis, the biexponential signal of adenine is assigned to an equilibrium mixture of the 7H- and 9H-amino tautomers. Excited-state absorption (ESA) by 9-methyladenine is 50% stronger than by 7-methyladenine. Assuming that ESA by the corresponding tautomers of adenine is unchanged, we estimate the population of 7H-adenine in H(2)O at room temperature to be 22 +/- 4% (estimated standard deviation). To understand how the environment affects nonradiative decay, we performed the first solvent-dependent study of nucleobase dynamics on the ultrafast time scale. In acetonitrile, both lowest energy tautomers of adenine are present in roughly similar proportions as in water. The lifetimes of the 9-substituted adenines depend somewhat more sensitively on the solvent than those of the 7-substituted adenines. Transient signals for adenine in H(2)O and D(2)O are identical. These solvent effects strongly suggest that excited-state tautomerization is not an important nonradiative decay pathway. Instead, the data are most consistent with electronic energy relaxation due to state crossings between the optically prepared (1)pipi* state and one or more (1)npi* states and the electronic ground state. The pattern of lifetimes measured for the monomethylated adenines suggests a special role for the (1)npi* state associated with the N7 electron lone pair.",

The currently accepted model for this phenomenon is built on a foundation in which the electronic excitation energy of O2(a(1)Δg) is transferred to vibrational modes in a solvent molecule, with oxygen returning to its ground electronic state, O2(X(3)Σg(-)). This model of electronic-to-vibrational (e-to-v) energy transfer specifically focusses on the solvent as a \"sink\" for the excitation energy of O2(a(1)Δg). On the basis of temperature-dependent changes in the solvent-mediated O2(a(1)Δg) lifetime, we demonstrate that this energy-sink-based model has limitations and needs to be re-formulated. We now show that the effect of solvent on the O2(a(1)Δg) lifetime is more reasonably interpreted by considering an activation barrier that reflects the extent to which a solvent molecule perturbs the forbidden O2(a(1)Δg) → O2(X(3)Σg(-)) transition. For a given solvent molecule, this barrier reflects contributions from (a) the oxygen-solvent charge transfer state that mediates nonradiative coupling between the O2(a(1)Δg) and O2(X(3)Σg(-)) states, and (b) vibrations of specific bonds in the solvent molecule. The latter establishes connectivity to the desirable features of the energy-sink-based model. Moreover, temperature-dependent H/D solvent isotope effects imply that tunneling through this barrier plays a role in the mechanism for O2(a(1)Δg) deactivation, even at room temperature. Although we focus on a long-standing problem involving O2(a(1)Δg), our results and interpretation touch fundamental issues of interest to chemists at large. ",

Excitation of the CTTS state at wavelengths ranging from 272 to 238 nm leads to the formation of the I···(ROH)(n)(-) (R═H-, CH(3)-, and CH(3)CH(2)-) species, which can be thought of as a vibrationally excited bare solvent cluster anion perturbed by an iodine atom.

Autodetachment lifetimes were observed to decrease significantly with increasing excitation energy for a particular number and type of solvent molecules.

One example is the bonding of two such atoms by multipole forces to form Rydberg-Rydberg molecules with very large internuclear distances. Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom. In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii. Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40. We find that the spectra of the vibrational ground state and of the first excited state of the Rydberg molecule, the rubidium dimer Rb(5s)-Rb(ns), agree well with simple model predictions. The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, &lt;100 meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules.

To mimic the long-lived charge separations characteristic of the reaction center in photosynthesis, researchers have applied the Marcus theory to design synthetic multistep electron-transfer (ET) systems. In this Account, we describe our recent research on the rational design of ET control systems, based on models of the photosynthetic reaction center that rely on the Marcus theory of ET. The key to obtaining a long-lived charge separation is the careful choice of electron donors and acceptors that have small reorganization energies of ET. In these cases, the driving force of back ET is located in the Marcus inverted region, where the lifetime of the charge-separated state lengthens as the driving force of back ET increases. We chose porphyrins as electron donors and fullerenes as electron acceptors, both of which have small ET reorganization energies. By linking electron donor porphyrins and electron acceptor fullerenes at appropriate distances, we achieved charge-separated states with long lifetimes. We could further lengthen the lifetimes of charge-separated states by mixing a variety of components, such as a terminal electron donor, an electron mediator, and an electron acceptor, mimicking both the photosynthetic reaction center and the multistep photoinduced ET that occurs there. However, each step in multistep ET loses a fraction of the initial excitation energy during the long-distance charge separation. To overcome this drawback in multistep ET systems, we used designed new systems where we could finely control the redox potentials and the geometry of simple donor-acceptor dyads. These modifications resulted in a small ET reorganization energy and a high-lying triplet excited state. Our most successful example, 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium ion (Acr(+)-Mes), can undergo a fast photoinduced ET from the mesityl (Mes) moiety to the singlet excited state of the acridinium ion moiety (Acr(+)) with extremely slow back ET. The high-energy triplet charge-separated state is located deep in the Marcus inverted region, and we have detected the structural changes during the photoinduced ET in this system using X-ray crystallography. To increase the efficiency of both the light-harvesting and photoinduced ET, we assembled the Acr(+)-Mes dyads on gold nanoparticles to bring them in closer proximity to one another. We can also incorporate Acr(+)-Mes molecules within nanosized mesoporous silica-alumina. In contrast to the densely assembled dyads on gold nanoparticles, each Acr(+)-Mes molecule in silica-alumina is isolated in the mesopore, which inhibits the bimolecular back ET and leads to longer lifetimes in solution at room temperature than the natural photosynthetic reaction center. Acr(+)-Mes and related compounds act as excellent organic photocatalysts and facilitate a variety of reactions such as oxygenation, bromination, carbon-carbon bond formation, and hydrogen evolution reactions.",

An unclear relationship between chromophores and physical parameters relating to pRTP has prevented obtaining an RTP yield of over 50% and a lifetime over 1 s. Here highly efficient pRTP is reported under ambient conditions from heavy atom-free chromophores. A heavy atom-free aromatic core substituted with a long-conjugated amino group considerably accelerates the phosphorescence rate independent of the intramolecular vibration-based nonradiative rate from the lowest excited triplet state.

The visible-light-induced photodissociation on metal substrates has long been thought to never occur, either because visible-light energy is much smaller than the optical energy gap between the frontier electronic states of the molecule or because the molecular excited states have short lifetimes due to the strong hybridization between the adsorbate molecular orbitals (MOs) and metal substrate. The S-S bond in dimethyl disulfide adsorbed on both Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces was dissociated through direct electronic excitation from the HOMO-derived MO (the nonbonding lone-pair type orbitals on the S atoms (n<subS</sub)) to the LUMO-derived MO (the antibonding orbital localized on the S-S bond (σ*<subSS</sub)) by irradiation with visible light. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that visible-light-induced photodissociation becomes possible due to the interfacial electronic structures constructed by the hybridization between molecular orbitals and the metal substrate states. The molecule-metal hybridization decreases the gap between the HOMO- and LUMO-derived MOs into the visible-light energy region and forms LUMO-derived MOs that have less overlap with the metal substrate, which results in longer excited-state lifetimes.",

The photophysical parameters crucial in triplet state decay mechanism of aqueous indole-2-carboxylic acid (I2C) and indole-5-carboxylic acid (I5C) have been determined applying our previously proposed methodology based on the heavy atom effect and fluorescence and phosphorescence decay kinetics [Kowalska-Baron et al., 2012]. The determined time-resolved phosphorescence spectra of I2C and I5C are red-shifted as compared to that of the parent indole. This red-shift was especially evident in the case of I2C and may indicate the possibility of hydrogen bonded complex formation incorporating carbonyl CO, the NH group of I2C and, possibly, surrounding water molecules. The possibility of the excited state charge transfer process and the subsequent electronic charge redistribution in such a hydrogen bonded complex may also be postulated. The resulting stabilization of the I2C triplet state is manifested by its relatively long phosphorescence lifetime in aqueous solution (912 μs). The relatively short phosphorescence lifetime of I5C (56 μs) may be the consequence of more effective ground-state quenching of I5 C triplet state. This hypothesis may be strengthened by the significantly larger value of the determined rate constant of I5C triplet state quenching by its ground-state (4.4 × 10(8)M(-1)s(-1)) as compared to that for indole (6.8 × 10(7)M(-1)s(-1)) and I2C (2.3 × 10(7)M(-1)s(-1)). The determined bimolecular rate constant for triplet state quenching by iodide [Formula: see text] is equal to 1 × 10(4)M(-1)s(-1); 6 × 10(3)M(-1)s(-1) and 2.7 × 10(4)M(-1)s(-1) for indole, I2 C and I5 C, respectively. In order to obtain a better insight into iodide quenching of I2C and I5C triplet states in aqueous solution, the temperature dependence of the bimolecular rate constants for iodide quenching of the triplet states has been expressed in Arrhenius form. The linearity of the obtained Arrhenius plots clearly indicated the existence of one temperature-dependent non-radiative process for the de-excitation of I2C and I5C triplet state in the presence of iodide. This process may be attributed to the solute-quenching by iodide and, most probably, proceeds via reversibly formed exciplex. The activation energies obtained from linear Arrhenius plots (1.89 kcal/mol for I5 C; 2.55 kcal/mol for I2 C) are smaller as compared to that for diffusion controlled reactions in aqueous solution (about 4 kcal/mol), which may indicate the great importance of the electrostatic interactions between solute and iodide ions in lowering the energy barrier needed for the formation of the triplet-quencher complex. Based on the theoretical predictions (at the DFT(CAM-B3LYP)/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory) and careful analysis of the obtained FTIR spectra it may be concluded that in the solid state I2 C and I5 C molecules form associates by intermolecular NH · · · OC and OH · · · OC hydrogen bonding interactions, whereas the existence of intramolecular NH · · · OC interactions in the solid state of I2C and I5C is highly unlikely.",

Previous work has shown that MTHF is the primary photoreceptor which transfers energy to the FADH2 cofactor; the FADH2 singlet excited state then repairs the photodimer by electron transfer. In this study, we have determined the rate constants for these photophysical processes by time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. From time-resolved fluorescence, we find that energy transfer from MTHF to FADH2 and FADH degrees occurs at rates of 4.6 x 10(9) and 3.0 x 10(10) s-1, respectively, and electron transfer from FADH2 to a pyrimidine dimer occurs at a rate of 5.5 x 10(9) s-1. Using Förster theory for long-range energy transfer and assuming K2 = 2/3, the interchromophore distances were estimated to be 22 A in the case of the MTHF-FADH2 pair and 21 A for the MTHF-FADH degrees pair. Picosecond absorption spectroscopy identified an MTHF single state which decays to yield the first excited singlet state of FADH2. The lifetimes of MTHF and FADH2 singlets and the rates of interchromophore energy transfer, as well as the rate of electron transfer from FADH2 to DNA measured by time-resolved fluorescence, were in excellent agreement with the values obtained by picosecond laser flash photolysis. Similarly, fluorescence or absorption lifetime studies of the folate-depleted enzyme with and without photodimer suggest that FADH2, in its singlet excited state, transfers an electron to the dimer with 89% efficiency. The distance between FADH2 and the photodimer was calculated to be ca. 14 A.",

As far as we know, this is the first theoretical study about rotational relaxation inside HeNDs, and here several (real and hypothetical) isotopes of H2 have been examined, in order to analyze the influence of the rotational constant Be of these fast rotors on the dynamics. The structure of the nanodroplet practically does not change during the RER process, which approximately takes place according to a cascade mechanism j → j - 2; j - 2 → j - 4; …; 2 → 0, and mj is conserved. The results are consistent with the very scarce estimated experimental data available. The lifetime of an excited rotational state (≈1.0-7.6 ns) increases when: (a) Be increases; (b) j increases; and (c) N decreases (above N = 100 there is a small influence of N on the lifetime). This also applies to the global relaxation time and transition time. The analysis of the influence of the coupling between the j and j - 2 rotational states (due to the X2-helium interaction) and the X2 angular velocity on the lifetime and related properties has been helpful to better understand the dynamics. In contrast to the RER results, for the vibrational energy relaxation (VER) in HeNDs, when the quantum number v increases a decrease is observed in the lifetime of the excited vibrational state. This difference can be interpreted taking into account that RER and VER are associated with very different types of motion. Besides, in VER the intermediate excited states show metastability, differing from the RER case. We hope that the present study will encourage more studies to be developed on the RER dynamics in HeNDs, a basic, interesting and difficult to study physical phenomenon about which we still know very little.",

Visible light excitation resulted in photoluminescence with a corrected maximum at 620 nm, a quantum yield phi = 0.14, and an excited state lifetime tau = 1.75 micros from which k(r) = 8.36 x 10(4) s(-1) and k(nr) = 5.01 x 10(5) s(-1) were abstracted. Arrhenius analysis of the temperature dependent excited state lifetime revealed an activation energy of approximately 2500 cm(-1) and a pre-exponential factor of 10(10) s(-1), assigned to activated surface crossing to a ligand field or MLCT excited state. Steady state light excitation of Ru(bpz)(2)(deeb)(2+) in a 20 mM TBAI acetonitrile solution resulted in ligand loss photochemistry with a quantum yield of 5 x 10(-5). The MLCT excited state was dynamically quenched by iodide with K(sv) = 1.1 x 10(5) M(-1) and k(q) = 6.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(10) M(-1) s(-1), a value consistent with diffusion-limited electron transfer. Excited state hole transfer to iodide was quantitative but the product yield was low due to poor cage escape yields, phi(CE) = 0.042 +/- 0.001. Nanosecond transient absorption was used to quantify the appearance of two photoproducts [Ru(bpz(-))(bpz)(deeb)](+) and I(2)(-*). The coincidence of the rate constants for [Ru(bpz(-))(bpz)(deeb)](+) formation and for excited state decay indicated reductive quenching by iodide. The rate constant for the appearance of I(2)(-*) was about a factor of 3 slower than excited state decay, k = 2.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(10) M(-1) s(-1), indicating that I(2)(-*) was not a primary photoproduct of excited state electron transfer. A mechanism was proposed where an iodine atom was the primary photoproduct that subsequently reacted with iodide, I(*) + I(-) --&gt; I(2)(-*). Charge recombination Ru(bpz(-))(bpz)(deeb)(+) + I(2)(-*) --&gt; Ru(bpz)(2)(deeb)(2+) + 2I(-) was highly favored, DeltaG(o) = -1.64 eV, and well described by a second-order equal concentration kinetic model, k(cr) = 2.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(10) M(-1) s(-1).",

Standard quantum chemistry methods cannot handle infinite number of orbitals coming from the band structure of the semiconductor, whereas solid state calculations cannot handle many excited states at a reasonable computational cost. In this regard, we propose a new method to evaluate lifetimes of many excited states of a molecule on a semi-infinite surface. On the basis of the theory of resonance state, the effect of the semi-infinite semiconductor is encoded into the complex self-energy from surface Green's function. The lifetimes of excited states are evaluated through the imaginary part of the self-energy, and the self-energy correction is included into excitation energies obtained from time-dependent density functional theory calculations. This new method is applied to a DSSC system composed of black dye attached to the TiO2 semiconductor, and the computed lifetimes are linked to the natures of excited states and to the surface properties.

In addition, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy measurements allowed detection of the triplet excited state of coumarin 314 (C(314)) with a maximum absorption at 550 nm in benzene. The triplet excited state has a lifetime of 90 μs in benzene. It is readily quenched by oxygen (k(q) = 5.0 × 10(9) M(-1) s(-1)). From triplet-triplet energy transfer quenching experiments, it is shown that the energy of this triplet excited state is higher than 35 kcal/mol, in accord with the relatively large singlet oxygen quantum yield (Φ(Δ) = 0.25). However, in aqueous media, the coumarin triplet was no longer observed, and instead of that, a long-lived (160 μs in air-equilibrated solutions) free radical cation with a maximum absorbance at 370 nm was detected. The free radical cation generation, which has a quantum yield of 0.2, occurs by electron photoejection. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that at least 40% of the electronic density is placed on the nitrogen atom in aqueous media, which explains its lack of reactivity toward oxygen.

They are known as polaritons and correspond to coherent superpositions of excitations of the molecules and of the cavity photon. The polariton energies and thus potential energy surfaces are changed with respect to the bare molecules, such that polariton formation is considered a promising paradigm for controlling photochemical reactions. To effectively manipulate photochemistry with confined light, the molecules need to remain in the polaritonic state long enough for the reaction on the modified potential energy surface to take place. To understand what determines this lifetime, we have performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of room-temperature ensembles of rhodamine chromophores strongly coupled to a single confined light mode with a 15 fs lifetime. We investigated three popular experimental scenarios and followed the relaxation after optically pumping (i) the lower polariton, (ii) the upper polariton, or (iii) uncoupled molecular states. The results of the simulations suggest that the lifetimes of the optically accessible lower and upper polaritons are limited by (i) ultrafast photoemission due to the low cavity lifetime and (ii) reversible population transfer into the \"dark\" state manifold. Dark states are superpositions of molecular excitations but with much smaller contributions from the cavity photon, decreasing their emission rates and hence increasing their lifetimes. We find that population transfer between polaritonic modes and dark states is determined by the overlap between the polaritonic and molecular absorption spectra. Importantly, excitation can also be transferred \"upward\" from the lower polariton into the dark-state reservoir due to the broad absorption spectra of the chromophores, contrary to the common conception of these processes as a \"one-way\" relaxation from the dark states down to the lower polariton. Our results thus suggest that polaritonic chemistry relying on modified dynamics taking place within the lower polariton manifold requires cavities with sufficiently long lifetimes and, at the same time, strong light-matter coupling strengths to prevent the back-transfer of excitation into the dark states.",

Activation of nonphotochemical quenching has been linked to the conversion of a carotenoid with a conjugation length of nine double bonds (violaxanthin) into an 11-double-bond carotenoid (zeaxanthin). It has been suggested that the increase in the conjugation length turns the carotenoid from a nonquencher into a quencher of chlorophyll singlet excited states, but unequivocal evidence is lacking. Here, we present a transient absorption spectroscopic study on a model system made up of a zinc phthalocyanine (Pc) molecule covalently linked to carotenoids with 9, 10, or 11 conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds. We show that a carotenoid can act as an acceptor of Pc excitation energy, thereby shortening its singlet excited-state lifetime. The conjugation length of the carotenoid is critical to the quenching process. Remarkably, the addition of only one double bond can turn the carotenoid from a nonquencher into a very strong quencher. By studying the solvent polarity dependence of the quenching using target analysis of the time-resolved data, we show that the quenching proceeds through energy transfer from the excited Pc to the optically forbidden S(1) state of the carotenoid, coupled to an intramolecular charge-transfer state. The mechanism for excess energy dissipation in photosystem II is discussed in view of the insights obtained on this simple model system.",

Neutron production varies depending on photon beam energy as well as on the manufacturer of the accelerator. Neutron production from modern linear accelerators (linacs) has not been extensively compared, particularly in terms of the differences in the strategies that various manufacturers have used to implement multileaf collimators (MLCs) into their linac designs. However, such information is necessary to determine neutron dose equivalents for different linacs and to calculate vault shielding requirements. The purpose of the current study, therefore, was to measure the neutron spectra from the most up-to-date linacs from three manufacturers: Varian 21EX operating at 15, 18, and 20 MV, Siemens ONCOR operating at 15 and 18 MV, and Elekta Precise operating at 15 and 18 MV. Neutron production was measured by means of gold foil activation in Bonner spheres. Based on the measurements, the authors determined neutron spectra and calculated the average energy, total neutron fluence, ambient dose equivalent, and neutron source strength. The shapes of the neutron spectra did not change significantly between accelerators or even as a function of treatment energy. However, the neutron fluence, and therefore the ambient dose equivalent, did vary, increasing with increasing treatment energy. For a given nominal treatment energy, these values were always highest for the Varian linac. The current study thus offers medical physicists extensive information about the neutron production of MLC-equipped linacs currently in operation and provides them information vital for accurate comparison and prediction of neutron dose equivalents and calculation of vault shielding requirements.",

An epithermal neutron spectrum generator was simulated with 30 MeV proton energy for BNCT purposes.

Yet NRS has seldom been used in dynamic experiments. There is a compelling incentive to do so because of the significant shortcomings of alternative techniques. An important barrier to adopting dynamic NRS thermometry is the difficulty in fielding it with conventional spallation neutron sources. To enable time-dependent and spatially resolved temperature measurements in dynamic environments, more compact neutron sources that can be used at user facilities in conjunction with other diagnostic probes (such as x-ray light sources) are required. Such sources may be available using ultrafast high-intensity optical lasers. We evaluate such possibilities by determining the sensitivities of the temperature estimate on neutron-beam and diagnostic parameters. Based on that evaluation, requirements are set on a pulsed neutron-source and diagnostics to make a meaningful dynamic temperature measurement. Dynamic thermometry measurements are examined in this context when driven by two alternative fast-neutron sources: the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) proton accelerator driving isotropic spallation neutrons as a baseline and a laser-plasma ion accelerator driving a neutron beam from deuterium breakup. Strategies to close the gap between the required and demonstrated performance of laser-based fast-neutron sources are presented. A short-pulse high-intensity laser with state-of-the-art pulse contrast and an energy of a few hundred Joules would drive a compact neutron source suitable for NRS thermometry that could transform the dynamic study of materials.",

Traditionally, investment casting has been used to produce structural titanium castings for aero-engine applications with wall thickness less than 1 in (2.54 cm). Recently, airframe manufacturers have been exploring the use of titanium investment casting to replace components traditionally produced from forgings. Use of titanium investment castings for these applications reduces weight, cost, lead time, and part count. Recently, the investment casting process has been selected to produce fracture critical structural titanium airframe components. These airframe components have pushed the traditional inspection techniques to their physical limits due to cross sections on the order of 3 in (7.6 cm). To overcome these inspection limitations, a process incorporating neutron radiography (n-ray) has been developed. In this process, the facecoat of the investment casting mold material contains a cocalcined mixture of yttrium oxide and gadolinium oxide. The presence of the gadolinium oxide, allows for neutron radiographic imaging (and eventual removal and repair) of mold facecoat inclusions that remain within these thick cross sectional castings. Probability of detection (POD) studies have shown a 3 x improvement of detecting a 0.050 x 0.007 in2 (1.270 x 0.178 mm2) inclusion of this cocalcined material using n-ray techniques when compared to the POD using traditional X-ray techniques. Further, it has been shown that this n-ray compatible mold facecoat material produces titanium castings of equal metallurgical quality when compared to the traditional materials. Since investment castings can be very large and heavy, the neutron radiography facilities at the University of California, Davis McClellan Nuclear Radiation Center (UCD/MNRC) were used to develop the inspection techniques. The UCD/MNRC has very unique facilities that can handle large parts up to 39 ft (12 m) in length and 13 ft (4 m) high weighing up to 5000 lbs (2300 kg). These handling systems are robotically driven. The neutron radiographic system consists of a highly thermalized neutron beam. The neutron beam has an intensity of 5.6 x 10(6) n/cm2 s, with a L/D = 200 at a power of 2 MW. A divergent beam collimator is used which provides a beam of approximately 22 in (56 cm) in diameter at the film plane.

The meeting was attended by 70 experimentalists, theorists and computer simulators from Europe, Japan and North America and comprised 34 oral presentations together with two lively poster sessions. Three major themes were discussed, namely (i) the glass transition and properties of liquids and glasses under extreme conditions; (ii) the complementarity of neutron and x-ray scattering techniques with other experimental methods; and (iii) the modelling of liquid and glass structure. These themes served to highlight (a) recent advances in neutron and x-ray instrumentation used to investigate liquid and glassy materials under extreme conditions; (b) the relationship between the results obtained from different experimental and theoretical/computational methods; and (c) the modern methods used to interpret experimental results. The presentations ranged from polyamorphism in liquids and glasses to protein folding in aqueous solution and included the dynamics of fresh and freeze-dried strawberries and red onions. The properties of liquid phosphorus were also memorably demonstrated! The formal highlight was the 'Spencerfest' dinner where Neil Cowlam (Sheffield, UK) gave an excellent after dinner speech. The organisation of the workshop benefited tremendously from the secretarial skills of Carole Denning (ISIS, UK).

Spencer Howells is in the centre of the front row. DEDICATION William Spencer Howells It is a great pleasure to dedicate this Special Issue on Current Challenges in Liquid and Glass Science to the many contributions Spencer Howells has made to the structure and dynamics of liquids and glasses over some 40 years of work with the neutron scattering technique. After completing a first degree in Physics at Cambridge in 1966, Spencer started a postgraduate program with Gordon Squires at Cambridge, exploiting the early neutron scattering instrumentation that was available in those days at the Harwell reactors. This resulted in a Ph D thesis in 1970 on the twin topics of 'Neutron scattering of phonons in single-crystal molybdenum, using a time-of-flight chopper spectrometer (Part I)' and 'Neutron studies of the metal-insulator transition (Part II)'. The thesis was split into two parts because the hydrogen moderator blew-up on the chopper instrument used for the first part! From Cambridge, he moved to Leicester University as a post-doctoral Fellow with John Enderby, who was setting up a programme of study on the liquid state of matter. Here Spencer continued to use the Harwell Dido reactor, now to measure the structure of liquid metal alloys and molten salts - a topic that has kept his interest right through into retirement. He also initiated the first structural studies of aqueous solutions using neutron scattering, eventually pursuing this work as one of the first UK users of the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France (ILL). In 1973 Spencer moved to the ILL, which was then and has remained the world's leading steady-state neutron source, as instrument scientist on IN10, the quasi-elastic neutron scattering beam line. Here he led the field in developing the quasi-elastic technique and new quasi-elastic scattering experiments were begun on the dynamics of aqueous solutions. At the same time he was local contact for most of the UK users of the liquids diffractometer D4, often providing excellent hospitality to hungry and thirsty Ph D students, in addition to his scientific support! After the ILL he moved, in 1978, to the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), later called ISIS, where he was responsible for building the Liquids and Amorphous Diffractometer, LAD. This was a tricky undertaking as there were no neutrons at the SNS until 1984, so initial testing of LAD was done on the Harwell Linac. He also worked on the design and specification of the SNS moderators and collimation, and his design for the neutron collimator is still in use at ISIS today. The initial design and build of the Small Angle Neutron Diffractometer for Amorphous and Liquid Samples (SANDALS) was undertaken in this period, and Spencer had a major impact on the development of the ATLAS software used to analyse diffraction data from disordered materials. He was also involved in the design of IRIS, the first quasi-elastic spectrometer at ISIS. As more people joined in liquids and amorphous materials research at ISIS, Spencer was able to diversify, and he took an increasing interest in the application of IRIS to liquid materials. Here he brought his expertise in data analysis from the ILL and LAD and applied it to the time-of-flight quasi-elastic technique. The suite of data analysis programs that evolved, called IDA, was enlarged to encompass quasi-elastic neutron scattering data taken on a number of ISIS and non-ISIS instruments, including OSIRIS, HET, and MARI (at ISIS), IN5, IN6, IN10, IN13 and IN16 (at ILL) and NEAT (at HMI, Berlin). At the same time, Spencer's penchant for working on computers meant he took an increasingly important role in setting up and running the ISIS user database and proposal system, which continued for many years until his retirement in 2004. He also became full-time instrument scientist on IRIS and even after retirement he continues to work on developing data analysis software for this instrument. In the course of his career Spencer Howells has so far produced more than 200 scientific publications, covering a broad spectrum of topics. Recent examples include 'Dynamics of fresh and freeze-dried strawberry and red onion: quasielastic neutron scattering.' and 'The structure and dynamics of 2-dimensional fluids in swelling clays', to illustrate some of the range of his science. This work has gone hand in hand with comprehensive support for users at the ILL, ISIS and elsewhere, and he has been a consultant at foreign institutions such as the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois. Arriving as he did at a time when large-scale central user facilities were first becoming established, Spencer has played a significant role in shaping the way these facilities operate and produce science. The Current Challenges Workshop was a fitting tribute to his work in disordered materials science and demonstrates how vibrant the field has become as a result.",

The multileaf collimator consists of two sets of 22 leaves each, which can be moved independently. They are made of iron and their thickness is 95 cm. Seven borated polyethylene disks are located in the distal part of the leaves in order to absorb more efficiently the low-energy component of the neutron spectrum. The width of the leaves is 1 cm at their distal part. The leaves can move 11 cm outwards and 6 cm inwards from their reference position, and field sizes up to 25.7 x 24.8 cm, as well as irregular field shapes, can be obtained. The inner part of the leaves and their two sides are always focused on the target. The complete multileaf collimator can rotate around the beam axis, from -90 degrees to +90 degrees from the reference position. The width of the penumbra (80-20% isodoses) is 0.64 cm and 1.17 cm at the depth of the maximum buildup and at 10 cm in depth respectively, for a 10 x 10 cm field size. The collimator is adequate for the energy of the p(65)+Be neutron beam of Louvain-la-Neuve and has been adapted to the fixed vertical beam. It has been designed following the original plans of Scanditronix, adjusted and fully assembled at the workshop of the Centre de Recherches du Cyclotron (CRC). Systematic measurements were performed in order to optimize the design and the composition of the leaves. In particular the attenuations of the actual beam and of monoenergetic neutron beams were measured in different materials such as iron and polyethylene.

A major advantage of an ABNS for BNCT over reactor-based neutron sources is the potential for siting within a hospital. Consequently, light-ion accelerators that are injectors to larger machines in high-energy physics facilities are not considered. An ABNS for BNCT is composed of: (1) the accelerator hardware for producing a high current charged particle beam, (2) an appropriate neutron-producing target and target heat removal system (HRS), and (3) a moderator/reflector assembly to render the flux energy spectrum of neutrons produced in the target suitable for patient irradiation. As a consequence of the efforts of researchers throughout the world, progress has been made on the design, manufacture, and testing of these three major components. Although an ABNS facility has not yet been built that has optimally assembled these three components, the feasibility of clinically useful ABNSs has been clearly established. Both electrostatic and radio frequency linear accelerators of reasonable cost (approximately 1.5 M dollars) appear to be capable of producing charged particle beams, with combinations of accelerated particle energy (a few MeV) and beam currents (approximately 10 mA) that are suitable for a hospital-based ABNS for BNCT. The specific accelerator performance requirements depend upon the charged particle reaction by which neutrons are produced in the target and the clinical requirements for neutron field quality and intensity. The accelerator performance requirements are more demanding for beryllium than for lithium as a target. However, beryllium targets are more easily cooled. The accelerator performance requirements are also more demanding for greater neutron field quality and intensity. Target HRSs that are based on submerged-jet impingement and the use of microchannels have emerged as viable target cooling options. Neutron fields for reactor-based neutron sources provide an obvious basis of comparison for ABNS field quality. This paper compares Monte Carlo calculations of neutron field quality for an ABNS and an idealized standard reactor neutron field (ISRNF). The comparison shows that with lithium as a target, an ABNS can create a neutron field with a field quality that is significantly better (by a factor of approximately 1.2, as judged by the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-dose that can be delivered to a tumor at a depth of 6cm) than that for the ISRNF. Also, for a beam current of 10 mA, the treatment time is calculated to be reasonable (approximately 30 min) for the boron concentrations that have been assumed.",

Most of these in vivo measurements have been conducted at a proton beam energy (E(p)) of 2.00 MeV to optimise the activation of the selected element of interest with an effective dose of the same order as that received in chest X rays. However, measurement of other elements at the same facility requires beam energies other than 2.00 MeV. The range of energy of neutrons produced at these proton beam energies comes under the region where tissue-equivalent proportional counters (TEPCs) are known to experience difficulty in assessing the quality factor and dose equivalent. In this study, the response of TEPCs was investigated to determine the quality factor of neutron fields generated via the (7)Li(p, n)(7)Be reaction as a function of E(p) in the range 1.884-2.56 MeV at the position of hand irradiation in the facility. An interesting trend has been observed in the quality factor based on ICRP 60, Q(ICRP60), such that the maximum value was observed at E(p)=1.884 MeV (E(n)=33±16 keV) and then continued to decline with increasing E(p) until achieving a minimum value at E(p)=2.0 MeV despite a continuous increase in the mean neutron energy with E(p). This observation is contrary to what has been observed with direct fast neutrons where the quality factor was found to increase continuously with an increase in E(p) (i.e. increasing E(n)). The series of measurements conducted with thermal and fast neutron fields demonstrate that the (14)N(n, p)(14)C produced 580 keV protons in the detector play an important role in the response of the counter under 2.0 MeV proton energy (E(n) ≤ 250 keV). In contrast to the lower response of TEPCs to low-energy neutrons, the quality factor is overestimated in the range 1-2 depending on beam energy &lt;2.0 MeV.

The advantages and drawbacks of several neutron beams are here analysed in terms of therapeutic gains. In detail the GEANT-3/MICAP simulations show that high tumor control probability, with sub-lethal dose at healthy tissues, can be achieved by using neutron beams of few keV energy having a flux of about 10(9) neutrons/(cm(2)s).

The temperature dependence of the Co1 and Co2 magnetic moments obtained from neutron diffraction experiments was fitted in a modified molecular-field model. The polarized neutron study of the magnetization induced by an applied field shows a non-negligible amount of magnetic moment on the oxygen positions, indicating a delocalization of the magnetic moment from Co towards neighbouring O owing to superexchange coupling. The relative strength of the exchange interactions is discussed based on the non-polarized and polarized neutron data.",

Of special interest are D-T neutron generators, which theoretically have shown the potential to be utilized as neutron sources for BNCT of deep-seated tumors. This work is devoted to investigate the feasibility of using the high-energy neutrons emitted from these generators for treatment of surface tumors, especially skin. Using a set of MCNPX simulations, the D-T neutrons are passed through an optimized arrangement of materials to slow-down toward the desired energy range, and to remove the neutron and gamma contamination considering the IAEA recommended criteria, especially determined for pre-clinical survey for treatment of surface tumors. By assessment with these parameters, it is shown that the designed beam, corresponding to a configuration composed of natural uranium as neutron multiplier, D<sub2</subO as moderator, Pb as reflector, Bi as gamma filter, and polyethylene and BeO as collimators provides high-intensity of desired neutrons, and low-background doses as well. It was found that an appropriate material for collimator, if accompanied with an optimized geometry, is an important parameter for keeping the undesired components to the recommended level. A typical simulated phantom, subjected to the irradiation of the designed spectrum, is used to study the performance of the resultant beam in shallow tissue. For an arbitrary chosen <sup10</supB concentration, the evaluated depth-dose curves show that the proposed configuration establishes acceptable agreement between the appropriate neutron intensity and penetration to desired depth in tissue in a reasonable treatment time of about 25-38min. Considering the simulations carried out, the total dose delivered to the tumor is expected to be of about 4.2 times higher than that delivered to the first depths in healthy tissue, and of about 2.4 times higher than that delivered to the normal skin. These results in essence endorse the ability of D-T neutron generators to be used for BNCT of surface tumors, even with the yield of ∼10<sup12</supn/s.",

The technique is applied to Boron Neutron Capture Therapy where most often mixed beams of neutrons and gammas are involved. In normal forward Monte Carlo simulations the particles start at a source and lose energy as they travel towards the region of interest, i.e., the designated point of detection. Conversely, with adjoint Monte Carlo simulations, the so-called adjoint particles start at the region of interest and gain energy as they travel towards the source where they are detected. In this respect, the particles travel backwards and the real source and real detector become the adjoint detector and adjoint source, respectively. At the adjoint detector, an adjoint function is obtained with which numerically the same result, e.g., dose or flux in the tumor, can be derived as with forward Monte Carlo. In many cases, the adjoint method is more efficient and by that is much quicker when, for example, the response in the tumor or organ at risk for many locations and orientations of the treatment beam around the patient is required. However, a problem occurs when the treatment beam is mono-directional as the probability of detecting adjoint Monte Carlo particles traversing the beam exit (detector plane in adjoint mode) in the negative direction of the incident beam is zero. This problem is addressed here and solved first with the use of next event estimators and second with the application of a Legendre expansion technique of the angular adjoint function. In the first approach, adjoint particles are tracked deterministically through a tube to a (adjoint) point detector far away from the geometric model. The adjoint particles will traverse the disk shaped entrance of this tube (the beam exit in the actual geometry) perpendicularly. This method is slow whenever many events are involved that are not contributing to the point detector, e.g., neutrons in a scattering medium. In the second approach, adjoint particles that traverse an adjoint shaped detector plane are used to estimate the Legendre coefficients for expansion of the angular adjoint function. This provides an estimate of the adjoint function for the direction normal to the detector plane. In a realistic head model, as described in this paper, which is surrounded by 1020 mono-directional neutron/gamma beams and from which the best ones are to be selected, the example calculates the neutron and gamma fluxes in ten tumors and ten organs at risk. For small diameter beams (5 cm), and with comparable relative errors, forward Monte Carlo is seen to be 1.5 times faster than the adjoint Monte Carlo techniques. For larger diameter neutron beams (10 and 15 cm), the Legendre technique is found to be 6 and 20 times faster, respectively. In the case of gammas alone, for the 10 and 15 cm diam beams, both adjoint Monte Carlo Legendre and point detector techniques are respectively 2 and 3 times faster than forward Monte Carlo.",

Deuterium-deuterium (DD) compact neutron generators have advantages over nuclear reactors and large accelerators as the BNCT neutron source, such as their compact size, low cost, and relatively easy installation. The purpose of this study is to design a beam shaping assembly (BSA) for a DD neutron generator and assess the potential of a DD-based BNCT system using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The MC model consisted of a head phantom, a DD neutron source, and a BSA. The head phantom had tally cylinders along the centerline for computing neutron and photon fluences and calculating the dose as a function of depth. The head phantom was placed at 4 cm from the BSA. The neutron source was modeled to resemble the source of our current DD neutron generator. A BSA was designed to moderate and shape the 2.45-MeV DD neutrons to the epithermal (0.5 eV to 10 keV) range. The BSA had multiple components, including moderator, reflector, collimator, and filter. Various materials and configurations were tested for each component. Each BSA layout was assessed in terms of the in-air and in-phantom parameters. The maximum brain dose was limited to 12.5 Gray-Equivalent (Gy-Eq) and the skin dose to 18 Gy-Eq.

Neutron yield data versus incident energy are necessary in order to select the proper incident energy and for estimating how high the incident proton current should be. The required proton beam current intensity is one of the key parameters for an accelerator useful for BNCT. In the present work, neutron yields of the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction with a thick lithium target and incident energies of 1.885 and 1.9 MeV were measured at 0 degree with respect to the incident beam direction.

Though nuclear reactors were used for a long time as the only neutron source available having the requested flux levels, the accelerator-based ones have recently been investigated on the other hand due to its easy-to-use and acceptable performances. However, when using an accelerator, various secondary particles would be emitted which forms a troublesome background. Moreover, the neutrons produced have usually an energy spectrum somewhat different from the requested one and thus should be largely moderated. An additional issue to be taken into account is the patient positioning, which should be close to the neutron source, in order to take advantage of a neutron flux level high enough to limit the BNCT treatment time within 1h. This implies that, inside a relatively narrow space, neutrons should be moderated, while unnecessary secondary particles should be shielded. Considering that a background-free neutron field from an accelerator-driven neutron source dedicated to BNCT application is generally difficult to be provided, the characterization of such a neutron field will have to be clearly assessed. In the present study, a low energy neutron spectrometer has been thus designed and is now being developed to measure the accelerator-based neutron source performance.

In addition, the work focused on acknowledging the performance of different commercial active dosimetry systems when measuring neutron ambient dose equivalents, H(∗)(10), at several positions inside (8 positions) and outside (3 positions) the treatment room.

Meanwhile, the photon component of stray radiation was deduced from the low-lineal energy transfer part of TEPC spectra or measured using a Thermo Scientific™ FH-40G survey meter.

The study also revealed the large dependence of the energy distribution of neutrons, and consequently of out-of-field doses, on the primary beam direction (directional emission of intranuclear cascade neutrons) and energy (spectral composition of secondary neutrons). In addition, neutron mapping within the facility was conducted and showed the highest H(∗)(10) value of ∼ 51 μSv Gy(-1); this was measured at 1.15 m along the beam axis. H(∗)(10) values significantly decreased with distance and angular position with respect to beam axis falling below 2 nSv Gy(-1) at the entrance of the maze, at the door outside the room and below detection limit in the gantry control room, and at an adjacent room (&lt;0.1 nSv Gy(-1)). Finally, the agreement on H(∗)(10) values between all detectors showed a direct dependence on neutron spectra at the measurement position. While conventional rem-counters (LB 6411, RadEye™ NL, NM2-458) underestimated the H(∗)(10) by up to a factor of 4, Hawk TEPCs and the WENDI-II range-extended detector were found to have good performance (within 20%) even at the highest neutron fluence and energy range. Meanwhile, secondary photon dose equivalents were found to be up to five times lower than neutrons; remaining nonetheless of concern to the patient.

With increasing depth in water, yD was found to decrease from 47.3 keV micron-1 at 5 cm to 35.6 keV micron-1 at 15 cm depth, and the gamma fraction was found to increase from 0.23 to 0.40. Although there is no generally accepted and agreed method of relating microdosimetric information to biological effectiveness, the dual radiation theory in its original form (Kellerer and Rossi 1972) has been shown to be a very useful model for the assessment of the biological effectiveness of fast neutrons (Kellerer et al 1976). The microdosimetric parameter which is used in the dual radiation model is the dose mean specific energy corrected for saturation zeta* which, for a 2 micron simulated diameter, is related to the dose mean lineal energy corrected for saturation y* by zeta* = y* keV micron-1 X 0.51 X 10(-2) Gy. Values of y* determined for each of the collimator arrangements used at the Gray Laboratory show a spread of some 6% (table 1) and, as the dose fraction between lineal energies 5 and 150 keV micron-1 (the recoil proton component) do not alter by more than 3%, radiobiological experiments performed with different collimator arrangements would show no observable differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The neutron spectrum of this IND-like neutron irradiator was designed according to estimations of the Hiroshima neutron spectrum at 1.5 km. It is significantly different from a standard reactor fission spectrum, because the spectrum changes as the neutrons are transported through air, and it is dominated by neutron energies from 100 keV up to 9 MeV. To verify such wide energy range neutron spectrum, detailed here is the development of a combined spectroscopy system. Both a liquid scintillator detector and a gas proportional counter were used for the recoil spectra measurements, with the individual response functions estimated from a series of Monte Carlo simulations. These normalized individual response functions were formed into a single response matrix for the unfolding process. Several accelerator-based quasi-monoenergetic neutron source spectra were measured and unfolded to test this spectroscopy system. These reference neutrons were produced from two reactions: T(p,n)<sup3</supHe and D(d,n)<sup3</supHe, generating neutron energies in the range between 0.2 and 8 MeV. The unfolded quasi-monoenergetic neutron spectra indicated that the detection system can provide good neutron spectroscopy results in this energy range. A broad-energy neutron spectrum from the <sup9</supBe(d,n) reaction using a 5 MeV deuteron beam, measured at 60 degrees to the incident beam was measured and unfolded with the evaluated response matrix. The unfolded broad neutron spectrum is comparable with published time-of-flight results. Finally, the pair of detectors were used to measure the neutron spectrum generated at the RARAF IND-like neutron facility and a comparison is made to the neutron spectrum of Hiroshima.",

This discrepancy casts doubts on the DS86 neutron source term and, consequently, the survivors' estimated neutron doses. However, the doses were caused mainly by fast neutrons. To determine retrospectively fast neutron fluences in Hiroshima, the reaction 63Cu(n, p)63Ni can be used, if adequate copper samples can be found. Measuring 63Ni (half life 100 y) in Hiroshima samples requires a very sensitive technique, such as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), because of the relatively small amounts of 63Ni expected (approximately 10(5)-10(6) atoms per gram of copper). Experiments performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have demonstrated in 1996 that AMS can be used to measure 63Ni in Hiroshima copper samples. Subsequently, a collaboration was established with the Technical University of Munich in view of its potential to perform more sensitive measurements of 63Ni than the Livermore facility and in the interest of interlaboratory validation. This paper presents the progress made at the Munich facility in the measurement of 63Ni by AMS. The Munich accelerator mass spectrometry facility is a combination of a high energy tandem accelerator and a detection system featuring a gas-filled magnet. It is designed for high sensitivity measurements of long-lived radioisotopes. Optimization of the ion source setup has further improved the sensitivity for 63Ni by reducing the background level of the 63Cu isobar interference by about two orders of magnitude. Current background levels correspond to a ratio of 63Ni/Ni&lt;2x10(-14) and suggest that, with adequate copper samples, the assessment of fast neutron fluences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is possible for ground distances of up to 1500 m, and--under favorable conditions--even beyond. To demonstrate this capability, we have measured successfully 6Ni/Ni ratios as low as (3.5 +/- 0.6) x 10(-13). The latter are, based on DS86, representative of a ratio expected from a typical Hiroshima copper sample at about 1,300-m ground range.",

Recent studies have shown that delivering therapy using a standard medical accelerator with the flattening filter removed may reduce neutron fluence by nearly 70% over the course of prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). In the current study, the 197Au Bonner sphere technique was used to compare the neutron spectrum produced when the filter is present and when it is absent. In addition, the following was calculated: (1) the neutron-shielding parameters of source strength and ambient dose equivalent (H0) and (2) using the Monte Carlo technique, the sources of neutron production in the accelerator head. It was found that the neutron spectrum was nearly constant, regardless of the presence of the flattening filter; however, the total fluence and ambient dose equivalent over the course of prostate IMRT were more than 70% lower when the filter was removed. Similarly, shielding parameters were lower when the filter was removed. Finally, the primary collimator and jaws accounted for the majority of neutron production, both with and without the flattening filter; however, with the flattening filter removed, the upper jaw accounted for much more neutron production relative to when the filter was present. Ultimately, removal of the flattening filter may offer several clinical advantages, including a reduction in the dose from neutrons to the patient and to radiation personnel.",

However, the lack of high-quality experimental work on the characterisation of such loads prevents a better understanding of many scenarios. Blast loads are typically characterised by use of some form of pressure gauge, from which the temperature can be inferred from a pressure measurement. However, such an approach to temperature measurement is limited; it assumes ideal gas laws apply throughout, which may not be the case for high temperature and pressure scenarios. In contrast, infrared radiation thermometers (IRTs) perform a measurement of temperature based upon the emitted radiance from the target object. The IRTs can measure fast changes in transient temperature, making them seemingly ideal for the measurement of a fireball's temperature. In this work, we present the use of a high-speed IRT for the measurement of early-stage explosive development and fireball expansion within a confined blast, with the temperature of the explosive fireball measured from its emitted radiance. The temperature measured by the IRT was corroborated against the temperature inferred from a pressure gauge measurement; both instruments measured the same temperature from the quasi-static pressure (QSP) point onwards. Before the QSP point, it is deduced that the IRT measures the average temperature of the fireball over a wide field-of-view (FOV), as opposed to that inferred from the singular shocks detected by the pressure gauge. Therefore, use of an IRT, in tandem with a pressure gauge, provides a potential invaluable measurement technique for the characterisation the early stages of a fireball as it develops and expands.",

Detailed numerical simulations of the first 3 min of the explosion were performed using the astrophysical hydrodynamics program ZEUS-3D. Our numerical simulations begin either with hot cylinders with dimensions suggested by the disruption and deceleration model or with an initial wake constructed from a moving line charge. In all cases, extensive plumes of hot gas are expelled from the atmosphere. The models with wakes evolve about twice as fast as the initially confined models. Models of both types generate similar pressure waves into the planet. Temperatures and negative hydrogen ion opacities were computed by solving a battery of Saha equations. For atmospheric entry, light curves were computed assuming thermal radiation by clean jovian air with a surface area consistent with the (changing) cross-sectional area of the impactor.

The nuclear runaway that leads to the explosion could start in a white dwarf gradually accumulating matter from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit, or could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs in a compact binary system. The X-ray signatures of these two possible paths are very different. Whereas no strong electromagnetic emission is expected in the merger scenario until shortly before the supernova, the white dwarf accreting material from the normal star becomes a source of copious X-rays for about 10(7) years before the explosion. This offers a means of determining which path dominates. Here we report that the observed X-ray flux from six nearby elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges is a factor of approximately 30-50 less than predicted in the accretion scenario, based upon an estimate of the supernova rate from their K-band luminosities.

We also find a linear relation between the low-temperature scattering rate and the density of quasiparticles, which shows a clear contrast to the case of d-wave cuprate superconductors with nodes in the gap.

We tested the hypothesis that differences in temperature sensitivity of enzyme kinetic parameters V max and K m will lead to a canceling effect: strong reduction of temperature response of catalytic reactions. Short-term temperature response of V max and K m of three hydrolytic enzymes responsible for decomposition of cellulose (β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase) and hemicelluloses (xylanase) were analyzed in situ from 0 to 40°C. The apparent activation energy varied between enzymes from 20.7 to 35.2 kJ mol(-1) corresponding to the Q 10 values of the enzyme activities of 1.4-1.9 (with V max - Q 10 1.0-2.5 and K m - Q 10 0.94-2.3). Temperature response of all tested enzymes fitted well to the Arrhenius equation. Despite that, the fitting of Arrhenius model revealed the non-linear increase of two cellulolytic enzymes activities with two distinct thresholds at 10-15°C and 25-30°C, which were less pronounced for xylanase. The nonlinearity between 10 and 15°C was explained by 30-80% increase in V max . At 25-30°C, however, the abrupt decrease of enzyme-substrate affinity was responsible for non-linear increase of enzyme activities. Our study is the first demonstrating nonlinear response of V max and K m to temperature causing canceling effect, which was most strongly pronounced at low substrate concentrations and at temperatures above 15°C. Under cold climate, however, the regulation of hydrolytic activity by canceling in response to warming is negligible because canceling was never observed below 10°C. The canceling, therefore, can be considered as natural mechanism reducing the effects of global warming on decomposition of soil organics at moderate temperatures. The non-linearity of enzyme responses to warming and the respective thresholds should therefore be investigated for other enzymes, and incorporated into Earth system models to improve the predictions at regional and global levels.

Here, we present a large study specifically focused on major and trace element relationships within a population of macroscale fallout samples from a single event. We interpret these data to better constrain how fallout melt glass formation in near surface environments is influenced by that environment and demonstrate how major and trace element abundances can provide useful insights into chemical processes within the fireball. Data confirm that the uranium in the fallout glass population derives from two isotopically distinct endmembers: isotopically enriched uranium (presumably from the weapon), and natural composition uranium that may be a combination of anthropogenic and environmental materials from within the blast zone. The similarity between major and trace element concentrations in fallout and corresponding local soils from the event site confirm the local soils as the most probable source of entrained material into the fireball and the source of carrier material into which the bomb vapor was incorporated. The lack of correlation between major and trace element abundances with size indicates that volatility driven processes, such as condensation from the fireball, do not control the composition of macroscale fallout melt glass. Although the fallout has major and trace element chemical characteristics broadly similar to those of the local, associated soils, some systematic differences are observed between the two populations. Fallout melt glass is depleted in volatile elements such as K, Na, Tl and Pb, consistent with heating to temperatures above ∼1000 °C for 3-10 s. This is supported by the results of laser heating experiments performed on rhyolitic soil at temperatures (1600-2200 °C) and timescales (1-120 s) that are broadly relevant to fallout formation conditions. Relative enrichments of metals such as Cu and Co do not correlate with the abundance of uranium, suggesting that fallout also records input of near field anthropogenic materials. Our observations suggest that major chemical features can be related to processing in the fireball and used to inform the thermal-chemical evolution of the system. Ultimately, these data are consistent with a fallout formation mechanism that involves rapid melting of surface materials to form carrier material melts with minor incorporation of bomb vapor and a degree of volumetric volatile loss due to heating.",

Maximum values of the explosion pressure ratio and the deflagration index, K(G), are clearly higher when nitrous oxide is applied as an oxidizer.

A specific physical mechanism of a relativistic neutron fireball with Lorentz factor of the order of 100 is assumed for propelling a great number of free neutrons outside the dense SN shell. A relativistic chiral electron-proton plasma, produced from neutron decays, is slowed down owing to collective effects in the interstellar plasma. As collective effects do not involve the particle spin, the electrons can carry their helicities to the cloud. The estimates show high chiral efficiency of such electrons. In addition to this mechanism, production of circularly polarized ultraviolet photons through polarized-electron bremsstrahlung at an early stage of the fireball evolution is considered. It is shown that these photons can escape from the fireball plasma. However, for an average density of neutrals in the interstellar medium of the order of 0.2 cm(-3) and at distances of the order of 10 pc from the SN, these photons will be absorbed with a factor of about 10(-7) due to the photoeffect.

The value of V(max) for NOS-I activity increases from 1.8 x 10(1) pmol min(-1) mg(-1), at 5.0 degrees C, to 1.8 x 10(2) pmol min(-1) mg(-1), at 45.0 degrees C; on the other hand, the value of K(m) (=4.0 x 10(-6) M) is temperature independent. Again, the value of V(max) for NOS-II activity increases from 8.0 pmol min(-1) mg(-1), at 7.0 degrees C, to 5.4 x 10(1) pmol min(-1) mg(-1), at 40.0 degrees C, the value of K(m) (=1.8 x 10(-5) M) being unaffected by temperature. Temperature exerts the same effect on NOS-I and NOS-II activity, as shown by the same values of DeltaH(V(max)) (=4.2 x 10(1) kJ mol(-1)), DeltaH(K(m)) (=0 kJ mol(-1)), and DeltaH((V(max))(/K(m))()) (=4.2 x 10(1) kJ mol(-1)). On the contrary, the value of K(m) for NOS-III activity decreases from 3.8 x 10(-5) M, at 10.0 degrees C, to 1.6 x 10(-5) M, at 40.0 degrees C, the value of V(max) (=6.8 x 10(1) pmol min(-1) mg(-1)) being temperature independent. Present results indicate that temperature influences directly NOS-I and NOS-II activity independently of the substrate concentration, the values of K(m) being temperature independent. However, when l-arginine level is higher than 2 x 10(-4) M, as observed under in vivo conditions, NOS-III activity is essentially unaffected by temperature, the substrate concentration exceeding the value of K(m). As a whole, although further studies in vivo are needed, these observations seem to have potential physiopathologic implications.",

Langmuir 2009, 25, 4715) that, for a colloid stabilized by charges from both polymer chain-end groups and adsorbed sulfonate surfactants, when the surfactant surface density reaches a certain critical value, the shear-induced gelation becomes unachievable at room temperature, even at an extremely large Peclet number, Pe = 4.6 x 10(4). This is due to the presence of the short-range, repulsive hydration force generated by the adsorbed surfactant. In this work, we investigate how such hydration force affects the shear-induced gelation at higher temperatures, in the range between 303 and 338 K. It is found that a colloidal system, which does not gel at room temperature in a microchannel at a fixed Pe = 3.7 x 10(4), does gel when temperature increases to a certain value. The critical initial particle volume fraction for the gelation to occur decreases as temperature increases. These results indicate that the effect of the hydration force on the gelation decreases as temperature increases. Moreover, we have observed that at the criticality only part of the primary particles is converted to the gel network and the effective particle volume fraction forming the gel network does not change significantly with temperature. The effective particle volume fraction is also independent of the surfactant surface coverage. Since the effective particle volume fraction corresponds to space filling requirement of a standing gel network, which is mainly related to the clusters structure, this result indicates that at a given shear rate the cluster structure does not change significantly with the surfactant surface coverage. On the other hand, since the cluster morphology is a strong function of the shear rate, we have observed that when the Peclet number is lowered from Pe = 3.7 x 10(4) to 1.7 x 10(4), the effective particle volume fraction reduces from 0.19 to 0.12 at 313 K.",

At first we investigate molecule formation in a primordial shock. We show that almost all deuterium can be converted to HD within the age of the universe at the collapsed redshift in the case of a cloud that has a virial temperature of approximately 106 K and collapses at z&gt;1. When the postshock sheet fragments owing to gravitational instability, the fractional H2 and HD abundances become approximately 10-2 and approximately 10-5, respectively, which are 103-104 times higher than the result of molecule formation in the expanding universe after recombination. To study the subsequent evolution of a fragment, we performed one-dimensional simulations of a spherical/cylindrical cloud, of which initial conditions (e.g., fractional abundances of chemical composition, temperature) are derived from the result of the shock. It is found that, in case of a cylindrical collapse, the cooling by HD molecules keeps the temperature of the cloud less than 100 K and the cloud evolves almost isothermally. When the cloud becomes optically thick to the HD line emission ( approximately 1010 cm-3) and the gravitational fragmentation of the cylindrical cloud becomes effective, the Jeans mass becomes comparable to 0.1 M middle dot in circle.

Integro-differential equations describing the profile and the density of a cylindrical (2D) drop were derived by the variational minimization of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the drop profile and density under the assumption of uniform density. The equations were solved numerically using the constraint of a constant number of molecules N(l) per unit length of the drop. It was shown that for temperatures lower than a certain temperature Tw the free energy against density has generally two minima, representing a stable equilibrium state and a metastable one. One of those minima is located at a density corresponding to the density of a normal liquid, whereas the other one is located at a density comparable to the density of the surrounding inert gas. For this reason, the latter state of the drop cannot be stable. For T &gt; Tw, the minimum corresponding to the liquid state disappears, and no drop can be formed on the surface. The temperature Tw depends on N(l) and the external pressure p and increases when N(l) and p increase. The true wetting angle theta0 that the drop profile makes with the solid surface depends on the parameters characterizing the microscopic interactions, the density, and the surface densities. If in the thermodynamically stable state absolute value(cos theta0) &gt; 1, then no drop is formed on the surface. If in that state absolute value(cos theta0) &lt; 1, then at any pressure the true contact angle decreases when the temperature increases and approaches Tw. However, theta0 does not reach a zero value for T &lt; or = Tw but has for T = Tw a discontinuity from a finite to a zero value. The true contact angle also depends on the number of molecules in the drop and on the external pressure. For all considered values of N(l), p, and microscopic parameters of the intermolecular interactions, the density of the drop decreases with increasing temperature. The rate of decrease is constant for temperatures sufficiently far from Tw and increases when T approaches Tw. At a given temperature and pressure, the density of the drop decreases with decreasing N(l). For relatively large drops (N(l) approximately = 10(14)-10(20)), the rate of decrease is very small, whereas for small droplets (N(l) approximately = 10(12)) it becomes much larger.",

The first two compounds are stable down to 10 K, while the third one undergoes a phase transition to an incommensurately modulated structure at approximately 250 K. The modulated phase is stable down to 10 K. The magnetic anomalies at 45 and 27 K observed previously in BaMnF4 are exclusively reflected in the behavior of the gamma component of the q vector, which assumes an irrational value of approximately 0.395 A(-1) at the temperature corresponding to the onset of the magnetic ordering and then stays constant down to 10 K. Mn-Mn distances do not indicate any structural response to the magnetic ordering. The formation of the modulated phase can be explained on the basis of simple geometrical criteria. The incorporation of the large Mn cation in the octahedral sheets implies an increase of the cavity in which the Ba ion is incorporated. This leads to the formation of the modulated structure to adapt the coordination sphere around Ba in such a way that the bond-valence sums can be kept close to the ideal value of two. With further lowering of the temperature, the charge balance around the Ba ion requires an increasingly anharmonic character of the modulation function of Ba, until finally at 10 K a crenel-like shape is assumed for the modulation of this atom.",

Myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity significantly increased with temperature between 15 and 25 degrees C, whereas its steepness was independent of temperature. A direct proportionality between active tension and Ca(2+)-activated rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed; the slope of this relationship (tension cost) was highly temperature dependent. The rate of tension redevelopment following a quick release-restretch manoeuvre (k(tr)) depended in a complex manner on the level of contractile activation and on temperature. At saturating calcium levels, the temperature dependence (Q(10)) of k(tr) and Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis rate were similar (Q(10) approximately 3.5), and significantly higher than the Q(10) for maximum tension (T(max); Q(10) approximately 1.3) or tension cost (Q(10) approximately 2.5). In contrast, at a low level of contractile activation ( approximately 5% of T(max)), the Q(10) of k(tr) was similar to that of tension cost, and significantly lower than the Q(10) of Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis at that level of contractile activation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that at high levels of contractile activation, the rates of tension redevelopment and Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis are determined by both apparent cross-bridge attachment and detachment rates, while at low levels, k(tr) is limited by cross-bridge detachment rate. Tension cost, on the other hand, is determined solely by cross-bridge detachment kinetics at all temperatures and levels of contractile activation.",

By using Al-Ni clad particles (30-40 microm diameter Al spheres coated by a 3-3.5 microm layer of Ni, that corresponds to a 1:1 Ni/Al atomic ratio), it was shown that such mechanical treatment leads to a significant decrease in the self-ignition temperature of the system. For example, after 15 min of ball milling, the ignition temperature appears to be approximately 600 K, well below the eutectic (913 K) in the considered binary system, which is the ignition temperature for the initial clad particles. Thus, it was demonstrated that the thermal explosion process for mechanically treated reactive media can be solely defined by solid-state reactions. Additionally, thermal analysis measurements revealed that mechanical activation results in a substantial decrease in the effective activation energy (from 84 to 28 kcal/mol) of interaction between Al and Ni. This effect, that is, mechanical activation of chemical reaction, is connected to a substantial increase of contact area between reactive particles and fresh interphase boundaries formed in an inert atmosphere during ball milling.

Temperature-induced viscosity growth is observed even at low-surfactant concentration (approximately 1 wt %), and viscosity reaches the maximum at a temperature T(eta)-max. Upon successive increases in the temperature, the viscosity decreases, and ultimately a phase separation occurs. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements confirm the presence of cylindrical aggregates at low temperature, which undergo continuous one-dimensional growth with increasing temperature, and ultimately, an indication of a slight lamellarlike structural pattern is observed, which probably comes from the formation of micellar joints or branching. Such changes in the microstructure result in a decrease in the viscosity and stress-relaxation time, while the network structure is retained; the trends in the evolution of shear modulus (Go) and relaxation time (tauR) with temperature are in agreement with this. With increased surfactant concentration, the temperature corresponding to the viscosity maximum (T eta-max) in the temperature-viscosity curve shifts to lower values, and the viscosity at temperatures below or around T eta-max increases sharply. A viscoelastic solution with Maxwellian-type dynamic rheological behavior at low-shear frequency is formed, which is typical of entangled wormlike micelles. Rheological parameters, eta(o) and Go, show scaling relationships with the surfactant concentrations with exponents slightly greater than the values predicted by the living-polymer model, but the exponent of tauR is in agreement with the theory.

The mixture shows two widely separated relaxation processes, as before, with the faster relaxation due to the orientational diffusion of isoamylbromide and the slower due to that of 1-propanol. In the mixture, the scaled contribution to permittivity from orientation polarization, Deltaepsilon, of isoamylbromide is about the same as in the pure state, but that of 1-propanol decreases by a factor of approximately 3 at 120 K. As the temperature is decreased, this difference remains constant. The relaxation time, tau, of isoamylbromide and its distribution parameter remains the same as for the pure liquid, but that of 1-propanol is longer and increases with decrease in T, becoming approximately 130 times the pure liquid's value at 119 K. This is in contrast to the finding for an isomeric heptanol, whose tau had decreased. Extrapolation suggests that at T&gt;151 K, tau of 1-propanol in the mixture may become less than that in the pure liquid (the isoamylbromide component crystallizes before this temperature could be reached). This indicates that Tg corresponding to tau of 10(3) s for 1-propanol in the mixture would be higher than in the pure liquid.

Upon irradiation of a flowing mixture of O3 (0.016 Torr) and CO (0.058 Torr), emission of CO (v &lt; or = 6) increases with time, reaches a maximum approximately 10 micros. At the earliest applicable period (2-3 micros), the rotational distribution of CO is not Boltzmann; it may be approximately described with a bimodal distribution corresponding to temperatures approximately 8000 and approximately 500 K, with the proportion of these two components varying with the vibrational level. A short extrapolation from data in the period 2-6 micros leads to a nascent rotational temperature of approximately 10170 +/- 600 K for v = 1 and approximately 1400 +/- 40 K for v = 6, with an average rotational energy of 33 +/- 6 kJ mol(-1). Absorption by CO (v = 0) in the system interfered with population of low J levels of CO (v = 1). The observed vibrational distribution of (v = 2):(v = 3):(v = 4):(v = 5):(v = 6) = 1.00:0.64:0.51:0.32:0.16 corresponds to a vibrational temperature of 6850 +/- 750 K. An average vibrational energy of 40 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1) is derived based on the observed population of CO (2 &lt; or = v &lt; or = 6) and estimates of the population of CO (v = 0, 1, and 7) by extrapolation. The observed rotational distributions of CO (1 &lt; or = v &lt; or = 3) are consistent with results of previous experiments and trajectory calculations; data for CO (4 &lt; or = v &lt; or = 6) are new.",

Ice films of 75 +/- 25 microm thickness were prepared by coating the reactor using a calibrated flow of water vapor. The rate coefficients for adsorption and desorption as well as adsorption isotherms have been derived from temporal profiles of the gas phase concentration at the exit of the flow reactor together with a kinetic model that has recently been developed in our group to simulate reversible adsorption in CWFTs (Behr, P.; Terziyski, A.; Zellner, R. Z. Phys. Chem. 2004, 218, 1307-1327). It is found that acetone adsorption is entirely reversible; the adsorption capacity, however, depends on temperature and decreases with the age of the ice film. The aging effect is most pronounced at low acetone gas-phase concentrations (&lt; or = 2.0 x 10(11) molecules/cm(3)) and at low temperatures. Under these conditions, acetone is initially adsorbed with a high rate and high surface coverage that, upon aging, both become lower. This effect is explained by the existence of initially two adsorption sites (1) and (2), which differ in nature and number density and for which the relative fractions change with time. Using two-site dynamic modeling, the rate coefficients for adsorption (k(ads)) and desorption (k(des)) as well as the Langmuir constant (K(L)) and the maximum number of adsorption sites (c(s,max)), as obtained for the adsorption of acetone on sites of types (1) and (2) in the respective temperature range, are k(ads)(1) = 3.8 x 10(-14) T(0.5) cm(3) s(-1), k(des)(1) = 4.0 x 10(11) exp(-5773/T) s(-1), K(L) (1) = 6.3 x 10(-25) exp(5893/T) cm(3), c(s,max)(1) &lt; or = 10(14) cm(-2) and k(ads)(2) = 2.9 x 10(-15) T(0.5) cm(3) s(-1), k(des)(2) = 1.5 x 10(7) exp(-3488/T) s(-1), K(L)(2) = 5.0 x 10(-22) exp(3849/T) cm(3), c(s,max)(2) = 6.0 x 10(14) cm(-2), respectively. On the basis of these results, the adsorption of acetone on aged ice occurs exclusively on sites of type (2). Among the possible explanations for the time-dependent two-site adsorption behavior, i.e., crystallographic differences, molecular or engraved microstructures, or a mixture of the two, we tentatively accept the former, i.e., that the two adsorption sites correspond to cubic (1, I(c)) and hexagonal (2, I(h)) sites. The temporal change of I(c) to I(h) and, hence, the time constants of aging are consistent with independent information in the literature on these phase changes.",

The method is based on measuring the rate of the hydrogen exchange (HX) reaction of the imidazole C(ε1)-hydrogen. The rate profile of the HX reaction as a function of pH gives a sigmoidal curve, which reaches the maximal rate constant (k(max)) on the alkaline side of the sigmoidal curve. To quantitatively describe the solvent accessibility of imidazole groups in proteins, it is necessary to compare the k(max) of the imidazole groups with their intrinsic k(max) ((i)k(max)), the maximal rate constants for the given imidazole groups when they are fully exposed to the bulk solvent. However, the mechanism of the HX reaction suggests that the (i)k(max) of an imidazole group differs depending on its pK(a), and no systematic study has been conducted to clarify how the (i)k(max) is affected by pK(a). We therefore investigated the relationship between (i)k(max) and pK(a) using four imidazole derivatives at three different temperatures. The experimentally determined pK(a)-specific (i)k(max) values allowed us to derive a general formula to estimate the (i)k(max) value of any given imidazole group exhibiting a specific pK(a) at a specific temperature. Using the formula, the protection factors (PF), the ratio of (i)k(max) to k(max), of five imidazole groups in dihydrofolate reductase were obtained and used to express the magnitude of their solvent accessibility. In this definition, the smaller the PF value, the higher the solvent accessibility, and a value of 1 indicates full exposure to the bulk solvent. The solvent accessibility expressed by the PF values agreed well with the solvent accessible surface areas obtained from the X-ray diffraction data.",

We select four worldwide battery producers, Sony, Sanyo, Samsung and LG, and tested their Li-ion batteries, which have LiCoO(2) cathodes, to determine their thermal instabilities and adiabatic runaway features. The charged (4.2V) and uncharged (3.7 V) 18650 Li-ion batteries are tested using a VSP2 with a customized stainless steel test can to evaluate their thermal hazard characteristics, such as the initial exothermic temperature (T(0)), the self-heating rate (dT/dt), the pressure rise rate (dP/dt), the pressure-temperature profiles and the maximum temperature (T(max)) and pressure (P(max)). The T(max) and P(max) of the charged Li-ion battery during the runaway reaction reach 903.0°C and 1565.9 psig (pound-force per square inch gauge), respectively.

The temporal responses detected for multiple signaling proteins involve both transient and sustained phosphorylation patterns, which change dramatically at low temperatures. To account quantitatively for complex responses, we employed a mechanistic kinetic model of the EGFR pathway, formulated in molecular terms as cascades of protein interactions and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Assuming differential temperature dependencies for different reaction groups, such as SH2 and PTB domain-mediated interactions, the EGFR kinase, and the phosphatases, good quantitative agreement was obtained between computer-simulated and measured responses. The kinetic model demonstrates that, for each protein-protein interaction, the dissociation rate constant, k(off), strongly decreases at low temperatures, whereas this decline may or may not be accompanied by a large decrease in the k(on) value. Temperature-induced changes in the maximal activities of the reactions catalyzed by the EGFR kinase were moderate, compared to such changes in the V(max) of the phosphatases. However, strong changes in both the V(max) and K(m) for phosphatases resulted in moderate changes in the V(max)/K(m) ratio, comparable to the corresponding changes in EGFR kinase activity, with a single exception for the receptor phosphatase at 4 degrees C. The model suggests a significant decrease in the rates of the EGF receptor dimerization and its dephosphorylation at 4 degrees C, which can be related to the phase transition in the membrane lipids. A combination of high-resolution experimental monitoring and molecular level kinetic modeling made it possible to quantitatively account for the temperature dependence of the integrative signaling responses.",

Ratio variables have underlying assumptions. One assumption is that the relationship between the numerator and denominator is linear with a zero y-intercept. If the relationship has a positive y-intercept, then the ratio will decrease with increasing values of the scaling variable thereby penalizing subjects with larger values of the scaling variable. Our purpose was to examine the validity of scaling LT by O(2) peak and by fat-free mass raised to 0 x 67 power (FFM(0 x 67)) as dimensional analysis predicts that LT is proportional to FFM(0 x 67). Cycle ergometer CPET was administered to 204 healthy, sedentary subjects (103 males) to the limit of tolerance. Lactate threshold was estimated noninvasively using the V-slope technique.

Consequently, the plot of the LT/FFM(0 x 67) ratio versus FFM resulted in a straight line with a slope of zero for both sexes.

In addition, the variation of the Ce(1-x)Ln(x)O(2-x/2) unit cell parameter was found to follow a quadratic relation as a result of the combination between increasing cationic radius, modifications of cation coordination, and decreasing O-O repulsion caused by oxygen vacancies.",

Gene action is autonomous and individual mutant melanocytes can be recognised in whole mounts of dorsal skin made after the post-natal onset of melanogenesis. Foetal heterozygotes for d and ln were treated with X-rays (0-200 rad) or procarbazine (0-300 mg/kg body mass by maternal i.p. injection) 17 days after detection of a vaginal plug; whole mounts of dorsal skin (fixed 3 days after birth) were microscopically scanned for mutant melanocytes in the hair follicles.About half a million follicular melanocytes were present in the 2 mounts made per mouse. Mutant cells were mainly in the form of small intrafollicular clones; the few mount containing large interfollicular clones were excluded from the analysis. For both treatments, dose-response relationships showed good fits to both a quadratic and a power-law curve. Equations for the latter were: For X-rays, y = 3.2 x 10(-5) + 3.12 x 10(-9) D2.07; for procarbazine, y = 3.6 x 10(-5) + 0.4 x 10(-10) D2.60.

A study of serial passage in the allantoic sac of agents that combine the antigens of two distinct influenza A strains.\nDouble infection of the allantoic sac with Melbourne and WSN viruses induced the formation of a combination virus, which had some of the antigenic properties of both parents and which maintained itself through serial passage in the chorioallantoic sac. In the course of prolonged passage in the egg, three varieties of combination virus were found. The first (X(1)) occurred in ten passages and was characterized as follows: X(1) was produced in and could be successfully passed from those chick embryos that had received very large inocula of virus. The X(1) hemagglutinin was efficiently inhibited by both M and W antisera. Each passage fluid, containing X(1) as the predominant strain, also contained large amounts of the parent forms M and W. It is very likely that X(1) reverted to parent types of virus at a high rate. The second variety (X(2)) arose from the passage series of X(1) and was carried for approximately 20 passages without definite alteration in its character. It differed from X(1) in that it had the ability to appear as the predominant form occasionally in embryos that had received a limiting infective dilution of virus. Because of this, it seems probable that X(2) reverted to parent types at a slower rate than X(1). Like X(1), this virus was never obtained in pure form and suspensions in which it predominated contained large amounts of M and W, especially the former. Good evidence was obtained that X(2) reverted to M and W virus while multiplying in the chorioallantoic sac. X(3) was derived from passage of X(2) virus after 32 transfers and can be characterized in several ways: (a) X(3) yielded the only X(3) fluids on passage in eggs. This was in striking contrast to X(2) which could not be passed without giving rise to some fluids in which M and W predominated, (b) The X(3) hemagglutinin was weakly inhibited by all but the highest concentrations of M serum, but was strongly inhibited by W serum. X(2) was readily inhibited by relatively small amounts of both sera. (c) X(3) virus, after several passages at limiting dilutions, was neutralized to a highly significant degree by specific M and W sera. This is not necessarily an essential difference from the behavior of X(2) since technical difficulties (large amounts of M and W in X(2) fluids) may have prevented the demonstration of equally striking double neutralization of this virus, (d) After five limiting dilution passages, the X(3) virus retained the characteristics listed under (a) to (c). It is felt that the foregoing facts justify the conclusion that X(3) is a stable virus which combines some of the specific antigens of two parent types.",

To better understand the effects of fertilization on community structure and productivity of lightly and severely degraded alpine meadows, we conducted a fertilization experiment in northern Tibet since 2008. The treatments were addition of nitrogen (N) alone (50 kg N x hm(-2) x a(-1), LN; 100 kg N x hm(-2) x a(-1), HN) or addition of both phosphorus (P) and N (50 kg N x hm(-2) x a(-1) +50 kg P x hm(-2) x a(-1), LN+P; 100 kg N x hm(-2) x a(-1) +50 kg P x hm(-2) x a(-1), HN+P) in each of the two types of degraded alpine meadows. N addition alone significantly affected plant community coverage or productivity in neither the slightly nor the severely degraded alpine meadow, while addition of both N and P significantly increased plant community coverage, aboveground and below- ground biomass of the alpine meadows. This suggested that productivity of this alpine meadow is co-limited by N and P. HN and HN+P significantly decreased species richness and evenness in the lightly degraded grassland, indicating that HN was not beneficial for the lightly degraded grassland to maintain species diversity and community stability. N addition significantly reduced the root to shoot ratio in the severely degraded meadow. In the lightly degraded meadow, N addition alone, especially with a high amount (HN) , enhanced the importance values (IV) and biomass of grasses, while fertilization with both N and P increased those of sedges. In the severely degraded meadow, fertilization had little effect on IV of grasses or sedges, but improved biomass of forbs. The results suggested that LN+P could be employed in recovery of lightly degraded alpine meadows, but other management measures such as fencing and reseeding may be needed for recovery of severely degraded alpine meadows.",

Since coupling may possibly be incomplete, we examine systems of an arbitrary degree of coupling q, regarding stoichiometry as a limiting case. We consider a sodium pump, with J(+) and J(r) linear functions of the electrochemical potential difference, -X(+), and the chemical affinity of the metabolic driving reaction, A. The affinity is well defined even for various complex reaction pathways. Incorporation of a series barrier and a parallel leak does not affect the linearity of the composite observable system. The affinity of some region of the metabolic chain may be maintained constant, either by large pools of reactants or by regulation. If so, this affinity can be evaluated by two independent methods. Sodium transport is conveniently characterized by the open-circuit potential (Deltapsi)(I=0) and the natural limits, level flow (J(+))(X+=0), and static head X(0) (+) = (X(+))(J+=0). With high degrees of coupling -X(0) (+)/F approaches the electromotive force E(Na) (Ussing); -X(0) (+)/F cannot be identified with ((RT/F) ln f)(X+=0), where f is the flux ratio.

The previously reported negative thermal expansion in the b direction of the PrGaO(3) lattice has been found to be persistent in Pr(1-x)Nd(x)GaO(3) solid solutions and its magnitude has been revealed as proportional to the amount of praseodymium. Evaluation of the obtained temperature evolution of cell dimensions indicated a weak anomalous behaviour of the b lattice parameter in NdGaO(3), and its origin is supposed to be the same as in PrGaO(3), i.e. a coupling of the crystal electric field levels with phonon excitations of about 23-25 meV energy. The performed bond length analysis revealed an anomalous behaviour of both LnO(12) (Ln-rare-earth) and GaO(6) coordination polyhedra, which can be a structural manifestation of anomalous thermal expansion in the considered compounds.",

In the case when the charged TP experiences a bias due to external electric field E (which favors its jumps in the preferential direction), we determine exactly the limiting probability distribution of the TP position in terms of appropriate scaling variables and the leading large-n (n being the discrete time) behavior of the TP mean displacement X(n); the latter is shown to obey an anomalous, logarithmic law /X(n)/=alpha(0)(/E/)ln(n). Comparing our results with earlier predictions by Brummelhuis and Hilhorst [J. Stat.

In Experiment 1, the comparison of fractions with common numerators (x/a_x/b) and of fractions with common denominators (a/x_b/x) primed the comparison of natural numbers. In Experiment 2, fillers (i.e., fractions without common components) were added to reduce the regularity of the stimuli. In both experiments, distance effects indicated that participants compared the numerators for a/x_b/x fractions, but that the magnitudes of the whole fractions were accessed and compared for x/a_x/b fractions. The priming effect of x/a_x/b fractions on natural numbers suggested that the interference of the denominator magnitude was controlled during the comparison of these fractions. These results suggested a hybrid representation of their magnitude (i.e., componential and holistic). In conclusion, the magnitude of the whole fraction can be accessed, probably by estimating the ratio between the magnitude of the denominator and the magnitude of the numerator.

For H=1/2, x(t) is a Brownian motion, while for H≠1/2, x(t) is a non-Markovian process.

It has a scaling form P(+)(x,t)~t(-H)R(+)(x/t(H)). Our objective is to compute the scaling function R(+)(y), which up to now was only known for the Markov case H=1/2.

For complexes 3-5 on the other hand, the transverse anisotropy was computed to be large, leading to the absence of slow relaxation of magnetization. As the magnetic field produced by SMTs decays faster than the normal spin moments, the concept of SMTs can be exploited to build qubits in which less interference and dense packing are possible.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the genetic structure of X. pachtaicum and X. index populations using eight and seven populations, respectively, from different \"wine of denomination of origin (D.O.) zones\" in Spain and Sardinia (Italy), by studying mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 or COI) and nuclear (D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rDNA) markers.

Population genetic structure was strong for both species. Nevertheless, molecular differences among grapevine-growing areas were not significant, and intrapopulation diversity was very low.

We compare the regimes induced by (line-cuts through) three specific geometries with distinct space-filling characteristics: (1) an algebraic spiral which has capacity (box-counting dimension) D(k)&gt;0, and fractal dimension H=0; (2) an exponential spiral which has D(k)=0 and H=0, and geometric ratio R&gt;1; (3) a fractal Cantor dust which has D(k)=H&gt;0. The (nondimensional) burning rate U(B) induced by all three geometries takes the general form U(B) approximately F(tau(-zeta)), where F is a function whose form depends on the specific geometry, zeta is an exponent that contains the space-filling characteristic of the geometry, and tau is a nondimensional time. (1) For the algebraic spiral, F(x)=1(x), and zeta=D(k); F is continuous. (2) For the exponential spiral, F(x)=ln(x), and zeta=1/(R-1); F is continuous. (3) For the fractal Cantor dust, F(u)(x)=1(x), and zeta=H (for the envelope); F itself is a step-like discontinuous function. Thus, as D(k)--&gt;0, or as H--&gt;0, or as R--&gt;infinity, then zeta--&gt;0 and U(B)--&gt;const; and as D(k)--&gt;1, or as H--&gt;1, (space filling) then zeta--&gt;1; and as R--&gt;1 (space filling) then zeta--&gt;infinity. Two numerical methods, a fundamental (Eulerian) solution to the equation of motion and a Lagrangian model for flamelet propagation, confirm these theoretical predictions. The Lagrangian model is based on the idealized flamelet as a \"point\" with finite flame thickness Delta(L), (which is determined by the two-flamelet collision process), propagating with a given flame speed U(L). The Lagrangian model allows simulations in parameter ranges not easily accessible by the fundamental method (such as the case for the fractal Cantor dust). Interestingly, the linear regime of scalar diffusion in an algebraic spiral field displays the same dependence on D(k) as in the present reaction-diffusion case. The nonlinear regime of advection-diffusion (Burger turbulence) shows a different dependence on D(k).",

While the in-plane hybrid structure shows uniform semiconducting properties with widely tunable band gap from 0 to 2.87 eV due to quantum confinement effect imposed by the SiC domains, the homogeneous structures can be semiconducting or remain semimetallic depending on a superlattice vector which dictates whether the sublattice symmetry is topologically broken. Moreover, we reveal a universal rule for describing the electronic properties of the homogeneous SixC1-x structures.

The degree to which this thymic-independent pathway can restore immune competence remains poorly understood but has important implications for a number of clinical conditions including stem cell transplantation and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A model of HY-mediated skin graft rejection by athymic, TCD mice was used to show that restoration of naive and recall responses via peripheral expansion requires transfer of only 25 x 10(6) lymph node (LN) cells representing approximately 10% of the T-cell repertoire. Constitutive expression of bcl-2 in the expanding inocula restored recall responses to HY at a substantially lower LN cell dose (1 x 10(6)), which is normally insufficient to induce HY-mediated graft rejection in athymic hosts. Interestingly, bcl-2 had no effect on primary responses. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) potently enhanced thymic-independent peripheral expansion and led to HY graft rejection using an LN cell dose of 1 x 10(6) in both primary and recall models. The restoration of immune competence by IL-7 appeared to be mediated through a combination of programmed cell death inhibition, improved costimulation, and modulation of antigen-presenting cell (APC) function. These results show that immune competence for even stringent antigens such as HY can be restored in the absence of thymic function and identify IL-7 as a potent modulator of thymic-independent T-cell regeneration.",

The most studied atinoporins are sticholysins I and II (StI/StII) from Stichodactyla helianthus, equinatoxin II (EqtII) from Actinia equina, and fragaceatoxin C (FraC) from Actinia fragacea. Their N-terminal sequences encompassing residues 1-30 seem to be the best candidates for pore formation. This segment comprises an amphipathic α-helix preceded by a more or less hydrophobic segment, depending on the toxin, of around 10 amino acid residues. Although it is clear that the N-terminal is the most variable sequence in this protein family, the role of their hydrophobic segment in not fully understood. Here we show a comparison of StI, StII, EqtII, and FraC activities with that of their respective N-terminal synthetic peptides. The hemolytic and permeabilizing activity of the peptides reproduce qualitatively the behavior of their respective parental proteins and are particularly related to the hydrophobicity of the corresponding 1-10 segment. Furthermore, the dendrogram analysis of actinoporins' N-terminal sequence allows relating differences in alignment with differences in activity among the four toxins. We have also evaluated the penetration depth of the N-terminal segment of StI and StII by using Trp-containing peptide-analogs. Our data suggest that the N-terminus of StII is more deeply buried into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer than that of StI. We hypothesize that the highest activity of StII could be ascribed to a larger hydrophobic continuum, an uninterrupted sequence of non-charged mainly hydrophobic amino acid residues, of its N-terminus promoting a highest ability to partially insert in the membrane core. Moreover, as we show for four related peptides that a higher hydrophobicity contributes to increase the activity, we reinforce the notion that this property must be taken into account to design new potent membranotropic agents.",

In terms of overall potency, aryltriazole analogues such as 7r bearing an N-(alpha-branched benzyl)-N-propylamino side chain were the most potent, followed by analogues such as 7a, with an N-bis(cyclopropyl)methyl-N-propylamino side chain, and analogues such as 7m, with an N-(alpha-branched aliphatic)-N-propylamino side chain.

The electrochemistry of this series in CH(3)CN solution exhibits three reversible one-electron transfer waves. UV-vis/NIR spectra and Cr K-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) are reported. The same experimental techniques have been applied for [Cr(III)(tacn)(2)]Br(3)·5H(2)O (5) and [Cr(II)(tacn)(2)]Cl(2) (6), which possess an S = 3/2 and an S = 2 ground state, respectively (tacn = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane, a tridentate, pure σ-donor ligand). The Cr K-edge XAS spectra of the corresponding complexes K(4)[Cr(II)(CN)(6)]·10H(2)O (S = 1) (7) and K(3)[Cr(III)(CN)(6)] (S = 3/2) (8) have also been recorded. All complexes have been studied computationally with density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional. The molecular and electronic structures of the anionic members of the series [Cr(bpy)(3)](1-,2-,3-) have also been calculated. It is unequivocally shown that all members of the electron transfer series 1-4 and [Cr(bpy)(3)](n) (n = 3+, 2+, 1+, 0, 1-, 2, 3-) possess a central Cr(III) ion ((t(2g))(3), S = 3/2).

Further one-electron reductions yield one, two, and three diamagnetic (bpy(2-))(2-) dianions in the mono-, di-, and trianion. Thus, [Cr(III)(bpy(2-))(3)](3-) is a normal Werner-type Cr(III) (!) species. In all complexes containing (bpy(•))(1-) ligands, the ligand spins are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled to the spins of the central Cr(III) ion (d(3), S(Cr) = 3/2) affording the observed ground states given above. Thus, all redox chemistry of [Cr(bpy)(3)](n) complexes is ligand-based and documents that the ligand 2,2'-bipyridine is a redox noninnocent ligand; it exists in three oxidation levels in these complexes: as N,N'-coordinated neutral (bpy(0)), monoanionic π-radical (bpy(•))(1-), and diamagnetic dianionic (bpy(2-))(2-).",

Moreover, diffractometric modeling agrees with the presence of both isomers in the solid state even when the alkyl substituent is an achiral alkyl group. In a chloroform solution, endo and exo isomers undergo isomeric conversion owing to the apparent allyl rotation that follows the Pd-N bond rupture in the (η(3)-allyl)Pd(N^N) frame of kinetic compounds or in the (η(3)-allyl)Pd(N^S) frame of thermodynamic compounds.

Synthesis and evaluation of 1-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)-N,N-dialkylcyclohexylamines at dopamine uptake and phencyclidine binding sites.\nWe previously reported (J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 1188-1193) that changes to the ring size of the piperidine and cyclohexyl rings of the high-affinity and selective dopamine (DA)-uptake inhibitor 1-[1-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (BTCP, 2) caused different, and in some cases opposite, changes in affinity for sites on the DA transporter labeled by [3H]BTCP and [3H]-cocaine. These results suggested that the radioligands label different sites on the transporter. In the present study, we extend the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of BTCP by studying the binding characteristics of a series of N,N-disubstituted 1-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexylamines 7-32 at the DA transporter. Cyclohexyl was selected as opposed to other ring sizes since it corresponds to BTCP. The binding results indicate that a considerable degree of structural variation is permitted for the N-substituents, while still retaining nanomolar affinity for sites on the transporter (studied in rat forebrain homogenates). As observed in our earlier study, the differential effects of structural change on binding to sites on the DA transporter labeled by these radioligands suggests that they are different and distinct binding sites. In general, and up to a point, increasing the size and lipophilicity of the N substituents resulted in improvements in binding but appeared to have less predictable effects on DA-uptake inhibition (as measured in rat brain synaptosomes). The binding of these compounds to sites labeled by [3H]BTCP appeared to correlate best with IC50 for DA-uptake inhibition. To our surprise, the monoalkyl N-substituted BTCP derivatives displayed the highest affinity for the DA transporter of all the compounds in this series. For example, the N-(cyclopropylmethyl) derivative 14 displayed IC50's = 23 nM ([3H]cocaine) and 1 nM ([3H]-BTCP), and the N-butyl derivative 10 showed IC50's = 60 nM ([3H]cocaine) and 0.3 nM ([3H]-BTCP). BTCP exhibited IC50's of 39 nM ([3H]cocaine) and 5 nM ([3H]BTCP) in this assay. The observation that N,N-dibutyl derivative 31 exhibited low ratios of IC50 [3H]cocaine/IC50 DA reuptake and IC50 [3H]BTCP/IC50 DA reuptake suggests that it may be a potential candidate for cocaine antagonism studies. The effect of additional amino, amide, and aromatic groups on the N-substituents was examined, and the results are discussed. The failure of all of the compounds in this series to bind phenycyclidine receptors coupled with their high affinity and range of selectivities at the DA transporter identifies many of them as useful tools for probing the mode of action of BTCP at this site.",

The corresponding 2-(1-alkynyl) derivatives of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and Ado are used as reference compounds. Binding studies demonstrated that the activities of 2-alkynylAdos were slightly increased for the adenosine A(1) receptor and slightly decreased for both A(3) and A(2B) subtypes compared to those of their corresponding NECA derivatives, whereas the A(2A) receptor affinities of the two series of nucleosides were similar. The presence of a methyl group on N(6) of the 2-alkynyladenosines, inducing an increase in affinity at the human A(3) receptor and a decrease at the other subtypes, resulted in an increase in A(3) selectivity. In particular, 2-phenylethynyl-N(6)-methylAdo (8b) showed an A(3) affinity in the low nanomolar range (K(i)(A(3)) = 3.4 nM), with a A(1)/A(3) and A(2A)/A(3) selectivity of about 500 and 2500, respectively. These findings motivated us to search for the preparation of new selective radioligands for the A(3) subtype; hence, a procedure to introduce a tritiated alkylamino group in these molecules was carried out. As far as the potency at the A(2B) receptor, the type of 2-alkynyl chain and the presence of the ethylcarboxamido group on the sugar seem to be very important; in fact, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynylNECA [(S)-PHPNECA, 1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM] proved to be one of the most potent A(2B) agonist reported so far. On the other hand, the (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyl-N(6)-ethylAdo (9e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.73 microM) showed a significantly increase of potency at the A(2B) subtype in comparison with the N(6)-methyl, N(6)-isopropyl, and the unsubstituted adenosine derivatives, although it resulted in being less potent than (S)-PHPNECA (1e, EC(50)(A(2B)) = 0.22 microM). These observations suggest that the introduction of an ethyl group in the N(6)-position and an ethylcarboxamido substituent in the 4'-position of (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyladenosine could lead to a compound endowed with high potency at the A(2B) receptor.",

The results suggest that the conformal aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) coatings have better optical properties than the plane AZO coatings. For the case of only top Si gratings, the grating geometry of degree $n={4}$n=4 can achieve a good trade-off between the shape-dependent light-trapping and antireflection properties, showing the best light-trapping effect; for the case of only bottom Ag gratings, the optical performance of TFSCs is significantly degraded as the degree $n$n increases from $n={1}$n=1 to $n\\to\\infty$n→∞. The above findings are analyzed and demonstrated in detail from the optical and electrical perspectives, and they can be utilized to guide the design of light-trapping structures for TFSCs.",

All structures were characterized at least at the RCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z level of theory.

For example, the optimized structure of SCl(2)((3)A(2)) is a transition state in C(s) symmetry, whereas the analogous states are minima in SF(n) and SF(n-1)Cl. Second, we found a continuation of a trend discovered in the SF(n-1)Cl series, where Cl substitution has a destabilizing effect that weakens bonds with respect to SF(n).

Furthermore, the crystal structure of [Na(THF)(5)][Ta((t)bpy)(3)] has been determined. These studies were supplemented by density functional theory (DFT) and the calculations extended to include the series [Y(bpy)(3)](m) (m = 0, 1-, 2-, 3-), [Ti(bpy)(3)](n) (n = 1+, 0, 1-, 2-, 3-), [Zr(bpy)(3)](p), and [Hf(bpy)(3)](p) (p = 0, 1-, 2-). This has allowed us to  define the correct electronic structures of these early transition metal tris(2,2'-bipyridine) complexes. It is shown that in the [Y(bpy)(3)](m) series the central ion possesses an invariant +III oxidation state and that the three successive one-electron redox processes that comprise the series are solely ligand-based, yielding three (bpy(•))(1-) radical anions in the neutral complex through to three diamagnetic dianions (bpy(2-))(2-) in the trianion. The same is true for the [Ti(bpy)(3)](n) series where the neutral complex contains 3(bpy(•))(1-) and the trianion 3(bpy(2-))(2-) anions. Hence, the central ion always possesses a central Ti(III) (d(1)) ion that intramolecularly antiferromagnetically couples to any (bpy(•))(1-) ligands present.

The first series of dinuclear complexes is [{Mo(V)(O)(Tp)Cl}(2)(&amp;mgr;-OO)], where \"OO\" is [1,4-O(C(6)H(4))(n)O](2)(-) (n = 1, 1; n = 2, 3), [4,4'-O(C(6)H(3)-2-Me)(2)O](2)(-) (4), or [1,3-OC(6)H(4)O](2)(-) (2) [Tp = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)hydroborate]. The second series of dinuclear complexes is [{Mo(I)(NO)(Tp)Cl}(2)(&amp;mgr;-NN)], where \"NN\" is 4,4'-bipyridyl (5), 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridine (6), 3,8-phenanthroline (7), or 2,7-diazapyrene (8). The trinuclear complex is [{Mo(V)(O)(Tp)Cl}(3)(1,3,5-C(6)H(3)O(3))] (9), whose crystal structure was determined [9.5CH(2)Cl(2): C(56)H(81)B(3)Cl(13)Mo(3)N(18)O(6); monoclinic, P2(1)/n; a = 13.443, b = 41.46(2), c = 14.314(6) Å; beta = 93.21(3) degrees; V = 7995(5) Å(3); Z = 4; R(1) = 0.106]. In these complexes, the sign and magnitude of the exchange coupling constant J is clearly related to both the topology and the conformation of the bridging ligand [where J is derived from H = -JS(1)().S(2)() for 1-8 and H = -J(S(1)().S(2)() + S(2)().S(3)() + S(1)().S(3)()) for 9]. The values are as follows: 1, -80 cm(-)(1); 2, +9.8 cm(-)(1); 3, -13.2 cm(-)(1); 4, -2.8 cm(-)(1); 5, -33 cm(-)(1); 6, -3.5 cm(-)(1); 7, -35.6 cm(-)(1); 8, -35.0 cm(-)(1); 9, +14.4 cm(-)(1). In particular the following holds: (1) J is negative (antiferromagnetic exchange) across the para-substituted bridges ligands of 1 and 3-8 but positive (ferromagnetic exchange) across the meta-substituted bridging ligands of 2 and 9. (2) J decreases in magnitude dramatically as the bridging ligand conformation changes from planar to twisted (compare 3 and 4, or 6 and 8). These observations are consistent with a spin-polarization mechanism for the exchange interaction, propagated across the pi-system of the bridging ligand by via overlap of bridging ligand p(pi) orbitals with the d(pi) magnetic orbitals of the metals. The EPR spectrum of 9 is characteristic of a quartet species and shows weak Deltam(s) = 2 and Deltam(s) = 3 transitions at one-half and one-third, respectively, of the field strength of the principal Deltam(s) = 1 component.",

Upon binding to the lectin, this ligand showed a difference absorption spectrum with two maxima (at 322 and 336 nm) of equal intensity (delta epsilon = 1.2 X 10(3) M-1 cm-1). A similar spectrum with a comparable value of delta epsilon was obtained with 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminide. Binding of methyl-alpha-D-galactoside, lactose, and N-acetyllactosamine all produced small but equally intense protein difference spectra with a maximum (delta epsilon = 2.8 X 10(2) M-1 cm-1) at 291.6 nm. Upon binding of N-dansyl-D-galactosamine to the lectin, there was a fivefold increase in fluorescence intensity of this ligand. The association constant for N-dansyl-D-galactosamine was caused by a very favorable delta S degree of the dansyl group without affecting the strictly carbohydrate-specific character of binding. N-Dansyl-D-galactosamine was employed as a fluorescent indicator ligand in substitution titrations. This involved the use of simple carbohydrates, N-acetyllactosamine, and oligosaccharides which occur in the carbohydrate units of N-glycoproteins; the latter were Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----2)Man, Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----6)Man, and Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----6)[Gal(beta 1----4)GlcNAc(beta 1----2)]Man. The titrations were performed at two temperatures to determine the thermodynamic parameters. In the series N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, methyl-alpha-D-galactoside, and lactose, -delta H degrees increased from 24 to 41 kJ mol-1; it increased further for N-acetyllactosamine and then remained unchanged for the N-acetyllactosamine-containing oligosaccharides (55 +/- 1 kJ mol-1. This indicated that the site specifically accommodated the disaccharide structure with an important contribution of the 2-acetamido group in the penultimate sugar. Beyond this, no additional contacts seemed to be formed. This conclusion also followed from considerations of delta S degrees values which became more unfavorable in the above series (-23 to -101 +/- 4 J mol-1 K-1); the most negative value of delta S degrees was observed with N-acetyllactosamine and the three N-acetyllactosamine-containing oligosaccharides.",

Syntheses and biological activities of 1,4-dialkyl-, 1,4-dibenzyl, and 1-benzyl-4-alkyl-2-(4',5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazines and isosteric analogues of imidazoline.\nPiperazine derivatives have been identified as new antidiabetic compounds. Structure-activity relationship studies in a series of 1-benzyl-4-alkyl-2-(4',5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazines resulted in the identification of 1-methyl-4-(2', 4'-dichlorobenzyl)-2-(4',5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazine, PMS 812 (S-21663), as a highly potent antidiabetic agent on a rat model of diabetes, mediated by an important increase of insulin secretion independently of alpha2 adrenoceptor blockage. These studies were extended to find additional compounds in these series with improved properties. In such a way, substitution of both piperazine N atoms was first optimized by using various alkyl, branched or not, and benzyl groups. Second, some modifications of the imidazoline ring and its replacement by isosteric heterocycles were carried out, proceeding from PMS 812, to evaluate their influence on the antidiabetic activity. The importance of the distance between the imidazoline ring and the piperazine skeleton was studied third. Finally, the influence of the N-benzyl moiety was also analyzed compared to a direct N-phenyl substitution. The pharmacological evaluation was performed in vivo using glucose tolerance tests on a rat model of type II diabetes. The most active compounds were 1,4-diisopropyl-2-(4', 5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazine (41a), PMS 847 (S-22068), and 1,4-diisobutyl-2-(4',5'-dihydro-1'H-imidazol-2'-yl)piperazine (41b), PMS 889 (S-22575), which strongly improved glucose tolerance without any side event or hypoglycemic effect. More particularly, PMS 847 proved to be as potent after po (100 micromol/kg) as after ip administration and appears as a good candidate for clinical investigations.",

We retrospectively analyzed 1757 patients with GC undergoing curative gastrectomy and divided them into two groups: MSI-H (n = 185(10.5%)) and microsatellite stability (MSS) (n = 1572(89.5%)), using a five-Bethesda-marker (NR-24, BAT-25, BAT-26, CAT-25, MONO-27) panel.

MSI-H was an independent factor for higher total LN count in patients undergoing DG (p = 0.011), but it was not statistically correlated to the adequate LN ratio. Statistically significant differences in PLNC, NLNC and LODDS were found between MSI-H GC and MSS GC (all p &lt; 0.001). The TLNT<sub(90%)</sub for MSI-H and MSS groups were 31 and 25, respectively. TLNT<sub(X%)</sub of MSI-H GC was always higher than that of MSS GC regardless of the given value of X%. MSI-H was associated with higher LN yield in patients undergoing gastrectomy for GC.

The Technetium group had significantly higher MFs and lower CEs but this can be attributed to the higher mean age of this group. Using the total data base, we calculated the following relationships between MF, CE, age and smoking: (1) ln MF = 4.23-0.63 x ln CE indicating that a doubling of the CE has the effect of decreasing the MF by 37%, (2) ln MF = 0.71 + 0.03 x age meaning that the MF increases by 3% from one year to the next, (3) ln CE = 4.87-0.04 X age indicating that the CE decreases by 0.98% from one year to the next, (4) ln MF = 3.25-0.52 x ln CE + 0.02 X age being the equation quantifying the interrelationship between MF, CE and age, (5) ln MF = 3.32-0.56 x ln CE + 0.01 x age + 0.31 s (where s = 1 for smokers and s = 0 for nonsmokers). Using the latter equation, which allows for effects of CE and age on the MF, a statistically significant effect of smoking could be established. For any combination of CE and age smoking has the effect of increasing the MF by 36%.

A stable dialysis schedule was maintained during the study. Online Kt/V was measured every week or 4 consecutive months. Single pool Kt/V (spKt/V) was calculated from urea estimations in the fourth week of the first month and in the last week of the fourth month of studies, using the formulas: (1)spKt/V = -ln(Ct/Co), where Ct is the postdialysis urea concentration obtained at the end of dialysis, Co the predialysis urea concentration obtained before the start of the blood pump; (2)spKt/V = -ln(R - 0.008 x t - f x UF/W), where R is the Ct/Co, t the duration of HD session, f=1.0, UF is the ultrafiltration volume (l), W is the body weight after the HD session; and (3)spKt/V + -ln(R - 0.008 x t) + (4 - 3.5 x R) x UF/W.

We have carried out extensive ab initio (CASSCF+RASSI-SO+SINGLE_ANISO+POLY_ANISO) calculations on all the five complexes to gain deeper insights into the nature of magnetic anisotropy and the presence and absence of slow relaxation in these complexes.

Our calculations reveal the presence of very large mixed toroidal moment in complex 1 and this is essentially due to the specific exchange topology present in this cluster. Our calculations also suggest presence of single-molecule toroics (SMTs) in complex 2. For complexes 3-5 on the other hand, the transverse anisotropy was computed to be large, leading to the absence of slow relaxation of magnetization. As the magnetic field produced by SMTs decays faster than the normal spin moments, the concept of SMTs can be exploited to build qubits in which less interference and dense packing are possible. Our systematic study on these series of Ln<sub4</sub complexes suggest how the ligand design can help to bring forth such SMT characteristics in lanthanide complexes.",

The M5,4-edge XAS spectra were modeled using configuration interaction calculations. The results were evaluated as a function of (1) the lanthanide (Ln) metal identity, which was varied across the series from Ce to Gd, and (2) the Ln oxidation state (when practical, i.e., formally Ce(III) and Ce(IV)). Pronounced mixing between the Cl 3p- and Ln 5d-orbitals (t2g* and eg*) was observed. Experimental results indicated that Ln 5d-orbital mixing decreased when moving across the lanthanide series. In contrast, oxidizing Ce(III) to Ce(IV) had little effect on Cl 3p and Ce 5d-orbital mixing. For LnCl6(3-) (formally Ln(III)), the 4f-orbitals participated only marginally in covalent bonding, which was consistent with historical descriptions. Surprisingly, there was a marked increase in Cl 3p- and Ce(IV) 4f-orbital mixing (t1u* + t2u*) in CeCl6(2-). This unexpected 4f- and 5d-orbital participation in covalent bonding is presented in the context of recent studies on both tetravalent transition metal and actinide hexahalides, MCl6(2-) (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, U).

As a synthetic equivalent for the elusive trimethyl complex [LnMe3], lithium methylates of the approximate composition [Li3LnMe6(thf)n] were prepared by treating rare-earth metal trichlorides [LnCl3(thf)n] with 6 equiv of methyllithium in diethyl ether. Heteronuclear complexes of the formula [Li3Ln2Me9L(n)] (Ln = Sc, Y, Tb; L = Et2O, thf) were isolated by crystallization from diethyl ether.

Except for the Ce complex, the salts were composed of (BDT-TTP)(5)[Ln(NO(3))(5)] and were isostructural. Even though the Ce crystal had a different composition, (BDT-TTP)(6)[Ce(NO(3))(6)](C(2)H(5)OH)(x)() (x approximately 3), the crystals all had the space group P(-)1. Although the X-ray examination of the Pr salts was insufficient, the existence of two modifications was suggested in these systems by preliminary X-ray examination. Previously, we reported the crystal structures and unique magnetic properties of (BDT-TTP)(5)[Ln(NO(3))(5)] (Ln = Sm, Eu, Nd, Gd). Thus, by combining the results of this work with previous one, we for the first time succeeded in obtaining a complete set of organic conductors composed of the identical pi-donors (BDT-TTP in this case) and all the lanthanide nitrate complex anions (except the complex with Pm(3+)). The crystals were all metallic down to 2 K. Electronic band structure calculations resulted in two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which was consistent with their stable metallic states. Except for the Lu complex, which lacked paramagnetic moments, the magnetic susceptibilities were measured on the six heavy lanthanide ion complex salts by a SQUID magnetometer (Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb). The large paramagnetic susceptibilities, which were caused by the paramagnetic moments of the rare-earth ions, were obtained. The Curie-Weiss law fairly accurately reproduced the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibilities of (BDT-TTP)(5)[Ho(NO(3))(5)] in the experimental temperature range (2-300 K) and a comparatively large Weiss temperature (|THETAV;|) was obtained (THETAV;(Ho) = -15 K). A Weiss temperature (THETAV;(Tm) = -8 K) was also obtained for Tm. The |THETAV;| values of other (BDT-TTP)(5)[Ln(NO(3))(5)] salts and (BDT-TTP)(6)[Ce(NO(3))(6)](C(2)H(5)OH)x(x approximately 3) were as follows: |THETAV;|/K = 4 (Er), &lt; or =2 (Ce, Tb, Dy, Yb). The comparatively strong intermolecular magnetic interaction between Ho(3+) ions, which was suggested by the |THETAV;| value, is inconsistent with the traditional image of strongly localized 4f orbitals shielded by the electrons in the outer 5s and 5p orbitals. The dipole interactions between Ln(3+) ions causing the Curie-Weiss behavior and the comparatively large THETAV; value of (BDT-TTP)(5)[Ho(NO(3))(5)] is inconsistent with the data, since the complexes exhibit isostructural properties and there is not a clear relationship between the magnitudes of THETAV; values and those of magnetic moments. Therefore, it is possible that the 4f orbitals of Ho atom are sensitive to the ligand field, which will have an effect on the orbital moment of the Ho(3+) ion and/or produce a small amount of mixing between 4f and ligand orbitals to give rise to \"real\" intermolecular antiferromagnetic interaction through intermolecular overlapping between pi (BDT-TTP) and ligand orbitals of lanthanide nitrate complex anions.",

The changes in electron density (ρ) and electronic energy density (H(r)) values confirm these structural reorganizations upon complexation.",

The [(13)C]-acetate breath test (ABT) quantifies gastric emptying as the half [(13)CO(2)]-excretion time (T(1/2b)), but T(1/2b) differs from the scintigraphic half-emptying time (T(1/2s)). The aims of the present study were to accurately determine the half-emptying time by ABT with Wagner-Nelson analysis (T(1/2WN)), to compare T(1/2WN) with T(1/2s) and to validate the Wagner-Nelson strategy in ABT. 2. For a comparative study, eight volunteers simultaneously underwent ABT and scintigraphy. Anterior images were acquired and breath samples were collected every 15 min for 4.0 h after ingestion of a 200 kcal liquid meal labelled with 37 MBq [(99m)Tc]-colloidal sulphur and 100 mg [(13)C]-acetate. For the validation experiment, another six volunteers underwent ABT, on two randomized occasions, using the 200 kcal liquid meal with 100 mg [(13)C]-acetate. On either of the two occasions, a gel-forming agent was stirred into the meal to intentionally delay gastric emptying by increasing meal viscosity. Breath samples were collected at regular 15 min intervals for 4 h post ingestion. 3. The Wagner-Nelson equation for ABT is F(t) = (A(breath)(t) + C(t)/0.65)/A(breath)(infinity), where F(t) is a fractional dose of the [(13)C] label emptied, C(t) is the [(13)CO(2)] excretion (% dose/h), A(breath)(t) is the area under the C(t) curve (% dose) and A(breath)(infinity) is the ultimate [(13)CO(2)] recovery in breath (% dose). The percentage gastric retention was estimated as 100 x (1 - F(t)). The time plots of scintigraphic activity and 100 x (1 - F(t)) were fitted to y(t) = 100 x e(-Kxt), K values were estimated mathematically for each plot by regression analysis and T(1/2s) and T(1/2WN) were calculated as (ln2)/K. The time versus pulmonary [(13)CO(2)] excretion plots were fitted to z(t) = m x k x beta x e(-kt)(1 - e(-kxt))(beta-1), where m, k and beta are constants; T(1/2b) was calculated as -(ln(1 - 2(-1/beta))]/k. 4. Values of T(1/2WN) were closer to T(1/2s) than T(1/2b), although T(1/2WN) and T(1/2b) yielded significant under- and overestimation of T(1/2s), respectively. The high viscosity meal significantly prolonged T(1/2WN) and T(1/2b); T(1/2WN) could detect the delayed transit of the viscous meal more sensitively than T(1/2b). 5. The Wagner-Nelson method improves the accuracy of the ABT.",

Our comparative study indicated the superiority of MP2 theory while the HF and B3-LYP methods as well as less sophisticated basis sets failed for the correct energetic relations. In particular, f polarization functions on Li and X proved to be important for the Li...X interaction in the complexes. From the three characteristic structures of such complexes, possessing 1-(C3v), 2-(C2v), or 3-fold coordination (C3v) between the alkali metal and the bridging halide atoms, the bi- and tridentate forms are located considerably lower on the potential energy surface then the monodentate isomer. Therefore only the bi- and tridentate isomers have chemical relevance. The monodentate isomer is only a high-lying local minimum in the case of X = F. For X = Cl, Br, and I this structure is found to be a second-order saddle point. The bidentate structure was found to be the global minimum for the systems with X = F, Cl, and Br. However, the relative stability with respect to the tridentate structure is very small (1-5 kJ/mol) for the heavier halide derivatives and the relative order is reversed in the case of the iodides. The energy difference between the three structures and the dissociation energy decrease in the row F to I. The ionic bonding in the complexes was characterized by natural charges and a topological analysis of the electron density distribution according to Bader's theorem. Variation of the geometrical and bonding characteristics between the lanthanum and dysprosium complexes reflects the effect of \"lanthanide contraction\".

The relevance of desiccation sensitivity (WC50) to cryopreservation of whole seeds and excised axes was investigated.

To test these hypotheses, swine (approximately 30 kg) drank either tap water (Con, n = 25) or water with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (8.0 +/- 0.4 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for &gt;or=4 wk; LN, n = 24). Treatment efficacy was reflected by higher mean arterial pressure and lower plasma NO metabolite concentration in LN than Con (both P &lt; 0.05). Swine completed two graded treadmill running tests to maximum. In the first test, O(2) consumption was determined at rest through maximal exercise intensity. O(2) consumption did not differ between groups at rest or at most exercise intensities, including maximum (Con, 40.8 +/- 1.8 ml x min(-1) x kg(-1); LN, 40.4 +/- 2.9; not significant). In the second test, tissue-specific blood flows were determined using the radiolabeled-microsphere technique. At rest, blood flows were lower (P &lt; 0.05) in LN compared with Con for a number of tissues, including kidney, adrenal, lung, and several skeletal muscles. During both submaximal and maximal exercise, however, blood flows were similar between Con and LN for all 16 muscles examined; only blood flows to kidney (Con, 99 +/- 16 ml x min(-1) x 100 g; LN, 55 +/- 15; P &lt; 0.05) and pancreas (Con, 25 +/- 7; LN, 6 +/- 2; P &lt; 0.05) were lower in LN at maximum.

The average blood pressures did not differ between F1 and F'1 rats or between the four populations of back-cross rats. On the contrary, the relative left ventricular weight was higher in F'1 than in F1 rats. As a role for loci on the Y chromosome could be discarded by comparison of the two populations of back-cross rats, which differ only in the origin of their Y chromosome, this increase in the relative left ventricular weight of F'1 rats was consistent with an effect of a locus on the LH X chromosome. This was supported by findings in the back-cross populations, those populations in which 100% of the rats carried an LH X chromosome having a significantly higher left ventricular weight than those in which only 50% of the rats carried such a chromosome. The estimate of the genetic determination was higher for left ventricular weight (41%) than for mean arterial pressure (19%). Although these two parameters were associated in the back-cross population, the origin of the X chromosome had no influence on this association. These findings indicate that, against the genetic background provided by the cross studied and at the age studied, the sex chromosomes of LH and LN rats do not contain loci at which alleles differentially influence blood pressure. They do, however, suggest that relative left ventricular weight in this model has a specific genetic determination, partly contributed by a locus on the X chromosome.",

The 18-c-6 ligands occupy equatorial positions of a distorted sphenocorona geometry, whereas the charged ligands occupy the axial positions. The analogues of both series with Ln=Ce, Nd, Tb and Dy exhibit out-of-phase ac magnetic susceptibility signals in the presence of an applied magnetic field, indicative of slow magnetization relaxation. When diluted into a diamagnetic La host to reduce dipolar interactions, the Dy analogue exhibits slow relaxation up to 20 K in the absence of an applied dc field. Concerted magnetic measurements, EPR spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations have allowed elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for slow magnetic relaxation. A consistent approach has been applied to quantitatively model the relaxation data for different lanthanoid analogues, suggesting that the spin dynamics are governed by Raman processes at higher temperatures, transitioning to a dominant phonon bottleneck process as the temperature is decreased, with an observed T<sup-6</sup rather than the usual T<sup-2</sup dependence (T is temperature). This anomalous thermal dependence of the phonon bottleneck relaxation is consistent with anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics, which was predicted by Van Vleck more than 70 years ago.",

The addition of Ln salts to an aqueous solution of L (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) led to the successive formation of [LnL] and [Ln(2)L] complexes, as evidenced by UV/Vis and fluorescence titration experiments. Homodinuclear [Ln(2)L] complexes (Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Yb, and Lu) were prepared and characterized. The (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra of the Lu and Yb complexes in D(2)O solution (pD = 7.0) showed C(1) symmetry of these species in solution, pointing to two different chemical environments for the two lanthanide cations. The analysis of the chemical shifts of the Yb complex indicated that the two coordination sites present square antiprismatic (SAP) coordination environments around the metal ions. The spectroscopic properties of the [Tb(2)L] complex upon ligand excitation revealed conventional behavior with τ(H2O) = 2.05(1) ms and ϕ(H2O) = 51%, except for the calculation of the hydration number obtained from the luminescent lifetimes in H(2)O and D(2)O, which pointed to a non-integer value of 0.6 water molecules per Tb(III) ion. In contrast, the Eu complex revealed surprising features such as: 1) the presence of two and up to five components in the (5)D(0)→(7)F(0) and (5)D(0)→(7)F(1) emission bands, respectively; 2) marked differences between the normalized spectra obtained in H(2)O and D(2)O solutions; and 3) unconventional temporal evolution of the luminescence intensity at certain wavelengths, the intensity profile first displaying a rising step before the occurrence of the expected decay. Additional spectroscopic experiments performed on [Gd(2-x)Eu(x)L] complexes (x = 0.1 and 1.9) confirmed the presence of two distinct Eu sites with hydration numbers of 0 (site I) and 2 (site II), and showed that the unconventional temporal evolution of the emission intensity is the result of an unprecedented intramolecular Eu-to-Eu energy-transfer process. A mathematical model was developed to interpret the experimental data, leading to energy-transfer rates of 0.98 ms(-1) for the transfer from the site with q=0 to that with q=2 and vice versa. Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed at the B3LYP level were used to investigate the conformation of the complex in solution, and to estimate the intermetallic distance, which provided Förster radii (R(0)) values of 8.1 Å for the energy transfer from site I to site II, and 6.8 Å for the reverse energy transfer. These results represent the first evidence of an intramolecular energy-transfer equilibrium between two identical lanthanide cations within a discrete molecular complex in solution.",

These values ranged from log K = 18.15 for Ce(PCTA) to log K = 20.63 for Yb(PCTA), increasing along the Ln series in proportion to decreasing Ln3+ cation size. The rates of complex formation for Ce(PCTA), Eu(PCTA), Y(PCTA), and Yb(PCTA) were followed by conventional UV-vis spectroscopy in the pH range 3.5-4.4. First-order rate constants (saturation kinetics) obtained for different ligand-to-metal ion ratios were consistent with the rapid formation of a diprotonated intermediate, Ln(H(2)PCTA)(2+). The stabilities of the intermediates as determined from the kinetic data were 2.81, 3.12, 2.97, and 2.69 log K units for Ce(H(2)PCTA), Eu(H(2)PCTA), Y(H(2)PCTA), and Yb(H(2)PCTA), respectively. Rearrangement of these intermediates to the fully chelated complexes was the rate-determining step, and the rate constant (k(r)) for this process was found to be inversely proportional to the proton concentration. The formation rates (k(OH)) increased with a decrease in the lanthanide ion size [9.68 x 10(7), 1.74 x 10(8), 1.13 x 10(8), and 1.11 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) for Ce(PCTA), Eu(PCTA), Y(PCTA), and Yb(PCTA), respectively]. These data indicate that the Ln(PCTA) complexes exhibit the fastest formation rates among all lanthanide macrocyclic ligand complexes studied to date. The acid-catalyzed dissociation rates (k1) varied with the cation from 9.61 x 10(-4), 5.08 x 10(-4), 1.07 x 10(-3), and 2.80 x 10(-4) M(-1) s(-1) for Ce(PCTA), Eu(PCTA), Y(PCTA), and Yb(PCTA), respectively.",

Complex 1 is a one-dimensional (1D) helical coordination polymer constructed by the joining of the dinuclear [(CuL)Hg(N3)2] units through a single μ-l,l azido bridge. In the dinuclear unit the Hg(II) is bonded with two phenoxido oxygen atoms of \"metalloligand\" [CuL] and two nitrogen atoms of azido ligands. Complex 2 is a linear trinuclear entity, in which two terminal \"metalloligands\" [CuL] are coordinated to central Hg(II) through double phenoxido bridges. The azido ligands link the central mercury atom with the terminal copper atoms via μ-l,3 bridges. In contrast, the trinuclear complex 3 is bent. Here, in addition to two double phenoxido bridges, central Cd(II) is bonded to two mutually cis nitrogen atoms of two terminal azido ligands. The variation in the coordination modes of the azido ligand seems to be responsible for the different molecular shapes of 2 and 3. Interestingly, bond distances between the Hg atoms and the central nitrogen atom of the azido ligands are 2.790(4) and 2.816(5) Å in 1 and 2.823(4) Å in 2. These bond distances are significantly less than the sum of van der Waals radii of mercury (2.04 Å) and nitrogen (1.55 Å) and considerably longer than the sum of their covalent radii (2.03 Å). However the distances are similar to reported Hg-N bond distances of some Hg(II) complexes. Therefore, we have performed a theoretical density functional theory study to know whether there is any interaction between the central nitrogen atom of the azido ligand and the mercury atoms. We have used the Bader's \"atoms-in-molecules\", energetic and orbital analyses to conclude that such interaction does not exist. The probable reason for different molecular shapes observed in trinuclear complexes of 2 and 3 also has been studied and explained by theoretical calculations and using the CSD. Electronic spectra, EPR spectra and ESI mass spectra show that all three complexes lose their solid state identity in solution. ",

Both protonated molecules are fragmented mainly at the Asp-Gly amide bond C-terminal to Asp, as supported by quantum chemical calculations. Charge distributions of C and N atoms (Qc + QN) on the amide bonds were collected when the ionizing proton was fixed at different nitrogen atoms along the backbone for each peptide. Compared with the neutral molecules, the total charges of C and N atoms (Qc + QN] for the singly charged peptides tended to be negative when the proton was located at the backbone nitrogen atoms. A relatively larger value of QC + QN corresponds to a higher trend of fragmentation, which is consistent with the experimental relative abundances data that the predominant ions are y2 for [GDGR + H]+ and b3 for [RGDG + H]+. Also, the anhydride mechanism driven by the C-terminal COOH for [RGDG + H]+ was explored by a quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical method. Calculations indicate that the protonated peptide can be cleaved through an unusual charge-directed pathway by forming a salt bridge at the C-termini. The formation of the anhydride linkage is much more feasible since this process needs very little energy and is exother- mic, though the subsequent nucleophilic attack on the Asp carbonyl carbon is more difficult.

Upon collisional activation, loss of CO from deprotonated N-phenylbenzamides could be observed, which can be interpreted as a nitrogen anion triggering the Smiles rearrangement reaction through a three-membered ring transition state. As the aniline ring was substituted by a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g., NO(2), COCH(3), or CF(3)) at the para position, a characteristic phenolate anion was obtained, which was derived from the Smiles rearrangement reaction initiated by the oxygen anion through a four-membered ring transition state.

In untargeted metabolomics, the measured mass of a detected compound is used to define the location of the compound in chemical space, but uncertainties in mass measurements lead to \"degeneracies\" in chemical space since multiple chemical formulae correspond to the same measured mass. We compare two methods to eliminate these degeneracies. One method relies on natural isotopic abundances, and the other relies on the use of stable-isotope labeling (SIL) to directly determine C and N atom counts. Both depend on combinatorial explorations of the \"chemical space\" comprised of all possible chemical formulae comprised of biologically relevant chemical elements. Of 1532 metabolic pathways curated in the MetaCyc database, 412 contain a metabolite having a chemical formula unique to that metabolic pathway. Thus, chemical formulae alone can suffice to infer the presence of some metabolic pathways. Of 248,928 unique chemical formulae selected from the PubChem database, more than 95% had at least one degeneracy on the basis of accurate mass information alone. Consideration of natural isotopic abundance reduced degeneracy to 64%, but mainly for formulae less than 500 Da in molecular weight, and only if the error in the relative isotopic peak intensity was less than 10%. Knowledge of exact C and N atom counts as determined by SIL enabled reduced degeneracy, allowing for determination of unique chemical formula for 55% of the PubChem formulae.

This makes it possible to accurately count the number of carbon and nitrogen atoms in each molecule, providing a robust means for reducing the degeneracy of chemical space and thus obtaining unique chemical formulae for features measured in untargeted metabolomics having a mass greater than 500 Da, with relative errors in measured isotopic peak intensity greater than 10%, and without the use of a chemical formula generator dependent on heuristic filtering.

In this paper, the kinetic method and theoretical calculations were applied to evaluate the fragmentation of protonated esomeprazole analogs. All collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry experiments were carried out using electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry in positive ion mode. Also the accurate masses of fragments were measured on by ESI quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS in positive ion mode. Theoretical calculations were carried out by the density functional theory (DFT) method with the 6-31G(d) basis set in the Gaussian 03 program. In the fragmentation of the protonated esomeprazole analogs, C-S bond breakage is observed, which gives rise to protonated 2-(sulfinylmethylene)pyridines and protonated benzimidazoles. DFT calculations demonstrate that the nitrogen atom of the pyridine part is the thermodynamically most favorable protonation site, and the C-S bond cleavage is triggered by the transfer of this ionizing proton from the nitrogen atom of the pyridine part to the carbon atom of the benzimidazole part to which the sulfinyl is attached. Moreover, with the kinetic plot, the intensity ratios of two protonated product ions yield a linear relationship with the differences in proton affinities of the corresponding neutral molecules, which provides strong experimental evidence that the reaction proceeds via proton-bound 2-(sulfinylmethylene)pyridine/benzimidazole complex intermediates. The kinetic method combined with theoretical calculations was successfully applied to probe the proton transfer reaction by proton-bound 2-(sulfinylmethylene)pyridine/benzimidazole complexes in the fragmentation of protonated esomeprazole analogs by ESI CID MS, which is a strong evidence that the kinetic method can be applied in identifying a proton-bound dimeric intermediate in the fragmentation of protonated ions.",

However, most reported studies about SACs in heterogeneous catalysis focus on model reactions with simple molecules. In addition, many reported single atoms are confined in microporous structures, hindering the mass transfer of molecules with large sizes, thus limiting their practical applications in industry. In this study, we report a molten salt-assisted method to synthesize metal single atoms anchored on a hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon support (denoted as M<sub1</sub/h-NC, M includes Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, and Cu). Taking Co<sub1</sub/h-NC as an example, compared to the control sample which has Co single atoms being encapsulated in a microporous N-doped carbon support (denoted as Co<sub1</sub/m-NC), Co<sub1</sub/h-NC exhibits significantly higher catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of large-sized pharmaceutical molecules, such as nimodipine (calcium channel blocker) and 2-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)quinoline (antispasmodic natural alkaloid intermediate). The superior catalytic performance of Co<sub1</sub/h-NC is directly ascribed to the integration of the advantages of single-atom active sites and hierarchical mesoporous structure, which is beneficial for the mass transfer of molecules with large sizes and enables nearly all the Co single atoms to be accessible for catalytic reactions.",

The structure of the Cu(II) complex with 5-Br-PADAP formed in acidic medium was proposed as CuR(R - H) (where R is the undissociated molecule of the reagent). The binding sites of the two bound reagent molecules were different: in one of them the oxygen atom of the dissociated phenolic group and the nitrogen atom from the azo (-N=N-) group took part in complex formation, whereas in the other only nitrogen atoms from the pyridyl ring and azo group were involved. The complex was stable and could not be reduced to Cu(I) species by use of standard reducing agents (ascorbic acid, hydroxylamine). In alkaline solutions the complex tended to polymerize and precipitated in media containing less than 80% of methanol. The copper(I)-5-Br-PADAP complex was extremely unstable and could be obtained (as a mixture with Cu(II) species) in media free of water or oxygen. For this complex, CuR(2) was proposed as the most probable structure. According to this proposal copper(I) reacted exclusively with nitrogen-containing binding sites and the undissociated phenolic group was not engaged in complex formation.

Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were employed to examine the influence of the position of the donor nitrogen atom and π-conjugation on solar cell performance. The calculated electron-injection driving force (ΔG inject), electron-regeneration driving force (ΔG regen), light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), dipole moment (μ normal), and number of electrons transferred (∆q) indicate that dyes 3, 4, and 6 have significantly higher efficiencies than reference dye 1, which exhibits high efficiency. We also extended our comparison to some other reported dyes, 7-9, which have a donor nitrogen atom in the middle of the ring system. The computed results suggest that dye 6 possesses a higher incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) than reported dyes 7-9. Thus, the use of donor groups with peripheral nitrogen atoms appears to lead to more efficient dyes than those in which the nitrogen atom is present in the middle of the donor ring system.

An ion-to-atom ratio of iron, which was estimated from the intensity ratio of ion to atomic lines having almost the same excitation energy, was reduced by adding oxygen gas to the nitrogen MIP, eventually contributing to an enhancement in the emission intensities of the atomic lines. Furthermore, Boltzmann plots for iron atomic lines were observed in a wide range of the excitation energy from 3.4 to 6.9 eV, indicating that plots of the atomic lines having lower excitation energies (3.4 to 4.8 eV) were well fitted on a straight line while those having more than 5.5 eV deviated upwards from the linear relationship. This overpopulation would result from any other excitation process in addition to the thermal excitation that principally determines the Boltzmann distribution. A Penning-type collision with excited species of nitrogen molecules probably explains this additional excitation mechanism, in which the resulting iron ions recombine with captured electrons, followed by cascade de-excitations between closely-spaced excited levels just below the ionization limit. As a result, these high-lying levels might be more populated than the low-lying levels of iron atom. The ionization of iron would be caused less actively in the nitrogen-oxygen plasma than in a pure nitrogen plasma, because excited species of nitrogen molecule, which can provide the ionization energy in a collision with iron atom, are consumed through collisions with oxygen molecules to cause their dissociation. It was also observed that the overpopulation occurred to a lesser extent when oxygen gas was added to the nitrogen plasma. The reason for this was also attributed to decreased number density of the excited nitrogen species due to collisions with oxygen molecule. ",

However, if the usage of Pt reduces to a sufficiently low level, this critical barrier may be overcome. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts with high activity and high atom efficiency have the possibility to achieve this goal. Herein, we report a locally distributed atomic Pt-Co nitrogen-carbon-based catalyst (denoted as A-CoPt-NC) with high activity and robust durability for ORR (267 times higher than commercial Pt/C in mass activity). The A-CoPt-NC shows a high selectivity for the 4e<sup-</sup pathway in ORR, differing from the reported 2e<sup-</sup pathway characteristic of atomic Pt catalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this high activity originates from the synergistic effect of atomic Pt-Co located on a defected C/N graphene surface. The mechanism is thought to arise from asymmetry in the electron distribution around the Pt/Co metal centers, as well as the metal atoms' coordination with local environments on the carbon surface. This coordination results from N8V4 vacancies (where N8 represents the number of nitrogen atoms and V4 indicates the number of vacant carbon atoms) within the carbon shell, which enhances the oxygen reduction reaction via the so-called synergistic effect.",

However, successful examples of highly efficient organic luminescent radicals are still rare. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor-acceptor (D-A•) chemical structure where an electron-donating group is covalently attached to an electron-withdrawing radical core (A•). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D-A• type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine-type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents; as a result, the molecule with the average extent of conjugation and number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent has the highest PLQE (89%). These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local-excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases. Our study underlines that the optimization of the CT energy is critical to maximize the emitter PLQE: On the one hand, the CT energy has to be high enough in order to reduce the non-radiative decay rate related to the energy-gap law; on the other hand, it should remain low with respect to the LE-state energies to prevent hybridization with the TTM local excitations.

If not, then the ablation products made available for prebiotic organic chemistry, and perhaps early biology, might have retained some memory of their astrophysical nature. To test this hypothesis we searched for CN emission in meteor spectra in an airborne experiment during the 2001 Leonid meteor storm. We found that the meteor's light-emitting air plasma, which included products of meteor ablation, contained less than 1 CN molecule for every 30 meteoric iron atoms. This contrasts sharply with the nitrogen/iron ratio of 1:1.2 in the solid matter of comet 1P/Halley. Unless the nitrogen content or the abundance of complex organic matter in the Leonid parent body, comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, differs from that in comet 1P/Halley, it appears that very little of that organic nitrogen decomposes into CN molecules during meteor ablation in the rarefied flow conditions that characterize the atmospheric entry of meteoroids approximately 50 microm-10 cm in size.

The observed ions were different from those which are traditionally observed in the full scan ESI mass spectra of CAP with ions of m/z 321, m/z 323 and m/z 325. We have evidence to show that this process starts with offline methylation of CAP in solutions of methanol or acetonitrile to give m/z 339. Investigations using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed that there is a methylene group somewhere within the CAP molecule but not attached to any of the carbon atoms when the CAP is dissolved in methanol or acetonitrile before infusion into the mass spectrometer. The possible locations of attachment were speculated to be the electronegative atoms apart from the chlorine atoms due to valence considerations. The methylene group is attached to the nitrogen atom and forms a bond as observed in the MS/MS spectra of m/z 297, m/z 311, m/z 325 and m/z 339 which give m/z 183 as the base peak in all cases.

This process occurs in the mass spectrometer in the region housing the tube lens and is triggered when the ions are accelerated through this region by application of a negative tube lens offset voltage.

Investigation of the fragmentation mechanism of amides in the gas phase is scientifically important for structural analysis. However, understanding of this problem is still elusive. Protonated N-phenyl-3-(phenylthio)propanamide and its derivatives were investigated using positive ion tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) with an LCQ mass spectrometer. Accurate mass analysis was conducted with a micrOTOF-QII mass spectrometer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 03 program and deuterium-labelling (D-labelling) experiments were performed to verify the proposed fragmentation mechanism. Interpretation of the fragment ions in the collision-induced dissociation mass spectra showed that the ionizing proton in the protonated ion transferred from the most thermodynamically favorable carbonyl oxygen to the dissociative protonation site at amide nitrogen or sulfur atom upon collisional activation. The dissociation of the amide or the C-S bond was induced by such proton transfer. An ion-neutral complex (INC) was generated via the dissociation of the amide bond. In the INC, it was observed that the carbocation of the ionic part attacked the ortho phenyl carbon atom adjacent to the sulfur atom, and proton transfer from the carbon atom to the nitrogen atom led to the formation of protonated aniline. The fragmentation mechanism of protonated N-phenyl-3-(phenylthio)propanamide and its derivatives was proposed and elucidated.

As a continuation of this line of research we show here the influence of solvent effects on the shieldings through the application of both explicit and implicit models. We found that the explicit solvent model is more appropriate for consideration due to the results matching better in general with experiments, as well as providing clear knowledge of the electronic origin of the value of the shieldings. Our study is grounded on a recently developed theoretical model of our own, by which we are able to learn about the magnetic effects of given fragments of DNA molecules on selected base pairs. We use the shieldings of the atoms of a central base pair (guanine-cytosine) of a selected fragment of DNA molecules as descriptors of physical effects, like π-stacking and solvent effects. They can be taken separately and altogether. The effect of π-stacking is introduced through the addition of some pairs above and below of the central base pair, and now, the solvent effect is considered including a network of water molecules that consist of two solvation layers, which were fixed in the calculations performed in all fragments. We show that the solvent effects enhance the stacking effects on the magnetic shieldings of atoms that belong to the external N-H bonds. The net effect is of deshielding on both atoms. There is also a deshielding effect on the carbon atoms that belong to CO bonds, for which the oxygen atom has an explicit hydrogen bond (HB) with a solvent water molecule. Solvent effects are found to be no higher than a few percent of the total value of the shieldings (between 1% and 5%) for most atoms, although there are few for which such an effect can be higher. There is one nitrogen atom, the acceptor of the HB between guanine and cytosine, that is more highly shielded (around 15 ppm or 10%) when the explicit solvent is considered. In a similar manner, the most external nitrogen atom of cytosine and the hydrogen atom that is bonded to it are highly deshielded (around 10 ppm for nitrogen and around 3 ppm for hydrogen).",

Herein, we report on the formation of a covalently-bonded (benzene·pyrimidine) radical cation dimer by the gas phase reaction of pyrimidine with the benzene radical cation at room temperature using the mass-selected ion mobility technique. No ligand exchange reactions with benzene and pyrimidine are observed indicating that the binding energy of the (benzene·pyrimidine)˙<sup+</sup adduct is significantly higher than both the benzene dimer cation and the proton-bound pyrimidine dimer.

The slower mobility peak corresponds to a non-covalent family of isomers with larger collision cross sections (76.0 ± 1.8 Å<sup2</sup) and the faster peak is consistent with a family of covalent isomers with more compact structures and smaller collision cross sections (67.7 ± 2.2 Å<sup2</sup). The mobility measurements at 509 K show only one peak corresponding to the family of stable covalently bonded isomers characterized by smaller collision cross sections (66.9 ± 1.9 Å<sup2</sup at 509 K).

The underlying theoretical framework is explored in depth. The effect of interferences due to 14N15N16O and 15N14N16O in the 15N2O sample and due to 15N2+ formation are fully accounted for in the calculation of the final position-dependent nitrogen isotope ratios.

Steady-state absorption and fluorescence studies reveal that DBPZ is completely insensitive to polarity of the medium. However, DBPZ can form a hydrogen bond very efficiently in its first excited singlet state. The extent of this excited-state hydrogen-bond formation depends both on size and on hydrogen-bond donor ability of the solvents. Time-resolved fluorescence studies and theoretical calculations also suggest that this hydrogen-bond formation is much more favorable in the excited state as compared to the ground state. In the excited state, the electron density is pushed toward the nitrogen atoms from the benzene rings, thereby increasing the dipole moment of the DBPZ molecule. Although the dipole moment of DBPZ increases upon photoexcitation, like other polarity probes, the molecule remains fully insensitive to the polarity of the interacting solvent. This unusual behavior of DBPZ as compared to simple phenazine and other polarity probes is due to the structure of the molecule. Hydrogen atoms at the 1 and 8 positions of DBPZ are sterically interacting with a lone pair of electrons on the proximate nitrogen atoms and make both of the nitrogen atoms inaccessible to solvent molecules. For this reason, DBPZ cannot sense the polarity of the medium. However, DBPZ can only sense solvents, those that have hydrogen with some electropositive nature, that is, the hydrogen-bond donating solvents.

In particular, we consider the reactive intermediates that precede the final products of two previously suggested dissociation pathways for these systems, i.e., (i) a direct cleavage of the NH-CH2 bond and (ii) an isomerization/fragmentation mechanism. The study is performed by means of correlated calculations (UCCSD and UMP2) together with density functionals (UM06 an UM06-2x) along with the triple-ζ quality basis set 6-311++G(2d,2p). In addition, we carried out a topological analysis of the electron density in accordance with the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) together with the examination of the noncovalent interaction (NCI) index. In contrast with previous studies based on the UB3LYP approximation, we could determine the transition states associated with both fragmentation pathways. The Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory, used to determine the relative importance of these dissociation mechanisms, indicates that whereas the direct cleavage and the isomerization/fragmentation reaction routes have similar constant rates at low energy, the former prevails when the energy of the system is increased. The QTAIM analysis reveals that the charge of the cation-radical complex is mainly located on either a furfuryl (direct cleavage mechanism) or a pyrylium (isomerization/fragmentation pathway) ion and that these units interact with a neutral radical aniline moiety. The localization of the positive charge in either a furfuryl or pyrylium cation is in agreement with the preminecence of the m/z = 81 fragment in the mass spectrometry of N-(2-furylmethyl)anilines. Moreover, the QTAIM properties indicate that the α unpaired electron of the system is principally distributed over the nitrogen and the ortho and para carbon atoms with respect to the -NH group in the R-C6H4-NH unit. The investigation of the NCI index and the intermolecular bond critical points and bond paths gives an account of the NCIs linking the radical cation clusters under consideration. Finally, we found correlations which indicate that the concentration of the m/z = 81 fragment in a mass spectrum is reduced with the interaction energy of the radical complex from which it is originated. Altogether, this work shows how the combination of suitable electronic structure calculations along with post wave function analyses can yield important insights about the formation and properties of cation-radical complexes relevant in mass spectrometry.

The nitrogen content within unzipped CNx-MWCNTs decreased as a function of the oxidation time, temperature, and oxidizer concentration. By controlling the degree of oxidation, the N atomic % could be reduced from 1.56% in pristine CNx-MWCNTs down to 0.31 atom % in nitrogen-doped oxidized graphene nanoribbons. A comparative thermogravimetric analysis reveals a lower thermal stability of the (unzipped) oxidized CNx-MWCNTs when compared to MWCNT samples. The oxidized graphene nanoribbons were chemically and thermally reduced and yielded nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons (N-GNRs). The thermal reduction at relatively low temperature (300 °C) results in graphene nanoribbons with 0.37 atom % of nitrogen. This method represents a novel route to preparation of bulk quantities of nitrogen-doped unzipped carbon nanotubes, which is able to control the doping level in the resulting reduced GNR samples. Finally, the electrochemical properties of these materials were evaluated.",

A study on benzodiazepines.\nThe fragment spectra of protonated nitro-substituted benzodiazepines show an unusual fragment [M + H - 14]<sup+</sup , which is shown by accurate mass measurement to be due to the loss of a nitrogen atom. Our investigations show that this apparent loss of atomic nitrogen is rather an attachment of molecular oxygen to the [M + H - NO<sub2</sub ]<sup+•</sup ion, which is the main fragment ion in these spectra. The oxygen attachment is exothermic, and rate constants have been derived. MS<supn</sup spectra show that it is not easily reversible upon fragmentation of the adduct ion and that it is also observed with some secondary and tertiary fragments, which allows to limit the attachment site to the aromatic ring annulated to the diazepine moiety. Fragments of the oxygen adduct ion indicate that the O<sub2</sub molecule dissociates in the adduct formation process, and the two oxygen atoms are bound to different sites of the ion. Comparison with radical cations generated by fragmentation of non-nitro-substituted benzodiazepines, none of which showed an oxygen attachment, and the fragmentation mechanisms involved in their formation indicates that the [M + H - NO<sub2</sub ]<sup+•</sup ion is a distonic ion with the charge and radical site neighbored on the aromatic ring.

Baseline separation of the cis- and trans- forms of both hydroxyproline and fluoroproline was achieved using TWIMS-MS via metal ion cationization (Li(+), Na(+), K(+), and Cs(+)). Density functional theory calculations indicate that differentiation of these diastereomers is a result of the stabilization of differing metal-complexed forms adopted by the diastereomers when cationized by an alkali metal cation, [M + X](+) where X = Li, Na, K, and Cs, versus the topologically similar structures of the protonated molecules, [M + H](+). Metal-cationized trans-proline variants exist in a linear salt-bridge form where the metal ion interacts with a deprotonated carboxylic acid and the proton is displaced onto the nitrogen atom of the pyrrolidine ring. In contrast, metal-cationized cis-proline variants adopt a compact structure where the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid, nitrogen atom, and if available, the hydroxyl and fluorine substituent solvate the metal ion. Experimentally, it was observed that the resolution between alkali metal-cationized cis- and trans-proline variants decreases as the size of the metal ion increases. Density functional theory demonstrates that this is due to the decreasing stability of the compact charge-solvated cis-proline structure with increased metal ion radius, likely a result of steric hindrance and/or weaker binding to the larger metal ion. Furthermore, the unique structures adopted by the alkali metal-cationized cis- and trans-proline variants results in these molecules having significantly different quantum mechanically calculated dipole moments, a factor that can be further exploited to improve the diastereomeric resolution when utilizing a drift gas with a higher polarizability constant.

Generally, the amide group strongly quenches the fluorescence of tyrosine, however, the size and number of substituents on amide nitrogen atom modify the quenching process only in small degree. The fluorescence intensity decays of all amides studied are bi-exponential. The contribution of both components (alphai) to the fluorescence decay undergoes irregular change. An introduction of alkyl substituent on amide nitrogen atom causes an increase of the fluorescence lifetime of tyrosine derivative compared to the unsubstituted amide for both N-acetyltyrosine and tyrosine with the protonated amino group. Calculated, basing on the fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and average lifetime, the radiative rate constants (kf) are similar, which indicates that the substituent(s) does not have substantial influence on radiative process of the deactivation of the excited state of the phenol chromophore for all compounds studied regardless the amino group status as well as the number and type of substituent (linear or branched). The comparison of the ground-state rotamer populations of tyrosine amides and N-acetyltyrosine amides with different alkyl substituent on amide nitrogen atom obtained from 1H NMR with the value of pre-exponential factors indicates that not the rotamer populations, but specific hydration of a whole molecule of the amino acid including chromophore and amino acid moiety, seems to be the main reason of the heterogenous fluorescence intensity decay of tyrosine derivatives.",

Currently, different instrumentation and methods can yield very different results when measuring the same feature such as color uniformity or color difference. As color increasingly comes into play in medical imaging diagnostics, display color will have to be quantified in order to assess whether the display should be used for imaging purposes. The authors report on the characterization of three novel probes for measuring display color with minimal contamination from screen areas outside the measurement spot or from off-normal emissions. They compare three probe designs: A modified small-spot luminance probe and two conic probe designs based on black frusta. To compare the three color probe designs, spectral and luminance measurements were taken with specialized instrumentation to determine the luminance changes and color separation abilities of the probes. The probes were characterized with a scanning slit method, veiling glare, and a moving laser and LED arrangement. The scanning slit measurement was done using a black slit plate over a white line on an LCD monitor. The luminance was measured in 1 mm increments from the center of the slit to +/- 15 mm above and below the slit at different distances between the probe and the slit. The veiling glare setup consisted of measurements of the luminance of a black spot pattern with a white disk of radius of 100 mm as the black spot increases in 1 mm radius increments. The moving LED and laser method consisted of a red and green light orthogonal to the probe tip for the light to directly shine into the probe. The green light source was moved away from the red source in 1 cm increments to measure color stray-light contamination at different probe distances. The results of the color testing using the LED and laser methods suggest a better performance of one of the frusta probes at shorter distances between the light sources, which translates to less contamination. The tails of the scans indicate the magnitude of the spread in signal due to light from areas outside the intended measurement spot. The measurements indicate a corresponding glare factor for a large spot of 140, 500, and 2000 for probe A, B1, and B2, respectively. The dual-laser setup suggests that color purity can be maintained up to a few tens of millimeters outside the measurement spot. The comparison shows that there are significant differences in the performance of each probe design, and that those differences have an effect on the measured quantity used to quantify display color. Different probe designs show different measurements of the level of light contamination that affects the quantitative color determination.",

The suction-electrode method used for recording from vertebrate rods was applied to fly ommatidia. A single ommatidium in vitro was partially sucked into a recording pipette. Illumination of the portion of the ommatidium within the pipette resulted in a flow of current having a wave form similar to that of the receptor potential and polarity consistent with current flow into the illuminated region of the photoreceptors. Two 5-microns slits of light, positioned at right angles to the ommatidial axis, were employed to determine the spread of light adaptation or inactivation along the ommatidium. The intensity of a flash of light delivered to one (adapting) slit was adjusted until it produced a criterion fractional reduction in the response to the other (test) slit. The reciprocal of this intensity of the adapting slit was taken as a measure of the effectiveness of the slit in causing light adaptation or inactivation. The effectiveness of the slit in causing light adaptation in normal Musca ommatidia fell as the adapting and test slits were moved farther apart along the ommatidial axis, declining to half its maximal value at a distance of 13 +/- 2 microns. Similar measurements of the effectiveness of a slit in causing light-induced inactivation in the nss mutant of Lucilia also demonstrated localization, declining to half its maximal value at a distance between the slits of 9 +/- 1 microns. Neither light adaptation nor inactivation by the nss mutation, therefore, appear to be mediated by voltage or by a highly diffusible agent. The results are consistent with the idea that inactivation by the nss mutation replaces adaptation in the mutant photoreceptors.",

Two suggestions have previously been made for a function of the W-shape: (1) camouflaging the eye; (2) providing distance information. Since neither of these suggestions can fully explain the function of this pupil across the entire visual field, particularly the frontal and caudal periphery, we re-addressed the question of its functional significance. We took infra-red images of the eyes of live S. officinalis at different light intensities and from different viewing angles. This allowed us to determine the shape and light-admitting area of the pupil for different parts of the visual field. Our data show that the W-shaped pupil projects a blurred \"W\" directly onto the retina and that it effectively operates as vertical slits for the frontal and caudal parts of the visual field. We also took images of the natural habitat of S. officinalis and calculated the average vertical brightness distribution in the visual habitat. Computing a retinal illumination map shows that the W-shaped pupil is effective in balancing a vertically uneven light field: The constricted pupil reduces light from the dorsal part of the visual field significantly more than it reduces light from the horizontal band. This will cut the amount of direct sunlight that is scattered by the lens and ocular media, and thus improve image contrast particularly for the dimmer parts of the scene. We also conclude that the pupil provides even attenuation along the horizontal band, whereas a circular pupil would attenuate the image relatively more in the important frontal and caudal periphery of the visual field.",

Here, the wavelength-dependent splitting of a light beam into two by asymmetrically filled slits in a metal film using intraslit and interslit dual-wave interferences is fully explored. We consider a triple-slit structure perforated on a gold film, where the middle slit is used for the surface-plasmon (SP) excitation by a narrow Gaussian beam while the two side slits are used for the detection of a transmitted SP wave propagated from the middle opaque slit either at a particular wavelength or at double that wavelength, respectively. For this proposed simple structure, we show that only one of the two side observation slits can be in a passing state for a particular wavelength, but the other blocked slit will change to a passing state at double that wavelength with a specific design for the slit depth, slit dielectric, and interslit distance in the deep subwavelength regime. In this sense, SP mediated light transmission becomes wavelength sensitive in our model, and a single light beam can be separated into two according to its wavelength in the transverse direction parallel to the array. This provides us with a unique way for direct optical reading in the near-field region using a nonspectroscopic approach.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Population analysis.\nThe colour of an object is changed by surround colours so that the perceived colour is shifted in a direction complementary to the surround colour. To investigate the physiological mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we recorded from 260 neurons in the parvo-cellular lateral geniculate nucleus (P-LGN) of anaesthetized monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), and measured their responses to 1.0-2.0 degrees diameter spots of equiluminant light of various spectral composition, centered over their receptive field (spectral response function, SRF). Five classes of colour opponent neurons and two groups of light inhibited cells were distinguished following the classification proposed by Creutzfeldt et al. (1979). In each cell we repeated the SRF measurement while an outer surround (inner diameter 5 degrees, outer diameter 20 degrees) was continuously illuminated with blue (452 nm) or red (664 nm) light of the same luminance as the center spots. The 1.0-1.5 degree gap between the center and the surround was illuminated with a dim white background light (0.5-1cd/m2). During blue surround illumination, neurons with an excitatory input from S- or M-cones (narrow- and wide-band/short-wavelength sensitive cells, NS- and WS-cells, respectively) showed a strong attenuation of responses to blue and green center spots, while their maintained discharge rate (MDR) increased. During red surround illumination the on-minus-off-responses of NS- and WS-cells showed a clear increment. L-cone excited WL-cells (wide-band/long-wavelength sensitive) showed a decrement of on-responses to red, yellow and green center spots during red surround illumination and, in the majority, also an increment of MDR. The response attenuation of narrow-band/long-wave-length sensitive (NL)-cells was more variable, but their on-minus-off-responses were also clearly reduced in the average during red surrounds. Blue surround illumination affected WL-cell responses little and less consistently than those of NL-cells, but often broadened the SRF also in the WL-cells towards shorter wavelengths. The M-cone excited and S-cone suppressed WM-cells were strongly suppressed by blue but only little affected by red surround illumination. The changes of spectral responsiveness came out clearly in the group averages of the different cell classes, but showed some variation between individual cells in each group. The zero-crossing wavelengths derived from on-minus-off-responses were also characteristically shifted towards wavelengths complementary to those of the surround.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

This paper deals with the changes that must be made to prepare the slit lamp for documenting squint. To achieve this goal we propose: 1. Changes in the observation system: minus lenses in front of the objective of the slit lamp to achieve a sharp image of both eyes (eg, -8 diopters [dpt] if the patient sits at a distance of 50 cm). 2. Changes in the illumination system: minimizing the narrowed angle between illumination and observation axis by holding a \"recentration\" prism of 14 dpt horizontally in front of the slit light. This procedure creates equally sufficient illumination of the patient's face and central corneal reflexes. 3. Recording clinical findings with a digital recorder. This enables us to identify binocular eye positions, which sometimes last only part of a second, eg, in latent or intermittent strabism. 4. Visualizing clinical findings by using Microsoft PowerPoint® to build up 9-gaze composites or adjust corneal reflexes on subsequent foils. Changes in binocular eye positions (eg, after surgery, but also during diagnostic covering) can be made visible by flickering between the foils to compare.",

The EVLC procedure was carried out on 22 surface veins of six sheep. The radiation source was a diode-pumped solid-state laser, which was based on a LiYF<sub4</sub:Tm crystal and had an emission wavelength of 1910 nm and a maximum output power of 10 W. Two types of optical fibers were used: (1) bare tip and (2) radial or radial with two rings. Histological and morphometric methods were used, and the statistical digital data were analyzed. The use of a linear endovenous energy density of 20 J/cm and optical bare fibers for veins with diameters of 3-4 mm resulted in a slit-shaped or wide venous wall perforation. A thermal effect was observed on the perivenous connective tissue (PVCT), which caused damage to its structures. Wide perforations were accompanied by complete destruction of the PVCT in the projection of the formed defect. The distance between the remaining vein wall fragment, located opposite to the perforation, and injured small vessels was 257.7 ± 23.6 μm. The radius of thermal damage increased to 2073.5 ± 8.0 μm near the vessel perforation. Using optical radial fibers for veins with diameters of 3.9 ± 0.5 mm did not lead to perforations. The destructive effect of the laser on small vessels of the PVCT extended to a distance of 425.7 ± 22.0 μm. Analysis of thermal vessel damage in perivenous tissue after EVLC with bare-tip fiber shows that in the projection of a wide perforation, the damaged vessels of the PVCT are located at a large distance from the coagulated vein wall. On the opposite side of the perforation, the distance from the coagulated vein wall to the damaged vessels of the PVCT is significantly reduced because of the minimal output of laser radiation energy through the poorly damaged part of the wall. Using an optical radial fiber facilitates the application of a uniform distribution of thermal energy to the vein wall and damage to all its layers; at the same time, it minimizes the thermal energy that extends beyond the vein wall and damages the surrounding tissue. The use of radiation with a wavelength of 1910 nm will make it possible to carry out endovenous laser coagulation of varicose veins at lower power values compared with radiation in the micron and one and a half micron regions of the spectrum. Understanding of morphological changes of veins and perivenous tissues after endovenous laser coagulation with 1910-nm laser radiation and different types of optical fibers (bare-tip, radial, radial 2ring) help predict possible complications and reduce their rate.",

Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives. Cs and CD measurements were obtained from the left carotid artery. A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV. The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories. Study results demonstrated that the proposed approach has a potential to provide valuable surrogate markers for cardiovascular risk assessment.",

An increasing body of evidence supports a beneficial effect of PBM in retinal disorders. To date, most studies have utilized light-emitting diode irradiation sources. Slit-lamp-mounted retinal lasers produce a coherent beam that can be delivered with precisely defined dosages and predetermined target area; however, the use of retinal lasers raises safety concerns that warrant investigation prior to clinical application. In this study, we determined safe dosages of laser-delivered PBM to the retina. A custom-designed, slit-lamp-delivered, 670-nm, red/near-infrared laser was used to administer a range of irradiances to healthy pigmented and non-pigmented rat retinas. The effects of PBM on various functional and structural parameters of the retina were evaluated utilizing a combination of electroretinography, Spectral Domain Optical Coherence (SD-OCT), fluorescein angiography, histology and immunohistochemistry. In non-pigmented rats, no adverse events were identified at any irradiances up to 500 mW/cm<sup2</sup. In pigmented rats, no adverse events were identified at irradiances of 25 or 100 mW/cm<sup2</sup; however, approximately one-third of rats that received 500 mW/cm<sup2</sup displayed very localized photoreceptor damage in the peripapillary region, typically adjacent to the optic nerve head. A safety threshold exists for laser-delivered PBM in pigmented retinas and was identified as 500 mW/cm<sup2</sup irradiance; therefore, caution should be exercised in the dosage of laser-delivered PBM administered to pigmented retinas. This study provides important data necessary for clinical translation of laser-delivered PBM for retinal diseases.",

The intersection of the laser slit with the ocular structures was viewed at an angle, as in conventional slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The instrument was used to examine patients with idiopathic macular holes or cysts.

These advantages allowed for visualization of fine retinal structures that are difficult to detect with conventional slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The findings in patients with idiopathic macular hole demonstrated that the operculum was located approximately 500 micron(s) anterior to the surrounding retina and moved minimally.

The scanning mirror, which is supported on pivots inside a helical coil, deflects the spectrum through an angle of approximately 90 degrees onto the exit slit. When a capacitor is discharged through the coil, the resulting magnetic field spins the aluminum mirror causing the spectrum to move across the exit slit. The wavelength calibration signal generator produces a series of electrical pulses as the scanning mirror turns, permitting wavelength calibration when the pulses are displayed below the spectrometer signal on a dual beam oscilloscope.

The enhancement and suppression zones were determined by a dual-stimulus technique where a stationary flashing light slit produced activity against which activation profiles across the receptive field were plotted with a parallel stationary test slit. The activation profiles showed less variation in receptive field configuration than plots of on- and off-discharge zones. Whereas the number of on- and off-zones varied between one and five, the activation profiles showed at least three distinct subregions in the receptive field, i.e. a central zone with an adjacent oppositely responding zone on each side. The responsivity was clearly stronger in one of these proximal flank zones. An additional zone occurred distal to the strong proximal flank zone in 53% of the cells, and in 10% such a distal zone occurred distal to both proximal flank zones. There was good correspondence between the location of on- and off-discharge zones and the location of the enhancement and suppression regions, although some subregions seen in the activation profiles did not appear in plots made with a single slit. The maximum discharge and the maximum enhancement and suppression effects in a subregion were found at the same receptive field location. The width of a subregion was measured as the width of the eventual on- or off-discharge zone determined with a single slit, as the width of the enhancement zone, and as the width of the suppression zone determined with the dual-slit technique. The enhancement zone was narrower, and the suppression zone wider than the discharge zone. The strong proximal flank zone had the same width as the central zone, but was wider than the weak proximal flank zone. For most cells the distances between successive extreme points across the activation profiles were constant, and this may explain the selectivity of the cells for spatial frequency of periodic stimuli. The strongest flank suppression occurred for most cells in that of the two proximal flank zones which had the strongest discharge to the single slit. Nevertheless, there was no correlation between the degree of discharge and the degree of suppression produced by opposite light cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The shifts of cavity resonance excitation result in higher transmittance through narrower slits at specific wavelengths and resonance modes are confirmed with the electromagnetic fields. Opposite roles possibly played by features in increasing or decreasing absorptance are determined by the feature position and demonstrated by Poynting vectors. Correlations among all responses of a representative slit array, the angle of incidence, and the slit density are also comprehensively studied.

By properly adjusting the resonance, this grating can be used as an integrated wavelength filter. We have produced an attenuation of 13.4 dB at 1562 nm with a FWHM of 3.45 nm.

The principal maxima created by the light passing through the target and the grating form distorted shapes of the target on the plane of the grating. Alignment can be achieved by displacing the grating in its plane to form a symmetric pattern of the (+/-m)-order principal maximum image of the target. The distance between the target and the reference grating, as well as the angle subtended by their planes, can be accurately estimated by the size and the distortion of the symmetric (+/-m)-order principal maximum image.

This method is, however, somewhat time-consuming, considering the time it often takes to locate a rod every time one switches between slit-lamps or slit-lamp-mounted lasers. In this article we present an alternative test, which we call the fading-slit test, that requires only a second to perform, does not involve additional equipment (such as a rod), and can be applied at any time during the slit-lamp examination. However, while the focusing-rod test determines what setting should be used, the fading slit test can verify only whether the current setting is indeed the correct one and, therefore, it is not a complete substitute for the focusing-rod test. The fading-slit test is performed as follows: while focusing on any approximately flat surface (even the center of the patient's dome-shaped cornea would do) and using oblique illumination, gradually reduce the slit width until it disappears. Pay attention to whether the slit continuously thins, reaching a hairline width prior to its disappearance or, alternatively, whether, just before disappearance, the slit remains somewhat wide, gradually fading away, instead of thinning away. In the former case the ocular setting is correct; in the latter case it is incorrect.",

Reflectance spectra were recorded from two patients with scleritis, three with non-scleritic red eyes and from two controls with non-inflamed eyes. Measurements were reproducible and demonstrated statistically significant differences in the spectral characteristics between the three groups. Spectra from scleritic eyes revealed a relative increase in intensity of long wavelength red light, 650-740 nm, compared with non-scleritic red eyes. These longer wavelengths will be appreciated as dark red. There was no increase in relative intensity in the blue part of the spectrum in scleritic eyes. Reproducible measurements of the eye were made using an innovative, slit-lamp mountable spectrometer and its functionality demonstrated by differentiating the spectra from eyes with differing pathologies. While intending only to illustrate one potential application; for the cases examined, our results indicate that inflamed scleritic eyes exhibit a longer wavelength red light with no increase in shorter wavelength blue light. Thus our measurements would seem to confirm that the perceived redness of scleritis differs from other red eyes. However, it is a deeper darker red and not a bluish one as traditionally described.",

In the visible spectral region, BEOT of TM-polarized light is achieved with up to 80% transmission at resonance, which is resulted from the simultaneous enhancement of zero-order slit resonance and higher-order slit resonances excited due to the existence of the substrate. The spectral range of BEOT is limited by Wood-Rayleigh anomalies and surface plasmon polariton resonances (SPPs). The BEOT spectrum of oblique incidence with small incident angle that is divided into two separate bands are also presented and analyzed theoretically. This metallic grating overcomes the low optical transmission limit of the structures with wavelength-sized grating period in visible and near-IR regions.

The design fills the smartphone sensor fully at the lowest magnification and matches the fixed focus of the slit-lamp. It comes with a smartphone for instant photo-documentation, an in-built software application for data-management and secure HIPAA compliant cloud storage, and a Bluetooth trigger for a one-tap image capture. The construction of the device is explained, and the optical resolution measured using U.S. air-force resolution test. AIM's performance was characterized with traceability to internationally relevant performance standards for digital slit-lamps after image quality assessment through a pilot study. Clinically useful anterior segment images were obtained with both diffuse and slit illumination at different magnification settings with the highest magnification (40X) resolution of 359 lines per cm and the lowest magnification (16X) resolution of 113 lines per cm. AIM is a novel, wireless, telemedicine-enabled design that digitizes existing, analog slit lamps with at least three-step magnification. The settings ensure the focus is determined purely by the position of the slit-lamp. Hence, the image viewed and captured on the smartphone is exactly what the clinician sees through the eyepiece.

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories.

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

To assess this possibility, this study calculates doses from alpha-particle emitters to the cells involved in trabecular bone turnover. Alpha-particle energy deposition in tissue from a bone surface source was calculated by Monte Carlo modeling. This was combined with bone surface cellular geometry to yield dose rates to cells during the remodeling cycle. Bone-resorbing osteoclasts receive on average 50 times the dose rate that bone-forming osteoblasts receive. Newly formed bone shields osteoblasts from alpha particles emitted by the buried deposit of alpha-particle emitters. However, at alpha-particle bone-seeking radionuclide intakes known to cause changes in remodeling (about 3700 Bq/kg body weight), the alpha-particle dose to osteoclasts corresponds to an extremely low rate of cell traversals (0.07% per cycle). It is therefore unlikely that perturbation of bone remodeling by alpha-particle bone-seeking radionuclides is directly caused by alpha-particle traversals of remodeling cells; some other indirect mechanism might be involved.",

A pool of total mass attenuation and energy absorption coefficients (for photons) and total mass stopping powers (for charged particles) for elements was constructed first. Then, a matrix of interaction cross sections for elements Z = 1-92 was constructed. Finally, effective atomic numbers were calculated for any material by interpolating adjacent cross sections through a linear logarithmic interpolation formula. The results for [Formula: see text] for photon interaction were compared with those calculated through Mayneord's formula, which suggests a single-valued [Formula: see text] for any material for low-energy photons for which photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction process. The single-valued [Formula: see text] was found to agree well with that obtained by other methods, in the low-energy region. In addition, [Formula: see text] values of various materials of biological interest were compared with those obtained experimentally at 59.54 keV. In general, the agreement between values calculated with Phy-X/ZeXTRa and Auto-Zeff and those measured were satisfactory. A comparison of [Formula: see text] values for photon energy absorption calculated with Phy-X/ZeXTRa and literature values for a nucleotide base, adenine, was made, and the relative difference (RD) in [Formula: see text] between Phy-X/ZeXTRa and literature values was found to be 2% &lt; RD &lt; 11%, at low photon energies (1-100 keV), while it was less than 1% at energies higher than 100 keV.

For electrons, corresponding RD(%) values in [Formula: see text] were found to be in the range 0.4 ≤ RD(%) ≤ 1.7, while for heavy charged particle interactions it was 2.4 ≤ RD(%) ≤ 4.2 for total proton interaction and 0 ≤ RD(%) ≤ 8 for total alpha particle interaction. In view of the importance of [Formula: see text] for identifying and differentiating tissues in diagnostic imaging as well as for estimating accurate dose in radiotherapy and particle-beam therapy, Phy-X/ZeXTRa could be used for fast and accurate calculation of [Formula: see text] in a wide energy range for both photon and charged particle (electrons, protons, alpha particles and C ions) interactions.",

Isolation and characterization of phycobilisome subassembly particles.\nSynechococcus 6301 mutant, strain AN112, produces phycobilisomes containing two major biliproteins, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, and two major linker polypeptides of 27 and 75 kilodaltons (27K and 75K). These phycobilisomes have a molecular weight of approximately 2.5 X 10(6) and are the smallest of these particles known to date. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of AN112 phycobilisomes partially dissociated in 50 mM N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]glycine, 5 mM CaCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.8, separated three distinct fractions: (1) free trimeric biliproteins, (2) hexameric complexes of phycocyanin with 27K (11 S particles), and (3) phycobilisome subassemblies equivalent in mass to approximately 25% of the intact phycobilisome (18 S particles). The 18 S particles contained equimolar amounts of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, which represented approximately 30 and 50%, respectively, of the content of these biliproteins in the AN112 phycobilisome. The 18 S particles also contained 75% and 100%, respectively, of 27K and 75K polypeptides; i.e. 75K was present in a 2-fold higher amount than in the intact phycobilisome. The absorption spectrum (lambda max 648 nm) of the 18 S particles was similar to that of allophycocyanin. Upon excitation at 580 nm, these particles exhibited a fluorescence emission spectrum consisting of 680 and 660 nm components, identical with that of intact phycobilisomes. The circular dichroism spectra of AN112 phycobilisomes and of the 18 S particles, in the region between 650 and 700 nm, were also very similar. Allophycocyanin B, which fluoresces at 680 nm, was found in fraction 1, and was totally absent from the 18 S particle. Thus, the long wavelength emission of the 18 S particle must have arisen from another terminal energy acceptor. The most probable candidate is the 75K polypeptide, which has been shown to carry a bilin chromophore and emit near 680 nm (Lundell, D. J., Yamanaka, G., and Glazer, A. N. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 91, 315-319). The 27K polypeptide, present in both fractions 2 and 3, was a component of different complexes in the two fractions. Fraction 2 displayed the physical and spectroscopic properties characteristic of the phycocyanin-linker complex, (alpha beta)6.27K. However, in the 18 S particle, 27K functioned in the assembly and attachment of phycocyanin trimers to a core domain. Based on the analysis of the components in fractions 1-3, a model is proposed which describes the structure of the AN112 phycobilisome, with emphasis on the roles of the linker polypeptides in the assembly of the core.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Since these equations written in spheroidal coordinates do not separate, no theoretical results exist for the low-frequency dielectric properties of suspensions of spheroidal particles. In order to sidestep this problem, we used another method which relates the dielectric properties to the energy stored in the system (Grosse, C., Ferroelectrics 86, 171 (1988)) which, at low frequencies, mainly corresponds to the Gibbs free energy associated to the field-induced electrolyte concentration changes outside the double layer (Grosse, C. and Shilov, V. N., J. Colloid Interface Sci. 193, 178 (1997)). This method permits us to calculate the static permittivity by solving a purely static problem, which makes it possible to calculate analytically the alpha-dispersion amplitude of suspensions of spheroidal particles since the electrodiffusion equations do separate in the static case. We also calculate the characteristic time of the alpha-dispersion from the dispersion amplitude and the static and high-frequency values of the dipolar coefficient. The analytical results obtained are presented and discussed for both prolate and oblate geometries, and for parallel, perpendicular, and random orientations of the particles with respect to the applied field.

Additionally, the potential use of alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides in radiotherapy is increasingly being explored. Within the body the emitted alpha particles slow down, traversing a number of cells with a range of energies and therefore with varying efficiencies at inducing biological response. The LET of the particle typically rises from between ~70-90 keV μm(-1) at the start of the track (depending on initial energy) to a peak of ~237 keV μm(-1) towards the end of the track, before falling again at the very end of its range. To investigate the variation in biological response with incident energy, a plutonium-238 alpha-particle irradiator was calibrated to enable studies with incident energies ranging from 4.0 MeV down to 1.1 MeV. The variation in clonogenic survival of V79-4 cells was determined as a function of incident energy, along with the relative variation in the initial yields of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) measured using the FAR assay. The clonogenic survival data also extends previously published data obtained at the Medical Research Council (MRC), Harwell using the same cells irradiated with helium ions, with energies ranging from 34.9 MeV to 5.85 MeV. These studies were performed in conjunction with cell morphology measurements on live cells enabling the determination of absorbed dose and calculation of the average LET in the cell. The results show an increase in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for cell inactivation with decreasing helium ion energy (increasing LET), reaching a maximum for incident energies of ~3.2 MeV and corresponding average LET of 131 keV μm(-1), above which the RBE is observed to fall at lower energies (higher LETs). The effectiveness of single alpha-particle traversals (relevant to low-dose exposure) at inducing cell inactivation was observed to increase with decreasing energy to a peak of ~68% survival probability for incident energies of ~1.8 MeV (average LET of 190 keV μm(-1)) producing ~0.39 lethal lesions per track. However, the efficiency of a single traversal will also vary significantly with cell morphology and angle of incidence, as well as cell type. ",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The use of alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides as radiolabels offers potential advantages over beta-particle sources. The short range in tissue (&lt; 100 microns) and the high linear energy transfer associated with alpha-particle emitters will result in a more concentrated deposition of energy at the site of radionuclide decay. Thus, if radiolabeled antibodies can be bound to malignant cells specifically, a high differential cell killing can be achieved between the malignant and the normal cells. However, the energy deposition pattern will be strongly dependent upon the configuration of alpha-particle sources relative to the cells, and will consequently impact upon the dose-response characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to study distributions of energy deposition from alpha-particle-emitting radioimmunoconjugates distributed uniformly and nonuniformly around cells through theoretical modeling. Energy deposition spectra for cell nuclei are calculated and used to estimate the survival fraction by a simple biological model. We show that survival curves resulting from nonuniform distributions of alpha-particle-emitting radiolabeled antibodies can depart significantly from the classical exponential survival model applied to external alpha-particle beams. The survival curves may have initial slopes much steeper than those produced by a uniform distribution of sources, and they may also depart from linearity. Furthermore, the results of the modelling indicate how survival curves are dependent on the cell and radiolabel spacing. The results from our model compare reasonably well with published experimental data and can be used to facilitate the design and interpretation of radiobiological experiments.",

Also, mean estimates of genetic correlation between METP with live weight (LW), feed intake (FI), and residual feed intake (RFI) were 0.719, 0.598, and 0.408, respectively. The genetic correlations of CO<sub2</sub with performance traits varied from 0.641 (with RFI) to 0.833 (with FI; p &lt; 0.05). This meta-analysis showed gas emission traits in sheep are under low-to-moderate genetic control.

Radiometals that home naturally to bone can be exploited for this purpose, and 223Ra (t(1/2)=11.4 days) recently has been studied for therapy of bone tumors in mice and rats. Actinium-225 (t(1/2)=10 days) is also an attractive radioisotope for endoradiotherapy. In a single decay of a 225Ac nucleus and its subsequent decay daughters, over 27 MeV ( approximately 90% of total energy) is released by sequential emission of four alpha particles, ranging in energy from 5.7 to 8.4 MeV. Although Ac3+ does not home naturally to bone, its parent radioisotope 225Ra (beta(-), t(1/2)=15 days) can be used as an in vivo source for 225Ac. Thus, injection of 225Ra takes advantage of the bone-homing properties of radium coupled with the significant amount of energy released from the 225Ac decay chain. Our data confirm that a large fraction of radium citrate injected intravenously into mice localizes rapidly in bone. Injected doses per gram (ID/g) for 225Ra range from 25% in skull to about 10% in sternum. Once deposited, the 225Ra remains in the bone with a biological half life of &gt;40 days. Furthermore, &gt;95% of the daughter radioisotope, 225Ac, is retained in the bone. However, a significant fraction of one of the daughter radioisotopes, 213Bi, is found in kidney. The biodistribution data indicate that 225Ra injection should be a powerful agent for killing cells associated with bone; however, the toxicity of this radioisotope which is similar to that of other alpha emitters limits the dose that can be tolerated.",

The analysis was limited to women for whom a radium body burden measurement had been obtained and who were married prior to age 45 (n = 603). Internal radiation dose to the ovary was calculated based on initial intakes of radium-226 and radium-228, average ovarian mass, number and energy of alpha particles emitted, fraction of energy absorbed within the ovary, effective retention integrals and estimated photon irradiation. Time between marriage and pregnancy, number of pregnancies and number of live births served as surrogates for fertility. Radiation appeared to have no effect on fertility at estimated cumulative ovarian dose equivalents below 5 Sv; above this dose, however, statistically significant declines in both number of pregnancies and live births were observed. These trends persisted after multivariable adjustment for potential confounding variables and after exclusion of subjects contributing a potential classification or selection bias to the study. Additionally, the high-dose group experienced fewer live births than would have been expected based on population rates. There were no differences in time to first pregnancy between high- and low-dose groups. These results are consistent with earlier studies of gamma-ray exposures and suggest that exposure to high doses of radiation from internally deposited radium reduces fertility rather than inducing sterility.",

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

Other pathologies are thought to be treatable through vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, inflammation or auto-immune diseases. However, the efficacy of the stimulation is not always optimal, partly due to the materials and the architecture of currently available electrodes. Standard electrodes, composed of metallic rings that stimulate the whole diameter of the nerve, are not adapted to experimentations involving spatial selectivity. Efficient and selective charge injection is usually difficult to achieve simultaneously, especially in experimental setups using rodents, due to the thin diameter of their VN. In this paper, we show that we can take advantage of the high charge injection property of conducting polymers to acutely stimulate the vagus nerve in rodents, using individual active electrodes with dimensions $725\\,\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}\\times \\,450\\,\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36).

These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure.

The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Computational models are particularly well suited for these investigations. The electric field can be accurately described by mathematical formalisms, and the population-based neural responses to the electrical stimulation can be investigated at resolutions well beyond those achievable by current state-of-the-art biological techniques. In this study, we used a biophysically-and morphologically-detailed RGC model to explore the ability of high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) to preferentially activate ON and OFF RGC subtypes, the two major information pathways of the retina. The performance of a wide range of electrical stimulation amplitudes (0 - $100~\\mu \\mathbf {A}$) and frequencies (1 - 10 kHz) on functionally-distinct RGC responses were evaluated.

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

However, restricted diffusion and exchange have opposite effects on the diffusion-weighted signal, which can lead to errors in parameter estimates. In this work, we propose a signal representation that incorporates the effects of both restricted diffusion and exchange up to second order in b-value and is compatible with gradient waveforms of arbitrary shape. The representation features mappings from a gradient waveform to two scalars that separately control the sensitivity to restriction and exchange. We demonstrate that these scalars span a two-dimensional space that can be used to choose waveforms that selectively probe restricted diffusion or exchange, eliminating the correlation between the two phenomena. We found that waveforms with specific but unconventional shapes provide an advantage over conventional pulsed and oscillating gradient acquisitions. We also show that parametrization of waveforms into a two-dimensional space can be used to understand protocols from other approaches that probe restricted diffusion and exchange. For example, we found that the variation of mixing time in filter-exchange imaging corresponds to variation of our exchange-weighting scalar at a fixed value of the restriction-weighting scalar. The proposed signal representation was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations in identical parallel cylinders with hexagonal and random packing as well as parallel cylinders with gamma-distributed radii.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

In this paper, we have developed a state-space framework to sequentially segment the carotid IM borders in each image throughout the cardiac cycle. In this framework, an ${\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{\\infty }}$ filter is used to solve the state-space equations, and a grayscale-derivative constraint snake is used to provide accurate measurements for the ${\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{\\infty }}$ filter. We have evaluated the performance of our approach by comparing our segmentation results to the manually traced contours of ultrasound image sequences of three synthetic models and 156 real subjects from four medical centers. The results show that our method has a small segmentation error (lumen intima, LI: 53 $\\pm\\, 67\\;{\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m; media-adventitia, MA: 57 $\\pm\\, 63\\;{\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m) for synthetic and real sequences of different image characteristics, and also agrees well with the manual segmentation (LI: bias = 1.44 ${\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m; MA: bias = $-$3.38 ${\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m).

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36).

The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset.

When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009±0.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01± 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician. In a cohort of 28 subjects with a history of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, we compared the PeriVib performance with two established threshold sensing systems: (1) a Biothesiometer device and (2) a tuning fork. We found that the sensation threshold estimated by PeriVib correlated well with the Biothesiometer ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.68) but less well with the tuning fork ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.15).

If this is the case, we should describe the relationship among proportions of face components quantitatively. This study aims to develop a mathematical model of facial proportions to provide a quantitative description of facial attractiveness. Furthermore, we expect that plastic surgeons can use models in clinical work to enhance communication efficiency between doctors and patients. Face alignment technique was used to analyse 5500 frontal faces with diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) to obtain the ratios among the nose length ($ {N}_{L} $), the nasal base width ($ N $), and the inner canthus width ($ {E}_{I} $). A mathematical model ($ {N}_{L}^{2} = a{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L}+b{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}N+cN\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L} $) was developed to describe the relationship among these proportions. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated the post-operative photos using Adobe Photoshop.

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles. As the FEV(1) quartile worsened (mean, 62%, 49%, 39%, and 27% predicted), functional residual capacity increased (144%, 151%, 164%, and 185% predicted), IC decreased (86%, 81%, 69%, and 60% predicted), and peak incremental cycle work rate decreased (66%, 55%, 50%, and 44% predicted); CWR endurance time was 9.7, 9.3, 8.2, and 7.3 min, respectively. During CWR exercise, as FEV(1) quartile worsened, peak minute ventilation ($$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e) and tidal volume (Vt) decreased, whereas an inflection or plateau of the Vt response occurred at a progressively lower $$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e (P &lt; .0005), similar percentage of peak $$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e (82%-86%), and similar Vt/IC ratio (73%-77%). Dyspnea intensity at this inflection point was also similar across quartiles (3.1-3.7 Borg units) but accelerated steeply to intolerable levels thereafter. Progressive reduction of the resting IC with increasing disease severity was associated with the appearance of critical constraints on Vt expansion and a sharp increase in dyspnea to intolerable levels at a progressively lower ventilation during exercise.",

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation. A first study ($\\mathrm{N}=30$) that focused on displaying cardiac activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort. A second study ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) that focused on respiratory activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort as well as two sub-components of the sense of embodiment. Interestingly, the user's actual breathing tended to synchronize with the simulated breathing, especially with the multi-sensory and haptic displays. A third study ($\\mathrm{N}=18$) that focused on the combination of cardiac and respiratory activity showed that combining both rendering techniques significantly enhances the sensation of effort.

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039 kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57 $\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mol}/{\\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30 000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

A pool of total mass attenuation and energy absorption coefficients (for photons) and total mass stopping powers (for charged particles) for elements was constructed first. Then, a matrix of interaction cross sections for elements Z = 1-92 was constructed. Finally, effective atomic numbers were calculated for any material by interpolating adjacent cross sections through a linear logarithmic interpolation formula. The results for [Formula: see text] for photon interaction were compared with those calculated through Mayneord's formula, which suggests a single-valued [Formula: see text] for any material for low-energy photons for which photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction process. The single-valued [Formula: see text] was found to agree well with that obtained by other methods, in the low-energy region. In addition, [Formula: see text] values of various materials of biological interest were compared with those obtained experimentally at 59.54 keV. In general, the agreement between values calculated with Phy-X/ZeXTRa and Auto-Zeff and those measured were satisfactory. A comparison of [Formula: see text] values for photon energy absorption calculated with Phy-X/ZeXTRa and literature values for a nucleotide base, adenine, was made, and the relative difference (RD) in [Formula: see text] between Phy-X/ZeXTRa and literature values was found to be 2% &lt; RD &lt; 11%, at low photon energies (1-100 keV), while it was less than 1% at energies higher than 100 keV. Highest [Formula: see text] values were observed at low photon energies, where photoelectric absorption dominates photon interaction. For electrons, corresponding RD(%) values in [Formula: see text] were found to be in the range 0.4 ≤ RD(%) ≤ 1.7, while for heavy charged particle interactions it was 2.4 ≤ RD(%) ≤ 4.2 for total proton interaction and 0 ≤ RD(%) ≤ 8 for total alpha particle interaction. In view of the importance of [Formula: see text] for identifying and differentiating tissues in diagnostic imaging as well as for estimating accurate dose in radiotherapy and particle-beam therapy, Phy-X/ZeXTRa could be used for fast and accurate calculation of [Formula: see text] in a wide energy range for both photon and charged particle (electrons, protons, alpha particles and C ions) interactions.",

Using the TOT technique, as a measure of energy loss instead of charge integration methods, significantly reduces the signal readout costs by combining the time and energy information. Therefore, this approach can potentially be utilized in J-PET tomograph which is built from plastic scintillators characterized by fast light signals. The drawback in adopting this technique lies in the non-linear correlation between input energy loss and TOT of the signal. The main motivation behind this work is to develop the relationship between TOT and energy loss and validate it by the J-PET tomograph setup. The experiment was performed using a <sup22</supNa beta emitter source placed in the center of the J-PET tomograph. This isotope produces photons of two different energies: 511 keV photons from the positron annihilation (direct annihilation or through the formation of a para-positronium atom or pick-off process of ortho-positronium atoms) and a 1275 keV prompt photon. This allows the study of the correlation between TOT values and energy loss for energy ranges up to 1000 keV. Since the photon interacts predominantly via Compton scattering inside the plastic scintillator, there is no direct information of the energy deposition. However, using the J-PET geometry, one can measure the scattering angle of the interacting photon. Since the <sup22</supNa source emits photons of two different energies, it is necessary to know unambiguously the energy of incident photons and their corresponding scattering angles in order to estimate energy deposition. In summary, this work presents a dedicated algorithm developed to tag photons of different energies and studying their scattering angles to calculate the energy deposition by the interacting photons. A new method was elaborated to measure the energy loss by photons interacting with plastic scintillators used in the J-PET tomograph. We find the relationship between the energy loss and TOT is non-linear and can be described by the functions TOT = A0 + A1 * ln(E <subdep</sub + A2) + A3 * (ln(E <subdep</sub + A2))<sup2</sup and TOT = A0 - A1 * A2[Formula: see text]. In addition, we also introduced a theoretical model to calculate the TOT as a function of energy loss in plastic scintillators. A relationship between TOT and energy loss by photons interacting inside the plastic scintillators used in J-PET scanner is established for a deposited energy range of 100-1000 keV.",

Three simulated [Formula: see text] mm[Formula: see text] cubic PMMA targets were irradiated by [Formula: see text]He or [Formula: see text]C ion beams with a spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) depth range of 60 mm; one target is homogeneous while the others include [Formula: see text] mm[Formula: see text] neutron capture inserts (NCIs) of pure [Formula: see text]B or [Formula: see text]Gd located at the distal edge of the SOBP. The arrival times of photons and neutrons entering a simulated [Formula: see text] mm[Formula: see text] ideal detector were recorded. A temporal mask of 50-60 ns was found to be optimal for maximising the discrimination of the photons resulting from the neutron capture by boron and gadolinium. A range of candidate detector and thermal neutron shielding materials were simulated, and detections meeting the proposed acceptance criteria (i.e. falling within the target energy window and arriving 60 ns post beam-off) were classified as true or false positives, depending on their origin. The ratio of true/false positives ([Formula: see text]) was calculated; for targets with [Formula: see text]B and [Formula: see text]Gd NCIs, the detector materials which resulted in the highest [Formula: see text] were cadmium-shielded CdTe and boron-shielded LSO, respectively. The optimal irradiation period for both carbon and helium ions was 1 µs for the [Formula: see text]B NCI and 1 ms for the [Formula: see text]Gd NCI.",

The purpose of this study is to determine the patient size dependent scanning parameters (kVp and mAs) for pediatric CT in two imaging cases: adipose imaging and iodinated blood imaging. Cylindrical soft-tissue phantoms of diameters between 10-25 cm were used to mimic patients of different ages from 0 to 15 y. For adipose imaging, a 5 mm diameter adipose sphere was assumed as an imaging target, while in the case of iodinated imaging, an iodinated blood sphere of 1 mm in diameter was assumed. By applying the geometry of a commercial CT scanner (GE Lightspeed VCT), simulations were carried out to calculate the detectability index, [Formula: see text], with tube potentials varying from 40 to 140 kVp. The optimal kVp for each phantom in each imaging case was determined such that the dose-normalized detectability index, [Formula: see text]dose, is maximized. With the assumption that the detectability index in pediatric imaging is required the same as in typical adult imaging, the value of mAs at optimal kVp for each phantom was selected to achieve a reference detectability index that was obtained by scanning an adult phantom (30 cm in diameter) in a typical adult CT procedure (120 kVp and 200 mAs) using a modeled energy-integrating system. For adipose imaging, the optimal kVps are 50, 60, 80, and 120 kVp, respectively, for phantoms of 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm in diameter. The corresponding mAs values required to achieve the reference detectability index are only 9%, 23%, 24%, and 54% of the mAs that is used for adult patients at 120 kVp, for 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm diameter phantoms, respectively. In the case of iodinated imaging, a tube potential of 60 kVp was found optimal for all phantoms investigated, and the mAs values required to achieve the reference detectability index are 2%, 9%, 37%, and 109% of the adult mAs. The results also indicate that with the use of respective optimal kVps, the photon-counting spectral system offers up to 30% higher [Formula: see text]dose than the modeled energy-integrating system for adipose imaging, and 70% for iodinated imaging.",

Monte Carlo (MC) tissue models combining varying levels of detail on different length scales are developed: microscopically-detailed regions of interest (&gt;1500 explicitly-modelled cells) are embedded in bulk tissue phantoms irradiated by photons (20 keV-1.25 MeV). Specific energy (z; energy imparted per unit mass) is scored in nuclei and cytoplasm compartments using the EGSnrc user-code egs_chamber; specific energy mean, [Formula: see text], standard deviation, [Formula: see text], and distribution, [Formula: see text], are calculated for a variety of macroscopic doses, D. MC-calculated [Formula: see text] are compared with normal distributions having the same mean and standard deviation. For  ∼mGy doses, there is considerable variation in energy deposition (microdosimetric spread) throughout a cell population: e.g. for 30 keV photons irradiating melanoma with 7.5 μm cell radius and 3 μm nuclear radius, [Formula: see text] for nuclear targets is [Formula: see text], and the fraction of nuclei receiving no energy deposition, f <subz=0</sub, is 0.31 for a dose of 10 mGy. If cobalt-60 photons are considered instead, then [Formula: see text] decreases to [Formula: see text], and f <subz=0</sub decreases to 0.036. These results correspond to randomly arranged cells with cell/nucleus sizes randomly sampled from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1 μm. If cells are arranged in a hexagonal lattice and cell/nucleus sizes are uniform throughout the population, then [Formula: see text] decreases to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for 30 keV and cobalt-60, respectively; f <subz=0</sub decreases to 0.25 and 0.000 94 for 30 keV and cobalt-60, respectively.

Bulk tissue dose differs from [Formula: see text] for nuclei (cytoplasms) by up to [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) across all cell/nucleus sizes, bulk tissues, and incident photon energies, considering a 50 mGy dose level.

In addition, numerical methods and Monte Carlo (MC) systems that did not exist at the time when air-kerma protocols were developed, are currently available. Calculations of the chamber-independent quantities required for the dosimetry of low- and medium-energy kV x rays were carried out using a consistent set of key data throughout the complete process. The quantities were based on MC calculations of a database for a dense grid of monoenergetic photons for different beam diameters and source-to-surface distances, followed by an averaging procedure to compute water/air energy-absorption coefficient ratios and backscatter factors for 342 experimental and calculated kV spectra. It was found that for a given HVL and field size the variation of backscatter factors for different kVs can be up to about 5%, a trend confirmed with independent calculations that shows the limitation of using only the HVL for the beam quality specification of kV x rays. Extensive tables as a function of beam quality in terms of kV and HVL were developed for configurations that might be encountered in clinical practice; the data are also available in the form of a GUI web app at http://52.233.195.208.

The purpose of this study is to address the limitations of the conversion method with respect to atomic number (Z) by elucidating the role of partial photon interactions in the ΔHU-ρe conversion process. The authors performed numerical analyses of the ΔHU-ρe conversion for 105 human body tissues, as listed in ICRU Report 46, and elementary substances with Z = 1-40. Total and partial attenuation coefficients for these materials were calculated using the XCOM photon cross section database. The effective x-ray energies used to calculate the attenuation were chosen to imitate a dual-source CT scanner operated at 80-140 kV/Sn under well-calibrated and poorly calibrated conditions. The accuracy of the resultant calibrated electron density,[Formula: see text], for the ICRU-46 body tissues fully satisfied the IPEM-81 tolerance levels in radiotherapy treatment planning. If a criterion of [Formula: see text]ρe - 1 is assumed to be within ± 2%, the predicted upper limit of Z applicable for the ΔHU-ρe conversion under the well-calibrated condition is Z = 27. In the case of the poorly calibrated condition, the upper limit of Z is approximately 16. The deviation from the ΔHU-ρe linearity for higher Z substances is mainly caused by the anomalous variation in the photoelectric-absorption component. Compensation among the three partial components of the photon interactions provides for sufficient linearity of the ΔHU-ρe conversion to be applicable for most human tissues even for poorly conditioned scans in which there exists a large variation of effective x-ray energies owing to beam-hardening effects arising from the mismatch between the sizes of the object and the calibration phantom.",

Interestingly, at certain polarization/helicity angles or certain photon energy, 100% spin polarized current can be achieved by either linearly or elliptically polarized light.

The time evolution of the fluctuation component of the magnetic field, i.e., the small-scale field, is described by the Kazantsev equation. We solve this linear differential equation for its eigenvalues with the quantum-mechanical WKB approximation. The validity of this method is estimated as a function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. We calculate the minimal magnetic Reynolds number for dynamo action, Rm_{crit}, using our model of the turbulent velocity correlation function. For Kolmogorov turbulence ([symbol see text] = 1/3), we find that the critical magnetic Reynolds number is Rm(crit) (K) ≈ 110 and for Burgers turbulence ([symbol see text] = 1/2) Rm(crit)(B) ≈ 2700. Furthermore, we derive that the growth rate of the small-scale magnetic field for a general type of turbulence is Γ proportional Re((1-[symbol see text])/(1+[symbol see text])) in the limit of infinite magnetic Prandtl number. For decreasing magnetic Prandtl number (down to Pm &gt;/~ 10), the growth rate of the small-scale dynamo decreases.

Some of them assign the difference in response to the mass density, or to the electron density, of the sensitive detector material relative to that of water. This work analyses the role of the mass and electron density ([Formula: see text]), density effect (δ) and mean excitation energy (I-value) of some detector materials in a 6 MV photon beam of 0.5 cm radius, its rationale being that the response of a detector depends critically on the stopping-power ratio detector-to-water. The influence on the detector response of volume scaling by electron density, and of electron single and multiple scattering, is also investigated. Detector materials are water, diamond and silicon, and additional materials are included for consistency in the analysis. A detailed analysis on the ([Formula: see text]) dependence of stopping-power ratios shows that the density effect δ depends both on the electron density and on the I-value of the medium, but not on the mass density ρ alone as is usually assumed. This leads to a double dependence of stopping-power ratios on the I-value and questions the adequacy of a 'density perturbation factor' or of common interpretations of detector response in terms of ρ alone. Differences in response can be described in terms of the variation of stopping power ratios detector-to-water, mainly due to different I-values and to a lesser extent to different values of electron density. It is found that at low energies the trend of Monte Carlo-calculated electron fluence spectra inside the detector materials depends solely on their I-values. No dependence on mass density or density effect alone is observed at any energy. The trend of restricted-cema ratios to water (as a substitute of absorbed dose ratios) follows that of stopping-power ratios at 1 MeV, the most probable energy of differential restricted-cema distributions in this study. It is concluded that the combined effect of the I-value and the dependence of δ on [Formula: see text] governs the restricted-cema values, and that neither ρ or a [Formula: see text] alone explain the different response of diverse detector materials. The results show that, for the small non-scaled and scaled volumes in this work, [Formula: see text] is practically constant and that in both cases the contribution of electron scattering to the restricted-cema values is about 2%.",

Results showed that the [Formula: see text] coefficient is high for phosphor grains in the submicron scale and for low light wavelengths.

It provides precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strange B meson (B(s)(0)) and the B0 meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (μ+ and μ−) are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the standard model. The standard model predicts that the B(s)(0) →µ+µ− and B(0) →µ+µ− decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B0 mesons. A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN started operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model predictions. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from proton–proton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts. Here we report the first observation of the B(s)(0) → µ+µ− decay, with a statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement so far of its branching fraction. Furthermore, we obtained evidence for the B(0) → µ+µ− decay with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. Both measurements are statistically compatible with standard model predictions and allow stringent constraints to be placed on theories beyond the standard model. The LHC experiments will resume taking data in 2015, recording proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 teraelectronvolts, which will approximately double the production rates of B(s)(0) and B0 mesons and lead to further improvements in the precision of these crucial tests of the standard model.",

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent.

The interplay of crystallographic site and charge state in Si and Ge at high temperatures, or under illumination, reflects the capture and loss of charge carriers that should model the electrical activity of monatomic hydrogen but still challenges theoretical descriptions. Spin-flip scattering of conduction electrons by the paramagnetic centres is revealed in heavily doped n-type material, as well as some modification of the local electronic structures. The corresponding spectroscopy for the solid elements of Groups III, V and VI is rather less well known and is reviewed here for the first time; a good deal of previously unpublished data is also included. Theoretical expectations and computational modelling are sparse, here. Recent results for B suggest a relatively shallow centre with molecular character; P and As show deeper quasi-atomic states, but still with substantial overlap of spin density onto surrounding host atoms. Particular attention is paid to the chalcogens. Muonium centres in Te show charge-state transitions already around room temperature; the identification of those in S and Se has been complicated by unusual spin dynamics of a different character, here attributed to spin-orbit coupling and interstitial reorientation.In the metals and semimetals, muonium is not formed as a paramagnetic centre. Here the implanted muons mimic interstital protons and interest shifts to a variety of other topics, including aspects of charge screening (α-Sn, Sb, Bi), site preference and quantum mobility (Al, β-Sn, Pb). The post-transition metals receive only a brief mention, by way of contrast with the nonmetals. Systematic studies of local susceptibility via measurements of muon Knight shifts extends in favourable cases to revealing the elusive high-field Condon domains (Al, Sn, Pb, Bi). Some new information is available on the superconducting phases.Appendices include a derivation of the spin Hamiltonian for paramagnetic muonium centres or molecular radicals having varying admixtures of orbital angular momentum, including the extreme case of orbital degeneracy, and examine the consequences of significant spin-orbit coupling for μSR spectroscopy and muon spin relaxation. This is the framework for the tentative assignments made here for the muonium defect centres formed in sulphur and selenium, namely diatomic species resembling the chalcogen monohydrides.

Chem. Chem. Phys., 2014, 16, 6602]. In the present report, the capacity of the positively charged muon in forming its own AIM is considered in a large set of molecules replacing muons with all protons in the hydrides of the second and third rows of the Periodic Table. Accordingly, in a comparative study the wavefunctions of both sets of hydrides and their muonic congeners are first derived beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) paradigm, assuming protons and muons as quantum waves instead of clamped particles. Then, the non-BO wavefunctions are used to derive the AIM structures of both hydrides and muonic congeners within the context of the multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results of the analysis demonstrate that muons are generally capable of forming their own atomic basins and the properties of these basins are not fundamentally different from those AIM containing protons. Particularly, the bonding modes in the muonic species seem to be qualitatively similar to their congener hydrides and no new bonding model is required to describe the bonding of muons to a diverse set of neighboring atoms. All in all, the positively charged muon is similar to a proton from the structural and bonding viewpoint and deserves to be placed in the same box of hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This conclusion is in line with a large body of studies on the chemical kinetics of the muonic molecules portraying the positively charged muon as a lighter isotope of hydrogen. ",

Chem. 2014, 126, 13925-13929] further demonstrates that upon replacing a proton with a positively charged muon, as the lightest radioisotope of hydrogen, radical changes in the nature of the structure and bonding of certain species may take place. The present report is a primary attempt to introduce another example of structural transformation on the basis of the malonaldehyde system. Accordingly, upon replacing the proton between the two oxygen atoms of malonaldehyde with the positively charged muon a serious structural transformation is observed. By using the ab initio nuclear-electronic orbital non-Born-Oppenheimer procedure, the nuclear configuration of the muon-substituted species is derived. The resulting nuclear configuration is much more similar to the transition state of the proton transfer in malonaldehyde rather than to the stable configuration of malonaldehyde. The comparison of the \"atoms in molecules\" (AIM) structure of the muon-substituted malonaldehyde and the AIM structure of the stable and the transition-state configurations of malonaldehyde also unequivocally demonstrates substantial similarities of the muon-substituted malonaldehyde to the transition state.

This exotic atom can be considered as a second radioisotope of hydrogen, along with tritium. Addition of this light atom (with a mass 1/9th that of a normal hydrogen, protium, atom) to unsaturated organic molecules forms free radicals, in which the muon serves as a radioactive and magnetic probe of their kinetic and structural properties. Suitable examples are chosen to illustrate the very large functionality of organic radicals which have been measured using muons and various methods of muSR, where mu stands for muon, S for spin and R may refer to rotation, resonance or relaxation. The principal techniques illustrated are transverse-field muon spin rotation (TF-muSR), avoided level crossing muon spin resonance (ALC-muSR) and longitudinal-field muon spin relaxation (LF-muSRx). Structural studies of radicals, the determination of mechanisms for radical formation, the measurement of radical stabilisation energies, the determination of the kinetics of reactions of free muonium atoms and of free radicals have all been accomplished using TF-muSR methods. It is further shown that TF-muSR is most useful in measuring radical reaction rates in non-aqueous media, to provide information of relevance to cell membrane damage and repair Muonium may further be used as a mechanistic probe since it determines a true pattern of H-atom reactivity in molecules, against which results from similar radiolysed materials may be compared. [In many solid materials that are exposed to ionising radiation, apparent H-atom adduct radicals are detected but which originate from charge-neutralisation of positive holes (radical cations) and ejected electrons, without free H-atoms being formed. DNA is the superlative example of this. Free H-atoms normally feature in the province of radiolysed aqueous media]. The applications of ALC-muSR and LF-muSRx in studying the reorientation of reactive radicals on reactive surfaces forms the substantive proportion of the review: considered specifically are radicals sorbed in zeolites, in clays and in porous silica, in porous carbons and on ice-surfaces, in connection with their role as intermediates in catalytic systems, particularly hydrocarbon cracking and oxidation processes, and in atmospheric aerosol chemistry. The formation of muonium and other muon species in cation-exchanged zeolite-X samples are also considered, according to the evidence of longitudinal field repolarisation measurements.

It has been found that for an atom with N electrons the total electron energy equation E=-(Z(eff))(2)e(4)m/(2n(2)Planck's(2)N) is more appropriate for energy calculation than standard quantum mechanical expressions. It means that the value of L of each electron is independent of the presence of other electrons in an atom and correlates well to the properties of virtual photons emitted by the nucleus and creating a trap for electrons. The energies for elements of the 1st up to the 5th rows and their ions (total amount 240) of Mendeleev' Periodical table were calculated consistent with the experimental data (deviations in average were 5 x 10(-3)). The obtained equations can be used for electron dynamics calculations in molecules.

They were studied by forming the analogous muonium adducts because muonium (Mu) behaves as a light isotope of hydrogen, and muoniated species can be characterized by muon spin spectroscopy (μSR). Two techniques were employed: transverse-field muon spin rotation (TF-μSR) and muon level-crossing resonance (μLCR), which allow for the measurement of muon hyperfine constants (hfcs) and other nuclear hfcs, respectively, and thus aid identification of the formed radicals. TF-μSR has already been used to determine that two radicals are formed by Mu addition to 1,1-dimethylallene, but μLCR techniques were undeveloped at the time of that study, so assignments were based on electron spin resonance (ESR) data of similar allyl and vinyl radicals. We report here the μSR of multiple radicals detected from positive muon irradiation of 1,1-dimethylallene and 1-methoxyallene in solution. The radicals were identified by comparison of muon and proton hfcs with ESR data and the results of density functional theory calculations.

In these effective equations, a non-Coulombic potential is added to the orthodox coulomb and exchange potential energy terms, which describes the interaction of the muon and the electrons effectively and is optimized during the self-consistent field cycles. While in the two-component HF equations a muon is treated as a quantum particle, in the effective HF equations it is absorbed into the effective potential and practically transformed into an effective potential field experienced by electrons. The explicit form of the effective potential depends on the nature of muon's vibrations and is derivable from the basis set used to expand the muonic spatial orbital. The resulting effective Hartree-Fock equations are implemented computationally and used successfully, as a proof of concept, in a series of muonic molecules containing all atoms from the second and third rows of the Periodic Table. To solve the algebraic version of the equations muon-specific Gaussian basis sets are designed for both muon and surrounding electrons and it is demonstrated that the optimized exponents are quite distinct from those derived for the hydrogen isotopes. The developed effective HF theory is quite general and in principle can be used for any muonic system while it is the starting point for a general effective electronic structure theory that incorporates various types of quantum correlations into the muonic systems beyond the HF equations.",

Theoretical understanding of the structure and properties of resulting muonic species requires accurate and efficient quantum mechanical computational methodologies. In this paper, the two-component density functional theory (TC-DFT), as a first principles method, which treats electrons and the positive muon on an equal footing as quantum particles, is introduced and implemented computationally. The main ingredient of this theory, apart from the electronic exchange-correlation functional, is the electron-positive muon correlation functional that is foreign to the purely electronic DFT. A Wigner-type local electron-positive muon correlation functional, termed eμc-1, is proposed in this paper and its capability is demonstrated through its computational application to a benchmark set of muonic organic molecules. The TC-DFT equations containing eμc-1 are not only capable of predicting the muon's binding site correctly, but they also reproduce muon's zero-point vibrational energies and the muonic densities much more accurately than the TC-DFT equations lacking eμc-1. Thus, this study sets the stage for developing accurate electron-positive muon functionals, which can be used within the context of the TC-DFT to elucidate the intricate interaction of the positive muon with complex molecular systems.",

Accordingly, the \"atoms in molecules\" analysis performed on various asymmetric exotic isotopomers of the hydrogen molecule, recently detected experimentally [Science, 2011, 331, 448], demonstrates that both the exotic isotopes are capable of forming atoms in molecules and retaining the identity of hydrogen atoms. Various derived properties of atomic basins containing the muonic helium cast no doubt that apart from its short life time, it is a heavier isotope of hydrogen while the properties of basins containing the positively charged muon are more remote from those of the orthodox hydrogen basins, capable of appreciable donation of electrons as well as large charge polarization. However, with some tolerance, they may also be categorized as hydrogen basins though with a smaller electronegativity.

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO).

CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

The intestinal absorption of the anthocyanins of red grape juice seemed to be improved compared to red wine, suggesting a possible synergistic effect of the glucose content of the juice. The improved absorption resulted in an enhanced plasmatic bioactivity.",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean (±standard deviation) ages: 47.4 ± 9.5 years). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed on the 10-item CES-D to test four model fits: (a) unidimensional model, (b) two-factor correlated model, (c) three-factor correlated model, and (d) second-order factor model. The diagonal-weighted least-squares estimator was used, as it is commonly applied to latent variable models with ordered categorical variables.

The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors. To account for this, this work proposes a sensor interface with $\\mathrm {C}_{P}$ canceller. By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface. The proposed force sensor offers great potential for real-time force monitoring of cardiovascular surgery.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

In striatum of PD monkey, two types of neurons were detected with mean amplitude of $102 \\mu \\mathrm{V}$ and $296 \\mu \\mathrm{V}$ respectively; the mean firing rate was 62 Hz significantly higher than that in normal monkey; as for one representative type of neurons, with respect to local field potential oscillating at a period in cortex, local field potential continuously oscillated in striatum at low frequency at the range of 4-7Hz which was constituent with neuronal burst firing rate, while single neuron discharged at the range of 10-32Hz, almost at beta frequencies. Abnormal neural information detection by microelectrode arrays with ifferent signals in different position will play an important role in target location in brain of PD patients, especially for treatment.",

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

Computational models are particularly well suited for these investigations. The electric field can be accurately described by mathematical formalisms, and the population-based neural responses to the electrical stimulation can be investigated at resolutions well beyond those achievable by current state-of-the-art biological techniques. In this study, we used a biophysically-and morphologically-detailed RGC model to explore the ability of high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) to preferentially activate ON and OFF RGC subtypes, the two major information pathways of the retina. The performance of a wide range of electrical stimulation amplitudes (0 - $100~\\mu \\mathbf {A}$) and frequencies (1 - 10 kHz) on functionally-distinct RGC responses were evaluated. We found that ON RGCs could be preferentially activated at relatively higher stimulation amplitudes $( &gt; 50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ and frequencies $( &gt;2$ kHz) while OFF RGCs were activated by lower stimulation amplitudes (10 to $50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ across all tested frequencies. These stimuli also show great promise in eliciting RGC responses that parallel RGC encoding: one RGC type exhibited an increase in spiking activity during electrical stimulation whilst another exhibited decreased spiking activity, given the same stimulation parameters.",

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity.

Furthermore, we expect that plastic surgeons can use models in clinical work to enhance communication efficiency between doctors and patients. Face alignment technique was used to analyse 5500 frontal faces with diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) to obtain the ratios among the nose length ($ {N}_{L} $), the nasal base width ($ N $), and the inner canthus width ($ {E}_{I} $).

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

The array is composed of 1600 cylindrical ionization chambers of 3.8 mm diameter, separated by 6.5 mm center-to-center spacing, in a 40 × 40 arrangement. The line spread function (LSF) of a single ion chamber in the detector was measured with a narrow slit collimator for a 6 MV photon beam. The 0.25 × 10 mm(2) slit was formed by two machined lead blocks. The LSF was obtained by laterally translating the detector in 0.25 mm steps underneath the slit over a range of 24 mm and taking a measurement at each step. This measurement was validated with Monte Carlo simulation using BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc. The presampling modulation transfer function (MTF), the Fourier transform of the line spread function, was determined and compared to calculated (Monte Carlo and analytical) MTFs. Two head-and-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields were measured using the device and were used to validate the LSF measurement. These fields were simulated with the BEAMnrc Monte Carlo model, and the Monte Carlo generated incident fluence was convolved with the 2D detector response function (derived from the measured LSF) to obtain calculated dose. The measured and calculated dose distributions were then quantitatively compared using χ-comparison criteria of 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement for in-field points (defined as those above the 10% maximum dose threshold). The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the measured detector response for a single chamber is 4.3 mm, which is comparable to the chamber diameter of 3.8 mm. The pre-sampling MTF was calculated, and the resolution of one chamber was estimated as 0.25 lp∕mm from the first zero crossing. For both examined IMRT fields, the χ-comparison between measured and calculated data show good agreement with 95.1% and 96.3% of in-field points below χ of 1.0 for fields 1 and 2, respectively (with an average χ of 0.29 for IMRT field 1 and 0.24 for IMRT field 2). The LSF for a new novel online detector has been measured at 6 MV using a narrow slit technique, and this measurement has been validated by Monte Carlo simulation. The detector response function derived from line spread function has been applied to recover measured IMRT fields. The results have shown that the device measures IMRT fields accurately within acceptable tolerance.",

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The size and position of the X-ray field, and its congruence with the corresponding light field, must be regularly tested for quality control. We propose a new method to estimate how far the x-ray field extends beyond the detector which does not require the use of external detectors. A metallic foil is inserted perpendicularly between the source and the detector. A slit camera, a linear extension of a pinhole camera, is used to project onto the detector the fluorescence X-rays emitted by the irradiated foil. The location where the fluorescence signal inside the camera vanishes is used to extrapolate the location of the field boundary. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the optimal composition and thickness of the foil. A prototype camera with a 1-mm-wide slit was built and tested in a clinical mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) system. The simulations estimated that a foil made of 25 µm of Molybdenum provided the maximum signal inside the camera for a 39 kVp beam. The boundary of the X-ray fields in mammography and DBT views were experimentally measured. With the camera along the chest wall side, the measured field in multiple DBT views had a variability of only 0.4 ± 0.1 mm compared to mammography. A difference in the measured boundary position of 2.4 and -1.0 mm was observed when comparing to measurements with a fluorescent ruler and self-developing film. The introduced technique provides a practical alternative method to detect the boundary of an X-ray field. The method can be combined with other testing methods to assess the congruence of the X-rays and light fields, and to determine if the X-ray field extends beyond the detector more than permitted.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

Common techniques for focal spot size measurements employ a pinhole camera, a slit camera, or a star resolution pattern. The coded aperture mask is a radiation collimator consisting of a large number of apertures disposed on a predetermined grid in an array, through which the radiation source is imaged onto a digital x-ray detector. The method of the coded mask camera allows one to obtain a one-shot accurate and direct measurement of the two dimensions of the focal spot (like that for a pinhole camera) but at a low tube loading (like that for a slit camera). A large number of small apertures in the coded mask operate as a \"multipinhole\" with greater efficiency than a single pinhole, but keeping the resolution of a single pinhole. X-ray images result from the multiplexed output on the detector image plane of such a multiple aperture array, and the image of the source is digitally reconstructed with a deconvolution algorithm. Images of the focal spot of a laboratory x-ray tube (W anode: 35-80 kVp; focal spot size of 0.04 mm) were acquired at different geometrical magnifications with two different types of digital detector (a photon counting hybrid silicon pixel detector with 0.055 mm pitch and a flat panel CMOS digital detector with 0.05 mm pitch) using a high resolution coded mask (type no-two-holes-touching modified uniformly redundant array) with 480 0.07 mm apertures, designed for imaging at energies below 35 keV. Measurements with a slit camera were performed for comparison. A test with a pinhole camera and with the coded mask on a computed radiography mammography unit with 0.3 mm focal spot was also carried out. The full width at half maximum focal spot sizes were obtained from the line profiles of the decoded images, showing a focal spot of 0.120 mm x 0.105 mm at 35 kVp and M = 6.1, with a detector entrance exposure as low as 1.82 mR (0.125 mA s tube load). The slit camera indicated a focal spot of 0.112 mm x 0.104 mm at 35 kVp and M = 3.15, with an exposure at the detector of 72 mR. Focal spot measurements with the coded mask could be performed up to 80 kVp. Tolerance to angular misalignment with the reference beam up to 7 degrees in in-plane rotations and 1 degrees deg in out-of-plane rotations was observed. The axial distance of the focal spot from the coded mask could also be determined. It is possible to determine the beam intensity via measurement of the intensity of the decoded image of the focal spot and via a calibration procedure. Coded aperture masks coupled to a digital area detector produce precise determinations of the focal spot of an x-ray tube with reduced tube loading and measurement time, coupled to a large tolerance in the alignment of the mask.",

The activation profiles showed less variation in receptive field configuration than plots of on- and off-discharge zones.

There was good correspondence between the location of on- and off-discharge zones and the location of the enhancement and suppression regions, although some subregions seen in the activation profiles did not appear in plots made with a single slit. The maximum discharge and the maximum enhancement and suppression effects in a subregion were found at the same receptive field location. The width of a subregion was measured as the width of the eventual on- or off-discharge zone determined with a single slit, as the width of the enhancement zone, and as the width of the suppression zone determined with the dual-slit technique. The enhancement zone was narrower, and the suppression zone wider than the discharge zone. The strong proximal flank zone had the same width as the central zone, but was wider than the weak proximal flank zone. For most cells the distances between successive extreme points across the activation profiles were constant, and this may explain the selectivity of the cells for spatial frequency of periodic stimuli. The strongest flank suppression occurred for most cells in that of the two proximal flank zones which had the strongest discharge to the single slit. Nevertheless, there was no correlation between the degree of discharge and the degree of suppression produced by opposite light cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Both the CL systems showed the CL spectra with maximum wavelength of 430 nm, suggesting that the emission was from the excite state of 3-aminophthalate ion. The TiO₂ photocatalytically induced luminol CL could be separately detected either when the pulse laser power was smaller than 0.15 mJ/pulse or a slit was placed beyond -2-2 mm in the vertical direction of the laser beam. The TiO₂ photocatalytically induced luminol CL intensity was linear to the laser power, while that of the 355 nm pulse laser-induced was nonlinear. A log-log plot between the 355 nm pulse laser-induced luminol CL intensity and laser power showed a near-linear regression fit with a slope of 2.11, suggesting that a two-photon absorption process of luminol was present in the 355 nm pulse laser-induced luminol CL.

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

This approach allows one to consider, for the first time, the transformation of the topograph's structure due to the two-dimensional slit sizes and the distance between the slit and the detector. The results are in good agreement with the results of other works and with the experimental data. This method of calculation does not require a supercomputer and it was performed on a standard laptop.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

Here, the wavelength-dependent splitting of a light beam into two by asymmetrically filled slits in a metal film using intraslit and interslit dual-wave interferences is fully explored. We consider a triple-slit structure perforated on a gold film, where the middle slit is used for the surface-plasmon (SP) excitation by a narrow Gaussian beam while the two side slits are used for the detection of a transmitted SP wave propagated from the middle opaque slit either at a particular wavelength or at double that wavelength, respectively. For this proposed simple structure, we show that only one of the two side observation slits can be in a passing state for a particular wavelength, but the other blocked slit will change to a passing state at double that wavelength with a specific design for the slit depth, slit dielectric, and interslit distance in the deep subwavelength regime. In this sense, SP mediated light transmission becomes wavelength sensitive in our model, and a single light beam can be separated into two according to its wavelength in the transverse direction parallel to the array. This provides us with a unique way for direct optical reading in the near-field region using a nonspectroscopic approach.",

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation.

The spectral resonance band position can be controlled mainly by nanoparticle composition, size, and geometry and is slightly influenced by the local refractive index of the near-field environment. Here we introduce another approach for tuning, based on interference modulation of the light scattered by the nanostructure. Thereby, the incoming electric field is wavelength-dependent modulated in strength and direction by interference due to a subwavelength spacer layer between nanoparticle and a gold film. Hence, the wavelength of the scattering maximum is tuned with respect to the original nanoparticle LSPR. The scattering wavelength can be adjusted by a metallic mirror layer located 100-200 nm away from the nanoparticle, in contrast to near-field gap mode techniques that work at distances up to 50 nm in the nanoparticle environment. Thereby we demonstrate, for the first time at the single nanoparticle level, that dependent on the interference spacer layer thickness, different distributions of the scattered signal can be observed, such as bell-shaped or doughnut-shaped point spread functions (PSF). The tuning effect by interference is furthermore applied to anisotropic particles (dimers), which exhibit more than one resonance peak, and to particles which are moved from air into the polymeric spacer layer to study the influence of the distance to the gold film in combination with a change of the surrounding refractive index.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

An overview of the required modifications is presented here together with a number of application examples. The accessible q range in a SAXS experiment is 0.009-0.3 A(-1) for the standard set-up but depends on the sample-to-detector distance, detector offset, beamstop size and wavelength. The SAXS camera has been designed to have a low background and has three collinear slit sets for collimating the incident beam. The standard beam size is about 0.37 mm x 0.37 mm (full width at half-maximum) at the sample position, with a flux of 4 x 10(10) photons s(-1) and lambda = 1.1 A. The vacuum is of the order of 0.05 mbar in the unbroken beam path from the first slits until the exit window in front of the detector. A large sample chamber with a number of lead-throughs allows different sample environments to be mounted. This station is used for measurements on weakly scattering proteins in solutions and also for colloids, polymers and other nanoscale structures. A special application supported by the beamline is the effort to establish a micro-fluidic sample environment for structural analysis of samples that are only available in limited quantities. Overall, this work demonstrates how a cost-effective SAXS station can be constructed on a multipurpose beamline.",

It is shown that the constraint of constant number of molecules leads to interesting effects which are absent when the slit is open and in contact with a reservoir. If the slit walls are identical, the density profiles at low temperatures or at high average densities rhoav of the fluid molecules in the slit have a sharp maximum in the middle of the slit, the value of the density at maximum being comparable to that of a liquid. The density of fluid at the walls is in this case comparable to the density of a vapor phase. At high temperatures or at low rhoav the fluid density in the middle of the slit is of the same order of magnitude as at the walls. For nonidentical walls the density maximum is shifted towards the wall with a stronger wall-fluid interaction. The transition between the two types (with and without the sharp maximum) of density profiles with the change of temperature in the slit occurs in a narrow range of temperatures, this range being larger for narrower slits. The pressures which the fluid exerts on the walls as well as the forces per unit area arising due to stresses in the sidewalls of the system can decrease with increasing rhoav. Such a behavior is not possible for homogeneous systems and can be explained by analyzing the fluid density at the walls when rhoav increases. The normal and transversal components of the pressure tensor were calculated as functions of the distance from the wall using the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and direct calculation of the forces between molecules, respectively. The normal component decreases with increasing distance near the wall in contrast to the normal component near the liquid-vapor interface reported previously in the literature. The behavior of the transverse component does not depend on the fluid-solid interaction and is comparable to that for a liquid-vapor interface.",

Our objective was to investigate associations between sub-daily exposures to PM and acute cardiac events using telemedicine data. We conducted a case-crossover study among telemedicine participants [Formula: see text] of age who called a service center for cardiac-related symptoms and were transferred to a hospital in Tel Aviv and Haifa, Israel (2002-2013). Ambient [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] measured by monitors located in each city during the hours before the patient called with symptoms were compared with matched control periods. We investigated the sensitivity of these associations to more accurate symptom onset time and greater certainty of diagnosis. We captured 12,661 calls from 7,617 subscribers experiencing ischemic (19%), arrhythmic (31%), or nonspecific (49%) cardiac events. PM concentrations were associated with small increases in the odds of cardiac events. For example, odds ratios for any cardiac event in association with a [Formula: see text] increase in 6-h and 24-h average [Formula: see text] were 1.008 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.998, 1.018] and 1.006 (95% CI: 0.995, 1.018), respectively, and for [Formula: see text] were 1.003 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.006) and 1.003 (95% CI: 1.000, 1.007), respectively.

A magnifier's field of view often contains only a few letters at a time. Page navigation is the process by which the reader moves the magnifier from word to word, and from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line. Page navigation takes time and reduces reading speed. The major questions addressed in this paper are: (1) What role does page navigation play in limiting reading speed? and (2) Are the window width requirements for reading (number of characters in the field for a criterion performance level) increased by the need for page navigation? We measured the reading speeds of three normal-vision and seven low-vision subjects in two ways: with drifting-text requiring no page navigation, and with a closed-circuit TV (CCTV) magnifier which required page navigation. We built special hardware to record the location of the CCTV's magnified field in the text. These recordings were used to separate forward-reading time (left-to-right movement through the text) from retrace time (navigational movement). For normal-vision subjects, forward-reading and retrace times were about equal. For low-vision subjects, retrace times were shorter than forward-reading times, indicating that the forward-reading performance was limited by visual, not navigational, demands. The retrace time did have an impact, however, ranging from 17 to 50% of the overall time. The window requirements for reading with page navigation (CCTV) were larger than those for reading without page navigation (drifting-text). The difference was more than a factor of three for normal-vision subjects and close to a factor of two for low-vision subjects (10 characters for CCTV vs 5.2 characters for drifting-text for 85% of maximum reading speed.",

Those methods usually rely on sparse random, importance, or worst-case sampling. Inevitably, this imposes a trade-off between computational speed and accuracy of the uncertainty propagation. Here, we investigate analytical probabilistic modeling (APM) as an alternative for uncertainty propagation and minimization in IMPT that does not rely on scenario sampling. APM propagates probability distributions over range and setup uncertainties via a Gaussian pencil-beam approximation into moments of the probability distributions over the resulting dose in closed form. It supports arbitrary correlation models and allows for efficient incorporation of fractionation effects regarding random and systematic errors. We evaluate the trade-off between run-time and accuracy of APM uncertainty computations on three patient datasets. Results are compared against reference computations facilitating importance and random sampling. Two approximation techniques to accelerate uncertainty propagation and minimization based on probabilistic treatment plan optimization are presented. Runtimes are measured on CPU and GPU platforms, dosimetric accuracy is quantified in comparison to a sampling-based benchmark (5000 random samples). APM accurately propagates range and setup uncertainties into dose uncertainties at competitive run-times (GPU [Formula: see text] min). The resulting standard deviation (expectation value) of dose show average global [Formula: see text] pass rates between 94.2% and 99.9% (98.4% and 100.0%). All investigated importance sampling strategies provided less accuracy at higher run-times considering only a single fraction. Considering fractionation, APM uncertainty propagation and treatment plan optimization was proven to be possible at constant time complexity, while run-times of sampling-based computations are linear in the number of fractions. Using sum sampling within APM, uncertainty propagation can only be accelerated at the cost of reduced accuracy in variance calculations. For probabilistic plan optimization, we were able to approximate the necessary pre-computations within seconds, yielding treatment plans of similar quality as gained from exact uncertainty propagation. APM is suited to enhance the trade-off between speed and accuracy in uncertainty propagation and probabilistic treatment plan optimization, especially in the context of fractionation. This brings fully-fledged APM computations within reach of clinical application.",

Maintaining common ground has a number of associated processes in which conversational participants engage. Many of these processes are lacking in current synthetic teammates, and it is unknown to what extent this lack of capabilities affects their ability to contribute during team-based tasks. We focused our research on how teams <ipackage</i information within a conversation, by which we mean specifically (1) whether information is explicitly mentioned or implied, and (2) how multiple pieces of information are ordered both within single communications and across multiple communications. We re-analyzed data collected from a simulated remotely-piloted aerial system (RPAS) task in which team members had to specify speed, altitude, and radius restrictions. The data came from three experiments: the \"speech\" experiment, the \"text\" experiment, and the \"evaluation\" experiment (which had a condition that included a synthetic teammate). We asked first whether teams settled on a specific routine for communicating the speed, altitude, and radius restrictions, and whether this process was different if the teams communicated in speech compared to text. We then asked how receiving special communication instructions in the evaluation experiment impacted the way the human teammates package information. We found that teams communicating in either speech or text tended to use a particular order for mentioning the speed, altitude, and radius. Different teams also chose different orders from one another. The teams in the evaluation experiment, however, showed unnaturally little variability in their information ordering and were also more likely to explicitly mention all restrictions even when they did not apply. Teams in the speech and text experiments were more likely to leave unnecessary restrictions unmentioned, and were also more likely to convey the restrictions across multiple communications. The option to converge on different packaging routines may have contributed to improved performance in the text experiment compared some of the conditions in the evaluation experiment.",

Distance and near reading speeds of 20 presbyopes (ages 40-60 years) were measured while viewing through artificial pupils (diameters 1-4.5 mm), natural pupils, or with a multifocal contact lens. Space-averaged text luminance levels varied from 0.14 to 140 cd/m2 (including the range of measured environmental text luminances). Adding black text to a white computer display or paper reduces luminance by approximately 15% to 31%, and the lowest encountered environmental text luminance was approximately 2 to 3 cd/m2. For both distance and near reading performance, the 2- to 3-mm small pupil yielded the best overall reading acuity for space-averaged text light levels ≥ 2 cd/m2. The 2- to 3-mm artificial pupils and the multifocal contact lenses both enabled maximum or near-maximum reading speeds for 0.5 logMAR characters at distance and near, but with natural pupils, reading speeds were significantly reduced at near. Although photon noise at low luminance reduces the visual benefits of small pupils, the benefits of 2- to 3-mm artificial pupils are sufficient to enable &gt;80% of distance-corrected presbyopes to read proficiently at near, even at the lowest text luminances found in interior environments.",

Predictors included age, gender, region of onset, symptom duration, weight at baseline, functional impairment, and estimated rate of functional loss. UMAP projection of patients showed an informative 2D data distribution. As limited data availability precluded complex model designs, the projection was divided into three zones defined by a functional impairment range probability. Zone membership allowed individual patient prediction.

Here, we reconstruct climatological [Formula: see text]O emissions from the ocean by training a supervised learning algorithm with over 158,000 [Formula: see text]O measurements from the surface ocean-the largest synthesis to date. The reconstruction captures observed latitudinal gradients and coastal hot spots of [Formula: see text]O flux and reveals a vigorous global seasonal cycle. We estimate an annual mean [Formula: see text]O flux of 4.2 ± 1.0 Tg N[Formula: see text], 64% of which occurs in the tropics, and 20% in coastal upwelling systems that occupy less than 3% of the ocean area. This [Formula: see text]O flux ranges from a low of 3.3 ± 1.3 Tg N[Formula: see text] in the boreal spring to a high of 5.5 ± 2.0 Tg N[Formula: see text] in the boreal summer. Much of the seasonal variations in global [Formula: see text]O emissions can be traced to seasonal upwelling in the tropical ocean and winter mixing in the Southern Ocean. The dominant contribution to seasonality by productive, low-oxygen tropical upwelling systems (&gt;75%) suggests a sensitivity of the global [Formula: see text]O flux to El Niño-Southern Oscillation and anthropogenic stratification of the low latitude ocean. This ocean flux estimate is consistent with the range adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but reduces its uncertainty by more than fivefold, enabling more precise determination of other terms in the atmospheric [Formula: see text]O budget.",

With these results, we propose that the superconducting transition temperature ([Formula: see text]) of Cmcm structure is estimated to be 50 K at 450 GPa. This could be implied that the proposed Cmcm structure may be emerging as a new class of superconductive ternary metal pentahydride.

Here, we develop a mathematical framework for the classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a dual speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that <ir</i = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like [Formula: see text] [ 1], and show that we can measure the strength and speed of an intervention on the same scale as the strength and speed of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, while the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of 'test-and-treat' interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We also discuss evaluating the effects of the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The model is based on new experimental methods to diagnose the maximum activity of Cyt [Formula: see text] in vivo, and to identify conditions under which photosynthetic control of Cyt [Formula: see text] is active or relaxed. With these approaches, we demonstrate that Cyt [Formula: see text] controls the trade-off between the speed and efficiency of electron transport under limiting light, and functions as a metabolic switch that transfers control to carbon metabolism under saturating light. We also present evidence that the onset of photosynthetic control of Cyt [Formula: see text] occurs within milliseconds of exposure to saturating light, much more quickly than the induction of non-photochemical quenching. We propose that photosynthetic control is the primary means of photoprotection and functions to manage excitation pressure, whereas non-photochemical quenching functions to manage excitation balance.

(1) To explore the utility of qualitative research methods, particularly narrative content analysis in mental health research, and (2) identify aspects of uncertainty in mental health service users and providers. Four hundred and six free text responses were considered as one element of an existing questionnaire about uncertainties about mental health treatments, collected from mental healthcare users and providers through charities, the Mental Health Research Network in Wales, health professionals and websites. Free text responses were analysed using narrative content analysis, an elaborate and rigorous research technique that involves groups of analysts working independently and together over extended group sessions. Three main themes emerged across respondent groups: \"medication and treatment options\", \"objectification and marginalisation of patient\" and \"integrity of service delivery\". Within these, patients embraced the opportunity to write about their illness at length, whilst carers' and parents' main concerns were about how patients were dealing with their illnesses, the services they were getting and the side effects of treatments. Carers and patients' parents perceived themselves to be the 'go-between', carrying messages between patients and professionals, in order to enable services to function. Mental health service providers and professionals considered uncertainties surrounding medication and treatment from an 'evidence-base' perspective, concentrating on medication choices and the adoption of new approaches to care rather than patient need and expectation. Patients wanted to know what alternatives were available to the drug regimes they were on and felt their opinions were rarely listened to. As a consequence patients felt marginalised by the health systems there to support them and by society as a whole. Narrative content analysis can help distil large amounts of free text data and enable their successful interpretation. Listening to patients' voices should become an integral part of routine service evaluation and may help bring patient expectation more in line with service organisation and delivery towards an optimal delivery of care.",

Free-text CPOE orders contained in the sample mentioned 193 medication names. Free-text CPOE orders were used frequently to communicate information about naloxone, heparin, flumazenil, and dextrose. Twenty-two percent of the free-text CPOE orders related to discontinuing medication(s), whereas 7% of the free-text CPOE orders relate to giving medication(s). There was high variation across hospitals both in the percentage of free-text CPOE orders mentioning medication information and in the proportion of those that referred to high-risk medications. The prevalence of medication information in free-text CPOE orders may suggest specific communication challenges in respect to urgency, uncertainty, planning, and other aspects of communication and clinical needs.

In this work, polarization imaging is proposed and described as a method enabling precise 2D dose measurements using CE. CE produced in a water tank is imaged from four polarization angles using a camera coupled to a rotating polarizer. Using Malus' law, the polarized component of CE is isolated and corrected with Monte Carlo calculated CE polar and azimuthal angular distributions. Projected dose measurements resulting from polarization-corrected CE are compared to equivalent radiochromic film measurements. Overall, agreement between polarized corrected CE signal and films measurements is found to be within 3%, for projected percent depth dose (PPDD) and profiles at the different tested energies ([Formula: see text]: 6 and [Formula: see text], e[Formula: see text]: 6 and 18[Formula: see text]).

In Expt 1, subjects read PAGE and RSVP text orally across a wide range of letter sizes (2X to 32X single-letter acuity) and reading speed was computed from the number of correct words read per minute. Reading speeds were consistently faster for RSVP compared to PAGE text at all letter sizes tested. The average speeds for text of an intermediate letter size (8X acuity) were 1171 words/min for RSVP and 303 words/min for PAGE text. In Expt 2 subjects read PAGE and RSVP text silently and a multiple-choice comprehension test was administered after each passage. All subjects continued to read RSVP text faster, and 6 subjects read at the maximum testable rate (1652 words/min) with at least 75% correct on the comprehension tests. Experiment 3 assessed the minimum word exposure time required for decoding text using RSVP to minimize potential delays due to saccadic eye movement control.

On average, lifelong smokers lose 10 years of life, and about half of all lifelong smokers have their lives shortened by smoking. Stopping smoking reverses or prevents many of these harms. However, cessation services in the NHS achieve variable success rates with smokers who want to quit. Approaches to behaviour change can be supplemented with electronic aids, and this may significantly increase quit rates and prevent a proportion of cases that relapse. The primary research question we sought to answer was: What is the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of internet, pc and other electronic aids to help people stop smoking? We addressed the following three questions: (1) What is the effectiveness of internet sites, computer programs, mobile telephone text messages and other electronic aids for smoking cessation and/or reducing relapse? (2) What is the cost-effectiveness of incorporating internet sites, computer programs, mobile telephone text messages and other electronic aids into current nhs smoking cessation programmes? and (3) What are the current gaps in research into the effectiveness of internet sites, computer programs, mobile telephone text messages and other electronic aids to help people stop smoking? For the effectiveness review, relevant primary studies were sought from The Cochrane Library [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)] 2009, Issue 4, and MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC) (Ovid) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost) from 1980 to December 2009. In addition, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) were searched for information on cost-effectiveness and modelling for the same period. Reference lists of included studies and of relevant systematic reviews were examined to identify further potentially relevant studies. Research registries of ongoing studies including National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database, Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov were also searched, and further information was sought from contacts with experts. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating smoking cessation programmes that utilise computer, internet, mobile telephone or other electronic aids in adult smokers were included in the effectiveness review. Relevant studies of other design were included in the cost-effectiveness review and supplementary review. Pair-wise meta-analyses using both random- and fixed-effects models were carried out. Bayesian mixed-treatment comparisons (MTCs) were also performed. A de novo decision-analytical model was constructed for estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was calculated. Narrative synthesis of key themes and issues that may influence the acceptability and usability of electronic aids was provided in the supplementary review. This effectiveness review included 60 RCTs/quasi-RCTs reported in 77 publications. Pooled estimate for prolonged abstinence [relative risk (RR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 1.45] and point prevalence abstinence (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22) suggested that computer and other electronic aids increase the likelihood of cessation compared with no intervention or generic self-help materials. There was no significant difference in effect sizes between aid to cessation studies (which provide support to smokers who are ready to quit) and cessation induction studies (which attempt to encourage a cessation attempt in smokers who are not yet ready to quit). Results from MTC also showed small but significant intervention effect (time to relapse, mean hazard ratio 0.87, 95% credible interval 0.83 to 0.92). Cost-threshold analyses indicated some form of electronic intervention is likely to be cost-effective when added to non-electronic behavioural support, but there is substantial uncertainty with regard to what the most effective (thus most cost-effective) type of electronic intervention is, which warrants further research. EVPI calculations suggested the upper limit for the benefit of this research is around £ 2000-3000 per person. The review focuses on smoking cessation programmes in the adult population, but does not cover smoking cessation in adolescents. Most available evidence relates to interventions with a single tailored component, while evidence for different modes of delivery (e.g. e-mail, text messaging) is limited. Therefore, the findings of lack of sufficient evidence for proving or refuting effectiveness should not be regarded as evidence of ineffectiveness. We have examined only a small number of factors that could potentially influence the effectiveness of the interventions. A comprehensive evaluation of potential effect modifiers at study level in a systematic review of complex interventions remains challenging. Information presented in published papers is often insufficient to allow accurate coding of each intervention or comparator. A limitation of the cost-effectiveness analysis, shared with several previous cost-effectiveness analyses of smoking cessation interventions, is that intervention benefit is restricted to the first quit attempt. Exploring the impact of interventions on subsequent attempts requires more detailed information on patient event histories than is available from current evidence. Our effectiveness review concluded that computer and other electronic aids increase the likelihood of cessation compared with no intervention or generic self-help materials, but the effect is small. The effectiveness does not appear to vary with respect to mode of delivery and concurrent non-electronic co-interventions. Our cost-effectiveness review suggests that making some form of electronic support available to smokers actively seeking to quit is highly likely to be cost-effective. This is true whether the electronic intervention is delivered alongside brief advice or more intensive counselling. The key source of uncertainty is that around the comparative effectiveness of different types of electronic interventions. Our review suggests that further research is needed on the relative benefits of different forms of delivery for electronic aids, the content of delivery, and the acceptability of these technologies for smoking cessation with subpopulations of smokers, particularly disadvantaged groups. More evidence is also required on the relationship between involving users in the design of interventions and the impact this has on effectiveness, and finally on how electronic aids developed and tested in research settings are applied in routine practice and in the community.",

However, in China, where the urban PM levels are typically considerably higher than in Western communities, some studies suggest nonlinearity in this association. Health impact assessments (HIA) of PM in China have generally not incorporated nonlinearity in the concentration-response (C-R) association, which could result in large discrepancies in estimates of excess deaths if the true association is nonlinear. We investigated nonlinearity in the C-R associations between with PM with aerodynamic diameter [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and mortality in Beijing, China, and the sensitivity of HIA to linearity assumptions. We modeled the C-R association between [Formula: see text] and cause-specific mortality in Beijing, China (2009-2012), using generalized linear models (GLM).

We used fMRI to understand the neural processes that underpin this phenomenon. First, we found that individuals with poorer text-based memory tend to show reduced recruitment of left middle temporal gyrus in response to orthographic input, within a region located at the intersection of default mode, dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Voxels within these networks were taken as seeds in a subsequent resting-state study. The default mode network region (i) had greater connectivity with medial prefrontal cortex, falling within the same network, for individuals with better text-based memory, and (ii) was more decoupled from medial visual regions in participants who mind-wandered more frequently. These findings suggest that stronger intrinsic connectivity within the default mode network is linked to better text processing, while reductions in default mode network coupling to the visual system may underpin individual variation in the tendency for our attention to become disengaged from what we are reading.",

The aim of our current study was to develop texts in more languages for a wide range of countries and users, and to assess the reading speeds of normally-sighted readers. Ten texts were designed for 17 languages each by a linguist who matched content, length, difficulty, and linguistic complexity. The texts then were used to assess reading speeds of 436 normally-sighted native speakers (age 18-35 years, 25 per language, 36 in Japanese), presented at a distance of 40 cm and size 1 M, that is 10-point Times New Roman font. Reading time (aloud) was measured by stopwatch. For all 17 languages, average mean reading speed was 1.42 ± 0.13 texts/min (±SD), 184 ± 29 words/min, 370 ± 80 syllables/min, and 863 ± 234 characters/min. For 14 languages, mean reading time was 68 ms/character (95% confidence interval [CI] 65-71 ms). Our analysis focussed on words per minute. The variability of reading speed within subjects accounts only for an average of 11.5%, between subjects for 88.5%. The low within-subject variability shows the equivalence of the texts. The IReST (second edition) can now be provided in 17 languages allowing standardized assessment of reading speed, as well as comparability of results before and after interventions, and is a useful tool for multi-language studies (for further information see www.amd-read.net).",

After several careful validations, the fluid-cilium interaction system is investigated in detail at various pulsatile flow conditions that are characterized by peak Reynolds numbers ([Formula: see text]) and Womersley numbers ([Formula: see text]). The periodic flapping of primary cilium observed in our simulations is very similar to the in vivo ciliary oscillation captured by O'Connor et al.

During the flapping process, the location of the maximum tensile stress is not always found at the basal region; instead, it is able to propagate from time to time within a certain distance to the base. Due to the obstruction of the primary cilium, the distribution of wall shear stress no longer remains uniform as in the absence of cilia. It oscillates in space with the minimum magnitude which is always found near where the cilium is located. The presence of cilium also reduces the overall level of wall shear stress, especially at the region near the cilium's anchor point.",

Handling and matching the string components between physicians' addresses and the addresses of the parcels could identify the spatial uncertainty and instability to derive a more reasonable relationship between different datasets.

Participants also described what information they could take away from line charts containing text with varying semantic content. We find that heavily annotated charts were not penalized. In fact, participants preferred the charts with the largest number of textual annotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. We also find effects of semantic content. For instance, the text that describes statistical or relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways referring to statistics or relational comparisons than text describing elemental or encoded components. Finally, we find different effects for the semantic levels based on the placement of the text on the chart; some kinds of information are best placed in the title, while others should be placed closer to the data.

Natural language and text processing techniques can facilitate this task by making the information contained in textual resources such as MEDLINE more readily accessible and amenable to computational processing. Names of biological entities such as genes and proteins provide critical links between different biomedical information sources and researchers' experimental data. Therefore, automatic identification and classification of these terms in text is an essential capability of any natural language processing system aimed at managing the wealth of biomedical information that is available electronically.

Speed reading has been an intriguing concept for decades, at least since Evelyn Wood introduced her Reading Dynamics training program in 1959. It has recently increased in popularity, with speed-reading apps and technologies being introduced for smartphones and digital devices. The current article reviews what the scientific community knows about the reading process--a great deal--and discusses the implications of the research findings for potential students of speed-reading training programs or purchasers of speed-reading apps. The research shows that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It is unlikely that readers will be able to double or triple their reading speeds (e.g., from around 250 to 500-750 words per minute) while still being able to understand the text as well as if they read at normal speed. If a thorough understanding of the text is not the reader's goal, then speed reading or skimming the text will allow the reader to get through it faster with moderate comprehension. The way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g., through increased vocabulary). This is because language skill is at the heart of reading speed.",

This might be due to the somewhat ambiguous nature of reading speed, which is sometimes regarded as a feature of the reading process, and sometimes as a product of that process. We argue that both reading speed and comprehension should be seen as the result of the reading process, and that the process of fluent text reading can instead be described by complexity metrics that quantify aspects of the stability of the reading process. In this article, we introduce complexity metrics in the context of reading and apply them to data from a self-paced reading study. In this study, children and adults read a text silently or aloud and answered comprehension questions after reading. Our results show that recurrence metrics that quantify the degree of temporal structure in reading times yield better prediction of text comprehension compared to reading speed. However, the results for fractal metrics are less clear. Furthermore, prediction of text comprehension is generally strongest and most consistent across silent and oral reading when comprehension scores are normalized by reading speed. Analyses of word length and word frequency indicate that the observed complexity in reading times is not a simple function of the lexical properties of the text, suggesting that text reading might work differently compared to reading of isolated word or sentences.",

Known as a natural Greenhouse Effect (GE), this near-surface Atmospheric Thermal Enhancement (ATE) as named herein is presently entirely attributed to the absorption of up-welling long-wave radiation by greenhouse gases. Often quoted as 33 K for Earth, GE is estimated as a difference between planet's observed mean surface temperature and an effective radiating temperature calculated from the globally averaged absorbed solar flux using the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) radiation law. This approach equates a planet's average temperature in the absence of greenhouse gases or atmosphere to an effective emission temperature assuming ATE ≡ GE. The SB law is also routinely employed to estimating the mean temperatures of airless bodies. We demonstrate that this formula as applied to spherical objects is mathematically incorrect owing to Hölder's inequality between integrals and leads to biased results such as a significant underestimation of Earth's ATE. We derive a new expression for the mean physical temperature of airless bodies based on an analytic integration of the SB law over a sphere that accounts for effects of regolith heat storage and cosmic background radiation on nighttime temperatures. Upon verifying our model against Moon surface temperature data provided by the NASA Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we propose it as a new analytic standard for evaluating the thermal environment of airless bodies. Physical evidence is presented that Earth's ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth's total ATE is ~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE = GE + TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE &gt; 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth's ATE defined as GE = ATE - TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.

Previous reports of planetary thermal emission give fluxes that are roughly consistent with predictions based on thermal equilibrium with the planets' received radiation, assuming a Bond albedo of approximately 0.3. Here we report direct detection of thermal emission from the smallest known transiting planet, HD 149026b, that indicates a brightness temperature (an expression of flux) of 2,300 +/- 200 K at 8 microm. The planet's predicted temperature for uniform, spherical, blackbody emission and zero albedo (unprecedented for planets) is 1,741 K. As models with non-zero albedo are cooler, this essentially eliminates uniform blackbody models, and may also require an albedo lower than any measured for a planet, very strong 8 microm emission, strong temporal variability, or a heat source other than stellar radiation. On the other hand, an instantaneous re-emission blackbody model, in which each patch of surface area instantly re-emits all received light, matches the data. This planet is known to be enriched in heavy elements, which may give rise to novel atmospheric properties yet to be investigated.",

The feedback of the first kind involves the radiative damping of the vertically uniform temperature perturbation of the troposphere and Earth's surface that approximately follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law of blackbody radiation. The second kind involves the change in the vertical lapse rate of temperature, water vapor, and clouds in the troposphere and albedo of the Earth's surface. Using satellite observations of the annual variation of the outgoing flux of longwave radiation and that of reflected solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere, this study estimates the so-called \"gain factor,\" which characterizes the strength of radiative feedback of the second kind that operates on the annually varying, global-scale perturbation of temperature at the Earth's surface. The gain factor is computed not only for all sky but also for clear sky. The gain factor of so-called \"cloud radiative forcing\" is then computed as the difference between the two. The gain factors thus obtained are compared with those obtained from 35 models that were used for the fourth and fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment. Here, we show that the gain factors obtained from satellite observations of cloud radiative forcing are effective for identifying systematic biases of the feedback processes that control the sensitivity of simulated climate, providing useful information for validating and improving a climate model.",

Both instruments far exceeded their 6 year design life and continue to operate satisfactorily for more than 15 and 13 years, respectively. The MODIS instrument is designed to make observations at nearly a 100% duty cycle covering the entire Earth in less than 2 days. The MODIS sensor characteristics include a spectral coverage from 0.41 μm - 14.4 μm, of which those wavelengths ranging from 3.7 μm - 14. 4 μm cover the thermal infrared region which is interspaced in 16 Thermal Emissive Bands (TEB). Each of the TEB contains 10 detectors which record samples at a spatial resolution of 1 km. In order to ensure a high level of accuracy for the TEB measured Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances, an onboard BlackBody (BB) is used as the calibration source. This paper reports the noise characterization and performance of the TEB on various counts. First, the stability of the onboard BB is evaluated to understand the effectiveness of the calibration source. Next, key noise metrics such as the Noise Equivalent Temperature difference (NEdT) and the Noise Equivalent dn difference (NEdN) for the various TEB are determined from multiple temperature sources.

By generally clement Earth standards, these Europan habitats are likely to be extreme environments. The objectives of this paper were to examine: (1) the limits for biological activity on Earth with respect to temperature, salinity, acidity, desiccation, radiation, pressure, and time; (2) potential habitats for life on Europa; and (3) Earth analogues and their limitations for Europa. Based on empirical evidence, the limits for biological activity on Earth are: (1) the temperature range is from 253 to 394 K; (2) the salinity range is a(H2O) = 0.6-1.0; (3) the desiccation range is from 60% to 100% relative humidity; (4) the acidity range is from pH 0 to 13; (5) microbes such as Deinococcus are roughly 4,000 times more resistant to ionizing radiation than humans; (6) the range for hydrostatic pressure is from 0 to 1,100 bars; and (7) the maximum time for organisms to survive in the dormant state may be as long as 250 million years. The potential habitats for life on Europa are the ice layer, the brine ocean, and the seafloor environment. The dual stresses of lethal radiation and low temperatures on or near the icy surface of Europa preclude the possibility of biological activity anywhere near the surface. Only at the base of the ice layer could one expect to find the suitable temperatures and liquid water that are necessary for life. An ice layer turnover time of 10 million years is probably rapid enough for preserving in the surface ice layers dormant life forms originating from the ocean. Model simulations demonstrate that hypothetical oceans could exist on Europa that are too cold for biological activity (T &lt; 253 K). These simulations also demonstrate that salinities are high, which would restrict life to extreme halophiles. An acidic ocean (if present) could also potentially limit life. Pressure, per se, is unlikely to directly limit life on Europa. But indirectly, pressure plays an important role in controlling the chemical environments for life. Deep ocean basins such as the Mariana Trench are good analogues for the cold, high-pressure ocean of Europa. Many of the best terrestrial analogues for potential Europan habitats are in the Arctic and Antarctica. The six factors likely to be most important in defining the environments for life on Europa and the focus for future work are liquid water, energy, nutrients, low temperatures, salinity, and high pressures.",

Applying the Brillouin scattering into the Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) to obtain the in situ elastic wave velocities of minerals, is the important approach to investigate elastic properties of Earth's Interior. With the development of DAC technology, on the one hand, the high temperature and high pressure experimental environment to simulate different layers of the earth can be achieved; on the other hand, the optical properties of DAC made many kinds of optical analysis and test methods have been widely applied in this research field. In order to gain the elastic wave velocity under high temperature and high pressure, the accurate experimental pressure and heating temperature of the sample in the cavity should be measured and calibrated first, then the scattering signal needs to dealt with, using the Brillouin frequency shift to calculate the velocity in the sample. Combined with the lattice constants obtained from X ray technique, by a solid elastic theory, all the elastic parameters of minerals can be solved. In this paper, firstly, application of methods based on optical spectrum such as Brillouin and Raman scattering in elasticity study on materials in Earth's interior, and the basic principle and research progress of them in the velocity measurement, pressure and temperature calibration are described in detail. Secondly, principle and scope of application of two common methods of spectral pressure calibration (fluorescence and Raman spectral pressure standard) are analyzed, in addition with introduce of the application of two conventional means of temperature calibration (blackbody radiation and Raman temperature scale) in temperature determination.

The increase in UV dominates changes of O3, OH, CH4, N2O, and CH3Cl, whereas the increase in stellar temperature dominates changes in H2O. The overall effect as stellar effective temperatures and corresponding UV increase is a lower surface temperature of the planet due to a bigger part of the stellar flux being reflected at short wavelengths, as well as increased photolysis.

Solar abundance arguments suggest and the measurements allow large quantities of surface methane near its triple-point temperature, so that the three phases of methane could play roles in the atmosphere and on the surface of Titan similar to those of water on Earth.

This paper provides absolute intensity measurements, quantum efficiencies and signal-to-blackbody radiation ratios at peak emission wavelengths, at various temperatures (20-1400°C), for Y(2)O(3):Eu, YAG:Tb and YAG:Tm thermographic phosphors under 266 and 355 nm excitation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These terms are beneficial in a number of ways for engineers wanting to use a phosphor thermometry solution at high temperatures.

The phosphor signal:blackbody radiation ratio is useful because it combines the effects of blackbody radiation and phosphor emission intensities at various temperatures, providing a valuable quantitative evaluation that can be used as a design aid for phosphor selection. A figure of merit is the temperature when the blackbody radiation equals the phosphor emission (ratio = 1); this is the cross-over temperature at which the blackbody radiation rapidly starts to overtake and mask out phosphor emissions. To the best of our knowledge no such work exists previously. The results presented show a variation in phosphor intensity with increasing temperature, and although the intensity and quantum efficiencies for Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb were much greater than YAG:Tm at low temperatures, YAG:Tm was found to be the most efficient phosphor investigated at higher temperatures (&gt;900°C). With a peak emission wavelength of 458 nm, YAG:Tm experienced the lowest proportion of blackbody radiation therefore its advantage at higher temperatures was further amplified and was found to offer an advantage of approximately +350°C and +250°C increased upper temperature capability compared to Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb phosphors, respectively.",

Radiative emission in high wavelength ranges from the Earth's surface at low temperature can be absorbed by atmospheric water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gases.

The cavitational temperature ranging from 2 600 to 3 050 K was calculated from the fitted spectra. The reasons for the existence of blackbody radiation in conical bubble luminescence were discussed both from special and temporal sides. The value of radius of cavitational bubble is about 1.7 cm theoretically, which is greater than that of the bubble acoustically excited. The width of light pulses of cavitational bubble reached 40-60 ms, and this provided enough time for the blackbody radiation. In addition, the light pulses at different wavelength were measured, and results show that the width of light pulses increased with the raise of wavelength of spectra, which proved the mechanism of blackbody radiation. Finally, based on the spectra and light pulses, the intensity of luminescence was calculated to be about 0.18 J.",

Another feature believed to be novel is simplifying the design by elimination of the need for cooling the blackbody for subambient temperature range by use of a second blackbody, strategically located, which is heated to achieve radiation balance. Detailed theoretical analysis is given, showing that the IRT can measure remotely the total emissivity or even the electric current or voltage.

Titan's atmosphere has a greenhouse effect caused primarily by pressure-induced opacity of N2, CH4, and H2.  H2 is a key absorber because it is primarily responsible for the absorption in the wave number 400 to 600 cm-1 \"window\" region of Titan's infrared spectrum.  The concentration of CH4, also an important absorber, is set by the saturation vapor pressure and hence is dependent on temperature.  In this respect there is a similarity between the role of H2 and CH4 on Titan and that of CO2 and H2O on Earth.  Titan also has an antigreenhouse effect that results from the presence of a high-altitude haze layer that is absorbing at solar wavelengths but transparent in the thermal infrared.  The antigreenhouse effect on Titan reduces the surface temperature by 9 K whereas the greenhouse effect increases it by 21 K.  The net effect is that the surface temperature (94 K) is 12 K warmer than the effective temperature (82 K).  If the haze layer were removed, the antigreenhouse effect would be greatly reduced, the greenhouse effect would become even stronger, and the surface temperature would rise by over 20 K.",

The large amounts of UV radiation emitted by early-type stars have been suggested to pose a problem for evolving life in their vicinity.

Previous studies proposed a weighted average method which can be indicated by a priori to calculate the reference temperature. However, these studies did not mention how to define the weight function but used some arbitrary temperature or the temperature of a fixed position like the central bottom of the cavity as the reference temperature. In this study, a quantitative analysis and calculation method, which is implemented in the Monte Carlo method based optical simulation software Tracepro, is proposed to define the weight coefficients and optimize the reference temperature. To do so, in the Tracepro software, a surface source is placed in front of the cavity opening and emits radiation to the blackbody cavity. The radiation from this surface source can be absorbed or reflected many times in the cavity, and finally the incident radiation distribution in the cavity can be obtained. According to the principle of light path reversibility, the normalized incident radiation can be considered as the contribution of its position to the effective emissivity. In the experiment, the actual temperatures of two different-shaped blackbody cavities are measured with the non-contact method in 873 K temperature. By dividing the inner surface of each blackbody cavity into several regions based on the positions of the actually measured temperature points, the incident radiation from the surface source to each segmented region is calculated and normalized to the total incident radiation across all regions as its weight coefficient; the reference temperature is the sum of the weighted temperature (by multiplying each weight coefficient with its measured temperature) in each region. Different from previous studies, this study optimizes the reference temperature by considering the contribution of the whole cavity to the effective emissivity, which should be more consistent with the actual situation. Moreover, the influences of different shapes of the blackbody cavities, different radiation characteristics of the inner surface materials and different viewing conditions of the effective emissivity on the reference temperature are discussed and compared. The results suggest that the optimization of reference temperature has close link with above factors and thus should be calculated individually.",

Ozone depletion increases incident short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVB, 280-315 nm) and longer (&gt;600 nm) wavelengths of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm). On the other hand, the NO2 haze decreases atmospheric transmission in the long-wavelength UVA (315-400 nm) and short-wavelength PAR. Here, we use the results of previous simulations of incident spectral irradiance following an ionizing radiation event to predict changes in terran productivity focusing on photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton. The prediction is based on a spectral model of photosynthetic response, which was developed for the dominant genera in central regions of the ocean (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus), and on remote-sensing-based observations of spectral water transparency, temperature, wind speed, and mixed layer depth. Predicted productivity declined after a simulated ionizing event, but the effect integrated over the water column was small. For integrations taking into account the full depth range of PAR transmission (down to 0.1% of utilizable PAR), the decrease was at most 2-3% (depending on strain), with larger effects (5-7%) for integrations just to the depth of the surface mixed layer. The deeper integrations were most affected by the decreased utilizable PAR at depth due to the NO2 haze, whereas shallower integrations were most affected by the increased surface UV. Several factors tended to dampen the magnitude of productivity responses relative to increases in surface-damaging radiation, for example, most inhibition in the modeled strains is caused by UVA and PAR, and the greatest relative increase in damaging exposure is predicted to occur in the winter when UV and productivity are low.",

The gradual reduction of the albedos of snow and ice at wavelengths greater than 1 μm, combined with M stars emitting a significant fraction of their radiation at these same longer wavelengths, means that the albedos of ice and snow on planets orbiting M stars are much lower than their values on Earth. Our results imply that the ice/snow albedo climate feedback is significantly weaker for planets orbiting M stars than for planets orbiting G-type stars such as the Sun. In addition, planets with significant ice and snow cover will have significantly higher surface temperatures for a given stellar flux if the spectral variation of cryospheric albedo is considered, which in turn implies that the outer edge of the habitable zone around M stars may be 10-30% farther away from the parent star than previously thought.",

As an example, the CPMS was used to determine the expected bioburden reductions on the Europa Clipper spacecraft upon arrival at Jupiter under two different transit scenarios. Under a direct trajectory scenario, exterior surfaces are rapidly sterilized with tens of thousands of lethal doses (LDs) absorbed to the spacecraft exterior and at least one LD to all interior spaces of the spacecraft heated to at least 240 K. Under a Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assist (VEEGA) trajectory, we find substantially higher bioburden reductions resulting from the spacecraft spending much more time near the Sun and more time in transit overall. With VEEGA, the exterior absorbs hundreds of thousands of LDs and interior surfaces heated above 230 K would absorb at least one LD. From these simulations, we are able to generalize about bioburden reduction in transit on spacecraft in general, finding that all spacecraft surfaces would sustain at least one LD in ≤38.5 years even if completely unheated.

The emissivity of oil slick changes marginally with oil slick thickness and clearly below that of seawater in the spectrum range from 11. 7 to 14 μm, this spectrum range can be practically used to distinguish oil slick from seawater; Around the wavelength of 11.72, 12.2, 12.55, 13.48 and 13.8 μm, the emissivity of oil slick presents clearly increasing or decreasing trends with the increase of its thickness, which are one of the best wavelengths for observing the offshore oil slick and estimating its thickness.",

Monte Carlo calculations of high-energy irradiation suggest that the surfaces of terrestrial-like planets with thick atmospheres (column densities greater than about 100 g cm(-2)) are well protected from directly incident X-rays and gamma-rays, but we find that sizeable fractions of incident ionizing radiation from astrophysical sources can be redistributed to biologically and chemically important ultraviolet wavelengths, a significant fraction of which can reach the surface. This redistribution is mediated by secondary electrons, resulting from Compton scattering and X-ray photoabsorption, the energies of which are low enough to excite and ionize atmospheric molecules and atoms, resulting in a rich aurora-like spectrum. We calculate the fraction of energy redistributed into biologically and chemically important wavelength regions for spectra characteristic of stellar flares and supernovae using a Monte-Carlo transport code and then estimate the fraction of this energy that is transmitted from the atmospheric altitudes of redistribution to the surface for a few illustrative cases. For atmospheric models corresponding to the Archean Earth, we assume no significant ultraviolet absorbers, only Rayleigh scattering, and find that the fraction of incident ionizing radiation that is received at the surface in the form of redistributed ultraviolet in the biologically relevant 200-320 nm region (UV-C and UV-B bands) can be up to 4%. On the present-day Earth with its ultraviolet ozone shield, this fraction is found to be 0.2%. Both values are many orders of magnitude higher than the fraction of direct ionizing radiation reaching the surface. This result implies that planetary organisms will be subject to mutationally significant, if intermittent, fluences of UV-B and harder radiation even in the presence of a narrow-band ultraviolet shield like ozone. We also calculate the surficial transmitted fraction of ionizing radiation and redistributed ultraviolet radiation for two illustrative evolving Mars atmospheres whose initial surface pressures were 1 bar. We discuss the frequency with which redistributed ultraviolet flux from parent star flares exceeds the parent star ultraviolet flux at the planetary surface. We find that the redistributed ultraviolet from parent star flares is probably a fairly rare intermittent event for habitable zone planets orbiting solar-type stars except when they are young, but should completely dominate the direct steady ultraviolet radiation from the parent star for planets orbiting all stars less massive than about 0.5 solar masses. Our results suggest that coding organisms on such planets (and on the early Earth) may evolve very differently than on contemporary Earth, with diversity and evolutionary rate controlled by a stochastically varying mutation rate and frequent hypermutation episodes.",

Today the full spectrum of solar UV radiation is only experienced in space, where other important space parameters influence survival and genetic stability additionally, like vacuum, cosmic radiation, temperature extremes, microgravity. To reach a better understanding of the processes leading to the origin, evolution and distribution of life we have performed space experiments with microorganisms.

The article proposes the concept of a system for performing hyperthermia with real-time spectroscopic temperature control and surface cooling, which allows to record spectra of diffusely scattered radiation and fluorescent signal from various depths of biological tissues by the means of the variation of the angle and distance between the fiber source of laser radiation and the receiving fiber. Theoretical and experimental modeling of the spatial distribution of diffusely scattered radiation and temperature inside the tissue with a fiber optic device providing surface cooling of the irradiated tissue, and recording spectral information from a given depth in real time, is presented. Simulation of radiation propagation in biological tissues, depending on the distance between the source and the receiver and the angle of their tilt, was carried out using the Monte Carlo method. Modeling of the temperature distribution inside the tissues was carried out by means of a numerical solution of the heat conduction equation.

We have used these data to upgrade, correct, and validate the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model. This comprehensive model now includes specular reflectance from the ocean and explicitly includes atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering, gas absorption, and temperature structure. We have used this model to generate spatially and temporally resolved synthetic spectra and images of Earth for the dates of EPOXI observation. Model parameters were varied to yield an optimum fit to the data. We found that a minimum spatial resolution of ∼100 pixels on the visible disk, and four categories of water clouds, which were defined by using observed cloud positions and optical thicknesses, were needed to yield acceptable fits. The validated model provides a simultaneous fit to Earth's lightcurve, absolute brightness, and spectral data, with a root-mean-square (RMS) error of typically less than 3% for the multiwavelength lightcurves and residuals of ∼10% for the absolute brightness throughout the visible and NIR spectral range. We have extended our validation into the mid-infrared by comparing the model to high spectral resolution observations of Earth from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, obtaining a fit with residuals of ∼7% and brightness temperature errors of less than 1 K in the atmospheric window. For the purpose of understanding the observable characteristics of the distant Earth at arbitrary viewing geometry and observing cadence, our validated forward model can be used to simulate Earth's time-dependent brightness and spectral properties for wavelengths from the far ultraviolet to the far infrared.

We studied the impact of the 1985 April 12 flare from the M dwarf AD Leonis (AD Leo), simulating the effects from both UV radiation and protons on the atmospheric chemistry of a hypothetical, Earth-like planet located within its habitable zone. Based on observations of solar proton events and the Neupert effect, we estimated a proton flux associated with the flare of 5.9 × 10⁸ protons cm⁻² sr⁻¹ s⁻¹ for particles with energies &gt;10 MeV. Then we calculated the abundance of nitrogen oxides produced by the flare by scaling the production of these compounds during a large solar proton event called the Carrington event. The simulations were performed with a 1-D photochemical model coupled to a 1-D radiative/convective model. Our results indicate that the UV radiation emitted during the flare does not produce a significant change in the ozone column depth of the planet. When the action of protons is included, the ozone depletion reaches a maximum of 94% two years after the flare for a planet with no magnetic field. At the peak of the flare, the calculated UV fluxes that reach the surface, in the wavelength ranges that are damaging for life, exceed those received on Earth during less than 100 s. Therefore, flares may not present a direct hazard for life on the surface of an orbiting habitable planet.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Although the brightness of semiconductor lasers has been increased by the use of edge-emitting-type resonators, their brightness is still one order of magnitude smaller than that of gas and solid-state/fibre lasers, and they often suffer from large beam divergence with strong asymmetry and astigmatism. Here, we develop a so-called 'double-lattice photonic crystal', where we superimpose two photonic lattice groups separated by one-quarter wavelength in the x and y directions. Using this resonator, an output power of 10 W with a very narrow-divergence-angle (&lt;0.3°) symmetric surface-emitted beam is achieved from a circular emission area of 500 μm diameter under pulsed conditions, which corresponds to a brightness of over 300 MW cm<sup-2</sup sr<sup-1</sup. In addition, an output power up to ~7 W is obtained under continuous-wave conditions. Detailed analyses on the double-lattice structure indicate that the resonators have the potential to realize a brightness of up to 10 GW cm<sup-2</sup sr<sup-1</sup, suggesting that compact, affordable semiconductor lasers will be able to rival existing gas and fibre/disk lasers.",

The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

MR multitasking is used to model the data into six dimensions, including three spatial dimensions for whole-brain coverage, a saturation-recovery time dimension, and a TE dimension for dynamic &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"&gt; &lt;mml:semantics&gt; &lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msub&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;T&lt;/mml:mi&gt; &lt;mml:mn&gt;1&lt;/mml:mn&gt;&lt;/mml:msub&gt; &lt;/mml:mrow&gt; &lt;mml:annotation&gt;$$ {\\mathrm{T}}_1 $$&lt;/mml:annotation&gt;&lt;/mml:semantics&gt; &lt;/mml:math&gt; and &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"&gt; &lt;mml:semantics&gt; &lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msubsup&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;T&lt;/mml:mi&gt; &lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt; &lt;mml:mo&gt;*&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:msubsup&gt; &lt;/mml:mrow&gt; &lt;mml:annotation&gt;$$ {\\mathrm{T}}_2^{\\ast } $$&lt;/mml:annotation&gt;&lt;/mml:semantics&gt; &lt;/mml:math&gt; quantification, respectively, and a contrast dynamics dimension for capturing contrast kinetics.

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation. Stimulus-induced cortical hyperactivity persisted up to 1.5 h and decayed to baseline after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ indicated by c-Fos expression.

The purpose of this paper is to experimentally optimize the energy thresholds and tube voltage for single-exposure DE x-ray angiography. We optimized single-exposure DE x-ray angiography using the iodine signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) per root patient air kerma (κ) as a figure of merit. We measured the iodine SDNR by imaging an iodine stepwedge immersed in a water tank with a depth of 30 cm in the direction of x-ray propagation. The stepwedge was imaged using tube voltages ranging from 90 to 150 kV and a cadmium telluride (CdTe) x-ray detector with two energy bins and analog charge summing for charge sharing suppression. The energy threshold that separates the two energy bins was varied from approximately 35 keV to approximately 75% of the maximum energy of the x-ray beam.

The effect of scatter was determined from measurements of the scatter-to-primary ratios (SPRs) of the low-energy and high-energy images and a semi-empirical model of the relationship between SDNR and SPR. Using the optimal parameters, we imaged a phantom with vessel-simulating structures and background clutter.

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

This performance limitation can be attributed to the commonly-applied standard collinear pumping scheme in which the optical pump is transmitted through a dichroic mirror whose spectral transmission and dispersion properties severely perturb the oscillating pulse when its optical spectrum extends towards the pump wavelength. In this study, we report on a novel pumping scheme relying on cross polarization that overcomes this challenge. In our concept, the pump transmitting mirror is highly transmissive for the pump light in p-polarization, while it is highly reflective for the laser light in s-polarization over a broad wavelength range, even covering the pump wavelength and beyond. In contrast to a standard thin-film polarizer featuring similar polarization dependent properties, it provides a low and flat dispersion profile over a broad spectral range for the s-polarization. Implementing this pumping scheme in a soft-aperture Kerr-lens mode-locked bulk laser oscillator based on the gain material Yb:CALGO, we achieve clean 22-fs soliton pulses at 729 mW of average output power and an optical-to-optical efficiency of 25%. In a second configuration optimized for the highest average output power, we demonstrate a high optical-to-optical efficiency of 36.6%, which was obtained for 31-fs pulses at 1.63 W of average output power. In a third configuration we experimentally confirm the limiting effect of a dichroic mirror commonly used in the standard collinear pumping scheme. All the results presented here and obtained in the first and second configuration generate pulses with a center wavelength ranging from 1030 nm to 1056 nm, well within the spectral region of high gain cross sections of Yb:CALGO. While this initial demonstration was realized using a commercial diffraction-limited fiber laser as pump source, the pump geometry appears also well suited for pumping with laser diodes coupled into multimode fibers. This novel approach opens up new opportunities for compact and cost-efficient high-power few-cycle bulk laser oscillators based on Yb-doped gain materials and can be applied to any gain material with small quantum defect.",

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

Previous reports of planetary thermal emission give fluxes that are roughly consistent with predictions based on thermal equilibrium with the planets' received radiation, assuming a Bond albedo of approximately 0.3. Here we report direct detection of thermal emission from the smallest known transiting planet, HD 149026b, that indicates a brightness temperature (an expression of flux) of 2,300 +/- 200 K at 8 microm. The planet's predicted temperature for uniform, spherical, blackbody emission and zero albedo (unprecedented for planets) is 1,741 K. As models with non-zero albedo are cooler, this essentially eliminates uniform blackbody models, and may also require an albedo lower than any measured for a planet, very strong 8 microm emission, strong temporal variability, or a heat source other than stellar radiation. On the other hand, an instantaneous re-emission blackbody model, in which each patch of surface area instantly re-emits all received light, matches the data. This planet is known to be enriched in heavy elements, which may give rise to novel atmospheric properties yet to be investigated.",

Humidifiers increase air humidity by generating water vapour and thus preventing the mucosa from desiccation. In this bench study, we compared the efficiency of several humidifiers. Two identical humidifiers of each type (HC 602, HumiCare 200, Humid Aire 2i, minni-Max, MR 730 AGM, REMstar, Sirius, Somnia2, Somno Comfort2, VENTIclick, VIVO 30) were measured at three different heating intensities (low, medium, high) and three different flow rates (20, 55 and 90 l/min). The relative humidity at the exit of the tube and the temperature of the water in the heating chamber were registered. Additionally, we measured the humidity of the oxygen humidifier Respiflo at 1 - 5 l/min, the Respiflo was filled with either NaCl 0.9% or Aqua dest. Measurements were taken in a climatic chamber at 20 degrees C and 50% relative humidity. The atmospheric pressure was taken into consideration. The MR 730 AGM and Humicare 200 generated a constant relative humidity of 100%. Among the remaining humidifiers, only the HC 602, HumidAire 2i and REMstar reached a humidity of about 95% at high flow rates. The Minni-Max, Somnia2 and VIVO 30 generated a humidity of 95% still at a flow rate of 55 l/min. The Sirius, Somno Comfort2 and the VENTIclick generated this amount of humidity only at low flow rates of 20 l/min. The three humidifiers mentioned last generated a relative humidity of only 68 - 76 at high flow rates of 90 l/min. The Respiflo generates a humidity of about 90% at each flow rate (1 - 5 l/min.), independent of being filled with NaCl 0.9% or Aqua dest. Factors determinating the efficacy of humidifiers are the velocity of the airstream, the temperature of the water, the contact surface of the air and water compartments and the turbulence of the airstream. In vivo the amount of leakage is a very important determinant for the velocity of the airstream. In the care of mechanically ventilated patients one should have an approximate idea of the magnitude of the applied air flows. The limitations of some humidifiers should be known. The simple presence of a humidifier in combination with a respirator does not mean that the problem of dryness of the airway mucosa is eliminated.",

The pyrometer had 650-750 nm, 750-850 nm, and 850-950 nm channels all with the same optical path. The wavelength choice for each channel is flexible with three center wavelengths (700 nm, 810 nm, and 920 nm) with a full width at half maximum of the spectrum of 3 nm used here. The three image sensors were precisely aligned to avoid spectrum artifacts by micro-mechanical adjustments of the sensors relative to each other to position them within a quarter pixel of each other. The pyrometer was calibrated with the standard blackbody source, and the temperature measurement uncertainty was within 0.21 °C-0.99 °C in the temperatures of 600 °C-1800 °C for the blackbody measurements. The pyrometer was then used to measure the leading edge temperatures of a ceramics model exposed to high-enthalpy plasma aerodynamic heating environment to verify the system applicability. The measured temperature ranges are 701-991 °C, 701-1134 °C, and 701-834 °C at the heating transient, steady state, and cooling transient times. A significant temperature gradient (170 °C/mm) was observed away from the leading edge facing the plasma jet during the steady state heating time. The temperature non-uniformity on the surface occurs during the entire aerodynamic heating process. However, the temperature distribution becomes more uniform after the heater is shut down and the experimental model is naturally cooled.

Two techniques, the standard normal approximation and an optimized power transformation, were used to predict binary angiographic restenosis rates and compare them with observed restenosis rates. The mean in-stent late loss observed in the SIRIUS trial was 0.17+/-0.45 mm (sirolimus) versus 1.00+/-0.70 mm (control). If a normal distribution was assumed, late loss accurately estimated in-stent binary angiographic restenosis for the control arm (predicted 35.4% versus observed 35.4%) but underestimated it in the sirolimus arm (predicted 0.6% versus observed 3.2%).

Here we present Sirius Prediction Systems Builder (PSB), a new computational tool for sequence analysis, classification and searching. Sirius PSB has four main operations: (1) Building a classifier, (2) Deploying a classifier, (3) Search for proteins similar to query proteins, (4) Preliminary and post-prediction analysis. Sirius PSB supports all these operations via a simple and interactive graphical user interface. Besides being a convenient tool, Sirius PSB has also introduced two novelties in sequence analysis. Firstly, genetic algorithm is used to identify interesting features in the feature space. Secondly, instead of the conventional method of searching for similar proteins via sequence similarity, we introduced searching via features' similarity. To demonstrate the capabilities of Sirius PSB, we have built two prediction models - one for the recognition of Arabidopsis polyadenylation sites and another for the subcellular localization of proteins. Both systems are competitive against current state-of-the-art models based on evaluation of public datasets. More notably, the time and effort required to build each model is greatly reduced with the assistance of Sirius PSB. Furthermore, we show that under certain conditions when BLAST is unable to find related proteins, Sirius PSB can identify functionally related proteins based on their biophysical similarities.

And the emissivity is the ratio of the radiation of an object at a given temperature in normal range of the temperature (260-320 K) and the blackbody radiation under the same temperature , the emissivity of an object is unrelated to the temperature, but only is dependent with the wavelength and material properties. Using the seawater taken from Bohai Bay and crude oil taken from Gudao oil production plant of Shengli Oilfield in Dongying city of Shandong Province, an experiment was designed to study the characteristics and mechanism of thermal infrared emissivity spectrum of artificial crude oil slick covered seawater surface with its thickness. During the experiment, crude oil was continuously dropped into the seawater to generate artificial oil slick with different thicknesses. By adding each drop of crude oil, we measured the reflectivity of the oil slick in the thermal infrared spectrum with the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (102F) and then calculated its thermal infrared emissivity. The results show that the thermal infrared emissivity of oil slick changes significantly with its thickness when oil slick is relatively thin (20-120 μm), which provides an effective means for detecting the existence of offshore thin oil slick In the spectrum ranges from 8 to 10 μm and from 13. 2 to 14 μm, there is a steady emissivity difference between the seawater and thin oil slick with thickness of 20 μm.

This study examined the performance of SES in a 'real world' setting by comparing the outcomes of trial-eligible versus ineligible patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. From the US commercial introduction of SES in April 2003 until December 2003, all patients that received an SES at our institution were followed in a prospective registry (n=838). For the purpose of this analysis, the registry population was divided into two groups based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the stenosis in a native coronary artery (SIRIUS) trial. The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR) at follow-up. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) such as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. Clinical follow-up was complete for 92% of patients with a median duration of 14.2 months. Overall, 296 patients (35.3%) met entry criteria for the SIRIUS trial and thus comprised the SIRIUS eligible group. Patients in the SIRIUS ineligible group (n=542) were more likely to have chronic kidney disease and earlier bypass surgery and had longer mean stent length. At 1 year, TLR occurred in 3.0% of the SIRIUS eligible population and in 9.2% of the SIRIUS ineligible group (P=0.001). The secondary endpoint of cumulative MACE occurred in 6.6% of the SIRIUS eligible versus in 17.7% of the SIRIUS ineligible population (P&lt;0.001). Two patients (0.4%) in the SIRIUS ineligible group had a late stent thrombosis on days 39 and 99, respectively, versus none in the SIRIUS eligible group. Among 'real world' patients treated with SES, the incidence of TLR and MACE at 1 year was substantially greater among SIRIUS ineligible patients compared with SIRIUS eligible patients. These findings confirm that pivotal clinical trials of drug-eluting stents tend to enroll low-risk patients and that the estimated rates of TLR and MACE derived from such trials may not reflect subsequent outcomes with unrestricted clinical use.",

Different histochemical approaches have been proposed to detect and quantify collagen deposition in paraffin slices with different degrees of satisfaction. The present study was performed to compare the qualitative and quantitative efficiency of three histochemical methods available for collagen staining in paraffin sections of colon. van Gieson, Sirius Red and Sirius Red/Fast Green stainings were carried out for collagen detection and quantitative estimation by morphometric image analysis in colonic specimens from normal rats or animals with 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS) induced colitis. Haematoxylin/eosin staining was carried out to assess tissue morphology and histopathological lesions. Among the three investigated methods, Sirius Red/Fast Green staining allowed to best highlight well-defined red-stained collagen fibers and to obtain the highest quantitative results by morphometric image analysis in both normal and inflamed colon. Collagen fibers, which stood out against the green-stained non-collagen components, could be clearly appreciated, even in their thinner networks, within all layers of normal or inflamed colonic wall. The present study provides evidence that, as compared with Sirius Red alone or van Gieson staining, the Sirius Red/Fast Green method is the most sensitive, in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of collagen fibers, in paraffin sections of both normal and inflamed colon.

Of the thousands of extrasolar planets now known, only six have been found that transit hot, A-type stars (with temperatures of 7,300-10,000 kelvin), and no planets are known to transit the even hotter B-type stars. For example, WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature of about 7,430 kelvin, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet, WASP-33b (ref. 1); the planet is itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M (ref. 2). WASP-33b displays a large heat differential between its dayside and nightside, and is highly inflated-traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the temperature of its dayside, its atmosphere probably resembles the molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets and, given the level of ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be substantially ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report observations of the bright star HD 195689 (also known as KELT-9), which reveal a close-in (orbital period of about 1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At approximately 10,170 kelvin, the host star is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the dayside temperature of KELT-9b to be about 4,600 kelvin. This is as hot as stars of stellar type K4 (ref. 5). The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and so the primary sources of opacity in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b are probably atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives 700 times more extreme-ultraviolet radiation (that is, with wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometres) than WASP-33b, leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host star.",

Current immobilized protein quantification methods are indirect, time-consuming, and/or inaccurate. In this study, Sirius red colorimetric microassay was shown to be feasible for quantifying the density of collagen immobilized on aminolyzed poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) surfaces using the specific bonding of Sirius dye to collagen. It offers a number of advantages over traditional methods, including direct staining, high sensitivity, and high stability of the dye. The detection limit is approximately 0.1 microg/cm(2), and the dynamic range is greater than 50. Sirius red dye has not been used previously for quantification of protein immobilized on polymers. The collagen densities achieved with each of the two crosslinking reagents investigated, namely glutaraldehyde (GA) and genipin, were compared. The latter is an alternative crosslinker derived from a traditional Chinese medicine. The collagen densities immobilized by the two reagents were measured to be similar. This was confirmed by the similar behaviors of esophageal primary smooth muscle cells (ESMCs) on these two modified PLLA membranes; collagen grafted with either coupler was found to greatly promote, to a similar extent, cell attachment and both short-term (4 days) and long-term (12 days) proliferation compared with unmodified PLLA.

The hardware and data processing described take advantage of the color filter array (CFA) that is deposited on the surface of the light sensor array present in most digital color cameras. In this work, a triple-pass optical filter incorporated into the camera lens allows light in three 10-nm wide bandpass regions to reach the CFA/light sensor array. These bandpass regions are centered over the maxima in the blue, green, and red transmission regions of the CFA, minimizing the spectral overlap of these regions normally present. A computer algorithm is used to retrieve the blue, green, and red image matrices from camera memory and correct for remaining spectral overlap. A second algorithm calibrates the corrected intensities to a gray body emitter of known temperature, producing a color intensity correction factor for the camera/filter system. The Wien approximation to the Planck blackbody emission law is used to construct temperature images from the three color (blue, green, red) matrices. A short pass filter set eliminates light of wavelengths longer than 750 nm, providing reasonable accuracy (±10%) for temperatures between 1200 and 6000 K. The effectiveness of this system is demonstrated by measuring the temperature of several systems for which the temperature is known.",

Medical Laser Center Lübeck, Germany. Corneas of freshly enucleated porcine eyes were treated with a continuous wave laser diode (1.86 microns) and a pulsed chromium-thulium-holmium: YAG laser (2.1 microns) to produce LTK lesions or ablated with a Q-switched and a free-running chromium-erbium: YSGG laser (2.70 microns), a free-running erbium: YAG laser (2.94 microns), and an argon-fluoride excimer laser (193 nm). The lesions were evaluated by light microscopy (LM) (hematoxylin and eosin, Azan, van Gieson's, and Masson-Goldner's trichrome stains), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and polarization microscopy after Sirius-red staining. Sirius-red, a strongly elongated, birefringent molecule binding parallel to collagen molecules, was used to enhance corneal birefringence. With routine LM, it was difficult to discriminate the degrees of thermal alterations in LTK lesions. Combined Sirius-red staining and polarization microscopy distinguished between a strongly coagulated central zone and the transition zone to normal tissue. Sirius-red uptake was increased in both zones, reflecting the availability of new binding sites. The central zone appeared darker under polarization than normal collagen because of a loss of birefringence. Intrinsic birefringence was greatly reduced; however, form birefringence partly remained as long as some collagen fibrils were intact. In the center of very strong lesions, where the collagen was hyalinized, birefringence was completely lost because of the complete disintegration of the fibrillar structure, which was visible under TEM. The transition zone toward normal cornea showed increased birefringence because the natural birefringence was largely preserved and enhanced by the increased Sirius-red uptake. Mechanical stretching between neighboring LTK lesions was manifested by increased birefringence. Sirius red offered an improved and simple histologic method for analyzing thermal collagen changes. It may contribute to a better understanding of the working mechanisms of LTK and improve analysis of thermal effects in corneal ablation.",

AS-OCT underestimated CCT measurements when compared to other two devices in healthy subjects. Hence, one must be cautious when analyzing the results from different machines and should be aware that the measurement values are not interchangeable.",

In contrast to the commonly considered flow characterized by constant fluid flux, in the present problem the base flow is time dependent. We present a method to carry out consistently linear stability analysis, based on simultaneously solving the time evolution of the base flow and of the perturbations. The analysis is performed numerically by using a finite-difference method supplemented with an integral method developed here. The computations show that, after a short transient stage, imposed perturbations travel with the same velocity as the leading contact line. The spectral analysis of the modes evolution shows that their growth rates are, in general, time dependent. The wavelength of maximum amplitude, lambda_{max} , decreases with time until it reaches an asymptotic value which is in good agreement with experimental results. We also explore the dependence of lambda_{max} on the cross sectional fluid area A , and on the inclination angle alpha of the substrate. For considered small A 's, corresponding to small Bond numbers, we find that the dependence of lambda_{max} on A is in good agreement with experimental data. This dependence differs significantly from the one observed for the films characterized by much larger A 's and Bond numbers.

It has been found that the luminescence excitation spectrum and the polarization curve of poly(A) solution reveal a low-intensity electronic transition at about 320 nm which is red-shifted by approximately 0.9 eV from the maximum of the absorption spectrum at 260 nm. A model of two luminescent stacked forms is suggested. The difference in the ground state levels of these two stacked forms obtained from the temperature dependencies of the emissions is insignificant ( approximately 1 kcal/mol). This means a lowering of the excited state of the stacked form with the 320 nm/420 nm absorption/emission bands by approximately 0.9 eV as compared to the main form with the 260 nm/400 nm absorption/emission bands.

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01).

Depending on their refractive error, each participant was allocated into a myopic, hyperopic, or emmetropic group. The Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany), and the Sirius Scheimpflug topographer (Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Florence, Italy) were used to take all measurements. RESULTS The repeatability of these instruments to measure the anterior chamber depth, angle-to-angle, thinnest pachymetry, and both nasal and temporal angles was smaller than 0.15 mm, 0.40 mm, 10 µm, and 10 degrees, respectively.

The different variation sources involved in a quantitative study on amyloid and the interstain reproducibility between the results given by these 5 stains were analyzed. The volume fractions of amyloid after different stains were subjected to correlation analysis. In our test system about a third (34%) of the variation was due to the point counting method. Sirius red had the lowest and Congo red the highest variation due to point counting, since Sirius red gave the most intense staining and highest volume fractions for amyloid. The volume fractions were lowest in Congo red. About 40% of the total variation was composed of the field variation. This variation includes the variation due to variation between fields, field selection and subjective intraobserver variation. Sirius red showed the smallest field variation in respect to the total variation. Congo red, on the other hand, had the highest variation. The variation caused by pure interobserver variation is presented by the difference between total variation and the calculated field variation. This was largest with Sirius red and smallest with Congo red. The pure interobserver variation accounted for about 26% of the total variation. The high reproducibility with Sirius stain is most probably due to the high volume fractions of positively stained material after this stain, not to low interobserver variation.

Hydroxyproline and Sirius red based assays are the most common methods for collagen quantification. However, these procedures have some pitfalls, such as the requirement of oxygen-free medium or expensive equipment and large sample size or being unsuitable for hydrolyzed collagen, respectively. Our objective was to develop a specific, versatile, and user-friendly quantitative method applicable to small tissue samples and extracts obtained from elastin purification, therefore, suitable for simultaneous quantification of elastin. This method is based on the binding of Sirius red to collagen present in a sample immobilized on a PVDF membrane, as in the dot-blot technique, and quantified by a scanner and image analysis software. Sample loading, Sirius red concentration, temperature and incubation time, type of standard substance, albumin interference, and quantification time are optimized. The method enabled the quantification of (1) intact collagen in several rat tissue homogenates, including small resistance-sized arteries, (2) partially hydrolyzed collagen obtained from NaOH extracts, compatible with elastin purification, and (3) for the detection of differences in collagen content between hypertensive and normotensive rats. We conclude that the developed technique can be widely used since it is versatile (quantifies intact and hydrolyzed collagen), requires small sample volumes, is user-friendly (low-cost, easy to use, minimum toxic materials, and reduced time of test), and is specific (minimal interference with serum albumin).

This work introduces Sirius (System for the Integration of Retinal Images Understanding Services), a web-based system for image analysis in the retinal imaging field. Sirius provides a framework for ophthalmologists or other experts in the field to collaboratively work using retinal image-based applications in a distributed, fast and reliable environment. Sirius consists of three main components: the web client that users interact with, the web application server that processes all client requests and the service module that performs the image processing tasks. In this work, we present a service for the analysis of retinal microcirculation using a semi-automatic methodology for the computation of the arteriolar-to-venular ratio (AVR). Sirius has been evaluated in different real environments, involving health care systems, to test its performance. First, the AVR service was validated in terms of precision and efficiency and then, the framework was evaluated in different real scenarios of medical centers. Sirius is a web-based application providing a fast and reliable work environment for retinal experts.

In the present work, Au nanoparticles with different mean sizes (18, 32, 42, and 70 nm) are controllably fabricated in ethanol by changing the concentration of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and HAuCl4, as well as the power of continuous wave UV light at 365 nm. PVP acts as both reducing and protective agent. The mechanism of photoreduction of PVP to HAuCl4 is proposed. PVP undergoes a series of chemical reactions which include the attack of the hydrogen atom on the tertiary carbon atom at the α-position of the nitrogen atom, production of a hydroxyl radical, and chain scission. The hydroxyl radical combines with the hydrogen atom produced through the dissociation of HAuCl4, which facilitates the decomposition of HAuCl4. The fabrication mechanism of Au nanoparticles is discussed. The nonlinear absorption of these Au nanoparticles is investigated; all of them exhibit saturable absorption, and the saturable absorption dominates the nonlinear absorption with the increase of laser energy. The dominance of saturable absorption in the nonlinear absorption is due to the stronger single-photon absorbed intraband absorption from the ground state to the first excited state in the conduction band, the weaker excited state absorption in the conduction band, and the weaker two-photon absorption from the d band to the conduction band.

The molecules (numbered 1-4) considered in the present work are analogs of bis(phenylethynyl)bis(tributylphosphine)platinum(II) complexes. Molecule 1 carries two alkynyl-benzothiazolylfluorene ligands, and molecule 2 has two alkynyl-diphenylaminofluorene ligands bound to the central platinum atom.

The ligands have strong effective two-photon absorption cross-sections, while the heavy metal platinum centers give rise to efficient intersystem crossing to long-lived triplet states. Ultrafast transient absorption and emission spectra demonstrate that one-photon excitation of the chromophores produces an S1 state delocalized across the two conjugated ligands, with weak (excitonic) coupling through the platinum centers. Intersystem crossing occurs rapidly (Kisc approximately 1011 s-1) to produce the T1 state, which is possibly localized on a single conjugated fluorenyl ligand.

Femtosecond pulses were used to characterize the two-photon absorption properties of the complexes, and all of the chromophores are relatively efficient two-photon absorbers in the visible and near-infrared region of the spectrum (600-800 nm). The complexes exhibit maximum two-photon absorption at a shorter wavelength than 2lambda for the one-photon band, consistent with the dominant two-photon transition arising from a two-photon-allowed gerade-gerade transition.

The use of non-resonant single-photon ionization at 118.2 nm allows detection and velocity-map imaging of all fragments, regardless of their vibrotational or electronic state. The resulting photofragment kinetic energy and angular distributions and the quantum yields of ground-state and spin-orbit excited iodine fragments are in good agreement with previous studies employing state-selective detection via REMPI. The data are readily rationalised in terms of three competing dissociation mechanisms. The dominant excitation at all wavelengths studied is via a parallel transition to the (3)Q0 state, which either dissociates directly to give an alkyl radical partnered by spin-orbit excited iodine, or undergoes radiationless transfer to the (1)Q1 potential surface, where it dissociates to an alkyl radical partnered by iodine in its electronic ground state. Ground state iodine atoms can also be formed by direct dissociation from the (1)Q1 or (3)Q1 excited states following perpendicular excitation at the shorter and longer wavelength region, respectively, in the current range of interest. The extent of internal excitation of the alkyl fragment varies with dissociation mechanism, and is considerably higher for ethyl fragments from ethyl iodide photolysis than for methyl fragments from methyl iodide photolysis. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of single-photon vacuum-ultraviolet ionization relative to the more widely used REMPI detection schemes, and conclude, in agreement with others, that single-photon ionization is a viable detection method for photofragment imaging studies, particularly when studying large molecules possessing multiple fragmentation channels.

In this paper, we propose a switchable absorption device consisting of a Pd-capped Mg thin film deposited onto a near-zero-index substrate. By utilizing Mg's extreme optical changes upon hydrogenation and combining it with the high optical contrast of the near-zero-index substrate, we can create a device that is fully switchable from a highly reflective state to a broadband absorbing state. When modeling the substrate as a Drude material with a plasma wavelength of 600 nm, we calculate an absorption change of &gt; 70% from 650-1230 nm, with a peak total absorption of 78% at 905 nm. We experimentally demonstrate this effect using 25 nm of Mg with a 3 nm Pd capping layer deposited onto an ITO-coated glass substrate. This device achieves an absorption change of 76% at 1335 nm illumination, with a maximum absorption of 93% in the hydride state, utilizing ITO's near-zero-index region in the near-infrared. By tuning the near-zero-index region of the substrate, this effect can be extended from the visible through the infrared.",

No HF elimination is observed to occur by such means from the monomer of 3-FP, but it occurs with a small yield from the monomer of 2-FP. On the other hand, upon dimerization the reaction is triggered on for 3-FP, and for 2-FP it becomes so facile that no intact dimer cation survives and only the HF eliminated product ion appears in the mass spectra. Electronic structure calculation shows that in the cationic ground (D<sub0</sub) state, although the reaction for 2-FP dimer is exothermic, the associated barrier is significantly high (2.75 eV) and for its occurrence, absorption of three photons (2+1 type) is required. However, the reaction is predicted barrierless in the intermediate S<sub1</sub state of this dimer, and HF loss dimer cation mass peak could appear in the mass spectrum due to an effective two-photon (1+1) ionization process. In the case of 3-FP dimer, the energy barriers both in S<sub1</sub (neutral) and D<sub0</sub (ionic) states are high, and it is suggested that for occurrence of HF elimination, dimer cation needs to absorb an additional photon. For facilitation of HF loss from this dimer cation, a rearrangement of the geometry and formation of an intermediate adduct have been suggested, and it is argued that the latter could be produced by nucleophilic attack of the neutral moiety at the ortho site of the cationic counterpart.",

Two-color ion images were recorded at pump wavelengths of 355 nm, 266 nm and 248 nm, and one-color ion images at the REMPI wavelengths of ∼304 nm and ∼280 nm. Analysis of the ion images shows that, regardless of iodine spin-orbit state, ∼20% of the available energy is partitioned into translation E(T) at all excitation wavelengths indicating that the CH2I co-fragment is formed highly internally excited. The translational energy distributions comprise a slow, \"statistical\" component that peaks near zero and faster components that peak away from zero. The slow component makes an increasingly large contribution to the distribution as the excitation wavelength is decreased. The C-I bond dissociation energy of D0 = 2.155 ± 0.008 eV is obtained from the trend in the E(T) release of the faster components with increasing excitation energy. The I and I* ion images are anisotropic, indicating prompt dissociation, and are characterized by β parameters that become increasingly positive with increasing E(T). The decrease in β at lower translational energies can be attributed to deviation from axial recoil. MRCI calculations including spin-orbit coupling have been performed to identify the overlapping features in the absorption spectrum and characterize one-dimensional cuts through the electronically excited potential energy surfaces. The excited states are of significantly mixed singlet and triplet character.

This motivates the exploration of physical mechanisms for entangled photon generation, with a special interest in mechanisms that can be heralded, preferably at telecommunications wavelengths. Here we present a mechanism for the generation of heralded entangled photons from Rydberg atom cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). We propose a scheme to demonstrate the mechanism and quantify its expected performance. The heralding of the process enables non-destructive detection of the photon pairs. The entangled photons are produced by exciting a rubidium atom to a Rydberg state, from where the atom decays via two-photon emission (TPE). A Rydberg blockade helps to excite a single Rydberg excitation while the input light field is more efficiently collectively absorbed by all the atoms. The TPE rate is significantly enhanced by a designed photonic cavity, whose many resonances also translate into high-dimensional entanglement. The resulting high-dimensionally entangled photons are entangled in more than one degree of freedom: in all of their spectral components, in addition to the polarization-forming a hyper-entangled state, which is particularly interesting in high information capacity quantum communication.

The experimental method involved excitation with linearly and circularly polarized femtosecond pulses and time-resolved detection of the polarized fluorescence decay. The fluorescence intensity, anisotropy, excited state lifetime, and rotation diffusion time as function of the excitation light wavelength in the spectral range 385-510 nm were determined in experiment. The theoretical fit of the experimental results obtained demonstrated the contributions of six highly excited molecular states of different symmetry to the two-photon absorption intensity and fluorescence anisotropy. An intense two-photon absorption peak was observed experimentally in the spectral range 385-480 nm and explained as contributions from four high lying electronic excited states. The temporal dependence of fluorescence intensity in indole was satisfactory characterized by a single excited state lifetime τf and a single rotational diffusion time τrot. As shown, the excited state lifetime τf depends on the excitation light wavelength, which was explained by taking into account nonradiative relaxation transitions in the molecular vibronic excited states. The rotation diffusion time τrot was found to be equal to τrot = 0.9 ± 0.5 ns and practically independent of the excitation wavelength.

N-H bond fission via the low lying (1)pi sigma(*) electronic state of aniline is experimentally demonstrated. The (1)pi sigma(*) potential energy surface (PES) of this prototypical aromatic amine is essentially repulsive along the N-H stretch coordinate, but possesses a shallow potential well in the vertical Franck-Condon region, supporting quasibound vibrational levels. Photoexcitation at wavelengths (lambda(phot)) in the range 293.859 nm &gt; or = lambda(phot) &gt; or = 193.3 nm yields H atom loss via a range of mechanisms. With lambda(phot) resonant with the 1(1)pi pi(*) &lt;-- S(0) origin (293.859 nm), H atom loss proceeds via, predominantly, multiphoton excitation processes, resonantly enhanced at the one photon energy by the first (1)pi pi(*) excited state (the 1(1)pi pi(*) state). Direct excitation to the first few quasibound vibrational levels of the (1)pi sigma(*) state (at wavelengths in the range 269.513 nm &gt; or = lambda(phot) &gt; or = 260 nm) induces N-H bond fission via H atom tunneling through an exit barrier into the repulsive region of the (1)pi sigma(*) PES, forming anilino (C(6)H(5)NH) radical products in their ground electronic state, and with very limited vibrational excitation; the photo-prepared vibrational mode in the (1)pi sigma(*) state generally evolves adiabatically into the corresponding mode of the anilino radical upon dissociation. However, as the excitation wavelength is reduced (lambda(phot) &lt; 260 nm), N-H bond fission yields fragments with substantially greater vibrational excitation, rationalized in terms of direct excitation to 1(1)pi pi(*) levels, followed by coupling to the (1)pi sigma(*) PES via a 1(1)pi pi(*)/(1)pi sigma(*) conical intersection. Changes in product kinetic energy disposal once lambda(phot) approaches approximately 230 nm likely indicate that the photodissociation pathways of aniline proceed via direct excitation to the (higher) 2(1)pi pi(*) state. Analysis of the anilino fragment vibrational energy disposal-and thus the concomitant dynamics of (1)pi sigma(*) state mediated photodissociation-provides a particularly interesting study of competing sigma(*) &lt;-- pi and pi(*) &lt;-- pi absorption processes and develops our appreciation of the photochemistry of aromatic amines.

Ground state H atoms in an expanding Ar-H cascaded arc plasma are excited to the p=3 level using two-photon laser excitation at 205 nm. The resulting fluorescence is resolved in time with a fast photomultiplier tube to investigate the occurrence of quenching. A fluorescence decay time of (10+/-0.5) ns is measured under all circumstances, indicating that there is a complete l mixing of the p=3 sublevels. A time-resolved collisional radiative model is developed to model pulsed laser induced fluorescence for a large range of plasma parameters. The model calculations agree well with the experimental results over the entire range of conditions and indicate that two-photon LIF can strongly influence the local electron and ion densities, resulting in a \"self-quenching\" of the laser-induced H fluorescence.",

A fragment ion at m/z = 84 was produced by 2-photon absorption at wavelengths ≤232 nm and assigned to C3H4N2O(+) following CO abstraction. This ion has not been observed in alternative dissociative ionization processes (notably electron impact) and its threshold is close to recent calculations of the minimum activation energy for a ring opening conical intersection to a σ(n-π)π* closed shell state. Moreover, the predicted ring opening transition leaves a CO group at one end of the isomer, apparently vulnerable to abstraction. An MPI mass spectrum of uracil-water clusters is presented for the first time and compared with an equivalent dry measurement.

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients.

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles. As the FEV(1) quartile worsened (mean, 62%, 49%, 39%, and 27% predicted), functional residual capacity increased (144%, 151%, 164%, and 185% predicted), IC decreased (86%, 81%, 69%, and 60% predicted), and peak incremental cycle work rate decreased (66%, 55%, 50%, and 44% predicted); CWR endurance time was 9.7, 9.3, 8.2, and 7.3 min, respectively.

Dyspnea intensity at this inflection point was also similar across quartiles (3.1-3.7 Borg units) but accelerated steeply to intolerable levels thereafter.

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation. Stimulus-induced cortical hyperactivity persisted up to 1.5 h and decayed to baseline after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ indicated by c-Fos expression.

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors.

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10 keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000 nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions. This paper proposes a back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by the mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA) to construct a prediction model and evaluate the corresponding prediction effect. The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$. The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids.

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

The ESD by the KAP meter was an agreement within ±1.5% with that measured using the plane-parallel chamber for 10 × 10-30 × 30 cm2 fields with a source-surface distance of 75-150 cm.

Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected.

Also, mean estimates of genetic correlation between METP with live weight (LW), feed intake (FI), and residual feed intake (RFI) were 0.719, 0.598, and 0.408, respectively. The genetic correlations of CO<sub2</sub with performance traits varied from 0.641 (with RFI) to 0.833 (with FI; p &lt; 0.05).

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles.

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives.

A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV.

Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p &lt; 0.001). The expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p &lt; 0.05).

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039 kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57 $\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mol}/{\\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30 000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation. A first study ($\\mathrm{N}=30$) that focused on displaying cardiac activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort. A second study ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) that focused on respiratory activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort as well as two sub-components of the sense of embodiment. Interestingly, the user's actual breathing tended to synchronize with the simulated breathing, especially with the multi-sensory and haptic displays. A third study ($\\mathrm{N}=18$) that focused on the combination of cardiac and respiratory activity showed that combining both rendering techniques significantly enhances the sensation of effort. Taken together, our results promote the use of our novel breathing display technique and multi-sensory rendering of physiological parameters in VR applications where effort sensations are prominent, such as for rehabilitation, sport training, or exergames.",

Five New Zealand rabbits (2-3 kg) of clean grade, aged 3 months and male or female, were obtained. ADSCs were isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of inguinal region, and cultured with collagenase digestion, then were detected and identified by CD44, CD106 immunofluorescence staining and adipogenic differentiation. ADSCs at passage 3 were used and the cell density was adjusted to 1 x 10(5) cells/mL, then the cells were treated with common cultural medium (group A) and osteogenic induced medium containing 0 (group B), 1 x 10(-9) (group C), 1 x 10(-8) (group D), 1 x 10(-7) (group E), 1 x 10(-6) (group F), and 1 x 10(-5) mol/L (group G) dexamethasone, respectively. The cell proliferation and the mRNA expressions of osteocalcin (OC) and core binding factor alpha1 (Cbfalpha1) were detected by MTT and RT-PCR, respectively. The activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was measured, and the percentage of mineral area was calculated. The mineral nodules were also detected by alizarin red staining. ADSCs mostly presented fusiform and polygon shape with positive expression of CD44 and negative expression of CD106. The result of oil red O staining was positive after ADSCs treated with adipogenic induced medium. The result of MTT revealed that the absorbance (A) value declined with the ascending of the concentration of dexamethasone, and there was significant difference in A value between groups D and E at 5 and 7 days after osteogenic induction (P &lt; 0.05). The mRNA expressions of OC and Cbfal reached the peak in groups E and D at 7 days after osteogenic induction, respectively. The activity of ALP and the percentage of mineral area had the maximum value in group D at 14 days, then declined gradually. There was no significant difference in the mRNA expressions of OC and Cbfalpha1, the activity of ALP, and the percentage of mineral area between groups D and E (P &gt; 0.05), but significant differences were found between groups D and E and other groups (P &lt; 0.05).

The carbon compound lin-HCN (HCN=hydrogen cyanide) is 14.9 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HNC but the heavier group 14 homologues lin-HEN (E=Si-Pb) are between 64.8 and 71.5 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the lin-HNE isomers. The phosphorous system (H, P, E) exhibits significant differences concerning the geometry and stability of the equilibrium structures compared with the nitrogen system. The linear form lin-HEP of the former system is much more stable than lin-HPE. The molecule lin-HCP is the only minimum on the singlet PES. It is 78.5 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HPC, which is a second-order saddle point. The heavier homologues lin-HPE, in which E=Si-Pb, are also second-order saddle points, whereas the bent-HPE structures are the global minima on the PES. They are between 10.3 (E=Si) and 36.5 kcal mol(-1) (E=Pb) lower in energy than lin-HEP. The bent-HPE structures possess rather acute bending angles H-P-E between 60.1 (E=Si) and 79.7° (E=Pb).

The drastic energy differences between the isomers of the system (H, X, E) are explained with three factors that determine the relative stabilities of the energy minima: 1) The different bond strength between the hydrogen bonds H-X and H-E. 2) The electronic excitation energy of the fragment HE from the X (2)Π ground state to the (4)Σ(-) excited state, which is required to establish a E≡X triple bond in the molecules lin-HEX. 3) The strength of the intrinsic X-E interactions in the molecules.

A literature review yielded limited information on the differences between X(E) and X(H) in terms of chemical composition and content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The objective of this project was to characterize the chemical composition (x, y, z, a, b and c in C(x)H(y)O(z)N(a)P(b)S(c)) of the endogenous and the active fractions and EPS of activated sludge from well designed experiments. To isolate X(H) and X(E) in this study, activated sludge was generated in a 200L pilot-scale aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with a soluble and completely biodegradable synthetic influent of sodium acetate as the sole carbon source. This influent, which contained no influent unbiodegradable organic or inorganic particulate matter, allowed the generation of a sludge composed essentially of two fractions: heterotrophic biomass X(H) and an endogenous residue X(E), the nitrifying biomass being negligible. The endogenous decay rate and the active biomass fraction of the MBR sludge were determined in 21-day aerobic digestion batch tests by monitoring the VSS and OUR responses. Fractions of X(H) and X(E) were respectively 68% and 32% in run 1 (MBR at 5.2 day SRT) and 59% and 41% in run 2 (MBR at 10.4 day SRT). The endogenous residue was isolated by subjecting the MBR sludge to prolonged aerobic batch digestion for 3 weeks, and was characterized in terms of (a) elemental analysis for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur; and (b) content of EPS. The MBR sludge was characterized using the same procedures (a and b). Knowing the proportions of X(H) and X(E) in this sludge, it was possible to characterize X(H) by back calculation. Results from this investigation showed that the endogenous residue had a chemical composition different from that of the active biomass with a lower content of inorganic matter (1:4.2), of nitrogen (1:2.9), of phosphorus (1:5.3) and of sulphur (1:3.2) but a similar content of carbon (1:0.98). Based on these elemental analyses, chemical composition formulae for X(H) and X(E) were determined as CH(1.240)O(0.375)N(0.200)P(0.0172)S(0.0070) and CH(1.248)O(0.492)N(0.068)P(0.0032)S(0.0016), respectively. Data from EPS analyses also confirmed this difference in structure between X(E) and X(H) with an EPS content of 11-17% in X(E)versus 26-40% in X(H).",

The TASMIP is not semi-empirical and uses no physical assumptions regarding x-ray production, but rather interpolates measured constant potential x-ray spectra published by Fewell et al. [Handbook of Computed Tomography X-ray Spectra (U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1981)]. X-ray output measurements (mR/mAs measured at 1 m) were made on a calibrated constant potential generator in our laboratory from 50 kV to 124 kV, and with 0-5 mm added aluminum filtration. The Fewell spectra were slightly modified (numerically hardened) and normalized based on the attenuation and output characteristics of a constant potential generator and metal-insert x-ray tube in our laboratory. Then, using the modified Fewell spectra of different kVs, the photon fluence phi at each 1 keV energy bin (E) over energies from 10 keV to 140 keV was characterized using polynomial functions of the form phi (E) = a0[E] + a1[E] kV + a2[E] kV2 + ... + a(n)[E] kVn. A total of 131 polynomial functions were used to calculate accurate x-ray spectra, each function requiring between two and four terms. The resulting TASMIP algorithm produced x-ray spectra that match both the quality and quantity characteristics of the x-ray system in our laboratory. For photon fluences above 10% of the peak fluence in the spectrum, the average percent difference (and standard deviation) between the modified Fewell spectra and the TASMIP photon fluence was -1.43% (3.8%) for the 50 kV spectrum, -0.89% (1.37%) for the 70 kV spectrum, and for the 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130 and 140 kV spectra, the mean differences between spectra were all less than 0.20% and the standard deviations were less than approximately 1.1%. The model was also extended to include the effects of generator-induced kV ripple. Finally, the x-ray photon fluence in the units of photons/mm2 per mR was calculated as a function of HVL, kV, and ripple factor, for various (water-equivalent) patient thicknesses (0, 10, 20, and 30 cm). These values may be useful for computing the detective quantum efficiency, DQE(f), of x-ray detector systems.

Since a considerable amount of data are published about cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals, calculations were made for this species and related ring-opened products as a reference for 2 and 3 and their reactions. Radicals 1-3 have practical utility as \"radical clocks\" that can be used to time other radical reactions. Radical 3 is of further interest in photoelectron-transfer processes where the back-electron-transfer process may be suppressed by rapid ring opening. Calculations have been carried out at the UHF/6-31G*, MP4//MP2/6-31G*, DFT B3LYP/6-31G*, and CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//QCISD/cc-pVDZ levels. Energies are corrected to 298 K, and the barriers between species are reported in terms of Arrhenius E(a) and log A values along with differences in enthalpies, free energies, and entropies. The CCSD(T)-calculated energy barrier for ring opening of 1 is E(a) = 9.70, DeltaG* = 8.49 kcal/mol, which compares favorably to the previously calculated value of E(a) = 9.53 kcal/mol by the G2 method, but is higher than an experimental value of 7.05 kcal/mol. Our CCSD(T)-calculated E(a) value is also higher by 1.8 kcal/mol than a previously reported CBS-RAD//B3LYP/6-31G* calculation. The cyclopropoxy radical has a very small barrier to ring opening (CCSD(T), E(a) = 0.64 kcal/mol) and should be a very sensitive time clock. Of the three series studied, the cyclopropylaminium radical cation is most complex. In agreement with experimental data, bisected cyclopropylaminium radical cation is not found, but instead a ring-opened species is found. A perpendicular cyclopropylaminium radical cation (4) was found as a transition-state structure. Rotation of the 2p orbital in 4 to the bisected array results in ring opening. The minimum onset energy of photoionization of cyclopropylamine was calculated to be 201.5 kcal/mol (CCSD(T)) compared to experimental values of between about 201 and 204 kcal/mol. Calculations were made on the closely related cyclopropylcarbinyl and bicyclobutonium cations. Stabilization of the bisected cyclopropylcarbinyl conformer relative to the perpendicular species is much greater for the cations (29.1 kcal/ mol, QCISD) compared to the radicals (3.10 kcal/mol, QCISD). A search was made for analogues to the bicyclobutonium cation in the radical series 1 and 2 and the radical cation series 3. No comparable species were found. A rationale was made for some conflicting calculations involving the cyclopropylcarbinyl and bicyclobutonium cations. The order of stability of the cyclopropyl-X radicals was calculated to be X = CH2 &gt;&gt; X = O &gt; X = NH2+, where the latter species has no barrier for ring opening. The relative rate of ring opening for cyclopropyl-X radicals X = CH2 to X = O was calculated to be 3.1 x 10(6) s(-1) at 298 K (QCISD).",

The [(13)C]-acetate breath test (ABT) quantifies gastric emptying as the half [(13)CO(2)]-excretion time (T(1/2b)), but T(1/2b) differs from the scintigraphic half-emptying time (T(1/2s)). The aims of the present study were to accurately determine the half-emptying time by ABT with Wagner-Nelson analysis (T(1/2WN)), to compare T(1/2WN) with T(1/2s) and to validate the Wagner-Nelson strategy in ABT. 2. For a comparative study, eight volunteers simultaneously underwent ABT and scintigraphy. Anterior images were acquired and breath samples were collected every 15 min for 4.0 h after ingestion of a 200 kcal liquid meal labelled with 37 MBq [(99m)Tc]-colloidal sulphur and 100 mg [(13)C]-acetate. For the validation experiment, another six volunteers underwent ABT, on two randomized occasions, using the 200 kcal liquid meal with 100 mg [(13)C]-acetate. On either of the two occasions, a gel-forming agent was stirred into the meal to intentionally delay gastric emptying by increasing meal viscosity. Breath samples were collected at regular 15 min intervals for 4 h post ingestion. 3. The Wagner-Nelson equation for ABT is F(t) = (A(breath)(t) + C(t)/0.65)/A(breath)(infinity), where F(t) is a fractional dose of the [(13)C] label emptied, C(t) is the [(13)CO(2)] excretion (% dose/h), A(breath)(t) is the area under the C(t) curve (% dose) and A(breath)(infinity) is the ultimate [(13)CO(2)] recovery in breath (% dose). The percentage gastric retention was estimated as 100 x (1 - F(t)). The time plots of scintigraphic activity and 100 x (1 - F(t)) were fitted to y(t) = 100 x e(-Kxt), K values were estimated mathematically for each plot by regression analysis and T(1/2s) and T(1/2WN) were calculated as (ln2)/K. The time versus pulmonary [(13)CO(2)] excretion plots were fitted to z(t) = m x k x beta x e(-kt)(1 - e(-kxt))(beta-1), where m, k and beta are constants; T(1/2b) was calculated as -(ln(1 - 2(-1/beta))]/k. 4. Values of T(1/2WN) were closer to T(1/2s) than T(1/2b), although T(1/2WN) and T(1/2b) yielded significant under- and overestimation of T(1/2s), respectively. The high viscosity meal significantly prolonged T(1/2WN) and T(1/2b); T(1/2WN) could detect the delayed transit of the viscous meal more sensitively than T(1/2b). 5.

Numerical evidence has established a similar asymptotic convergence approximately X(-3) with the cardinal number X of correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pVXZ for coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) and second order perturbation theory (MP2) calculations of molecules. The main focus of this article is to probe for deviations from asymptotic convergence behavior for practical values of X by defining a trial function X(-beta) that for an effective exponent beta=beta(eff)(X,X+1,X+N) provides the correct energy E(X+N), when extrapolating from results for two smaller basis sets, E(X) and E(X+1). This analysis is first applied to \"model\" expansions available from analytical theory, and then to a large body of finite basis set results (X=D,T,Q,5,6) for 105 molecules containing H, C, N, O, and F, complemented by a smaller set of 14 molecules for which accurate complete basis set limits are available from MP2-R12 and CCSD-R12 calculations. beta(eff) is generally found to vary monotonically with the target of extrapolation, X+N, making results for large but finite basis sets a useful addition to the limited number of cases where complete basis set limits are available. Significant differences in effective convergence behavior are observed between MP2 and CCSD (valence) correlation energies, between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-free molecules, and, for He, between partial-wave expansions and correlation-consistent basis sets. Deviations from asymptotic convergence behavior tend to get smaller as X increases, but not always monotonically, and are still quite noticeable even for X=5. Finally, correlation contributions to atomization energies (rather than total energies) exhibit a much larger variation of effective convergence behavior, and extrapolations from small basis sets are found to be particularly erratic for molecules containing several electronegative atoms. Observed effects are discussed in the light of results known from analytical theory. A carefully calibrated protocol for extrapolations to the complete basis set limit is presented, based on a single \"optimal\" exponent beta(opt)(X,X+1,infinity) for the entire set of molecules, and compared to similar approaches reported in the literature.",

In this work, we have evaluated four dosimeters (ionization chambers and solid state detectors) in their suitability for relative dosimetry of kilovoltage x-ray beams in the energy range of 50 - 280kVp. The solid state detectors, which have not been investigated with low energy x-rays, were the PTW 60019 microDiamond synthetic diamond detector and the PTW 60012 diode. The two ionization chambers used were the PTW Advanced Markus parallel plate chamber and the PTW PinPoint small volume chamber. For each of the dosimeters, percentage depth doses were measured in water over the full range of x-ray beams and for field sizes ranging from 2cm diameter to 12 × 12cm. In addition, depth doses were measured for a narrow aperture (7mm diameter) using the PTW microDiamond detector. For comparison, the measured data was compared with Monte Carlo calculated doses using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo package. The depth dose results indicate that the Advanced Markus parallel plate and PinPoint ionization chambers were suitable for depth dose measurements in the beam quality range with an uncertainty of less than 3%, including in the regions closer to the surface of the water as compared with Monte Carlo depth dose data for all six energy beams. The response of the PTW Diode E detector was accurate to within 4% for all field sizes in the energy range of 50-125kVp but showed larger variations for higher energies of up to 12% with the 12 × 12cm field size. In comparison, the microDiamond detector had good agreement over all energies for both smaller and larger field sizes generally within 1% as compared to the Advanced Markus chamber field and Monte Carlo calculations. The only exceptions were in measuring the dose at the surface of the water phantom where larger differences were found. For the 7mm diameter field, the agreement between the microDiamond detector and Monte Carlo calculations was good being better than 1% except at the surface. Based on these results, the PTW microDiamond detector has shown to be a suitable detector for relative dosimetry of low energy x-ray beams over a wide range of x-ray beam energies.",

While the dependence on ρ(e) is known to be linear, that of Z(eff) is found to follow a power law (Z(eff))(x) which makes it very sensitive to the index \"x\". Several different values, lying between 3 and 4 have been suggested for the exponent x, in the existing literature. The purpose of the present investigations is to ascertain empirically the value that should be assigned to x. This is done by measuring the HU value of different mixtures, having different values for ρ(e) and Z(eff) (calculated from their known chemical compositions) and thus determining the dependence of their attenuation coefficients (μ) on the above two quantities. The experimental results show the dependence of μ on Z(eff) to be of the power law type, [ρ(e)(Z(eff))(x)/E(y)], where y = 3.0669 but no single value for the index x, can be assigned to fit the observed data. It is seen in different mixtures that the value of x predominantly decreases as Z(eff) increases from 7.5 to 12. This result points out that very large errors can occur in calculating Z(eff) from the values of μ if a fixed value for x is used. The importance of this result to dual energy computed tomography is pointed out and it is concluded that the proper values for x are required to be incorporated in the inversion algorithms, for the different regimes of Z(eff).",

It was first exclusively used in the livestock sector as cattle feed. The grass is characterized by its high productivity and photosynthetic capacity and is considered as an alternative source of renewable energy. Here, we estimated the general combining ability of the parents and specific combining ability of the hybrids based on morpho-agronomic biomass-quality traits. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with 3 replicates. The diallel was composed of 16 hybrids and 2 groups of genitors. In the diallel analysis of variance, we observed a significant difference among treatments. A significant difference was observed among genitors for dry matter production (DMP). For the general combining ability of group 1, the traits leaf blade width, DMP, height, percentage of neutral detergent fiber, percentage of hemicellulose, percentage of lignin, percentage of acid detergent fiber, and percentage of cellulose were significant. For the estimates of general combining ability of DMP, parents Porto Rico 534-B, Vruckwona, Taiwan A-146, and Mercker S. E. A. were 0.4748, 3.2819, 1.1659, and 0.4317. The parents of Mercker S. E.

For the first time, it is applied to the detection of analytes extracted by molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) in a thin-film format. MIPs formed with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as the template were used for the extraction of this analyte from aqueous solutions spiked at concentrations of 0.0050-2.0 mg L(-1) (approximately 2 x 10(-8) to approximately 1 x 10(-5) M). The response was linear up to 0.50 mg L(-1), and then levelled off due to saturation of the active sites of the MIP. In MS/MS mode, the signal at 0.0050 mg L(-1) was still an order of magnitude higher than the signal of a blank. The MIP DESI-MS approach was also used for the analysis of tap water and river water spiked with 2,4-D and four analogues, which indicated that these analogues were also extracted to various extents.

A total of 28 patients with gynecological tumors treated with radioactive seed implantation in Hebei General Hospital from January 2016 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Twelve patients (template group) were guided by 3D-PT and the remaining 16 patients (traditional group) were guided by computed tomography (CT) with traditional technique. Preoperative treatment plan (preplan) was completed through a treatment planning system. In the template group, 3D-PT was printed according to preplan and seeds were implanted under the guidance of 3D-PT and CT. In the traditional group, seeds were implanted under the guidance of single CT directly according to the preplan. Postoperative verification plan (post-plan) was completed. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) was calculated and D80, D90, V90, V100, and V150 were obtained according to DVH. Then, deviation of the dosimetric parameters D80, D90, V90, V100, and V150 between the preplan and postplan were compared within the two groups. The difference and percentage of difference of the above dosimetric parameters between the preplan and postplan within the two groups were calculated using the formula X<subd</sub = X<subpost-plan-</sub X<subpre-plan</sub, and X<subd</sub% = (X<subpost-plan-</sub X<subpre-plan</sub)/X<subpre-plan</sub × 100%.

The result of the curative effect after 2 months were as follows: the local control rate and effective rate of the template group were 100% (12/12) and 83.3% (10/12), while those of the traditional group were 100% (16/16) and 81.2% (13/16).

The second objective is to reinvestigate the sensitivity of the calculated dose distributions to variations in the primary electron beam parameters. The GEPTS Monte Carlo code is used for photon beam simulations and dose calculations. The linear accelerator geometric models are based on (i) manufacturer specifications, (ii) corrections made by Chibani and Ma [\"On the discrepancies between Monte Carlo dose calculations and measurements for the 18 MV Varian photon beam,\" Med. Phys. 34, 1206-1216 (2007)], and (iii) more recent drawings. Measurements were performed using pinpoint and Farmer ionization chambers, depending on the field size. Phase space calculations for small fields were performed with and without angle-based photon splitting. In addition to the three commonly used primary electron beam parameters (E(AV) is the mean energy, FWHM is the energy spectrum broadening, and R is the beam radius), the angular divergence (theta) of primary electrons is also considered. The calculated and measured dose distributions agreed to within 1% local difference at any depth beyond 1 cm for different energies and for field sizes varying from 2 x 2 to 35 x 35 cm2. In the penumbra regions, the distance to agreement is better than 0.5 mm, except for 15 MV (0.4-1 mm). The measured and calculated output factors agreed to within 1.2%. The 6, 10, and 18 MV beam models use theta = 0 degrees, while the 4 and 15 MV beam models require theta = 0.5 degrees and 0.6 degrees, respectively. The parameter sensitivity study shows that varying the beam parameters around the solution can lead to 5% differences with measurements for small (e.g., 2 x 2 cm2) and large (e.g., 35 x 35 cm2) fields, while a perfect agreement is maintained for the 10 x 10 cm2 field. The influence of R on the central-axis depth dose and the strong influence of theta on the lateral dose profiles are demonstrated. Dose distributions for very small and very large fields were proved to be more sensitive to variations in E(AV), R, and theta in comparison with the 10 x 10 cm2 field. Monte Carlo beam models need to be validated for a wide range of field sizes including small field sizes (e.g., 2 x 2 cm2).",

The advantage of a method using conventional radiographs has led us to look for an original technology to estimate X-ray bone density from routine radiographs using both soft tissues and prostheses as X-ray absorptiometric phantoms. In theory, this calculation requires several approximations. An experimental study based on 40 subjects aimed at determining the rate of error due to these approximations. Three radiographs were made for every subject with very different exposure settings. They were computerized by a CCD camera to measure the grey levels (256 scale) of soft tissue and prosthesis, as well as variations in contrast. The statistical analysis showed that when comparing X-ray bone density on different routine radiographs, the percentage of error could be lower than 10% but only under these conditions: (a) grey levels of soft tissue &gt; 26; (b) grey levels of prosthesis &lt; 212; (c) variation of contrast between radiographs &gt; 0.79; (d) radiographs made with the same incidence, and (e) weight of the subject remaining constant during the whole period. It therefore seems possible to compare retrospectively the cortical X-ray bone density from routine radiographs, and to quantify bone remodelling around total hip arthroplasty, but only for the same subject.",

Methods considered were: 1) the maximum likelihood lod-score (MLS), based on the distribution of parental alleles identical by descent (IBD) in affected sibs; 2) the sum of the MLS (sMLS) calculated in affected sib-pairs with 2, 1, or 0 sibs exposed; 3) the predivided sample test (PST), which compares the IBD distribution between affected sib-pairs with 2, 1, or 0 sibs exposed; 4) the triangle test statistic (TTS), which uses the IBD distribution among discordant affected sib-pairs (one exposed, one unexposed); and 5) the mean interaction test (MIT), based on the regression of the proportion of alleles shared IBD among affected sib-pairs on the exposure among sib-pairs. The MLS, sMLS, and MIT allow detection of linkage. However, the sMLS and MIT account for a possible G x E interaction without testing it. In contrast, the PST and the TTS allow detection of both linkage and G x E interaction. Results showed that when exposure cancels the effect of the gene, or changes the direction of this effect (i.e., the protective allele becomes the risk allele), the PST, sMLS, and MIT may provide, under some models, greater power to detect linkage than the MLS. Under models where exposure changes the direction of the effect of the gene, the TTS test may also be more powerful than the other tests accounting for G x E interaction. Under the other models, the MLS remains the most powerful test to detect linkage. However, only the PST and TTS allow the detection of G x E interaction.",

PDDs were measured with TLDs, plane parallel and cylindrical ionization chambers and beam profiles with films. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations by means of the PENELOPE code were performed. Four different field sizes (10 x 10, 5 x 5, 2 x 2, and 1 x 1 cm2) and two lung equivalent materials (CIRS, p(w)e=0.195 and St. Bartholomew Hospital, London, p(w)e=0.244-0.322) were studied. The performance of four correction-based algorithms and one based on convolution-superposition was analyzed. The correction-based algorithms were the Batho, the Modified Batho, and the Equivalent TAR implemented in the Cadplan (Varian) treatment planning system and the TMS Pencil Beam from the Helax-TMS (Nucletron) treatment planning system. The convolution-superposition algorithm was the Collapsed Cone implemented in the Helax-TMS. The only studied calculation methods that correlated successfully with the measured values with a 2% average inside all media were the Collapsed Cone and the Monte Carlo simulation. The biggest difference between the predicted and the delivered dose in the beam axis was found for the EqTAR algorithm inside the CIRS lung equivalent material in a 2 x 2 cm2 18 MV x-ray beam. In these conditions, average and maximum difference against the TLD measurements were 32% and 39%, respectively. In the water equivalent part of the phantom every algorithm correctly predicted the dose (within 2%) everywhere except very close to the interfaces where differences up to 24% were found for 2 x 2 cm2 18 MV photon beams. Consistent values were found between the reference detector (ionization chamber in water and TLD in lung) and Monte Carlo simulations, yielding minimal differences (0.4%+/-1.2%).

The purpose was to identify whether the erectile tissue mechanical property, cavernosal expandability, correlated with the percentage of trabecular smooth muscle content in an animal model of hypercholesterolemia and ischemic-induced corporal fibrosis. New Zealand White rabbits (6 to 7 months old, 3 to 3.5 kg.), were divided into control (n = 7), hypercholesterolemic (n = 5, 0.5% cholesterol diet) and atherosclerotic groups (n = 8, 0.5% cholesterol diet with balloon de-endothelialization). At 16 weeks, the corpora cavernosa were removed en bloc and submerged in physiologic salt solution, and volume-pressure data were plotted at 20 mm. Hg pressure intervals under trabecular smooth muscle relaxation. Cavernosal expandability, X, (the measure of the ability to achieve high corporal expansion at relatively low intracavernosal pressure) and tunical distensibility, V(E)/V(F), (relative volume of fully erect to flaccid penis) were calculated. Erectile tissue was assessed by computer-assisted color histomorphometry with Masson's trichrome stained sections (30 to 45 high power fields/animal) to assess percentage of trabecular smooth muscle content. The overall mean percentage of trabecular smooth muscle content and mean cavernosal expandability values were 45.4 +/- 1.6, 39.2 +/- 0.9, 33.9 +/- 0.6 and 0.0165 +/- 3.04 x 10(-3), 0.0116 +/- 1.63 x 10(-3), 0.0118 +/- 1.26 x 10(-3) mm.

The erectile tissue mechanical property, cavernosal expandability, correlated with erectile tissue structural quality.

The monodentate Lewis acids EX(3) and the bidentate Lewis acids E(2) X(n) bind N-heterocyclic carbenes rather strongly in donor-acceptor complexes [(NHC)(EX(3))] and [(NHC)(2)(E(2)X(n))]. The equilibrium structures of the bidentate complexes depend on the electronic reference state of E(2)X(n), which may vary for different atoms E and X. All complexes [(NHC)(2)(E(2)X(4))] possess C(s) symmetry in which the NHC ligands bind in a trans conformation to the group 13 atoms E. The complexes [(NHC)(2)(E(2)H(2))] with E=B, Al, Ga have also C(s) symmetry with a trans arrangement of the NHC ligands and a planar CE(H)E(H)C moiety that has a E=E π bond. In contrast, the indium complex [(NHC)(2)(In(2) H(2))] has C(i) symmetry with pyramidal-coordinated In atoms in which the hydrogen atoms are twisted above and below the CInInC plane. The latter C(i) form is calculated for all chloride systems [(NHC)(2)(E(2)Cl(2))], but the boron complex [(NHC)(2)(B(2)Cl(2))] deviates only slightly from C(s) symmetry. The B(2) fragment in the linear coordinated complex [(NHC)(2)(B(2))] has a highly excited (3)(1)Σ(g)(-) reference state, which gives an effective B≡B triple bond with a very short interatomic distance. The heavier homologues [(NHC)(2)(E(2))] (E=Al to In) exhibit a anti-periplanar arrangement of the NHC ligands in which the E(2) fragments have a (1)(1) Δ(g) reference state and an E=E double bond. The calculated energies suggest that the dihydrogen release from the complexes [(NHC)(EH(3))] and [(NHC)(2)(E(2)H(n))] becomes energetically more favourable when atom E becomes heavier. The indium complexes should therefore be the best candidates of the investigated series for hydrogen-storage systems that could potentially deliver dihydrogen at close to ambient temperature. The hydrogenation reaction of the dimeric magnesium(I) compound [LMgMgL] (L=β-diketiminate) with [(NHC)(EH(3))] becomes increasingly exothermic with the trend B&lt;Al&lt;Ga&lt;In.",

For these irradiation conditions, which are appropriate for the diagnostic application of mammography X-rays, a coefficient alpha of (5.88+/-0.66) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) of the linear quadratic dose-response relationship was determined. This value does not differ significantly from the coefficient alpha of (6.55+/-0.97) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) obtained earlier for a free-in-air set-up using blood of the same donor. The results are interpreted in terms of both the energy distributions of the photon fluence of mammography X-rays free-in-air and those in the PMMA phantom. Based on earlier results of experiments with monochromatic X-rays in the energy range 1.83-40 keV (completed here by an additional measurement at 25 keV), a fit function alpha(E) to the measured alpha coefficients as a function of the energy E of monochromatic X-rays was used to calculate weighted mean values alpha for both the mammography X-ray spectra free-in-air and in the phantom. As a result, weighted mean values of (4.9+/-1.0) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) and (4.5+/-1.0) x 10(-2) Gy(-1) were obtained, respectively. Although the measured alpha coefficients for mammography X-rays appear to be systematically higher than those calculated as weighted mean values alpha, it can be concluded that the modification of the mammography X-ray spectrum to a depth of 13.5 mm in a PMMA phantom compared with the free-in-air spectrum has no significant influence on the dicentric yields in human lymphocytes.",

Our goal is to quantify the inherent lag and ghosting of a-Se photoconductor as a function of imaging conditions. Two small area electroded a-Se samples, one positively and the other negatively biased on the entrance side of x rays, were used in the experiments. The study of lag and ghosting was performed by delivering a number of raw exposures as experienced in screening mammography to the samples at different electric field strength E(Se) while measuring the current through the a-Se sample. Ghosting at different operational conditions was quantified as the percentage x-ray sensitivity (x-ray generated photocurrent measured from the sample) reduction compared to before irradiation. Lag was determined by measuring the residual current of a-Se at a given time after the end of each x-ray exposure. Both lag and ghosting were measured as a function of E(Se) and cumulative exposure. The values of E(Se) used in our experiments ranged from 1 to 20 V/microm. It was found that ghosting increases with exposure and decreases with E(Se) for both samples because of the dominant effect of recombination between trapped electrons and x-ray generated holes. Lag on the other hand has different dependence on E(Se) and cumulative exposure. At E(Se) &lt; or = 10 V/microm, the first frame lag for both samples changed slowly with cumulative exposure, with a range of 0.2%-1.7% for the positively biased sample and 0.5%-8% for the negatively biased sample. Overall the positively biased sample has better temporal performance than the negatively biased sample due to the lower density of trapped electrons. The impact of time interval between exposures on the temporal performance was also investigated. Recovery of ghosting with longer time interval was observed, which was attributed to the neutralization of trapped electrons by injected holes through dark current.",

In response to the surging suspicions of systematic distortion, we challenge the notion of chance capitalization as a possible contributor. Beyond qualifying multiple testing as a mere methodological issue that, if uncorrected, leads to chance capitalization, we advance towards illustrating the potential benefits of multiple tests in understanding equivocal evidence in genetics literature. We focused on the interaction between the serotonin-transporter-linked promotor region (5-HTTLPR) and childhood adversities with regard to depression. After testing 2160 interactions with all relevant measures available within the Dutch population study of adolescents TRAILS, we calculated percentages of significant (p &lt; .05) effects for several subsets of regressions. Using chance capitalization (i.e. overall significance rate of 5% alpha and randomly distributed findings) as a competing hypothesis, we expected more significant effects in the subsets of regressions involving: 1) interview-based instead of questionnaire-based measures; 2) abuse instead of milder childhood adversities; and 3) early instead of later adversities. Furthermore, we expected equal significance percentages across 4) male and female subsamples, and 5) various genotypic models of 5-HTTLPR. We found differences in the percentages of significant interactions among the subsets of analyses, including those regarding sex-specific subsamples and genetic modeling, but often in unexpected directions. Overall, the percentage of significant interactions was 7.9% which is only slightly above the 5% that might be expected based on chance. Taken together, multiple testing provides a novel approach to better understand equivocal evidence on G x E, showing that methodological differences across studies are a likely reason for heterogeneity in findings - but chance capitalization is at least equally plausible.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the estimated fluid volumes calculated, either by the Modified Brooke or the Parkland formulas, and actual volumes received. From November 2005 to December 2008, 105 patients were globally evacuated with &gt;20% TBSA burns, of whom 73 had burn flow sheets initiated. Of these, 58 had completed burn flow sheets. Total fluids administered in the first 24-hour period for each patient were recorded. Chart reviews were performed to extract demographic and clinical outcomes data. Of the 58, the modified Brooke formula was used in 31 patients (modified Brooke group) to estimate 24-hour fluid requirements and the Parkland formula was used in 21 (Parkland group). In six, 3 mL x kg(-1) x %TBSA(-1) was used and were excluded from analysis. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for age, %TBSA burned, inhalation injury, or Injury Severity Score.

The total 120 min period of work was divided into four work intervals, 30 min each. There were 5-min breaks between the individual intervals. The load on the ergometer was selected in the range of 25 to 150 W, Tg=20 to 40 degrees C, rh=40 to 80% and v(a)=0.2 to 1.5 m x s(-1). The thermal resistance of the working suit was 0.65 clo at stage A, 1.07 clo at stage B and 0.81 clo at stage E. A total of 200 experiments with 50 combinations of the work and climate loads were made. The heart rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, body temperature, skin temperature, water loss by sweating and perspiration, dry and wet bulb air temperature, air velocity and globe temperature were measured during the experiments. The expected production of sweat (SR) and the amount of accumulated heat in the body (Qmax) were calculated for each combination of the work-climate conditions by a computing program ISO 7933:1989 as well as by our own program. Good agreement was reached between the measured and predicted SR values, calculated by the ISO program (r=0.871) as well as between the values calculated by the two programs, respectively (r=0.985). The experimental results have shown good agreement between the predicted and actually measured values of temperature of the body core as an index of short-term tolerable climate load. The values of short-term tolerable time of work calculated at the level of accumulated heat in the body of 50 W x h x m(-2) resulted in an increase of body core temperature by 0.8 to 1.0 K. The values of heart rate did not mostly exceed 140 beats/min, reaching in exceptional (three) cases values above 150 beats/min. The authors recommend to limit the long-term work-heat (climatic) load during a higher metabolic rate (M &gt;80 W x m(-2) including the basal metabolic rate) of acclimatized males and females at a sweat rate SR=270 g x h(-1) x m(-2), of non-acclimatized persons at SR=206 g x h(-1) x m(-2). The limit for low metabolic rates (M &lt; or = 80 W x m(-2)) for non-acclimatized and acclimatized persons is proposed for long-term tolerable loads of SR=147 g x h(-1) x m(-2).

Stabilization energy of [X(H(2)O)(n)](-) clusters is defined as the difference between the vertical photodeachment energy of the cluster and the electron affinity of the isolated halide. On one hand, a study about the relation between cluster structure and the E(stab)(n) value, as well as the dependence of the latter with temperature is performed, on the other hand, a test on the reliability of our recently developed first-principles halide ion-water interaction potentials is carried out. Two different approximations were applied: (1) the Koopmans' theorem and (2) calculation of the difference between the interaction energy of [X(H(2)O)(n)](-) and [X(H(2)O)(n)] clusters using the same ab initio interaction potentials. The developed methodology allows for using the same interaction potentials in the case of the ionic and neutral clusters with the proviso that the charge of the halide anion was switched off in the latter. That is, no specific parametrization of the interaction potentials to fit the magnitude under study was done. The good agreement between our predicted E(stab)(n) and experimental data allows us to validate the first-principles interaction potentials developed elsewhere and used in this study, and supports the fact that this magnitude is mainly determined by electrostatic factors, which can be described by our interaction potentials. No relation between the value of E(stab)(n) and the structure of clusters has been found. The diversity of E(stab)(n) values found for different clusters with similar interaction energy indicates the need for statistical information to properly estimate the stabilization energy of the halide anions. The effect of temperature in the prediction of the E(stab)(n) is not significant as long as it was high enough to avoid cluster trapping into local equilibrium configurations which guarantees an appropriate sampling of the configurational space. Parallel tempering method was applied in particular cases to guarantee satisfactory sampling of clusters at low temperature.",

X-ray procedures are considered as justified only when expected benefits exceed related risks. While benefits are well known to physicians, radiological risk awareness can be vague, impeding an optimal communication with patients' parents and possibly leading to discomfort and anxiety. Objective of the study is the suggestion of a risk comparison approach for better communicating the radiological risks related to X-ray investigation of scoliosis. Starting point of the analysis is the Linear Non-Threshold (LNT) assumption for radiation stochastic effect, which states that for effective doses (E, Sievert - Sv) below 100 mSv, the probability of future stochastic damage is linearly related to E: absorbing two E's in separate moments results in the addition of the risks related to each E. This allows to add E from different sources to calculate a cumulative risk of health detriment. Medline (Pubmed) was systematically searched in order to determine the average E delivered during X-ray investigation of scoliosis. Subsequently, the major natural sources of radiation were considered. The average yearly E due to natural sources was compared with E due to the imaging of the vertebral column. E's due to X-ray scoliosis examinations show a large variability: under 7 years of age, 0.03-0.54 mSv; 7-12 years, 0.11-0.80 mSv; 13-18 years, 0.17-1.09 mSv. Overall, 65% of the world population is expected to be exposed to an annual E between 1 and 3 mSv. More in detail, worldwide the total annual average E due to natural sources is 2.4 mSv (range 1-10), of which half originates from Radon exposure. Other sources are cosmic rays and ingestion and inhalation of radionuclides. For example, one flight between Europe and America accounts for 0.030-0.045 mSv because of exposure to cosmic rays. X-rays are carcinogenic and exposures to them always need to be justified and optimized in order to minimize the risks of health effects. However, the human body is continuously struck by radiations coming from natural sources. A useful element of comparison to evaluate E due to medical exposures in scoliosis can be then provided by the amount of E coming from natural sources. This comparison approach can play a role in the relationship between physicians and patients' parents and lead to an improved awareness in patients' parents.",

The technique, which is similar to that developed for other ion-selective microelectrodes, centres on the oscillation of a Cl--selective microelectrode between known points, micrometres apart, orthogonal to the plasma membrane. Application of the Fick principle to the differential voltage obtained per excursion amplitude (the referenced signal) yields the Cl- flux (pmol x cm(-2) x s(-1)). A Cl- effusion gradient was used to confirm that empirical measurements of J(Cl) using the Cl- SrE were statistically similar to predicted flux values calculated from the fall in [Cl-] with distance from the tip of the effusion source. Apical J(Cl) was then measured as a function of [Cl-]e from polarised FDLE cultures grown on permeable supports. At [Cl-]e&lt;50 mmol x l(-1), an apical-to-basolateral (inward) flux, maximal at 400 pmol x cm(-2 ) x s(-1), was observed; this reverted to a continuous basolateral-to-apical (outward) flux of 203 pmol x cm(-2 ) x s(-1) at [Cl]e&gt;100 mmol x l(-1). At [Cl-]e&gt;100 mmol x l(-1), isoproterenol (basolaterally applied, 10 micromol x l(-1)) activated a Cl- influx of 561 pmol x cm(-2 ) x s(-1), whereas UTP (apically applied, 100 micromol x l(-1)) stimulated a Cl- efflux of 300 pmol x cm(-2) x s(-1).

Applications of two beam dynamical theory of electron diffraction considering absorption effect of electrons made clear the importance of relativistic effect of the mass of electron to the variation of extinction distance and transmissive power at higher voltage and noted that they are proportional to (v/c) and (v/c)2 respectively, where v and c are the velocity of illuminating electrons and light. With elevating accelerating voltage of illuminating electrons, it was noted that many diffracted waves are excited and thus, for understanding of the image contrast and the improvement of transmissive power of electrons, many beam dynamical theory considering absorption of electron waves has to be applied. Detailed analysis of the excitation and absorption of component Bloch waves was carried out and flux (electron current) flow of Bloch waves and total waves was deduced. Improvements of image contrast and visibility of the imperfection in crystalline materials both in thin and thick regions of ultra-high voltages were realized by using the multi-beam imaging (MBI) method. In MBI of very thick crystals, it was noted that most of the inelastically scattered electrons which appeared in the background of the diffraction patterns contribute to the image contrast by the successive elastic scattering after inelastic scattering. It was noted that the improvement of maximum usable thickness at high voltage is highly dependent on the contribution of inelastically scattered electrons. The calculated flux flows of total electrons of various materials in various orientations were calculated for not only ultra-high voltages but low voltages such as 100 kV.

The collection efficiency of the chamber, operating at a standard voltage of 250 V, decreases from 0.99 to 0.84 for a charge density increasing from 0.3 X 10(-4) C/m3 to 7.5 X 10(-4) C/m3, respectively. The maximum deviation observed between the TLD and the \"two-voltage\" method adopted for similar M is never more than 2% and mostly smaller than 1%. It can be concluded that, under the present experimental conditions, the calculated ionisation chamber collection efficiency is confirmed by the experimental method using TL dosimetry.",

The performance specifications of Marx generators consisting of a 100 kV DC power supply, R-L-C circuit, and high voltage switch are at a maximum 800 kV.

The overall energy spread is defined by the sum of the MTE and the MLE, and the minimization of MTE is crucial to reduce emittance and thus generate a high-brightness electron beam.

However, there are limitations for low energy electron beams. This work aims to improve the accuracy of the dose calculation using eMC for 4 and 6 MeV electron beams of Varian linear accelerators. Improvements implemented into the eMC include (1) improved determination of the initial electron energy spectrum by increased resolution of mono-energetic depth dose curves used during beam configuration; (2) inclusion of all the scrapers of the applicator in the beam model; (3) reduction of the maximum size of the sphere to be selected within the macro MC transport when the energy of the incident electron is below certain thresholds. The impact of these changes in eMC is investigated by comparing calculated dose distributions for 4 and 6 MeV electron beams at source to surface distance (SSD) of 100 and 110 cm with applicators ranging from 6 x 6 to 25 x 25 cm(2) of a Varian Clinac 2300C/D with the corresponding measurements. Dose differences between calculated and measured absolute depth dose curves are reduced from 6% to less than 1.5% for both energies and all applicators considered at SSD of 100 cm.

The purpose of the present work is to investigate the dosimetric properties of an electron beam that should be achievable using existing LWFA technology, and to document the necessary improvements to make radiotherapy application for LWFA viable. This paper first qualitatively reviews the fundamental principles of LWFA and describes a potential design for a 30 cm accelerator chamber containing a gas target. Electron beam energy spectra, upon which our dose calculations are based, were obtained from a uniform energy distribution and from two-dimensional particle-in-cell (2D PIC) simulations. The 2D PIC simulation parameters are consistent with those reported by a previous LWFA experiment. According to the 2D PIC simulations, only approximately 0.3% of the LWFA electrons are emitted with an energy greater than 1 MeV. We studied only the high-energy electrons to determine their potential for clinical electron beams of central energy from 9 to 21 MeV. Each electron beam was broadened and flattened by designing a dual scattering foil system to produce a uniform beam (103%&gt;off-axis ratio&gt;95%) over a 25 x 25 cm2 field. An energy window (deltaE) ranging from 0.5 to 6.5 MeV was selected to study central-axis depth dose, beam flatness, and dose rate. Dose was calculated in water at a 100 cm source-to-surface distance using the EGS/BEAM Monte Carlo algorithm. Calculations showed that the beam flatness was fairly insensitive to deltaE. However, since the falloff of the depth-dose curve (R10-R90) and the dose rate both increase with deltaE, a tradeoff between minimizing (R10-R90) and maximizing dose rate is implied. If deltaE is constrained so that R10-R90 is within 0.5 cm of its value for a monoenergetic beam, the maximum practical dose rate based on 2D PIC is approximately 0.1 Gy min(-1) for a 9 MeV beam and 0.03 Gy min(-1) for a 15 MeV beam. It was concluded that current LWFA technology should allow a table-top terawatt (T3) laser to produce therapeutic electron beams that have acceptable flatness, penetration, and falloff of depth dose; however, the dose rate is still 1%-3% of that which would be acceptable, especially for higher-energy electron beams. Further progress in laser technology, e.g., increasing the pulse repetition rate or number of high energy electrons generated per pulse, is necessary to give dose rates acceptable for electron beams. Future measurements confirming dosimetric calculations are required to substantiate our results. In addition to achieving adequate dose rate, significant engineering developments are needed for this technology to compete with current electron acceleration technology. Also, the functional benefits of LWFA electron beams require further study and evaluation.",

Here, we present an approach to effectively suppress space-charge artifacts in momentum microscopes and photoemission microscopes. A retarding electrostatic field generated by a special objective lens repels slow electrons, retaining the k-image of the fast photoelectrons. The suppression of space-charge effects scales with the ratio of the photoelectron velocities of fast and slow electrons. Fields in the range from -20 to -1100 V/mm for E<subkin</sub = 100 eV to 4 keV direct secondaries and pump-induced slow electrons back to the sample surface. Ray tracing simulations reveal that this happens within the first 40 to 3 μm above the sample surface for E<subkin</sub = 100 eV to 4 keV. An optimized front-lens design allows switching between the conventional accelerating and the new retarding mode. Time-resolved experiments at E<subkin</sub = 107 eV using fs extreme ultraviolet probe pulses from the free-electron laser FLASH reveal that the width of the Fermi edge increases by just 30 meV at an incident pump fluence of 22 mJ/cm<sup2</sup (retarding field -21 V/mm). For an accelerating field of +2 kV/mm and a pump fluence of only 5 mJ/cm<sup2</sup, it increases by 0.5 eV (pump wavelength 1030 nm). At the given conditions, the suppression mode permits increasing the slow-electron yield by three to four orders of magnitude. The feasibility of the method at high energies is demonstrated without a pump beam at E<subkin</sub = 3830 eV using hard x rays from the storage ring PETRA III. The approach opens up a previously inaccessible regime of pump fluences for photoemission experiments.",

In this paper, the development of a compact high energy-density electron beam accelerator, viz., HEART-20, based on a propylene carbonate (PC) forming line is presented. The accelerator HEART-20 consists of a primary energy source, a pulse transformer, a PC pulse forming line, a gas spark gap switch, and a vacuum diode.

A detailed comparison of the numerical results of the RRS and CMS at different accelerating voltages, Debye-Waller factors, and beam tilts is performed.

The differences between measured and calculated ROF values were within ± 3% for beams with cutout radius of ≥ 1.5 cm for electron beams with energies from 6 MeV to 15 MeV. The proposed formula will be helpful for double-check of MUs, as it requires minimal efforts for MU calculation.",

In the future, these microdevices can provide an alternative to replace the electrochemical batteries, which cause contamination due to their toxic materials. We present the electromechanical modeling of a pVEH microdevice with a novel resonant structure for air conditioning vents at office buildings. This electromechanical modeling includes different multilayers and cross-sections of the microdevice resonator as well as the air damping. This microdevice uses a flexible substrate and it does not include toxics materials. The microdevice has a resonant structure formed by multilayer beams and U-shape proof mass of UV-resin (730 μm thickness). The multilayer beams contain flexible substrates (160 μm thickness) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), two aluminum electrodes (100 nm thickness), and a ZnO layer (2 μm thickness). An analytical model is developed to predict the first bending resonant frequency and deflections of the microdevice. This model considers the Rayleigh and Macaulay methods, and the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. In addition, the electromechanical behavior of the microdevice is determined through the finite element method (FEM) models. In these FEM models, the output power of the microdevice is obtained using different sinusoidal accelerations. The microdevice has a resonant frequency of 60.3 Hz, a maximum deflection of 2.485 mm considering an acceleration of 1.5 m/s², an output voltage of 2.854 V and generated power of 37.45 μW with a load resistance of 217.5 kΩ. An array of pVEH microdevices connected in series could be used to convert the displacements of air conditioning vents at office buildings into voltages for electronic devices and sensors.",

The accelerator is a three grid system comprising of 1280 apertures, grouped in 16 groups with 80 apertures per beam group.

Fusion 49, 045006 (2009)]. The aperture shapes, intergrid distances, and the extractor voltage have been optimized to minimize the beamlet divergence. To suppress the acceleration of coextracted electrons, permanent magnets have been incorporated in the extraction grid, downstream of the cooling water channels. The electron power loads on the extractor and the grounded grids have been calculated assuming 1 coextracted electron per ion. The beamlet divergence is calculated to be 4 mrad. At present the design for the filter field of the RF based ion sources for ITER is not fixed, therefore a few configurations of the same have been considered. Their effect on the transmission of the electrons and beams through the accelerator has been studied. The OPERA-3D code has been used to estimate the aperture offset steering constant of the grounded grid and the extraction grid, the space charge interaction between the beamlets and the kerb design required to compensate for this interaction. All beamlets in the DNB must be focused to a single point in the duct, 20.665 m from the grounded grid, and the required geometrical aimings and aperture offsets have been calculated.",

Calculations are performed for a Siemens MD2 linear accelerator with beam energies, 6, 9, 11, and 13 MeV.

The details of each component of the dose, such as the dose from particles scattered off the jaws and the applicator, the dose from contaminant photons, the dose from direct electrons, etc., are also analyzed. The calculations show that inphantom side-scatter equilibrium is a major factor for the contribution from the direct component which usually dominates the output of a beam.

The general ion recombination effect on the response of a micro liquid ion chamber (microLion) was investigated with a 6 MV photon beam in normal and SRS modes produced from a Varian(®) Novalis Tx(TM) linear accelerator. Dose rates of the linear accelerator were set to 100, 400, and 1000 MU∕min, which correspond to pulse repetition frequencies of 60, 240, and 600 Hz, respectively. Polarization voltages applied to the microLion were +800 and +400 V. The relative collection efficiency of the microLion response as a function of dose per pulse was experimentally measured with changing polarization voltage and pulse repetition frequencies and was compared with the theoretically calculated value. For the 60 Hz pulse repetition frequency, the experimental relative collection efficiency was not different from the theoretical one for a pulsed beam more than 0.3% for both polarization voltages. For a pulsed radiation beam with a higher pulse repetition frequency, the experimental relative collection efficiency converged to the theoretically calculated efficiency for continuous beams. This result indicates that the response of the microLion tends toward the response to a continuous beam with increasing pulse repetition frequency of a pulsed beam because of low ion mobility in the liquid. This work suggests an empirical method to correct for differences in general ion recombination of a LIC between different radiation fields. More work is needed to quantitatively explain the LIC general ion recombination behavior in pulsed beams generated from linear accelerators.",

The design of the device structure and the electronic structure on superlattices and quantum wells assume abrupt interfaces. However, the emergence of possible interface segregation and atom exchange can only be determined experimentally, impacting the device performance. In this work, the interface atom intermixing and their effects on the energy band structure in a molecular beam epitaxy grown ICIP are studied. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals atom diffusion and intermixing between the constituent layers of the cascade structure, causing a shift in the quantum state energy levels of the layers and the consequent misalignment of the cascade structures. Combining the STEM observation with high-resolution X-ray diffraction, the alloy composition profiles of the layers are determined. Using the \"real\" graded composition profiles, the effective band gap of the superlattice absorber and the energy levels of the relaxation region and the tunneling region are recalculated showing a cutoff wavelength of the superlattice absorber 4.93 μm, which is 0.78 μm smaller than that calculated using the nominal step composition profile. However, its agreement is greatly improved with the measured cutoff wavelength of 5.03 μm. The energy level of the narrowest quantum well in the relaxation region is 0.091 eV higher than the conduction miniband of the absorber, which is also consistent with the experiments that the pho-response exits a \"turn on\" voltage of 0.1 V.

However, the energy spectrum of LWFA-generated electrons is broad, on the order of tens of MeV. Using existing laser technology, the therapeutic beam might require a significant energy spread to achieve clinically acceptable dose rates. The purpose of this work was to test the assumption that a scattering foil system designed for a mono-energetic beam would be suitable for a poly-energetic beam with a significant energy spread. Dual scattering foil systems were designed for mono-energetic beams using an existing analytical formalism based on Gaussian multiple-Coulomb scattering theory. The design criterion was to create a flat beam that would be suitable for fields up to 25 x 25 cm2 at 100 cm from the primary scattering foil. Radial planar fluence profiles for poly-energetic beams with energy spreads ranging from 0.5 MeV to 6.5 MeV were calculated using two methods: (a) analytically by summing beam profiles for a range of mono-energetic beams through the scattering foil system, and (b) by Monte Carlo using the EGS/BEAM code. The analytic calculations facilitated fine adjustments to the foil design, and the Monte Carlo calculations enabled us to verify the results of the analytic calculation and to determine the phase-space characteristics of the broadened beam. Results showed that the flatness of the scattered beam is fairly insensitive to the width of the input energy spectrum. Also, results showed that dose calculated by the analytical and Monte Carlo methods agreed very well in the central portion of the beam. Outside the useable field area, the differences between the analytical and Monte Carlo results were small but significant, possibly due to the small angle approximation. However, these did not affect the conclusion that a scattering foil system designed for a mono-energetic beam will be suitable for a poly-energetic beam with the same central energy. Further studies of the dosimetric properties of LWFA-generated electron beams will be done using Monte Carlo methods.",

In LM, specimens are fully hydrated, and molecular species are distinguished based on the fluorescence colors of probes. EM provides both high-spatial-resolution images superior to those obtained with LM and ultrastructural information of cellular components. The combination of LM and EM gives much more information than either method alone, which helps us to analyze cellular function in more detail.We propose a Y2O3:Tm,Yb phosphor nanoparticle which allows upconversion luminescence (UCL) imaging with near-infrared (NIR) light excitation and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging [1], where the light emission induced by an electron beam is called cathodoluminescence (CL). Due to electron beam excitation, the spatial resolution of CL microscopy is on the order of nanometers [2,3]. Upconversion is a process in which lower energy, longer wavelength excitation light is transduced to higher energy, shorter wavelength emission light. So far, in LM observation for CLEM, ultraviolet (UV) or visible light has been used for excitation. However, UV and visible light have limited ability to observe deep tissue regions due to absorption, scattering, and autofluorescence. On the other hand, NIR light does not suffer from these problems. Rare-earth-doped upconversion nanophosphors have been applied to biological imaging because of the advantages of NIR excitation [4].We investigated the UCL and CL spectra of Y2O3:Tm,Yb nanophosphors. Y2O3:Tm,Yb nanophosphors that emit visible and near-infrared UCL under 980nm irradiation and blue CL via electron beam excitation. To confirm bimodality of our nanophosphors, correlative UCL/CL images of the nanophosphors were obtained for the same region. The nanophosphors were poured onto a P doped Si substrate (Fig. 1(a)) and were irradiated with 980 nm NIR CW laser light or an electron beam. Fig. 1(b) shows the UCL image of the nanophosphors under 980 nm NIR CW laser irradiation, UCL spots were observed, but the individual nanophosphors in each spot were difficult to distinguish in the UCL image. On the other hand, the edges and the gap between the nanophosphors were clearly distinguished in the CL image (Fig. 1(c)), showing that the spatial-resolution of CL imaging was enough higher than that of UCL image. We believe that upconversion phosphors of the type described here will allow the realization of new CLEM imaging techniques covering the nanometer to millimeter scale, i.e., the molecular to in vivo scale.jmicro;63/suppl_1/i29/DFU073F1F1DFU073F1Fig. 1.(a) SEM and correlative (b) UCL (intensity of 980 nm NIR CW laser 8 mW) and (c) CL images of Y2O3:Tm,Yb nanophosphors in same region (accelerating voltage 3 kV, exposure time 100 ms/pixel).

All of them are very strongly red-degraded and most of them are perturbed. 59Co hyperfine broadenings or splittings have been observed in many. The bands can be arranged into five electronic transitions, together with a considerable number of \"extra\" bands induced by perturbations; two of the excited electronic states are 4Phi, while the other three, which lie within 1700 cm-1, are 4Delta. Semi-empirical calculations have been carried out for the 4Delta excited states, using exchange integrals transferred from the TiO and VO spectra; the predicted energies, spin-orbit structures, and relative intensities in absorption are consistent with the assignment of all three 4Delta states to the same electron configuration, (4ssigma)1(3ddelta)3(3dpi)2(3dsigma)1. It seems that there are extensive interactions between the excited 4Delta states, because only one of them gives rise to a recognizable, though irregular, long vibrational progression in absorption. The other two progressions die out abruptly and unexpectedly after three or four members, presumably as a result of interference effects; however, wavelength-resolved fluorescence studies, together with calculations of the Franck-Condon overlap integrals to the various vibrational levels of the ground state, show that the upper state progressions reappear following a region of confused absorption. All of the excited states show highly irregular variations of their vibrational intervals and rotational constants with the vibrational quantum number, v.
