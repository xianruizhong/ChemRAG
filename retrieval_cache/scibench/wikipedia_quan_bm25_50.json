The ion absorbs photons with energies in the range 0.75–4.0 eV, which ranges from the infrared into the visible spectrum (Rau 1996, Srinivasan 1999). Most of the electrons in these negative ions come from the ionization of metals with low first ionization potentials, including the alkali metals and alkali earths. The process which ejects the electron from the ion is properly called photodetachment rather than photoionization because the result is a neutral atom (rather than an ion) and a free electron.

The span wings consist of fiberglass skins built around a carbon fiber and aluminium spars. The wings employ a Wortmann FX 67-170/17 airfoil and have flaps for glidepath control. The wings are a constant chord design, with tapered wing tips. The fuselage is a pod-and-boom design, with the cockpit area made from wood, covered in fiberglass and the tail boom made from aluminium. The tail surfaces are of carbon fiber structure, covered in fiberglass. The powerplant is a Kohler Company engine of that drives a folding two-bladed propeller. The engine is mounted in pusher configuration behind the cockpit, with the tail boom running underneath the propeller.

Because of the tremendously large value of c (i.e. 299,792,458 metres per second in vacuum) compared to the speeds of things in our daily experience, the propagation of light seems to us to be instantaneous. Hence, the ratio 1/c was hidden from our view making relativistic mechanics irrelevant. At speeds comparable to the speed of light (c), special relativity takes the finitude of the speed of light into consideration by the aid of Lorentz transformation. A non-relativistic theory is recovered from a relativistic theory when the limit 1/c is set to zero. The gravitational constant (G) is irrelevant for a system where gravitational forces are negligible. For example, the special theory of relativity is the special case of general relativity in the limit G → 0.",

Suppose Alice measures the z-spin and obtains +z, so that the quantum state collapses into state I. Now, instead of measuring the z-spin as well, Bob measures the x-spin. According to quantum mechanics, when the system is in state I, Bob's x-spin measurement will have a 50% probability of producing +x and a 50% probability of -x. It is impossible to predict which outcome will appear until Bob actually performs the measurement.

In the gas phase the lifetime of methanesulfenic acid is about one minute. The gas phase structure of methanesulfenic acid was found by microwave spectroscopy (rotational spectroscopy) to be CH3–S–O–H. Sulfenic acids can be stabilized through steric effects, which prevent the sulfenic acid from condensing with itself to form thiosulfinates, RS(O)SR, such as allicin from garlic. Through the use of X-ray crystallography, the structure of such stabilized sulfenic acids were shown to be R–S–O–H. The stable, sterically hindered sulfenic acid 1-triptycenesulfenic acid has been found to have a pKa of 12.5 and an O–H bond-dissociation energy (bde) of 71.9 ± 0.3 kcal/mol, which can be compared to a pKa of ≥14 and O–H BDE of ~88 kcal/mol for the (valence) isoelectronic hydroperoxides, ROOH.

A theoretical treatment of the electron-helium interaction was developed by Cole and Cohen in 1969 and, independently, by Shikin in 1970. An electron close to the surface of liquid helium experiences an attractive force due to the formation of a weak (~0.01e) image charge in the dielectric liquid. However, the electron is prevented from entering the liquid by a high (~1 eV) barrier formed at the surface due to the hard-core repulsion of the electron by the helium atoms. As a result, the electron remains trapped outside the liquid. The energy of the electron in this potential well is quantised in a Hydrogen-like series with the modified Rydberg constant RHe 10−4 RH.

In general, atoms are split into ionic cores and valence electrons. The ionic cores (nuclei plus non-bonding electrons) are assumed to be stable and are treated as a single object. Each valence electron is treated separately. Thus, for example, a Lithium atom is treated as two bodies – Li+ and e- – while oxygen is treated as three bodies, namely O2+ and 2e−. The “true” ground state of a crystal system is generally unsolvable. However, the variational theorem assures us that any guess as to the electronic state function of a system will overestimate the ground state energy. Thus, by beginning with a suitably parametrized guess and minimizing the energy with respect to each of those parameters, an extremely accurate prediction may be made.

Since it takes nearly as much energy to excite the hydrogen atom's electron from n = 1 to n = 3 (12.1 eV, via the Rydberg formula) as it does to ionize the hydrogen atom (13.6 eV), ionization is far more probable than excitation to the n = 3 level.

The kinetic basis of the low reactivity is the nonpolar nature of H2 and its weak polarizability. It spontaneously reacts with chlorine and fluorine to form hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, respectively. The reactivity of H2 is strongly affected by the presence of metal catalysts. Thus, while mixtures of H2 with O2 or air combust readily when heated to at least 500 C by a spark or flame, they do not react at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst.

The latter can be estimated by considering the electrostatic potential energy for an electron displaced by r from its lattice point.

This is a consequence of the fact that the optical nucleons are not free, but bound particles. Thus the results could be explained within the theory by associating with the odd optical neutron an effective electric charge of Z/A. The Mössbauer isomeric shift The Mössbauer isomeric shift is the shift seen in gamma-ray spectroscopy when one compares two different nuclear isomeric states in two different physical, chemical or biological environments, and is due to the combined effect of the recoil-free Mössbauer transition between the two nuclear isomeric states and the transition between two atomic states in those two environments.",

The core idea is that nonzero rest mass particles such as electrons, protons, neutrons and their antimatter counterparts exhibit stepwise motion as they alternate between a particlelike state of rest and a wavelike state of motion. Gravitation then takes place in a wavelike state, and the theory allows, for example, that the wavelike states of protons and antiprotons interact differently with the earth's gravitational field.",

The synthetic standard had a unit cell with a= 6.912(1) Å; b= 7.470(1) Å; and c= 7.357 Å;, β= 112.29(3)°, and Z= 4. The standard is in the space group C2/c. The XRD analysis was run with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using CuKɑ radiation and a secondary monochromator to collect the data. The data from the analysis showed that serrabrancaite has unit cell dimensions of a= 6.914(2) Å; b= 7.468(2) Å; and c= 7.364(2) Å;, β= 112.29°, and V= 351.8(1) Å3. This puts serrabrancaite in the monoclinic crystal system and the point group C2/c after a structural analysis. Serrabrancaite's structure is built of chains of (MnO6)-octahedra that share their corners and run in the [101] direction. These chains are then held together by (PO4)-tetrahedra.

If X(t) is invertible for all t with 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the eigenvalue argument gives a contradiction since it is positive at t = 0 and has negative eigenvalues at t = 1.

To check this, let where the minimum is taken over z in F such that d(x,z) ≤ d(x,F) + ε. Since fε is homogeneous in h and increases uniformly to f0 on any sphere, with a constant C(ε) tending to 0 as ε tends to 0. This differentiability property follows from this because and similarly if |h| ≤ ε The differentiability property implies that minimized over closest points z to c(t). For any such z Since −|y − c(t)|2 has a local maximum on F at y = z, c(t) − z is an exterior normal vector at z. So the first term on the right hand side is non-negative.

This puts serrabrancaite in the monoclinic crystal system and the point group C2/c after a structural analysis. Serrabrancaite's structure is built of chains of (MnO6)-octahedra that share their corners and run in the [101] direction. These chains are then held together by (PO4)-tetrahedra.

If X(t) is invertible for all t with 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the eigenvalue argument gives a contradiction since it is positive at t = 0 and has negative eigenvalues at t = 1. So X(s) has a zero eigenvalue for some s with 0 < s ≤ 1: X(s)w = 0 with w ≠ 0. By the properties of the quadratic representation, x(t) is invertible for all t. Let Y(t) = L(x(t)2). This is a positive operator since x(t)2 lies in C. Let T(t) = Q(x(t)), an invertible self-adjoint operator by the invertibility of x(t). On the other hand, T(t) = 2X(t)2 - Y(t). So (T(s)w,w) < 0 since Y(s) is positive and X(s)w = 0. In particular T(s) has some negative eigenvalues. On the other hand, the operator T(0) = Q(a2) = Q(a)2 is positive.

The atomic nucleus can be composed of a large number of protons and neutrons which move due to strong interactions between them. In spite of their complexity, nuclei exhibit some simple and regular features. Most importantly, nuclei behave as if they move independently in a common static potential well. This gives rise to the existence of shells of protons and neutrons much like the electronic shells in atoms. Nuclei whose proton and neutron shells are complete have special stability and the numbers of protons and of neutrons in them are called magic numbers. This picture of the nucleus is called the nuclear shell model to obtain the information from experimental data and use it to calculate and predict energies which have not been measured. This method has been successfully used by many nuclear physicists and has led to deeper understanding of nuclear structure. To calculate energies of nuclear states it is necessary",

These three glutamic acids are located in an α-helix that forms part of the PFM, and glutamic acids are found in aerolysin family members in its PFMs. Such a conformational change produces a decrease in the oligomer height of 2.5 nm according to AFM measurements. The main dimensions, using lysenin pore X-ray structure, are height 97 Å, width 115 Å and the inner pore of 30 Å. However, complete oligomerization into the nonamer is not a requisite for the insertion, since incomplete oligomers in the pore state can be found.

The single-point computation for each geometry can then be plotted versus bond angle to produce the representative Walsh diagram. Structure of a Walsh Diagram",

There are two distinct versions of the method: ZINDO/1 – for calculating ground-state properties such as bond lengths and bond angles.

GAMESS-UK can perform many general computational chemistry calculations, including Hartree–Fock method, Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2 & MP3), coupled cluster (CCSD & CCSD(T)), density functional theory (DFT), configuration interaction (CI), and other advanced electronic structure methods. Calculation of valence bond wave functions are possible by the TURTLE code, due to J. H. van Lenthe.

Conditional probabilities, conditional expectations, and conditional probability distributions are treated on three levels: discrete probabilities, probability density functions, and measure theory. Conditioning leads to a non-random result if the condition is completely specified; otherwise, if the condition is left random, the result of conditioning is also random. Conditioning on the discrete level Example: A fair coin is tossed 10 times; the random variable X is the number of heads in these 10 tosses, and Y is the number of heads in the first 3 tosses. In spite of the fact that Y emerges before X it may happen that someone knows X but not Y. Conditional probability Given that X = 1, the conditional probability of the event Y = 0 is More generally, One may also treat the conditional probability as a random variable, — a function of the random variable X, namely,",

The mass of heavy atoms such as gold is mostly concentrated in the central charge region, since calculations show it is not deflected or moved by the high speed alpha particles, which have very high momentum in comparison to electrons, but not with regard to a heavy atom as a whole.

This state is short-lived, and the electron returns to the ground-level orbital, losing the energy either as heat or in the case of fluorophores by emitting a photon, which, due to the loss of the difference between the energy of the absorbed photon and the excitation energy required, will have a lower energy than the absorbed photon, or, expressed in terms of wavelength, the emitted photon will have a longer wavelength.

A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs were made by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication.

In a chain reaction step of a Br radical reacting with a hydrogen on a secondary carbon to cleave the H−C bond requires 397 kJ/mol and an H−Br is formed. We can look at the BDE of H−Br (366 kJ/mol) and subtract this value from 397 kJ/mol to get +31 kJ/mol. This positive value tells us that this step in the reaction requires energy (endothermic) and the reactants are more stable than the products. Comparing this with the same situation of a Cl radical we see that this step is exothermic (397 − 431 kJ/mol = −34 kJ/mol). From these values, we can conclude that in bromination it is more important that the most stable radical (tertiary) be formed during this step and thus it is more selective than chlorination.

The relationship is given by: where is the torque acting on the dipole, is the external magnetic field, and is the magnetic moment. This definition is based on how one could, in principle, measure the magnetic moment of an unknown sample. For a current loop, this definition leads to the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment equaling the product of the current times the area of the loop. Further, this definition allows the calculation of the expected magnetic moment for any known macroscopic current distribution. An alternative definition is useful for thermodynamics calculations of the magnetic moment. In this definition, the magnetic dipole moment of a system is the negative gradient of its intrinsic energy, , with respect to external magnetic field:",

Hyperfine structure, with energy shifts typically orders of magnitudes smaller than those of a fine-structure shift, results from the interactions of the nucleus (or nuclei, in molecules) with internally generated electric and magnetic fields. History In 1935, H. Schüler and Theodor Schmidt proposed the existence of a nuclear quadrupole moment in order to explain anomalies in the hyperfine structure. Theory The theory of hyperfine structure comes directly from electromagnetism, consisting of the interaction of the nuclear multipole moments (excluding the electric monopole) with internally generated fields. The theory is derived first for the atomic case, but can be applied to each nucleus in a molecule. Following this there is a discussion of the additional effects unique to the molecular case.",

Hence for an ideal, simple-harmonically vibrating bond, the vibrational spectrum contains no overtones. Of course, real molecules do not vibrate perfectly harmonically, because a bond's potential is not precisely quadratic but better approximated as a Morse potential. Solving the Schrödinger equation with the Morse potential for the molecule under consideration yields vibrational energy eigenstates with the interesting property that when one calculates transition dipole moments for various vibrational energy level transitions, the transition dipole moment is not zero for the transitions where ∆v=±2,±3,±4, etc. Thus, for real molecules, the allowed transitions are those for which ∆v=±1,±2,±3,±4, etc. The overtone band observed in the IR spectrum is one such transition with ∆v=2, from v=0 to v=2 energy state.",

When used as a unit of energy, the numerical value of 1 eV in joules (symbol J) is equivalent to the numerical value of the charge of an electron in coulombs (symbol C). Under the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, this sets 1 eV equal to the exact value J. Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences, because a particle with electric charge q has an energy after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the potential in volts, one gets an energy in eV.",

The hippocampus contains multiple layers of very densely packed neurons—the dentate gyrus and the CA3/CA1/subicular layer—and therefore has the potential to generate strong EEG signals. Basic EEG theory says that when a layer of neurons generates an EEG signal, the signal always phase-reverses at some level. Thus, theta waves recorded from sites above and below a generating layer have opposite signs. There are other complications as well: the hippocampal layers are strongly curved, and theta-modulated inputs impinge on them from multiple pathways, with varying phase relationships. The outcome of all these factors is that the phase and amplitude of theta oscillations change in a very complex way as a function of position within the hippocampus. The largest theta waves, however, are generally recorded from the vicinity of the fissure that separates the CA1",

These electrons couple to high-lying unoccupied electronic states and decay to low-lying unoccupied states, with a subset of these transitions being radiative. The photons emitted in the decay process are detected and an energy spectrum, photon counts vs. incident electron energy, is generated. Due to the low energy of the incident electrons, their penetration depth is only a few atomic layers, making inverse photoemission a particularly surface sensitive technique. As inverse photoemission probes the electronic states above the Fermi level of the system, it is a complementary technique to photoemission spectroscopy. Theory",

This idea was later proven with the existence of tritium, but that was not the explanation of why molecular weight 3 was observed in mass spectrometers. J. J. Thomson later believed that the molecular weight 3 molecule he observed was Hydrogen deuteride. In the Orion nebula lines were observed that were attributed to nebulium which could have been the new element eka-hydrogen, especially when its atomic weight was calculated as near 3.

The proton radius was a puzzle as of 2017. A resolution came in 2019, when two different studies, using different techniques involving the Lamb shift of the electron in hydrogen, and electron–proton scattering, found the radius of the proton to be 0.833 fm, with an uncertainty of ±0.010 fm, and 0.831 fm. The radius of the proton is linked to the form factor and momentum-transfer cross section. The atomic form factor G modifies the cross section corresponding to point-like proton. The atomic form factor is related to the wave function density of the target: The form factor can be split in electric and magnetic form factors. These can be further written as linear combinations of Dirac and Pauli form factors.",
