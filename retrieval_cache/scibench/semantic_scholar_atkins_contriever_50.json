Since the nitrogen atom is located at the centre of the cage, 9 we set this distance equal to the fullerene radius. The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements. We test this model by using Eq. (2) to predict the pressure shift given the bulk modulus B. By treating the cage as a sphere with volume V and bulk modulus B = −V ∂P/∂V , we obtain the expression\n∂∆A ∂P = 2∆A B .(3)",

Because the absolute enthalpy and absolute entropy reference states are different for each model, the differences in enthalpy and entropy from a selected reference state are calculated and compared. This reference state is taken at P = 101.325 kPa, T 0 = 25 o C and S A,0 = 0.035 kg s /kg. Figure 1 shows the changes in specific enthalpy calculated for seawater, aqueous sodium chloride solution and the sodium chloride ideal mixture model [5] as it varies with the salinity. At the reference salinity (S A,0 = 0.035 kg s /kg), the enthalpy is zero for all three models. There are large differences between the enthalpy of seawater and the aqueous sodium chloride solution. This is due to a large difference in the heats of solution between the seawater and sodium chloride, averaging up to a factor of ten according to Tribus and Evans [22]. It is important to emphasize that the accurate estimation of the seawater specific enthalpy obtained by using the ideal mixture model [5] is coincidental, as the enthalpy should be close to aqueous sodium chloride solution rather than seawater. \n\n\nFig. 1 The specific enthalpy as a function of salinity\n\nOn the other hand, the specific entropy calculated for the three models is shown in Figure 2. As shown in this figure, there is no agreement between any of the three models. However, the trend of seawater and the aqueous sodium chloride solution is the same: the entropy decreases as the salinity increases. \n\n\nFig. 2 The specific entropy as it varies with salinity",

The thermodynamic estimation of the equilibrium composition of multicomponent multiphase systems requires minimization of the thermodynamic free energy (G) subject to mass and energy balances [33]. \"Thermo\" software was used for thermodynamic calculations [34], which has thermochemical database for approximately 3000 compounds. In addition, we used the thermo-chemical software HSC Chemistry-7, which can predict equilibrium compositions and can calculate adiabatic temperature, if input and output species and their amounts are defined. HSC-Chemistry-7 has database of over 25000 compounds, based on which it can also calculate the theoretical heat balances, by taking molecular amounts of components using the reaction equations at system equilibrium.\n\nThe reaction adiabatic temperature and composition of the equilibrium products can be estimated by minimizing the thermodynamic potential.

The ESR measurements were carried out at a microwave frequency of ν = 9.56 GHz using Bruker X-band ESR-spectrometer. The magnetic field H was swept from 0 to 9 kOe. Samples were placed in a 4 He-gas flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments) allowing temperature measurements between 4 and 300 K. The experimental setup was equipped with a goniometer for angular dependent measurements. All the recorded spectra are field derivatives of the microwave power absorption.",

Since the nitrogen atom is located at the centre of the cage, 9 we set this distance equal to the fullerene radius. The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements. We test this model by using Eq. (2) to predict the pressure shift given the bulk modulus B.

Entropy changes due to changes in concentration are estimated with the usual relation\n∆S conc = k ln (c i /c f ) ,(33)\nwhere c i and c f are, respectively, the concentrations in the initial and final state.

The lack of chlorine in HFCs significantly reduces the ozone depletion potential of the compound. Among them, R134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), a replacement for the commonly used Freon-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), has been favored in industrial use.

Generally, the CO2 absorption in these ammonium-based protic ionic liquids increased with pressure following Henry's law; the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the surface of the liquid. The mol fraction of CO2 absorbed in the ammonium-based protic ionic liquids was in the range of about 0.02 to 0.48 and up to 20 bar at 298.15 K. The effects of cation structure on the CO2 absorption in the ionic liquids are shown in Figure 8.  Figure 9 indicates a slight increase in the CO2 solubility when the anion of a common cation was changed from [AC] to [BA]. Based on our experimental results, there is a relationship between absorption of CO2 with the density and the molecular volume of the ionic liquids. As the density decreases and molecular volume increases, the fractional free volume increases and, thus, the solubility of CO2 increases [43,44].

The surface entropy (S r ) and the surface enthalpy (H r ) were calculated from the following equations [37,38]:\nS r ¼ À dr dTð14ÞH r ¼ r À T dr dTð15Þ\nThe thermodynamic functions for [BMPYR][TCM] at T = 308.15 K are listed in Table 4. The surface entropy is quite high {S r = (55.00 ± 0.05) 9 10 -6 NÁm -1 ÁK -1 at T = 308.15 K}, but lower than that for [EMIM][TCM] {S r = (10.61 ± 0.08) 9 10 -5 NÁm -1 ÁK -1 at T = 298.15 K [18] }, and higher than those for many ionic liquids [16,17,19,36]. The lower is the surface entropy, the lower is the surface organization of the solution. The lower value of entropy of the IL shows that the partial molar entropy of the IL decreases at the contact between the IL and air in the surface region. The surface enthalpy {H r = (64.98 ± 0.05) 9 10 -3 NÁm -1 at T = 308.15 K} is lower than those observed for [EMIM][TCM] (T = 298.15 K) [18] and other ionic liquids [16,17,19,36].",

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nSingle crystals of Mn 2 P 2 S 6 , MnNiP 2 S 6 and Ni 2 P 2 S 6 studied in this work were grown using chemical vapor transport method. Details of their growth, crystallographic, compositional and static magnetic characterization are described in Refs. [12,16]. Note, that the experimental value x exp in (Mn 1−x Ni x ) 2 P 2 S 6 for the nominal MnNiP 2 S 6 compound is found to be x exp = 0.45, considering an uncertainty of approximately 5% [12]. The ESR measurements were carried out at a microwave frequency of ν = 9.56 GHz using Bruker X-band ESR-spectrometer. The magnetic field H was swept from 0 to 9 kOe. Samples were placed in a 4 He-gas flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments) allowing temperature measurements between 4 and 300 K. The experimental setup was equipped with a goniometer for angular dependent measurements. All the recorded spectra are field derivatives of the microwave power absorption.",

However, because chlorofluorocarbons contribute to ozone depletion, hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) have emerged as environmentally friendly alternatives. The lack of chlorine in HFCs significantly reduces the ozone depletion potential of the compound. Among them, R134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), a replacement for the commonly used Freon-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), has been favored in industrial use. R134a is primarily utilized for domestic refrigeration and air conditioning. Its vapor-liquid equilibrium properties and liquid microscopic structure have been well-studied 1 . However, for use with nanoporous sorbent materials, the fundamental host-guest interaction during adsorption of R134a must be thoroughly interpreted to identify more efficient use of such HFCs in industrial applications.",

Rayleigh prepared some samples of nitrogen by chemical reaction of nitrogencontaining compounds; under his standard conditions, a glass globe filled with this 'chemical nitrogen' had a mass of $2.2990 \\mathrm{~g}$. He prepared other samples by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour from atmospheric air; under the same conditions, this 'atmospheric nitrogen' had a mass of $2.3102 \\mathrm{~g}$ (Lord Rayleigh, Royal Institution Proceedings 14, 524 (1895)). With the hindsight of knowing accurate values for the molar masses of nitrogen and argon, compute the mole fraction of argon in the latter sample on the assumption that the former was pure nitrogen and the latter a mixture of nitrogen and argon.",

Now, it appears from the recent researches of these two chemists, reported upon in the ' Comptes Rendus' for October 1857 (and which I now find detailed in a more extended form in the 'Annales de Chimie' for the present month, January 1858), that titanium absorbs nitrogen from the air, even in preference to oxygen ; titanic acid being reduced at a high temperature whenever air is admitted, and a nitride of titanium being formed in consequence. Such indeed, it is stated, is the affinity of this metal for nitrogen, that titanium can only be obtained pure by heating the titanic acid in an atmosphere of pure hydrogen ; for if the opera. tion be conducted in the presence of nitrogen, a nitride is sure to be produced. The union, indeed, takes place with so much energy as to generate light and heat, and thus to constitute a genuine case * The pressure of the atmosphere may be estimated at about I~ lbs. to the square'inch ; ~he pressure of the 8ca at I~ mile i~ 187• 15~2805, t Ann. de Chimie~ Jan. 185~, p, 61.",

Between 0° and -20° the coefficient was 0*004003, and between 0° and 98° it was 0*003802.The expenses incurred in the above research have been defrayed by a grant from the Royal Society.Vapour Pressure of Liquid Ammonia and the Determination of itsBoiling Point.By J ohn H ughes D avies.It was suggested to me by Dr. Per man, to whom I am much indebted for kindly advice and assistance, th at I should repeat the determination of the vapour pressure of liquid ammonia at some of the lower temperatures, using pure ammonia, in order to obtain an accurate value for its boiling point.Apparatus.-(Fig. 2.)This consisted o f:-1.

Attempts were made to calculate values of a and b in van der .Waals' equation from these data ; it was found, however, to be impossible, the equation not representing the facts with sufficient accuracy. Taking the simple equation pv = RT R is found to vary about 2 per cent, between -20° and 100°. Compressibility of Ammonia.-By comparing the density at half an atmosphere with that at one atmosphere, the compressibility of ammonia may be determined. The globe, was tilled with ammonia in the usual way, then connected with a pressure-gauge and about half the ammonia pumped out. Next the ammonia was allowed to blow off until equilibrium had been attained, when the pressure was immediately read. The readings were made on a mirror scale, the barometer standing in the same trough being read at the same time (see fig. II). Owing to the difficulty of reading the pressure and maintaining its constancy, no great accuracy was attained; the probable error is about 0 2 mm. As before stated, we cannot claim any great accuracy for this result, and we prefer to make use of Lord Rayleigh's number in proceeding to calculate the molecular weight of ammonia, the method and apparatus used by him being specially adapted to the purpose.* Lord Rayleigh found B = 1*00632 at 9°*7, which, corrected in the way indicated by him, becomes 1*00706 at 0°.\n\nThis gives a = -0*01413, and the correction factor The density calculated from Rayleigh's value for the compressibility (B = T00706) is 0*38272. The partial pressure of the ammonia in the above table is obtained by subtracting the partial pressure of the air (calculated from its weight) from the total pressure. I t will be seen that the density is nearly one part in 1000 higher than that calculated from the compressibility, and this represents the deviation from Dalton's law of a mixture of approximately equal volumes of ammonia and air.",

This arrangement was not nearly so efficient as when liquid air was used, and unless a stream of helium was kept flowing through the ionisation chamber, the helium probably became contaminated with gases evolved from the heated filament.

The standard molar heat capacity at constant volume (C θ V ), standard state entropy (S θ ), as well as the absolute enthalpy (H θ ) and Gibbs free energy (G θ ), were obtained directly from the calculations (Gaussian's output file). Moreover, the isodesmic reaction illustrated in Eq. (1) has been designed to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (Δ f H θ ) and standard Gibbs energy of formation (Δ f G θ ) of the molecules because no relevant experimental data is available. A similar isodesmic reaction was used to calculate the Δ f H θ and Δ f G θ of C 8 H 18 , and obtained results consistent with the corresponding experimental data (Pollack et al., 2005). Therefore, comparatively accurate thermodynamic estimates are expected for C 10 -SCCPs. The standard enthalpy change of the reaction (Δ r H θ ) is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of reactants, while the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation (Δ f H θ ) of the products minus that of the reactants also yields Δ r H θ . Thus, we can get Δ f H θ of C 10 -SCCPs from Eq. (2). The calculation of the Δ f G θ values of C 10 -SCCPs can also be accomplished in the same way from Eq. (3).",

In the beer bottles hermetically sealed with a crown cap, a volume V G of gas phase in the headspace under the cap cohabits with a volume V L of beer (i.e., the liquid phase). In the sealed bottles, the total number of moles of CO 2 , denoted n T , is a conserved quantity that decomposes into n G moles in the gas phase and n L moles in the liquid phase. Therefore n T = n G + n L . In the realistic pressure range found in a beer bottle (a few bar), it will be safely assumed that the gas-phase volume under the cap is ruled by the ideal gas law (i.e., with P CO 2 V G = n G RT). Finally, dissolved and gas-phase CO 2 follow the system of equations described hereafter, as exemplified in Figure   By combining the three equations of the previous system, the theoretical dependence on temperature of the pressure of gasphase CO 2 found in the sealed lager beer bottles can be determined according to the following equation, with every parameter displayed in the International System of Units (SI).\n= + P n RT V k RTV CO T G H L 2 (5)",

A similar effect has been measured previously for atomic nitrogen generated using a radio-frequency discharge plasma, where the hyperfine coupling is proportional to the buffer gas pressure. 1,24 In contrast to the pressure-dependent coupling observed for atoms with unpaired s electrons, which can either be positive or negative, the magnitude of the nitrogen hyperfine coupling always increases with pressure. 3 This observation has been explained by treating van der Waals interactions between the nitrogen atom and the buffer gas atoms as the dominant contribution to the increased hyperfine coupling. 3 These interactions lead to spin-dependent excitation of the s electrons, which causes spin polarization of the s orbital at the nucleus and an Pressure (GPa) |A| (MHz) 22 increased hyperfine coupling. Following an analogous model, we hypothesise that the increase in hyperfine coupling for the nitrogen endohedral fullerene is due to van der Waals interactions between the incarcerated nitrogen and the fullerene cage. There should also be a pressuredependent exchange coupling between the cage and the p orbitals. However, because of spherical symmetry this does not mix p and s orbitals and is therefore expected to make a weaker contribution to the hyperfine coupling. 3 We therefore model the shift as arising entirely from van der Waals interactions. To apply this model to the endohedral fullerene system, we consider the increase in hyperfine coupling ∆A = A − A free , where A free is the value for free atomic nitrogen. A perturbative calculation of the van der Waals interaction between atomic nitrogen and a nearby particle predicts the relationship (Eq. (15) \n∆A = k R 6 ,(2)",

(48).However, due to the non-hard sphere nature of methanol, the generalized van der Waals approach slightly underestimates the attractive contribution by 0.9 cal•mol −1 •K −1 compared to the reference CG entropy value.In contrast, the correction for chloroform is greater in value, with the final corrected entropy that is in closer agreement with the reference value compared to the hard sphere entropy reported in Table 3.The van der Waals treatment thus reduces the discrepancy from 14.40 % to 4.79 %.Based on these findings in Table 5, we conclude that the generalized van der Waals approach can rectify the overly estimated entropy values from the hard sphere nature by accurately addressing the attractive part of the CG interactions.Nevertheless, given the simplified nature of the square-well interaction, this framework may be more suitable to systems exhibiting hard sphere characteristics akin to chloroform.In this light, we note that an additional improvement to this approach is possible in which the attraction can be generalized to a more complicated shape beyond the square-well interaction form.\n\n\nMultiparticle Expansion\n\n\nPairwise Contribution: CG System.",

For the particular apparatus used, the quantity 4 Xair/R a t atmospheric pressure and temperature is, nearly enough, 0'004. Hence the formula used in the comparisons becomes -A_ = -/ 1 + 0-004(--",

The Quantities Associated with the Partial Molar EnthalpyDetermination of the Partial Molar Enthalpy for KCl at Infinite Dilution at Various Temperatures from the Heats of Solution Measured using Dilute KCl Solutions. Vasil'ev and Lobanov 49 have determined many values for the heat of solution for KCl(aq) where the molality of the salt was close to a value of 0.12335 mol·kg −1 at 291. 15, 298.15, 308.15, 313.15, 328.15, 343.15, and 358.15 K. This molality corresponds to the dilution ratio of 1/450. These data were used here with parametrization PI to determine the partial molar enthalpies of KCl at infinite dilution at the seven temperatures. The experimental heats were predicted using PI together with the value of H m,2 ∞ that gives the best fit at each temperature. The errors are shown in Figure 4 as a function of the temperature. The exact molalities used in our calculations are provided by the original paper. 49 They are all, however, very close to 0.12335 mol·kg −1 . The resulting values for H m,2 ∞ are reported in Table 7. The error plot in Figure 4 verifies that the agreement between the measured and predicted heats of solution is very good throughout.\n\nFor determination of H m,2 ∞ values at various temperatures, the apparent molar enthalpies given by Kilday 28 can also be used. In addition to wide heat-of-solution data reported in her study at 298.15 K (see Figure 1A), she also determined one ΔH app value  , and some partial molar enthalpies of the salt at infinite dilution are given in Table 7. b The values have been calculated using parametrization PI. c m°= 1 mol·kg −1 . d Unit is J·mol −1 and the value is given at temperature T expressed in parentheses as (T − 273.15)/K.

Because a pressure increment is applied inside the manometer, the radius R of the bubble decreases; its minimum value is achieved when the bubble radius becomes equal to the tube's inner radius R 0 . Then, the bubble radius again increases; however, in most cases, the bubble detaches from the tube as soon as the radius increases. When the bubble radius is minimum, the Laplace pressure becomes maximum. Thus, surface tension can be deduced from Eq. (2) by using the pressure balance at this instant and by setting R to R 0 . A glass tube that was 32 mm long with an inner diameter (ID) of 0.20 mm and outer diameter (OD) of 0.68 mm, was used as the capillary tube. The tube was specially prepared with high precision. The precision of the diameter was 0.01 mm. The tube was connected to a U-shaped manometer, which measures the internal pressure. By adding a small drop of pure water into the manometer, the internal pressure was increased; air was gradually forced into the test liquid. At the instant when a bubble detaches from the capillary tube, the maximum pressure can be measured using the head difference in the U-shaped manometer because the bubble radius becomes approximately equal to the tube inner radius at bubble detachment.",

In this term the value P occurs in the numerator twice. Therefore the magnitude of the term will vary directly as P. In other words, as the pressure in the system is lowered the vessel constant will decrease and vice versa. Thus if an organism absorbs the same number of molecules of oxygen per unit time as the pressure is lowered then the observed pressure change, h, must increase to compensate for the decrease in the vessel constant.\n\nThere are certain technical details which should be noted. The fluid in the manometer was Brodie's solution, used because the value of Po expressed in millimeters Brodie is an even 10,000. The volumes of the two sides of the manometer were determined by filling each side separately with mercury and weighing. The diameter of the capillary was similarly determined. The stopcocks were greased with a petroleum jelly-rubber composition which was firm enough to prevent leakage of air. Prior to actual use, the whole apparatus was set up empty in the water bath, exhausted as completely as possible, and shaken 2 hours. During this time no change in the fluid level of the manometer could be observed.\n\n\nRESULTS",

The standard molar heat capacity at constant volume (C θ V ), standard state entropy (S θ ), as well as the absolute enthalpy (H θ ) and Gibbs free energy (G θ ), were obtained directly from the calculations (Gaussian's output file). Moreover, the isodesmic reaction illustrated in Eq. (1) has been designed to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (Δ f H θ ) and standard Gibbs energy of formation (Δ f G θ ) of the molecules because no relevant experimental data is available. A similar isodesmic reaction was used to calculate the Δ f H θ and Δ f G θ of C 8 H 18 , and obtained results consistent with the corresponding experimental data (Pollack et al., 2005). Therefore, comparatively accurate thermodynamic estimates are expected for C 10 -SCCPs. The standard enthalpy change of the reaction (Δ r H θ ) is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of reactants, while the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation (Δ f H θ ) of the products minus that of the reactants also yields Δ r H θ . Thus, we can get Δ f H θ of C 10 -SCCPs from Eq. (2). The calculation of the Δ f G θ values of C 10 -SCCPs can also be accomplished in the same way from Eq. (3).",

The feed used is a mixture of pentane and hexane. The molar compositions and the flow rates of the feed and the top products were specified as follows: Vapor Fraction $(v_f) = 0.00$ The distillation column was simulated using the number of stages, operating pressure and temperature, reflux ratios, and the flow rates as obtained from literature (Adewole, 2009). The column was first converged with the specifications from the simulation basis shown in the The Pall ring, Intalox saddle and Berl saddle were first used individually in the simulation, then a dual combination of the packings were then used. The single, dual as well as the multiple packing simulations were carried out using the Tray Sizing Utilities of the simulation software. Appropriate packing type, size, height and arrangement order in the column was selected from AutoSection Information window through the Specs page of the Design tab of the software.\n\nThe simulation was then Run again to converge the column, and the results viewed. For dual arrangement, the 'AutoSection' command button was first used to perform the simulation. The initial estimate was then used to perform the multiple simulations by using the \"Copy Section\" command button and then modify the number of stages as appropriate.\n\nThe sizing of the distillation column was done using the approach described in (Adewole, 2009).

The TSEOS is fitted using only the PIMD and MD data for 180 ≤ T ≤ 325 K and −50 ≤ P ≤ 350 MPa. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, the TSEOS isobars are in excellent agreement with the simulation results over a majority of the state points simulated. Interestingly, the TSEOS also predicts a minimum in the ρ(T) isobars of q-TIP4P/F water. While at the studied temperatures we do not observe density minima in the classical MD and PIMD simulations, density minima were reported at different pressures in TIP4P/2005 and ST2 water 15,42 .

The TSEOS is fitted using only the PIMD and MD data for 180 ≤ T ≤ 325 K and −50 ≤ P ≤ 350 MPa. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, the TSEOS isobars are in excellent agreement with the simulation results over a majority of the state points simulated. Interestingly, the TSEOS also predicts a minimum in the ρ(T) isobars of q-TIP4P/F water. While at the studied temperatures we do not observe density minima in the classical MD and PIMD simulations, density minima were reported at different pressures in TIP4P/2005 and ST2 water 15,42 .

The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements. We test this model by using Eq. (2) to predict the pressure shift given the bulk modulus B.

The TSEOS is fitted using only the PIMD and MD data for 180 ≤ T ≤ 325 K and −50 ≤ P ≤ 350 MPa. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, the TSEOS isobars are in excellent agreement with the simulation results over a majority of the state points simulated. Interestingly, the TSEOS also predicts a minimum in the ρ(T) isobars of q-TIP4P/F water. While at the studied temperatures we do not observe density minima in the classical MD and PIMD simulations, density minima were reported at different pressures in TIP4P/2005 and ST2 water 15,42 . The optimized parameters for the TSEOS are given in Table S1 of the SI.",

The obtained potential strengths are summarized in Table 1. For the later use, the scattering lengths of the higher channels (D + D * 0 and {D + D * − }) calculated with the same potentials are also listed.

A similar effect has been measured previously for atomic nitrogen generated using a radio-frequency discharge plasma, where the hyperfine coupling is proportional to the buffer gas pressure. 1,24 In contrast to the pressure-dependent coupling observed for atoms with unpaired s electrons, which can either be positive or negative, the magnitude of the nitrogen hyperfine coupling always increases with pressure. 3 This observation has been explained by treating van der Waals interactions between the nitrogen atom and the buffer gas atoms as the dominant contribution to the increased hyperfine coupling. 3 These interactions lead to spin-dependent excitation of the s electrons, which causes spin polarization of the s orbital at the nucleus and an Pressure (GPa) |A| (MHz) 22 increased hyperfine coupling. Following an analogous model, we hypothesise that the increase in hyperfine coupling for the nitrogen endohedral fullerene is due to van der Waals interactions between the incarcerated nitrogen and the fullerene cage. There should also be a pressuredependent exchange coupling between the cage and the p orbitals. However, because of spherical symmetry this does not mix p and s orbitals and is therefore expected to make a weaker contribution to the hyperfine coupling. 3 We therefore model the shift as arising entirely from van der Waals interactions. To apply this model to the endohedral fullerene system, we consider the increase in hyperfine coupling ∆A = A − A free , where A free is the value for free atomic nitrogen. A perturbative calculation of the van der Waals interaction between atomic nitrogen and a nearby particle predicts the relationship (Eq. (15) \n∆A = k R 6 ,(2)",

The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements.

For the noble gases (Xe and Rn) the RPA corrections contribute at the level of 30%, while for the atomic Hg, Yb, and Ra, which have two s electrons above closed shells, the RPA corrections are much larger. In fact, they increase the EDM 2.5 times for Hg and 5 times for Yb and Ra as compared to the DHF results. The reason for this increase is that the two s electrons are loosely bound and can be easily excited. As a result, an account for the higher orders of the perturbation theory (like the RPA corrections) leads to significant change of the \"bare\" results obtained in the DHF approximation. The results obtained for d P at are listed in Table III. In Ref. [22] Flambaum and Khriplovich suggested a method to establish the correspondence between contributions of the tensor-pseudotensor and pseudoscalar-scalar P,T-odd operators using the expressions for the reduced MEs of these operators (see Appendix A).",

Thus, the entropy penalty for bringing a gas at standard conditions to a 1 M concentration is ∆S conc = −6.4 cal/mol-K.\n\n\nBenchmarks",

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nSingle crystals of Mn 2 P 2 S 6 , MnNiP 2 S 6 and Ni 2 P 2 S 6 studied in this work were grown using chemical vapor transport method. Details of their growth, crystallographic, compositional and static magnetic characterization are described in Refs. [12,16]. Note, that the experimental value x exp in (Mn 1−x Ni x ) 2 P 2 S 6 for the nominal MnNiP 2 S 6 compound is found to be x exp = 0.45, considering an uncertainty of approximately 5% [12]. The ESR measurements were carried out at a microwave frequency of ν = 9.56 GHz using Bruker X-band ESR-spectrometer. The magnetic field H was swept from 0 to 9 kOe. Samples were placed in a 4 He-gas flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments) allowing temperature measurements between 4 and 300 K. The experimental setup was equipped with a goniometer for angular dependent measurements. All the recorded spectra are field derivatives of the microwave power absorption.",

Having experimentally confirmed the stability of this compound, we wished to understand its origin. By analogy with other noble gases, one could expect helium to rather form stable compounds with the most electronegative atoms, or perhaps with molecular entities such as H 2 (for example, Xe forms stable fluorides under ambient conditions, stable oxides under pressure 11 and compounds with H; ref. 23). However, due to its extremely high ionization potential, the highest among all elements, helium does not react with oxygen or fluorine even at the extremely high pressure of 800 GPa. Xenon was predicted to react with electropositive elements (for example, with Mg; ref. 12) under pressure, but in contrast to Xe, He has zero electron affinity and is much less reactive. So what is the chemical nature of Na 2 He?",

Since the nitrogen atom is located at the centre of the cage, 9 we set this distance equal to the fullerene radius. The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements. We test this model by using Eq. (2) to predict the pressure shift given the bulk modulus B. By treating the cage as a sphere with volume V and bulk modulus B = −V ∂P/∂V , we obtain the expression\n∂∆A ∂P = 2∆A B .(3)",

The weight F w scales with r 3 , while the surface tension force F s scales with the contact radius r 0 and sin β, therefore β r r sin 3 0",

The Molecular Heats of Nitrogen, Steam, and Carbon Dioxide at High TemperaturesOur knowledge of the radiation emitted during explosions in closed vessels is still very imperfect. Prof. W. T. David found by direct measurement in a cylindrical vessel of diameter 30 cm. and height 30 cm.-that in the explosion of a 25-4 per cent, hydrogen-air mixture 0-5 per cent, of the energy liberated was lost by radiation up to the moment of attainment of maximum pressure ; for a 9*8 per cent, coal gas air mixture the corresponding quantity was 7-0 per cent. That radiation loss in carbonic oxide-oxygen explosions may sometimes involve as much as 10 per cent, of the total energy liberated has recently been shown by Garner and Johnson.\n\nVery little quantitative work appears to have been done on the effect of initial pressure upon the absolute amount of chemi-luminescence resulting from gaseous combustion under explosive conditions. David has shown that in the case of a 15 per cent, coal gas-air mixture fired at initial pressures of \\ and 1J atmospheres, respectively, the total energy lost by radiation up to the moment of attainment of maximum pressure was 3 • 3 per cent, of the heat of combustion at the lower, and 2*5 per cent, at the higher, pressure. This would seem to indicate an increase in the opacity of the medium with increasing pressure, an observation in line with the results of our experiments over a much wider pressure range.",

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nSingle crystals of Mn 2 P 2 S 6 , MnNiP 2 S 6 and Ni 2 P 2 S 6 studied in this work were grown using chemical vapor transport method. Details of their growth, crystallographic, compositional and static magnetic characterization are described in Refs. [12,16]. Note, that the experimental value x exp in (Mn 1−x Ni x ) 2 P 2 S 6 for the nominal MnNiP 2 S 6 compound is found to be x exp = 0.45, considering an uncertainty of approximately 5% [12]. The ESR measurements were carried out at a microwave frequency of ν = 9.56 GHz using Bruker X-band ESR-spectrometer. The magnetic field H was swept from 0 to 9 kOe. Samples were placed in a 4 He-gas flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments) allowing temperature measurements between 4 and 300 K. The experimental setup was equipped with a goniometer for angular dependent measurements. All the recorded spectra are field derivatives of the microwave power absorption.",

Entropy changes due to changes in concentration are estimated with the usual relation\n∆S conc = k ln (c i /c f ) ,(33)\nwhere c i and c f are, respectively, the concentrations in the initial and final state.

This implies the assumption that the intramembrane gas diffusion coefficients are identical for all five gases, which of course may not hold true. Under the condition of a constant D M , the last line of Table 1 suggests that all gas permeabilities should be rather similar, and all of them should be extremely high.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nSingle crystals of Mn 2 P 2 S 6 , MnNiP 2 S 6 and Ni 2 P 2 S 6 studied in this work were grown using chemical vapor transport method. Details of their growth, crystallographic, compositional and static magnetic characterization are described in Refs. [12,16]. Note, that the experimental value x exp in (Mn 1−x Ni x ) 2 P 2 S 6 for the nominal MnNiP 2 S 6 compound is found to be x exp = 0.45, considering an uncertainty of approximately 5% [12]. The ESR measurements were carried out at a microwave frequency of ν = 9.56 GHz using Bruker X-band ESR-spectrometer. The magnetic field H was swept from 0 to 9 kOe. Samples were placed in a 4 He-gas flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments) allowing temperature measurements between 4 and 300 K. The experimental setup was equipped with a goniometer for angular dependent measurements. All the recorded spectra are field derivatives of the microwave power absorption.",

The thermodynamic estimation of the equilibrium composition of multicomponent multiphase systems requires minimization of the thermodynamic free energy (G) subject to mass and energy balances [33]. \"Thermo\" software was used for thermodynamic calculations [34], which has thermochemical database for approximately 3000 compounds. In addition, we used the thermo-chemical software HSC Chemistry-7, which can predict equilibrium compositions and can calculate adiabatic temperature, if input and output species and their amounts are defined. HSC-Chemistry-7 has database of over 25000 compounds, based on which it can also calculate the theoretical heat balances, by taking molecular amounts of components using the reaction equations at system equilibrium.\n\nThe reaction adiabatic temperature and composition of the equilibrium products can be estimated by minimizing the thermodynamic potential. For a system with N(g) gas and N(s) solid number of components, at constant pressure, the concentrations of equilibrium phases can be expressed as:\n{ $ , { & }) = $ + , + + $ + / / 0 (2) /34 0 (5) $34 (1)\nWhere p k is the partial pressure of the k`th gas-phase component, while n l and G l are the number of moles and molar Gibbs free energy of components. The adiabatic combustion temperature, T c ad , is determined by total energy balance: \n\nand ∆ ?,7 9 is the heat of formation at 1 atm and reference temperature T 0 , c p,i is the heat capacity, and ∆ &,7 is the heat of s`th phase transition for components [35]. The combination of both above mentioned software programs made it possible to estimate the equilibrium composition, adiabatic temperature, gas generation, and standard enthalpy of formation for each examined system.",

The surface entropy is quite high {S r = (55.00 ± 0.05) 9 10 -6 NÁm -1 ÁK -1 at T = 308.15 K}, but lower than that for [EMIM][TCM] {S r = (10.61 ± 0.08) 9 10 -5 NÁm -1 ÁK -1 at T = 298.15 K [18] }, and higher than those for many ionic liquids [16,17,19,36]. The lower is the surface entropy, the lower is the surface organization of the solution. The lower value of entropy of the IL shows that the partial molar entropy of the IL decreases at the contact between the IL and air in the surface region. The surface enthalpy {H r = (64.98 ± 0.05) 9 10 -3 NÁm -1 at T = 308.15 K} is lower than those observed for [EMIM][TCM] (T = 298.15 K) [18] and other ionic liquids [16,17,19,36].",

It is also commonplace to write Equations (34) and (37) using the partial pressure of each gas instead of its fugacity. However, when the approximation of ideal-gas behavior is not valid, such as when high pressures or gas mixtures are considered, the fugacity constitutes a more appropriate measure of the chemical potential, which is the driving force for gas sorption in the polymer. It has been verified that using pressure-based or fugacity-based parameters yields the same results in mixed-gas sorption calculations; therefore, the accuracy of the multicomponent calculations with the DMS model does not depend on this choice [46,49,51,165].",
