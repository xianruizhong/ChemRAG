The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Figure 3.34. Within a period, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ generally increases with increasing $Z$. Down a group, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ value generally decreases with increasing $Z$. There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as $l$ increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the $s$ electrons are lower in energy than the $p$ electrons. This means that an $s$ electron is harder to remove from an atom than a $p$ electron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2}$ ) is an $s$ electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}$ ) is a $p$ electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring each time a new subshell begins.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.33 The first ionization energy of the elements in the first five periods are plotted against their atomic number.\n\nFirst Ionization Energies of Some Elements (kJ/mol)",

For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the nucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, the ionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learned about radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and to increase across a period.",

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Variation in Electron Affinities - \nWe also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that the second element in the group most often has the most negative EA.

For example, chlorine, with an EA value of $-348 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine is $-322 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion ( $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$), we add an electron to the $n=2$ shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the $n=3$ shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily, resulting in a more negative EA.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.35 This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) for selected elements.\n\nThe properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.",

This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively.

For the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule shown in Figure 5.2, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is $7.24 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$ lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms.

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long. In addition, the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum shows a single sharp resonance line at $5.78 \\mathrm{\\delta}$, a value characteristic of an alkene rather than an aromatic molecule.\n\nWhat's so special about $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons? Why do $2,6,10,14 \\pi$ electrons lead to aromatic stability, while other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$. Any other number would leave an energy level partially filled.\n\nThe six $\\pi$ molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are shown again in FIGURE 15.6. The lowest-energy MO, $\\psi_{1}$, occurs singly and contains two electrons. The next two lowest-energy orbitals, $\\psi_{2}$ and $\\psi_{3}$, are degenerate, and it therefore takes four electrons to fill both.

Small and medium rings are strained, but cyclohexane rings and very large rings are strain-free.\n\nThe data in FIGURE 4.4 show that Baeyer's theory is only partially correct. Cyclopropane and cyclobutane are indeed strained, just as predicted, but cyclopentane is more strained than predicted, and cyclohexane is strainfree. Cycloalkanes of intermediate size have only modest strain, and rings of 14 carbons or more are strain-free. Why is Baeyer's theory wrong?\n\nBaeyer's theory is wrong for the simple reason that he assumed all cycloalkanes to be flat. In fact, as we'll see in the next section, most cycloalkanes are not flat; instead, they adopt puckered three-dimensional conformations that allow bond angles to be nearly tetrahedral. As a result, angle strain occurs only in three- and fourmembered rings, which have little flexibility. For most ring sizes, particularly the medium-ring ( $\\mathrm{C}_{7}-\\mathrm{C}_{11}$ ) cycloalkanes, torsional strain caused by $\\mathrm{H} \\leftrightarrows \\mathrm{H}$ eclipsing interactions at adjacent carbons (Section 3.6) and steric strain caused by the repulsion between nonbonded atoms that approach too closely (Section 3.7) are the most important factors. Thus, three kinds of strain contribute to the overall energy of a cycloalkane.",

The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 ( 5 A ), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher $n$ level, which is more difficult to do. Group $2(2 \\mathrm{~A})$ has a filled $n s$ subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy $n p$, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled $n p$ subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing $n p$ electron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend in EA.",

The position of a chemical equilibrium is determined by the value of the free-energy change $(\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} \\boldsymbol{G})$ for the reaction, where $\\Delta G=\\Delta H-T \\Delta S$. The enthalpy term $(\\Delta H)$ corresponds to the net change in strength of chemical bonds broken and formed during the reaction; the entropy term $(\\Delta S)$ corresponds to the change in the amount of molecular randomness during the reaction. Reactions that have negative values of $\\Delta G$ release energy, are said to be exergonic, and have favorable equilibria. Reactions that have positive values of $\\Delta G$ absorb energy, are said to be endergonic, and have unfavorable equilibria.\n\nA reaction can be described pictorially using an energy diagram that follows the reaction course from reactants through transition state to product. The transition state is an activated complex occurring at the highestenergy point of a reaction. The amount of energy needed by reactants to reach this high point is the activation energy, $\\Delta G^{*}$. The higher the activation energy, the slower the reaction.\n\nMany reactions take place in more than one step and involve the formation of a reaction intermediate.

Answer: - \nAs for the diprotic acid examples, each successive ionization reaction is less extensive than the former, reflected in decreasing values for the stepwise acid ionization constants. This is a general characteristic of polyprotic acids and successive ionization constants often differ by a factor of about $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$.\n\nThis set of three dissociation reactions may appear to make calculations of equilibrium concentrations in a solution of $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ complicated. However, because the successive ionization constants differ by a factor of $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$, large differences exist in the small changes in concentration accompanying the ionization reactions. This allows the use of math-simplifying assumptions and processes, as demonstrated in the examples above.\n\nPolyprotic bases are capable of accepting more than one hydrogen ion. The carbonate ion is an example of a diprotic base, because it can accept two protons, as shown below. Similar to the case for polyprotic acids, note the ionization constants decrease with ionization step.

Thus, by measuring the UV spectrum of an unknown, we can derive structural information about the nature of any conjugated $\\pi$ electron system present in a molecule.\n\nOne of the most important factors affecting the wavelength of UV absorption by a molecule is the extent of conjugation. Molecular orbital calculations show that the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO decreases as the extent of conjugation increases. Thus, 1,3-butadiene absorbs at $\\lambda_{\\max }=217 \\mathrm{~nm}$, 1,3,5-hexatriene absorbs at $\\lambda_{\\max }=258 \\mathrm{~nm}$, and 1,3,5,7-octatetraene absorbs at $\\lambda_{\\max }=290 \\mathrm{~nm}$.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

For example, the hydrogen molecule, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 4.4 illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the $x$-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the $x$-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n\n\nFIGURE 4.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band.

The straight line in Figure 20.2 represents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons ( $\\mathrm{n}: \\mathrm{p}$ ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead- 207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52.

When a reagent such as HCl adds to an alkene, the electrophilic hydrogen ion approaches the $\\pi$ electrons of the double bond and forms a bond to one carbon, leaving a positive charge at the other carbon. This carbocation intermediate then reacts with the nucleophilic $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion to yield the addition product.\n\n\nAn electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction begins in a similar way, but there are a number of differences. One difference is that aromatic rings are less reactive toward electrophiles than alkenes. For example, $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ solution reacts instantly with most alkenes but does not react with benzene at room temperature. For bromination of benzene to take place, a catalyst such as $\\mathrm{FeBr}_{3}$ is needed. The catalyst makes the $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ molecule more electrophilic by polarizing it to give a $\\mathrm{FeBr}_{4}{ }^{-} \\mathrm{Br}^{+}$species that reacts as if it were $\\mathrm{Br}^{+}$. The polarized $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ molecule then reacts with the nucleophilic benzene ring to yield a nonaromatic carbocation intermediate that is doubly allylic (Section 11.5) and has three resonance forms.\n\n\nAlthough more stable than a typical alkyl carbocation because of resonance, the intermediate in electrophilic aromatic substitution is nevertheless much less stable than the starting benzene ring itself, with its $150 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ( $36 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) of aromatic stability. Thus, the reaction of an electrophile with a benzene ring is endergonic, has a substantial activation energy, and is rather slow.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins).

The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle.

When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current.

It's the method of structure determination that organic chemists usually turn to first.\n\nWe saw in the chapter on Structure Determination: Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy that mass spectrometry gives a molecule's formula and infrared spectroscopy identifies a molecule's functional groups. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy complements these other techniques by mapping a molecule's carbon-hydrogen framework. Taken together, MS, IR, and NMR make it possible to determine the structures of even very complex molecules.\n\n| Mass spectrometry | Molecular size and formula |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Infrared spectroscopy | Functional groups present |\n| NMR spectroscopy | Map of carbon-hydrogen framework |",

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

The radical carbon atom with an unpaired electron can adopt $s p^{2}$ hybridization, placing the unpaired electron in a $p$ orbital and giving a structure that is electronically symmetrical. The $p$ orbital on the central carbon can therefore overlap equally well with a $p$ orbital on either of the two neighboring carbons.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 10.4 An orbital view of the allyl radical. The $p$ orbital on the central carbon can overlap equally well with a $p$ orbital on either neighboring carbon, giving rise to two equivalent resonance structures.\n\nBecause the allyl radical is electronically symmetrical, it has two resonance forms-one with the unpaired electron on the left and the double bond on the right and another with the unpaired electron on the right and the double bond on the left. Neither structure is correct by itself; the true structure of the allyl radical is a resonance hybrid of the two. (You might want to review Section 2.4 to Section 2.6 to brush up on resonance.) As noted in Section 2.5, the greater the number of resonance forms, the greater the stability of a compound, because bonding electrons are attracted to more nuclei. An allyl radical, with two resonance forms, is therefore more stable than a typical alkyl radical, which has only a single structure.\n\nIn molecular orbital terms, the stability of the allyl radical is due to the fact that the unpaired electron is delocalized, or spread out, over an extended $\\pi$-orbital network rather than localized at only one site, as shown\nby the computer-generated MO in FIGURE 10.4. This delocalization is particularly apparent in the so-called spin-density surface in FIGURE 10.5, which shows the calculated location of the unpaired electron. The two terminal carbons share the unpaired electron equally.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.5 The spin density surface of the allyl radical locates the position of the unpaired electron and shows that it is equally shared between the two terminal carbons.",

This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 . The first two electrons in lithium fill the $1 s$ orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:\n\n\nAn atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4 , contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus.

Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment - \nAs discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge ( $\\delta^{+}$) and the other atom with a partial negative charge ( $\\delta^{-}$), as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole moment. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu( $\\mu$ ) and is given by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and $r$ is the distance between the charges:\n\n$$\n\\mu=\\mathrm{Qr}\n$$\n\nThis bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and magnitude (Figure 4.26). Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference between the two atoms.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 4.26 (a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between C and H , represented as a short vector.

If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

Answer: - \n$\\Delta H=-338 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \\mathrm{bar}=0.987 \\mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted \" o \" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\\left(\\Delta H^{\\circ}\\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)\n\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\\Delta H$, often \"normalized\" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)",

In fact,\nthe complex region of the IR spectrum, from $1500 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to around $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, is called the fingerprint region. If two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.\n\nFortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu .

The nucleus consists of subatomic particles called neutrons, which are electrically neutral, and protons, which are positively charged. Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a distance of approximately $10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, the diameter of a typical atom is about $2 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$, or 200 picometers (pm), where $1 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$. To give you an idea of how small this is, a thin pencil line is about 3 million carbon atoms wide. Although most chemists throughout the world use the International System (SI) of units and describe small distances in picometers, many organic chemists and biochemists in the United States still use the unit angstrom ( $\\AA$ ) to express atomic distances, where $1 \\AA=100 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$.

Nuclear Fusion and Fusion Reactors - \nThe process of converting very light nuclei into heavier nuclei is also accompanied by the conversion of mass into large amounts of energy, a process called fusion.

In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: $\\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{Z}=$ number of neutrons.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { atomic number }(\\mathrm{Z}) & =\\text { number of protons } \\\\\n\\text { mass number }(\\mathrm{A}) & =\\text { number of protons+ number of neutrons } \\\\\n\\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{Z} & =\\text { number of neutrons }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAtoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. When the numbers of these subatomic particles are not equal, the atom is electrically charged and is called an ion. The charge of an atom is defined as follows:\n\nAtomic charge $=$ number of protons - number of electrons\nAs will be discussed in more detail, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an anion. Positively charged atoms called cations are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom $(Z=11)$ has 11 electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge ( $11-10=1+$ ). A neutral oxygen atom $(Z=8)$ has eight electrons, and if it gains two electrons it will become an anion with a $2-$ charge ( $8-10=2-$ ).",

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

According to frontier orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene. The $2 E, 4 Z, 6 E$ isomer yields cis product; the $2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z$ isomer yields trans product (FIGURE 30.6).\n\n\nIn the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts conrotatory ring-closure. In practice, however, the conjugated diene reaction can be observed only in the reverse direction (cyclobutene $\\rightarrow$ diene) because of the position of the equilibrium. We therefore find that the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene ring opens in a conrotatory fashion. cis-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 Z$ )-2,4-hexadiene, and trans-3,4-dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 E$ )-2,4-hexadiene by conrotatory opening (FIGURE 30.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 30.7 Thermal ring-openings of cis- and trans-dimethylcyclobutene occur by conrotatory paths.",

In a typical mass spectrometer (Figure 2.15), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample's atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation's path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel ball). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a mass spectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron.

The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins).

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell.

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states.

In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$.

The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure - \nFIGURE 3.24 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale).\n\nElectrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the $5 p$ orbitals fill immediately after the $4 d$, and immediately before the $6 s$. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, $n$, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of 1 increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order $s>p>d>f$. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron-nucleus attractions slightly (recall\nthat all electrons have -1 charges, but nuclei have $+Z$ charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals ( $1 s$ through $3 p$ ), the increase in energy due to $n$ is more significant than the increase due to $l$; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.\n\nThe arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom. We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information (Figure 3.25):\n\n1. The number of the principal quantum shell, $n$,\n2.

The energy increases as we move up to the $2 s$ and then $2 p, 3 s$, and $3 p$ orbitals, showing that the increasing $n$ value has more influence on energy than the increasing $l$ value for small atoms.

The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (\"to build up\"). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 3.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 3.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 3.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order. For example, after filling the $3 p$ block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be $4 \\mathrm{~s}(\\mathrm{~K}, \\mathrm{Ca})$, followed by the $3 d$ orbitals.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.26 This diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state electron configurations.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.27 This partial periodic table shows electron configurations for the valence subshells of atoms.

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long. In addition, the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum shows a single sharp resonance line at $5.78 \\mathrm{\\delta}$, a value characteristic of an alkene rather than an aromatic molecule.\n\nWhat's so special about $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons? Why do $2,6,10,14 \\pi$ electrons lead to aromatic stability, while other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$. Any other number would leave an energy level partially filled.\n\nThe six $\\pi$ molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are shown again in FIGURE 15.6. The lowest-energy MO, $\\psi_{1}$, occurs singly and contains two electrons. The next two lowest-energy orbitals, $\\psi_{2}$ and $\\psi_{3}$, are degenerate, and it therefore takes four electrons to fill both. The result is a stable six- $\\pi$-electron aromatic molecule with filled bonding orbitals.",

Look at methane, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, the main constituent of natural gas, for example. The bonding in methane is not ionic because it would take too much energy for carbon ( $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{2}$ ) either to gain or lose four electrons to achieve a noble-gas configuration. Instead, carbon bonds to other atoms, not by gaining or losing electrons, but by sharing them. Such a sharedelectron bond, first proposed in 1916 by the American chemist G. N. Lewis, is called a covalent bond. The neutral collection of atoms held together by covalent bonds is called a molecule. Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, however, are not called molecules.\n\nA simple way of indicating the covalent bonds in molecules is to use what are called Lewis structures, or electron-dot structures, in which the valence-shell electrons of an atom are represented as dots. Thus, hydrogen has one dot representing its $1 s$ electron, carbon has four dots ( $2 s^{2} 2 p^{2}$ ), oxygen has six dots ( $2 s^{2} 2 p^{4}$ ), and so on. A stable molecule results whenever a noble-gas configuration of eight dots (an octet) is achieved for all main-group atoms or two dots for hydrogen. Even simpler than Lewis structures is the use of Kekulé structures, or line-bond structures, in which the two-electron covalent bonds are indicated as lines drawn between atoms.",

For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and a ground state electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 4 s^{2}$. When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with 18 electrons, a $2+$ charge, and an electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6}$.

Silicon's empty $d$ orbitals and boron's empty $p$ orbital enable tetrahedral silicon compounds and trigonal planar boron compounds to act as Lewis acids.

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

The electrons occupying the outermost shell orbital(s) (highest value of $n$ ) are called valence electrons, and those occupying the inner shell orbitals are called core electrons (Figure 3.28).

However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{4}$, with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two $2 p$ orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds form from the overlap of these two $2 p$ orbitals with the $1 s$ orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be $90^{\\circ}$, as shown in Figure 5.6 , because $p$ orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is $104.5^{\\circ}$, not $90^{\\circ}$. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.6 The hypothetical overlap of two of the $2 p$ orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1 s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of $90^{\\circ}$.

Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons.

The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 .

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe multiple covalent bonding in terms of atomic orbital overlap\n- Relate the concept of resonance to $\\pi$-bonding and electron delocalization\n\nThe hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, $\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{4}$, shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.\n\n\nThe three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the $\\sigma$ bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the $2 p$ orbitals and the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 5.22). These orbitals form the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ single bonds and the $\\sigma$ bond in the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ double bond (Figure 5.23). The $\\pi$ bond in the $\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{C}$ double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) $2 p$ orbital on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized $p$ orbital (lobes shown in red and blue in Figure 5.23) is perpendicular to the plane of the $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized $2 p$ orbitals overlap in a side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis (Figure 5.23) and form a $\\pi$ bond.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.22 In ethene, each carbon atom is $s p^{2}$ hybridized, and the $s p^{2}$ orbitals and the $p$ orbital are singly occupied. The hybrid orbitals overlap to form $\\sigma$ bonds, while the $p$ orbitals on each carbon atom overlap to form $a \\pi$ bond.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

The subject can be a bit complex but is so important that it's worthwhile spending time to become familiar with it.\n\nAn object or molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image is said to be chiral, meaning \"handed.\" A chiral molecule is one that does not have a plane of symmetry cutting through it so that one half is a mirror image of the other half. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups-a so-called chirality center. Chiral compounds can exist as a pair of nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers called enantiomers. Enantiomers are identical in all physical properties except for the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nThe stereochemical configuration of a chirality center can be specified as either $\\boldsymbol{R}$ (rectus) or $\\boldsymbol{S}$ (sinister) by using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. First rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon atom, and then orient the molecule so that the lowest-ranked group points directly back. If a curved arrow drawn in the direction of decreasing rank $(1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3)$ for the remaining three groups is clockwise, the chirality center has the $R$ configuration. If the direction is counterclockwise, the chirality center has the $S$ configuration.\n\nSome molecules have more than one chirality center. Enantiomers have opposite configuration at all chirality centers, whereas diastereomers have the same configuration in at least one center but opposite configurations at the others. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one chirality center. A compound with $n$ chirality centers can have a maximum of $2^{n}$ stereoisomers.\n\nA meso compound contains a chirality center but is achiral overall because it has a plane of symmetry. Racemic mixtures, or racemates, are 50:50 mixtures of (+) and (-) enantiomers. Racemates and individual diastereomers differ in their physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, and boiling point.",

Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) contains single $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules with each of the two oxygen atoms attached to the carbon atom by double bonds. Very weak intermolecular forces hold the molecules together in the crystal. The volatility of dry ice reflect these weak forces between molecules.

Second-period elements, such as carbon, form very strong $\\pi$ bonds, which is why carbon dioxide forms small molecules with strong double bonds.

This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the octet rule.\n\nThe number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table ( $\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{O}$, and F ). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet.

We'll see in Chapter 15, for instance, that the six carbon-carbon bonds in aromatic compounds, such as benzene, are equivalent and that benzene is best represented as a hybrid of two resonance forms. Although each individual resonance form seems to imply that benzene has alternating single and double bonds, neither form is correct by itself. The true benzene structure is a hybrid of the two individual forms, and all six carbon-carbon bonds are equivalent. This symmetrical distribution of electrons around the molecule is evident in an\nelectrostatic potential map.\n\n\n\nBenzene (two resonance forms)",

In methane, for instance, the carbon atom owns one electron in each of the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

In many cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one possible molecular structure-different multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a particular molecule or ion:\n\n1. A molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in which some formal charges are not zero.\n2. If the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the smallest nonzero formal charges is preferable.\n3. Lewis structures are preferable when adjacent formal charges are zero or of the opposite sign.\n4. When we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of formal charges, the structure with the negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms is preferable.\n\nTo see how these guidelines apply, let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. We know from our previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central position, but formal charges allow us to understand why this occurs.

Chemically, a given functional group behaves in nearly the same way in every molecule it's a part of. For example, compare ethylene, a plant hormone that causes fruit to ripen, with menthene, a much more complicated molecule found in peppermint oil. Both substances contain a carbon-carbon double-bond functional group, and both therefore react with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in the same way to give a product in which a Br atom has added to each of the double-bond carbons (FIGURE 3.2). This example is typical: the chemistry of every organic molecule, regardless of size and complexity, is determined by the functional groups it contains.\n\n\n\nEthylene\n\n\n\nMenthene\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 The reactions of ethylene and menthene with bromine. In both molecules, the carbon-carbon double-bond functional group has a similar polarity pattern, so both molecules react with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in the same way. The size and complexity of the molecules are not important.\n\nLook at TABLE 3.1, which lists many of the common functional groups and gives simple examples of their occurrence. Some functional groups have only carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; others have halogen atoms; and still others contain oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Much of the chemistry you'll be studying is the chemistry of these functional groups.",

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

When a reagent such as HCl adds to an alkene, the electrophilic hydrogen ion approaches the $\\pi$ electrons of the double bond and forms a bond to one carbon, leaving a positive charge at the other carbon. This carbocation intermediate then reacts with the nucleophilic $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion to yield the addition product.\n\n\nAn electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction begins in a similar way, but there are a number of differences. One difference is that aromatic rings are less reactive toward electrophiles than alkenes. For example, $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ solution reacts instantly with most alkenes but does not react with benzene at room temperature. For bromination of benzene to take place, a catalyst such as $\\mathrm{FeBr}_{3}$ is needed. The catalyst makes the $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ molecule more electrophilic by polarizing it to give a $\\mathrm{FeBr}_{4}{ }^{-} \\mathrm{Br}^{+}$species that reacts as if it were $\\mathrm{Br}^{+}$. The polarized $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ molecule then reacts with the nucleophilic benzene ring to yield a nonaromatic carbocation intermediate that is doubly allylic (Section 11.5) and has three resonance forms.\n\n\nAlthough more stable than a typical alkyl carbocation because of resonance, the intermediate in electrophilic aromatic substitution is nevertheless much less stable than the starting benzene ring itself, with its $150 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ( $36 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) of aromatic stability. Thus, the reaction of an electrophile with a benzene ring is endergonic, has a substantial activation energy, and is rather slow. FIGURE 16.2 shows an energy diagram comparing the reaction of an electrophile with an alkene and with benzene. The benzene reaction is slower (higher $\\Delta G^{+}$) because the starting material is more stable.",

The radical carbon atom with an unpaired electron can adopt $s p^{2}$ hybridization, placing the unpaired electron in a $p$ orbital and giving a structure that is electronically symmetrical. The $p$ orbital on the central carbon can therefore overlap equally well with a $p$ orbital on either of the two neighboring carbons.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 10.4 An orbital view of the allyl radical. The $p$ orbital on the central carbon can overlap equally well with a $p$ orbital on either neighboring carbon, giving rise to two equivalent resonance structures.\n\nBecause the allyl radical is electronically symmetrical, it has two resonance forms-one with the unpaired electron on the left and the double bond on the right and another with the unpaired electron on the right and the double bond on the left. Neither structure is correct by itself; the true structure of the allyl radical is a resonance hybrid of the two. (You might want to review Section 2.4 to Section 2.6 to brush up on resonance.) As noted in Section 2.5, the greater the number of resonance forms, the greater the stability of a compound, because bonding electrons are attracted to more nuclei. An allyl radical, with two resonance forms, is therefore more stable than a typical alkyl radical, which has only a single structure.\n\nIn molecular orbital terms, the stability of the allyl radical is due to the fact that the unpaired electron is delocalized, or spread out, over an extended $\\pi$-orbital network rather than localized at only one site, as shown\nby the computer-generated MO in FIGURE 10.4. This delocalization is particularly apparent in the so-called spin-density surface in FIGURE 10.5, which shows the calculated location of the unpaired electron. The two terminal carbons share the unpaired electron equally.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.5 The spin density surface of the allyl radical locates the position of the unpaired electron and shows that it is equally shared between the two terminal carbons.",

For example, hydroboration-oxidation of 1-methylcyclopentene yields trans-2-methylcyclopentanol. In this process, boron and hydrogen add to the alkene from the same face of the double bond-that is, with syn stereochemistry, the opposite of anti-with boron attaching to the less highly substituted carbon. During the oxidation step, the boron is replaced by an -OH with the same stereochemistry, resulting in an overall syn non-Markovnikov addition of water. This stereochemical result is particularly useful because it is complementary to the Markovnikov regiochemistry observed for oxymercuration-demercuration.\n\n\nWhy does alkene hydroboration take place with syn, non-Markovnikov regiochemistry to yield the less highly substituted alcohol? Hydroboration differs from many other alkene addition reactions in that it occurs in a single step without a carbocation intermediate (FIGURE 8.6). Because the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{B}$ bonds form at the same time and from the same face of the alkene, syn stereochemistry results.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ).

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

An atomic orbital is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most probable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is based on solutions of the Schrödinger equation. In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.\n\nAnother quantum number is $l$, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take the values, $l=0,1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have only one value of $l, l=0$, whereas $n=2$ permits $l=0$ and $l=1$, and so on. Whereas the principal quantum number, $n$, defines the general size and energy of the orbital, the secondary quantum number 1 specifies the shape of the orbital. Orbitals with the same value of $l$ define a subshell.",

Variation in Electron Affinities - \nThe electron affinity (EA) is the energy change for the process of adding an electron to a gaseous atom to form an anion (negative ion).\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{X}(g)+\\mathrm{e}^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{X}^{-}(g) \\quad \\mathrm{EA}_{1}\n$$\n\nThis process can be either endothermic or exothermic, depending on the element. The EA of some of the elements is given in Figure 3.35. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a -2 ion, and so on.\n\nAs we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 ( 5 A ), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher $n$ level, which is more difficult to do. Group $2(2 \\mathrm{~A})$ has a filled $n s$ subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy $n p$, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled $n p$ subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing $n p$ electron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend in EA.",

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude.

Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds).

The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 . The first two electrons in lithium fill the $1 s$ orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:\n\n\nAn atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4 , contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nTABLE 5.1\n\nMolecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals. Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function, $\\Psi$, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized) energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital ( $\\Psi^{2}$ ). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.\n\nWe will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms ( $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ or $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, for example). Such molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular orbitals occur.\n\nThe mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with troughs (Figure 5.28). In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.28 (a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude.

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's surface, and the expansion of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports stadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a few seconds before sitting down again while the fans in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in sequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually travel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats.\n\nWaves need not be restricted to travel through matter.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a onedimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 3.7 shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen in Figure 3.7. The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths $n$. Since the number of nodes is $n-1$, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor.

The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

Also in common use is a chemical method of peptide sequencing called the Edman degradation.\n\nThe general idea of peptide sequencing by Edman degradation is to cleave one amino acid at a time from an end of the peptide chain. That terminal amino acid is then separated and identified, and the cleavage reactions are repeated on the chain-shortened peptide until the entire peptide sequence is known. Automated protein sequencers are available that allow as many as 50 repetitive sequencing cycles to be carried out before a buildup of unwanted by-products interferes with the results. So efficient are these instruments that sequence information can be obtained from as little as 1 to 5 picomoles of sample-less than $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~g}$.\n\nAs shown in FIGURE 26.5, Edman degradation involves treatment of a peptide with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5}-\\mathrm{N}=\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{S}$, followed by reaction with trifluoroacetic acid.

Further acidcatalyzed rearrangement of the ATZ derivative with aqueous acid converts it into a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH), which is identified by comparison of its elution time with the known elution times of PTH derivatives of the 20 common amino acids. The chain-shortened peptide is then automatically resubmitted for another round of Edman degradation.",

The reasons for this include smaller size, greater ionization energy, and (most important) the fact that the first member of each group has only four valence orbitals (one $2 s$ and three $2 p$ ) available for bonding, whereas other group members have empty $d$ orbitals in their valence shells, making possible five, six, or even more bonds around the central atom. For example, nitrogen forms only $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$, whereas phosphorus forms both $\\mathrm{PF}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{PF}_{5}$.\n\nAnother difference between the first group member and subsequent members is the greater ability of the first member to form $\\pi$ bonds.

In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

As discussed previously, the plutonium forms from the combination of neutrons and the uranium in the fuel. In any nuclear reactor, only about $0.1 \\%$ of the mass of the fuel is converted into energy. The other $99.9 \\%$ remains in the fuel rods as fission products and unused fuel. All of the fission products absorb neutrons, and after a period of several months to a few years, depending on the reactor, the fission products must be removed by changing the fuel rods. Otherwise, the concentration of these fission products would increase and absorb more neutrons until the reactor could no longer operate.\n\nSpent fuel rods contain a variety of products, consisting of unstable nuclei ranging in atomic number from 25 to 60 , some transuranium elements, including plutonium and americium, and unreacted uranium isotopes. The unstable nuclei and the transuranium isotopes give the spent fuel a dangerously high level of radioactivity. The long-lived isotopes require thousands of years to decay to a safe level. The ultimate fate of the nuclear reactor as a significant source of energy in the United States probably rests on whether or not a politically and scientifically satisfactory technique for processing and storing the components of spent fuel rods can be developed.",

None of the extraordinary advances of the past several decades would have been possible, however, were it not for the discovery in 1977 of methods for sequencing immense DNA chains.\n\nThe first step in DNA sequencing is to cleave the enormous chain at known points to produce smaller, more manageable pieces, a task accomplished by the use of restriction endonucleases, or restriction enzymes. Each different restriction enzyme, of which more than 4000 are known and approximately 600 are commercially available, cleaves a DNA molecule at a point in the chain where a specific base sequence occurs. For example, the restriction enzyme AluI cleaves between $G$ and $C$ in the four-base sequence AG-CT. Note that the sequence is a palindrome, meaning that the sequence ( $5^{\\prime}$ )-AGCT-( $3^{\\prime}$ ) is the same as its complement ( $3^{\\prime}$ )-TCGA-( $5^{\\prime}$ ) when both are read in the same $5^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 3^{\\prime}$ direction. The same is true for other restriction endonucleases.\n\nIf the original DNA molecule is cut with another restriction enzyme having a different specificity for cleavage, still other segments are produced whose sequences partially overlap those produced by the first enzyme. Sequencing all the segments, followed by identification of the overlapping regions, allows for complete DNA sequencing.\n\nA dozen or so different methods of DNA sequencing are now available, and many others are under development.

At the low frequency (low energy, long wavelength) end of this region are AM (amplitude modulation) radio signals ( $540-2830 \\mathrm{kHz}$ ) that can travel long distances. FM (frequency modulation) radio signals are used at higher frequencies ( $87.5-108.0 \\mathrm{MHz}$ ). In AM radio, the information is transmitted by varying the amplitude of the wave (Figure 3.5). In FM radio, by contrast, the amplitude is constant and the instantaneous frequency varies.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.5 This schematic depicts how amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) can be used to transmit a radio wave.\n\nOther technologies also operate in the radio-wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, 4G cellular telephone signals are approximately 880 MHz , while Global Positioning System (GPS) signals operate at 1.228 and 1.575 GHz , local area wireless technology (Wi-Fi) networks operate at 2.4 to 5 GHz , and highway toll sensors operate at 5.8 GHz . The frequencies associated with these applications are convenient because such waves tend not to be absorbed much by common building materials.",

Entropy and Microstates - \nThe previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (Figure 12.4) is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. Initially, the gas molecules are confined to just one of the two flasks. Opening the valve between the flasks increases the volume available to the gas molecules and, correspondingly, the number of microstates possible for the system. Since $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the expansion process involves an increase in entropy $(\\Delta S>0)$ and is spontaneous.\n\nA similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two objects, each containing two particles, and two units of thermal energy (represented as \"*\") in Figure 12.9. The hot object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution (a), is $\\frac{3}{10}$. More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being $\\frac{7}{10}$. The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), the probability of this configuration being $\\frac{4}{10}$. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects' temperatures. And, again, this spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.",

Having now seen the valence bond approach, which uses hybrid atomic orbitals to account for geometry and assumes the overlap of atomic orbitals to account for electron sharing, let's look briefly at the molecular orbital approach to bonding. We'll return to this topic in Chapters 14, 15, and 30 for a more in-depth discussion.\n\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes covalent bond formation as arising from a mathematical combination of atomic orbitals (wave functions) on different atoms to form molecular orbitals, so called because they belong to the entire molecule rather than to an individual atom. Just as an atomic orbital, whether unhybridized or hybridized, describes a region of space around an atom where an electron is likely to be found, so a molecular orbital describes a region of space in a molecule where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nLike an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a specific size, shape, and energy. In the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule, for example, two singly occupied $1 s$ atomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals. There are two ways for the orbital combination to occur-an additive way and a subtractive way. The additive combination leads to formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy and roughly egg-shaped, while the subtractive combination leads to a molecular orbital that is higher in energy and has a node between nuclei (FIGURE 1.18). Note that the additive combination is a single, egg-shaped, molecular orbital; it is not the same as the two overlapping 1 s atomic orbitals of the valence bond description. Similarly, the subtractive combination is a single molecular orbital with the shape of an elongated dumbbell.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.18 Molecular orbitals of $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{2}}$. Combination of two hydrogen $1 s$ atomic orbitals leads to two $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecular orbitals. The lowerenergy, bonding MO is filled, and the higher-energy, antibonding MO is unfilled.",

The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL . The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the $22-\\mathrm{mL}$ mark than to the $21-\\mathrm{mL}$ mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid's volume would be 21.6 mL . In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place digit as 5 , while others may think it to be even closer to the $22-\\mathrm{mL}$ mark and estimate this digit to be 7 . Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. The scale in this case has $1-\\mathrm{mL}$ divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL .",

The mathematical expression known as the wave function, $\\psi$, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 5.7).

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks.

The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Although these two symbols appear nearly identical, they mean very different things). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as being a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued that Bohr's assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is considered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that only an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit (Figure 3.17).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.17 If an electron is viewed as a wave circling around the nucleus, an integer number of wavelengths must fit into the orbit for this standing wave behavior to be possible.\n\nFor a circular orbit of radius $r$, the circumference is $2 \\pi r$, and so de Broglie's condition is:\n\n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

This approach is perfectly acceptable when computing the formula mass of an ionic compound. Even though a sodium cation has a slightly smaller mass than a sodium atom (since it is missing an electron), this difference will be offset by the fact that a chloride anion is slightly more massive than a chloride atom (due to the extra electron). Moreover, the mass of an electron is negligibly small with respect to the mass of a typical atom. Even when calculating the mass of an isolated ion, the missing\nor additional electrons can generally be ignored, since their contribution to the overall mass is negligible, reflected only in the nonsignificant digits that will be lost when the computed mass is properly rounded.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively.

Rutherford bombarded nitrogen atoms with high-speed $\\alpha$ particles from a natural radioactive isotope of radium and observed protons resulting from the reaction:\n\n$$\n{ }_{7}^{14} \\mathrm{~N}+{ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He} \\longrightarrow{ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}+{ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}\n$$\n\nThe ${ }_{8}^{17} \\mathrm{O}$ and ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nuclei that are produced are stable, so no further (nuclear) changes occur.\nTo reach the kinetic energies necessary to produce transmutation reactions, devices called particle accelerators are used. These devices use magnetic and electric fields to increase the speeds of nuclear particles. In all accelerators, the particles move in a vacuum to avoid collisions with gas molecules. When neutrons are required for transmutation reactions, they are usually obtained from radioactive decay reactions or from various nuclear reactions occurring in nuclear reactors. The Chemistry in Everyday Life feature that follows discusses a famous particle accelerator that made worldwide news.",

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

The Kinetic-Molecular Theory\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\n- State the postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory\n- Use this theory's postulates to explain the gas laws\n\nThe gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm . Although the gas laws describe relationships that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these relationships.\n\nThe kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term \"molecule\" will be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)\n\n1. Gases are composed of molecules that are in continuous motion, travelling in straight lines and changing direction only when they collide with other molecules or with the walls of a container.\n2. The molecules composing the gas are negligibly small compared to the distances between them.\n3. The pressure exerted by a gas in a container results from collisions between the gas molecules and the container walls.\n4. Gas molecules exert no attractive or repulsive forces on each other or the container walls; therefore, their collisions are elastic (do not involve a loss of energy).\n5. The average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is proportional to the kelvin temperature of the gas.\n\nThe test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT, which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws (Boyle's, Charles's, Amontons's, Avogadro's, and Dalton's laws) conceptually to see how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain Graham's law.",

Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's surface, and the expansion of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports stadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a few seconds before sitting down again while the fans in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in sequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually travel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats.\n\nWaves need not be restricted to travel through matter.

Using the concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at \"time zero,\" when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle's initial rate-analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction-would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes ( $t_{0}$ ). A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment-call it $t_{1}$-would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car's average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop ( $\\Delta t$ ). Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. In a plot of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at any time $t$ is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time (Figure 17.3). These tangent line slopes may be evaluated using calculus, but the procedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter.",

The nucleus consists of subatomic particles called neutrons, which are electrically neutral, and protons, which are positively charged. Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a distance of approximately $10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, the diameter of a typical atom is about $2 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$, or 200 picometers (pm), where $1 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$. To give you an idea of how small this is, a thin pencil line is about 3 million carbon atoms wide.

Band Theory - \nIn order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is \"easy\" to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so \"large\" that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when \"moderate\" amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics.\n\nSemiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells. Solar cells produce electricity when light provides the energy to move electrons out of the valence band.

The Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part I - \nRecalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas as follows:\n\n- Amontons's law. If the temperature is increased, the average speed and kinetic energy of the gas molecules increase. If the volume is held constant, the increased speed of the gas molecules results in more frequent and more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, therefore increasing the pressure (Figure 8.31).\n- Charles's law. If the temperature of a gas is increased, a constant pressure may be maintained only if the volume occupied by the gas increases. This will result in greater average distances traveled by the molecules to reach the container walls, as well as increased wall surface area. These conditions will decrease the both the frequency of molecule-wall collisions and the number of collisions per unit area, the combined effects of which balance the effect of increased collision forces due to the greater kinetic energy at the higher temperature.\n- Boyle's law. If the gas volume volume of a given amount of gas at a given temperature is decreased (that is, if the gas is compressed), the molecules will be exposed to a decreased container wall area. Collisions with\nthe container wall will therefore occur more frequently and the pressure exerted by the gas will increase (Figure 8.31).\n- Avogadro's law. At constant pressure and temperature, the frequency and force of molecule-wall collisions are constant. Under such conditions, increasing the number of gaseous molecules will require a proportional increase in the container volume in order to yield a decrease in the number of collisions per unit area to compensate for the increased frequency of collisions (Figure 8.31).\n- Dalton's Law. Because of the large distances between them, the molecules of one gas in a mixture bombard the container walls with the same frequency whether other gases are present or not, and the total pressure of a gas mixture equals the sum of the (partial) pressures of the individual gases.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.31 (a) When gas temperature increases, gas pressure increases due to increased force and frequency of molecular collisions. (b) When volume decreases, gas pressure increases due to increased frequency of molecular collisions. (c) When the amount of gas increases at a constant pressure, volume increases to yield a constant number of collisions per unit wall area per unit time.",

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes.

Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

Molecular Orbital Theory\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called $\\sigma$ MOs. They can be formed from $s$ orbitals or from $p$ orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from $p$ orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called $\\pi$ orbitals.\n\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund's rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins.

Because they're positively charged, these spinning nuclei act like tiny magnets and can interact with an external magnetic field, denoted $\\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$. Not all nuclei act this way, but fortunately for organic chemists, both the proton $\\left({ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$ and the ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus do have spins. The more common ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ isotope, however, does not have nuclear spin.

Let's see what the consequences of nuclear spin are and how we can use the results.\n\nIn the absence of an external magnetic field, the spins of magnetic nuclei are oriented randomly. When a sample containing these nuclei is placed between the poles of a strong magnet, however, the nuclei adopt specific orientations, much as a compass needle orients in the earth's magnetic field. A spinning ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus can orient so that its own tiny magnetic field is aligned either with (parallel to) or against (antiparallel to) the external field.

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

Although we'll just give an overview of the subject in this chapter, focusing on NMR applications with small molecules, more advanced NMR techniques are also used in biological chemistry to study protein structure and folding.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most valuable spectroscopic technique available to organic chemists. It's the method of structure determination that organic chemists usually turn to first.\n\nWe saw in the chapter on Structure Determination: Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy that mass spectrometry gives a molecule's formula and infrared spectroscopy identifies a molecule's functional groups. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy complements these other techniques by mapping a molecule's carbon-hydrogen framework. Taken together, MS, IR, and NMR make it possible to determine the structures of even very complex molecules.\n\n| Mass spectrometry | Molecular size and formula |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Infrared spectroscopy | Functional groups present |\n| NMR spectroscopy | Map of carbon-hydrogen framework |",

The radical carbon atom with an unpaired electron can adopt $s p^{2}$ hybridization, placing the unpaired electron in a $p$ orbital and giving a structure that is electronically symmetrical. The $p$ orbital on the central carbon can therefore overlap equally well with a $p$ orbital on either of the two neighboring carbons.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 10.4 An orbital view of the allyl radical. The $p$ orbital on the central carbon can overlap equally well with a $p$ orbital on either neighboring carbon, giving rise to two equivalent resonance structures.\n\nBecause the allyl radical is electronically symmetrical, it has two resonance forms-one with the unpaired electron on the left and the double bond on the right and another with the unpaired electron on the right and the double bond on the left. Neither structure is correct by itself; the true structure of the allyl radical is a resonance hybrid of the two. (You might want to review Section 2.4 to Section 2.6 to brush up on resonance.) As noted in Section 2.5, the greater the number of resonance forms, the greater the stability of a compound, because bonding electrons are attracted to more nuclei. An allyl radical, with two resonance forms, is therefore more stable than a typical alkyl radical, which has only a single structure.\n\nIn molecular orbital terms, the stability of the allyl radical is due to the fact that the unpaired electron is delocalized, or spread out, over an extended $\\pi$-orbital network rather than localized at only one site, as shown\nby the computer-generated MO in FIGURE 10.4. This delocalization is particularly apparent in the so-called spin-density surface in FIGURE 10.5, which shows the calculated location of the unpaired electron. The two terminal carbons share the unpaired electron equally.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.5 The spin density surface of the allyl radical locates the position of the unpaired electron and shows that it is equally shared between the two terminal carbons.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nQuantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ differ from those predicted by the overlap of the $1 s$ orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the $2 p$ orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, $\\psi$, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 5.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle $\\left(109.5^{\\circ}\\right)$. The observed angle of $104.5^{\\circ}$ is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 5.7 (a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral arrangement of hybrid orbitals.

Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nTABLE 5.1\n\nMolecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals. Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function, $\\Psi$, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized) energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital ( $\\Psi^{2}$ ). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.\n\nWe will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms ( $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ or $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, for example). Such molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular orbitals occur.\n\nThe mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with troughs (Figure 5.28). In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.28 (a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude. (b) When out-of-phase waves combine, destructive interference produces a wave with less (or no) amplitude.",

When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current. Aromatic protons are deshielded by the induced magnetic field caused by delocalized $\\pi$ electrons circulating around the aromatic ring.\nNote that the aromatic ring-current produces different effects inside and outside the ring.

Since the core electron shells correspond to noble gas electron configurations, we can abbreviate electron configurations by writing the noble gas that matches the core electron configuration, along with the valence electrons in a condensed format. For our sodium example, the symbol [ Ne ] represents core electrons, $\\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6}\\right)$ and our abbreviated or condensed configuration is [ Ne$] 3 s^{1}$.\n\n\nAbbreviation $[\\mathrm{Ne}] 3 s^{1}$\n\nFIGURE 3.28 A core-abbreviated electron configuration (right) replaces the core electrons with the noble gas symbol whose configuration matches the core electron configuration of the other element.\n\nSimilarly, the abbreviated configuration of lithium can be represented as [He] $2 s^{1}$, where [He] represents the configuration of the helium atom, which is identical to that of the filled inner shell of lithium. Writing the configurations in this way emphasizes the similarity of the configurations of lithium and sodium. Both atoms, which are in the alkali metal family, have only one electron in a valence $s$ subshell outside a filled set of inner shells.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{Li}:[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{1} \\\\\n& \\mathrm{Na}:[\\mathrm{Ne}] 3 s^{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it is also an exothermic quantity.

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes.

This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Answer: - \n$\\Delta H=-338 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \\mathrm{bar}=0.987 \\mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted \" o \" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\\left(\\Delta H^{\\circ}\\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)\n\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\\Delta H$, often \"normalized\" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)",

However, we do find exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27. For instance, the electron configurations (shown in Figure 3.29) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper ( Cu ; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling.\n\nIn the case of Cr and Cu , we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the $4 s$ into the $3 d$ orbital to gain the extra stability of a half-filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cr ) or a filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cu ). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium ( Nb , atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{2} 4 d^{3}$. Experimentally, we observe that its ground-state electron configuration is actually $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{1} 4 d^{4}$. We can rationalize this observation by saying that the electron-electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the $5 s$ orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the $5 s$ and $4 d$ orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.",

For example, the ion bis(bipyridyl)osmium(II) uses bis- to signify that there are two ligands attached to Os, and each bipyridyl ligand contains two pyridine groups $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{H}_{4} \\mathrm{~N}\\right)$.\n\nWhen the complex is either a cation or a neutral molecule, the name of the central metal atom is spelled exactly like the name of the element and is followed by a Roman numeral in parentheses to indicate its oxidation state (Table 19.2 and Table 19.3). When the complex is an anion, the suffix -ate is added to the stem of the name of the metal, followed by the Roman numeral designation of its oxidation state (Table 19.4).\nSometimes, the Latin name of the metal is used when the English name is clumsy. For example, ferrate is used instead of ironate, plumbate instead leadate, and stannate instead of tinate. The oxidation state of the metal is determined based on the charges of each ligand and the overall charge of the coordination compound. For example, in $\\left[\\mathrm{Cr}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{4} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\\right] \\mathrm{Br}$, the coordination sphere (in brackets) has a charge of $1+$ to balance the bromide ion. The water ligands are neutral, and the chloride ligands are anionic with a charge of 1-each. To determine the oxidation state of the metal, we set the overall charge equal to the sum of the ligands and the metal: $+1=-2$ $+x$, so the oxidation state $(x)$ is equal to $3+$.",

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThis view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstax.org/l/16combustion) illustrates the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into energy of motion.\n\nAs discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as $\\Delta U=q+w$. Internal energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m , and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 9.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).\n\n\nFIGURE 9.20 Paths $X$ and $Y$ represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path).

Electronic Structures of Cations - \nWhen forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its valence electrons, thus assuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and a ground state electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 4 s^{2}$. When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with 18 electrons, a $2+$ charge, and an electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6}$. The $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion is therefore isoelectronic with the noble gas Ar.\n\nFor groups 13-17, the group numbers exceed the number of valence electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility of full $d$ subshells in atoms of elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10.

An intuitive explanation of this rule is to imagine that one reactant donates electrons to the other. As with electrocyclic reactions, it's the electrons in the HOMO of the first reactant that are least tightly held and most likely to be donated.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

The Aufbau Principle - \nWe will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first and second periods of the periodic table. Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron ( $n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ ). The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins).

The Formation of Ionic Compounds - \nBinary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have relatively low ionization potentials and lose electrons easily. These elements lie to the left in a period or near the bottom of a group on the periodic table. Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. Nonmetallic elements are found in the upper-right corner of the periodic table.\n\nAs all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide, $\\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$, indicates that this ionic compound contains two aluminum cations, $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$, for every three oxide anions, $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ [thus, $(2 \\times+3)+(3 \\times-2)=0$ ].\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a sodium chloride ( NaCl ) \"molecule\" because there is not a\nsingle ionic bond, per se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces between ions are isotropic-the same in all directions-meaning that any particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound, threedimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a regular arrangement of equal numbers of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$cations and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$anions (Figure 4.3).",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Molecular polarity results from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule. As a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar substances are insoluble in water.\n\nNet polarity is measured by a quantity called the dipole moment and can be thought of in the following way: assume that there is a center of mass of all positive charges (nuclei) in a molecule and a center of mass of all negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don't coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.\n\nThe dipole moment, $\\mu$ (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge $Q$ at either end of the molecular dipole times the distance $r$ between the charges, $\\mu=Q \\times r$. Dipole moments are expressed in debyes $(\\mathrm{D})$, where $1 \\mathrm{D}=3.336 \\times 10^{-30}$ coulomb meters ( $\\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$ ) in SI units. For example, the unit charge on an electron is $1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

The lattice energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this attraction. The lattice energy ( $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} \\boldsymbol{H}_{\\text {lattice }}$ ) of an ionic compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into its component gaseous ions.

Some texts use the equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice energy as the energy released when separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic) values. Thus, if you are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which definition is being used. In both cases, a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates a more stable ionic compound. For sodium chloride, $\\Delta H_{\\text {lattice }}=769 \\mathrm{~kJ}$.

They suggested that although interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles (Figure 11.28). In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the actual concentrations. Note that the van't Hoff factors for the electrolytes in Table 11.3 are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of $i$ for NaCl is 1.9 , as opposed to an ideal value of 2 .\n\n\nFIGURE 11.28 Dissociation of ionic compounds in water is not always complete due to the formation of ion pairs.",

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

Ionic Compounds - \nWhen an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an element composed of atoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed by this transfer is stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite charge present in the compound. For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one electron to form a sodium cation, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and each chlorine atom in a sample of chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to form a chloride anion, $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the resulting compound, NaCl , is composed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio of one $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion for each $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion. Similarly, each calcium atom (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one to each of two chlorine atoms to form $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$, which is composed of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions in the ratio of one $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion to two $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions.\n\nA compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an ionic compound. The periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic: When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the compounds typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always true (for example, aluminum chloride, $\\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}$, is not ionic).",

We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it is also an exothermic quantity.

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. (We will work exclusively in the SI system, so distances will be measured in meters $(\\mathrm{m})$ ).\nAnd as you may recall, energy is force times distance, so\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d}\n$$\n\nTo illustrate the trend in attractive force, we will consider first the attractive force between two ions of single charge separated by a distance of 2 d :",

Unit Cells of Ionic Compounds - \nWhen an ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically crystallizes with an FCC unit cell, like that shown in Figure 10.60. Sodium chloride, NaCl , is an example of this, with $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$having radii of 102 pm and 181 pm , respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions forming an FCC cell, with sodium ions located in the octahedral holes in the middle of the cell edges and in the center of the cell. The sodium and chloride ions touch each other along the cell edges. The unit cell contains four sodium ions and four chloride ions, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry required by the formula, NaCl .\n\n\nFace-centered simple cubic structure\nFIGURE 10.60 Ionic compounds with anions that are much larger than cations, such as NaCl , usually form an FCC structure. They can be described by FCC unit cells with cations in the octahedral holes.\n\nThe cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated in Figure 10.61. This structure contains sulfide ions on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. (The arrangement of sulfide ions is identical to the arrangement of chloride ions in sodium chloride.) The radius of a zinc ion is only about $40 \\%$ of the radius of a sulfide ion, so these small $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions are located in alternating tetrahedral holes, that is, in one half of the tetrahedral holes. There are four zinc ions and four sulfide ions in the unit cell, giving the empirical formula ZnS .\n\n\nZnS face-centered unit cell\nFIGURE 10.61 ZnS , zinc sulfide (or zinc blende) forms an FCC unit cell with sulfide ions at the lattice points and much smaller zinc ions occupying half of the tetrahedral holes in the structure.",

Viewed from a more active perspective, sodium functions as a reducing agent (reductant), since it provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an oxidizing agent (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes) sodium.",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom.

Answer: - \n$\\Delta H=-338 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \\mathrm{bar}=0.987 \\mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted \" o \" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\\left(\\Delta H^{\\circ}\\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)\n\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\\Delta H$, often \"normalized\" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)",

According to frontier orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene. The $2 E, 4 Z, 6 E$ isomer yields cis product; the $2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z$ isomer yields trans product (FIGURE 30.6).\n\n\nIn the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts conrotatory ring-closure. In practice, however, the conjugated diene reaction can be observed only in the reverse direction (cyclobutene $\\rightarrow$ diene) because of the position of the equilibrium. We therefore find that the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene ring opens in a conrotatory fashion. cis-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 Z$ )-2,4-hexadiene, and trans-3,4-dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 E$ )-2,4-hexadiene by conrotatory opening (FIGURE 30.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 30.7 Thermal ring-openings of cis- and trans-dimethylcyclobutene occur by conrotatory paths.",

Electronic Structures of Cations - \nWhen forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its valence electrons, thus assuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and a ground state electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 4 s^{2}$. When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with 18 electrons, a $2+$ charge, and an electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6}$. The $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion is therefore isoelectronic with the noble gas Ar.\n\nFor groups 13-17, the group numbers exceed the number of valence electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility of full $d$ subshells in atoms of elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10.

All of the principles involving energy we have examined up to now apply to bond energies exactly as they do to all other forms of energy: that is, energy may change form or be absorbed or released, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The energy of a chemical bond is indicated by the bond enthalpy, taken by convention to be the energy required to break a chemical bond. The same energy is released when a chemical bond is formed. Given that a chemical reaction involves breaking some bonds and making others, the enthalpy change for a chemical reaction can be estimated by analyzing the bonds broken and formed during the reaction. While this procedure gives an estimate of the overall enthalpy, it should be noted that a far more precise method involves using enthalpies of formation; the fact that there can be significant differences between, for example, an $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond in water and that in acetic acid accounts for the discrepancy in calculating $\\Delta H$ using bond enthalpies versus the use of enthalpies of formation.",

The trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer by $2.8 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(0.66 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$ at room temperature, corresponding to a $76: 24$ ratio.\n\n\nCis alkenes are less stable than their trans isomers because of steric strain between the two larger substituents on the same side of the double bond.

It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields.

Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

Thus, by measuring the UV spectrum of an unknown, we can derive structural information about the nature of any conjugated $\\pi$ electron system present in a molecule.\n\nOne of the most important factors affecting the wavelength of UV absorption by a molecule is the extent of conjugation. Molecular orbital calculations show that the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO decreases as the extent of conjugation increases. Thus, 1,3-butadiene absorbs at $\\lambda_{\\max }=217 \\mathrm{~nm}$, 1,3,5-hexatriene absorbs at $\\lambda_{\\max }=258 \\mathrm{~nm}$, and 1,3,5,7-octatetraene absorbs at $\\lambda_{\\max }=290 \\mathrm{~nm}$.

Answer: - \nAs for the diprotic acid examples, each successive ionization reaction is less extensive than the former, reflected in decreasing values for the stepwise acid ionization constants. This is a general characteristic of polyprotic acids and successive ionization constants often differ by a factor of about $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$.\n\nThis set of three dissociation reactions may appear to make calculations of equilibrium concentrations in a solution of $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ complicated. However, because the successive ionization constants differ by a factor of $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$, large differences exist in the small changes in concentration accompanying the ionization reactions. This allows the use of math-simplifying assumptions and processes, as demonstrated in the examples above.\n\nPolyprotic bases are capable of accepting more than one hydrogen ion. The carbonate ion is an example of a diprotic base, because it can accept two protons, as shown below. Similar to the case for polyprotic acids, note the ionization constants decrease with ionization step.

The Aufbau Principle - \nWe will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first and second periods of the periodic table. Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron ( $n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ ). The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 . The first two electrons in lithium fill the $1 s$ orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:\n\n\nAn atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4 , contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus.

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. (We will work exclusively in the SI system, so distances will be measured in meters $(\\mathrm{m})$ ).\nAnd as you may recall, energy is force times distance, so\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d}\n$$\n\nTo illustrate the trend in attractive force, we will consider first the attractive force between two ions of single charge separated by a distance of 2 d :",

For example, perchlorate is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$, chlorate is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, chlorite is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{2}{ }^{-}$and hypochlorite is $\\mathrm{ClO}^{-}$.

This will be covered in more detail later in the module on nomenclature.\n\nThe nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is the basis for classifying chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred and ions form, ionic bonds result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is, the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this case, cations and anions). When electrons are \"shared\" and molecules form, covalent bonds result. Covalent bonds are the attractive forces between the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms and one or more pairs of electrons that are located between the atoms. Compounds are classified as ionic or molecular (covalent) on the basis of the bonds present in them.",

The Formation of Ionic Compounds - \nBinary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have relatively low ionization potentials and lose electrons easily. These elements lie to the left in a period or near the bottom of a group on the periodic table. Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. Nonmetallic elements are found in the upper-right corner of the periodic table.\n\nAs all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide, $\\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$, indicates that this ionic compound contains two aluminum cations, $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$, for every three oxide anions, $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ [thus, $(2 \\times+3)+(3 \\times-2)=0$ ].\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a sodium chloride ( NaCl ) \"molecule\" because there is not a\nsingle ionic bond, per se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces between ions are isotropic-the same in all directions-meaning that any particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound, threedimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a regular arrangement of equal numbers of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$cations and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$anions (Figure 4.3).",

This is the defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: $\\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{Z}=$ number of neutrons.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { atomic number }(\\mathrm{Z}) & =\\text { number of protons } \\\\\n\\text { mass number }(\\mathrm{A}) & =\\text { number of protons+ number of neutrons } \\\\\n\\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{Z} & =\\text { number of neutrons }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAtoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.

An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an anion. Positively charged atoms called cations are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom $(Z=11)$ has 11 electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge ( $11-10=1+$ ). A neutral oxygen atom $(Z=8)$ has eight electrons, and if it gains two electrons it will become an anion with a $2-$ charge ( $8-10=2-$ ).",

LINK TO LEARNING - \nClick here (http://openstax.org/l/16JJThomson) to hear Thomson describe his discovery in his own voice.\n\nIn 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist Robert A. Millikan via his \"oil drop\" experiments. Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the charge on individual drops (Figure 2.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.7 Millikan's experiment measured the charge of individual oil drops. The tabulated data are examples of a few possible values.\n\nLooking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that the charge of an oil droplet is always a multiple of a specific charge, $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a fundamental charge-the charge of a single electron-with his measured charges due to an excess of one electron ( 1 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), two electrons ( 2 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), three electrons ( 3 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), and so on, on a given oil droplet.

Answer: - \n148.4 MeV\n\nBecause the energy changes for breaking and forming bonds are so small compared to the energy changes for breaking or forming nuclei, the changes in mass during all ordinary chemical reactions are virtually undetectable.

Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is known as the band of stability (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in Figure 20.2 represents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons ( $\\mathrm{n}: \\mathrm{p}$ ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead- 207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52. This is because larger nuclei have more proton-proton repulsions, and require larger numbers of neutrons to provide compensating strong forces to overcome these electrostatic repulsions and hold the nucleus together.",

In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively.

A cation (a positive ion) forms when a neutral atom loses one or more electrons from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral atom gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.\n\nCompounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their constituent ions are held together by ionic bonds: electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same reason-the strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid state.

Once dissolved or melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because the ions can move about freely.\n\nNeutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical properties. Sodium atoms form sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine atoms form chlorine gas, $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to most metals and very poisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline compound sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride anions (Figure 4.2). The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely different from the properties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.",

The n:p ratio increases, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide.\n\nElectron capture occurs when one of the inner electrons in an atom is captured by the atom's nucleus.

The loss of an inner shell electron leaves a vacancy that will be filled by one of the outer electrons. As the outer electron drops into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an X-ray. Like positron emission, electron capture occurs for \"proton-rich\" nuclei that lie below the band of stability. Electron capture has the same effect on the nucleus as does positron emission: The atomic number is decreased by one and the mass number does not change. This increases the n:p ratio, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Whether electron capture or positron emission occurs is difficult to predict. The choice is primarily due to kinetic factors, with the one requiring the smaller activation energy being the one more likely to occur.",

This can occur when the sample is composed of many small pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny particles of water (liquid or solid).\n\nThe mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to measure an object's mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.\n\nAlthough weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing. Weight refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronaut's mass does not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moon's gravity is only one-sixth that of the earth's. She may feel \"weightless\" during her trip when she experiences negligible external forces (gravitational or any other), although she is, of course, never \"massless.\"",

Band Theory - \nIn order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is \"easy\" to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so \"large\" that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity.

Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics.\n\nSemiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells.

Covalent Bonding\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the formation of covalent bonds\n- Define electronegativity and assess the polarity of covalent bonds\n\nIonic bonding results from the electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions that are typically produced by the transfer of electrons between metallic and nonmetallic atoms. A different type of bonding results from the mutual attraction of atoms for a \"shared\" pair of electrons. Such bonds are called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen atoms bond covalently to form an $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule; each hydrogen atom in the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas He .\n\nCompounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity in any state.",

Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics, medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer (Figure 2.15), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample's atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation's path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel ball). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a mass spectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modern atomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of applications.\n\n\nFIGURE 2.15 Analysis of zirconium in a mass spectrometer produces a mass spectrum with peaks showing the different isotopes of Zr .",

When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 5.27), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample.",

Also important, however, particularly in large biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, are a variety of interactions between molecules that strongly affect molecular properties. Collectively called either intermolecular forces, van der Waals forces, or noncovalent interactions, they are of several different types: dipole-dipole forces, dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonds.\n\nDipole-dipole forces occur between polar molecules as a result of electrostatic interactions among dipoles. The forces can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the orientation of the molecules-attractive when unlike charges are together and repulsive when like charges are together. The attractive geometry is lower in energy and therefore predominates (FIGURE 2.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.7 Dipole-dipole forces cause polar molecules (a) to attract one another when they orient with unlike charges together, but (b) to repel one another when they orient with like charges together.\n\nDispersion forces occur between all neighboring molecules and arise because the electron distribution within molecules is constantly changing. Although uniform on a time-averaged basis, the electron distribution even in nonpolar molecules is likely to be nonuniform at any given instant. One side of a molecule may, by chance, have a slight excess of electrons relative to the opposite side, giving the molecule a temporary dipole. This temporary dipole in one molecule causes a nearby molecule to adopt a temporarily opposite dipole, resulting in a tiny attraction between the two (FIGURE 2.8). Temporary molecular dipoles have only a fleeting existence and are constantly changing, but their cumulative effect is often strong enough to hold molecules close together so that a substance is a liquid or solid rather than a gas.\n\n\nFIGURE 2.8 Attractive dispersion forces in nonpolar molecules are caused by temporary dipoles, as shown in these models of pentane, $\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{H}_{12}$.",

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

Dispersion Forces - \nOne of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the London dispersion force in honor of German-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as simply the dispersion force. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron's location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species-a so-called dispersion force like that illustrated in Figure 10.6.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.6 Dispersion forces result from the formation of temporary dipoles, as illustrated here for two nonpolar diatomic molecules.\n\nDispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two molecules to each other.

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During the formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged particles called ions (Figure 3.39).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.39 (a) A sodium atom ( Na ) has equal numbers of protons and electrons (11) and is uncharged.

Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a cation with a $2+$ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a $2+$ charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

The molecules within a liquid are surrounded by other molecules and are attracted equally in all directions by the cohesive forces within the liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by about one-half as many molecules. Because of the unbalanced molecular attractions on the surface molecules, liquids contract to form a shape that minimizes the number of molecules on the surface-that is, the shape with the minimum surface area. A small drop of liquid tends to assume a spherical shape, as shown in Figure 10.16, because in a sphere, the ratio of surface area to volume is at a minimum. Larger drops are more greatly affected by gravity, air resistance, surface interactions, and so on, and as a result, are less spherical.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.16 Attractive forces result in a spherical water drop that minimizes surface area; cohesive forces hold the sphere together; adhesive forces keep the drop attached to the web.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Figure 5.2 illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 5.2.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm , which is the bond length observed for the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule.\n\nIn addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for two $s$ orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 5.3 illustrates this for two $p$ orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

Consequently, the partial negative charge on F is greater than that on O . The hydrogen bond between the partially positive H and the larger partially negative F will be stronger than that formed between H and O .\n10.

Graphene is a single layer of graphite (one atom thick), as illustrated in Figure 18.23, whereas carbon nanotubes roll the layer into a small tube, as illustrated in Figure 18.23.\n\n\nFIGURE 18.23 (a) Graphene and (b) carbon nanotubes are both allotropes of carbon.\nGraphene is a very strong, lightweight, and efficient conductor of heat and electricity discovered in 2003. As in graphite, the carbon atoms form a layer of six-membered rings with $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms at the corners. Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no stacking of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the University of Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing graphene.\n\nThe simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer of graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak London dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.\n\nThere currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high electron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced electronic devices and for thermal management applications.\n\nCarbon nanotubes are carbon allotropes, which have a cylindrical structure. Like graphite and graphene, nanotubes consist of rings of $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Unlike graphite and graphene, which occur in layers, the layers wrap into a tube and bond together to produce a stable structure. The walls of the tube may be one atom or multiple atoms thick.\n\nCarbon nanotubes are extremely strong materials that are harder than diamond. Depending upon the shape of the nanotube, it may be a conductor or semiconductor. For some applications, the conducting form is preferable, whereas other applications utilize the semiconducting form.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Entropy and Microstates - \nFollowing the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates ( $W$ ) possible for the system. A microstate is a specific configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The relation between a system's entropy and the number of possible microstates is\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nAs for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final ( $S_{\\mathrm{f}}$ ) and initial $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ values:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=S_{\\mathrm{f}}-S_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{f}}-k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\n\nFor processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the entropy of the system increases and $\\Delta S>0$. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}<W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, yield a decrease in system entropy, $\\Delta S<0$. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.\n\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of $N$ particles distributed among $n$ boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is $n^{N}$. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in $2^{4}=16$ different microstates as illustrated in Figure 12.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)",

However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant.\n\nIt should be noted that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nHeisenberg's principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science. The uncertainty principle can\nbe shown to be a consequence of wave-particle duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory from classical mechanics.",

One way we measure a change in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. The liquid in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature changes, and the position of the trapped liquid's surface along a printed scale may be used as a measure of temperature.\n\nTemperature scales are defined relative to selected reference temperatures: Two of the most commonly used are the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 ${ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is defined as the freezing temperature of water and $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is defined as $32^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ and the boiling temperature as $212^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$. The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).\n\nDefining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another ( $\\mathrm{y}=\\mathrm{mx}$ ). Using familiar length units as one example:\n\n$$\n\\text { length in feet }=\\left(\\frac{1 \\mathrm{ft}}{12 \\mathrm{in} .}\\right) \\times \\text { length in inches }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{y}=$ length in feet, $\\mathrm{x}=$ length in inches, and the proportionality constant, m , is the conversion factor. The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, however, do not share a common zero point, and so the relationship between these two scales is a linear one rather than a proportional one ( $y=m x+b$ ). Consequently, converting a temperature from one of these scales into the other requires more than simple multiplication by a conversion factor, $m$, it also must take into account differences in the scales' zero points (b).",

Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation - \nThe minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the activation energy $\\left(\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$. How this energy compares to the kinetic energy provided by colliding reactant molecules is a primary factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. If the activation energy is much larger than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, the reaction will occur slowly since only a few fast-moving molecules will have enough energy to react. If the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, a large fraction of molecules will be adequately energetic and the reaction will proceed rapidly.\n\nFigure 17.14 shows how the energy of a chemical system changes as it undergoes a reaction converting reactants to products according to the equation\n\n$$\nA+B \\longrightarrow C+D\n$$\n\nThese reaction diagrams are widely used in chemical kinetics to illustrate various properties of the reaction of interest. Viewing the diagram from left to right, the system initially comprises reactants only, $A+B$. Reactant molecules with sufficient energy can collide to form a high-energy activated complex or transition state. The unstable transition state can then subsequently decay to yield stable products, $C+D$. The diagram depicts the reaction's activation energy, $E_{a}$, as the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state. Using a specific energy, the enthalpy (see chapter on thermochemistry), the enthalpy change of the reaction, $\\Delta H$, is estimated as the energy difference between the reactants and products. In this case, the reaction is exothermic $(\\Delta H<0)$ since it yields a decrease in system enthalpy.\n\n\nFIGURE 17.14 Reaction diagram for the exothermic reaction $A+B \\longrightarrow C+D$.\nThe Arrhenius equation relates the activation energy and the rate constant, $k$, for many chemical reactions:\n\n$$\nk=A e^{-E_{\\mathrm{a}} / R T}\n$$",

The frequency factor, $A$, reflects how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An increased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for $A$ and faster reaction rates.\nThe exponential term, $e^{-E a / R T}$, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample of matter at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in Figure 17.15(a). Two shaded areas under the curve represent the numbers of molecules possessing adequate energy $(R T)$ to overcome the activation barriers $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$. A lower activation energy results in a greater fraction of adequately energized molecules and a faster reaction.\n\nThe exponential term also describes the effect of temperature on reaction rate. A higher temperature represents a correspondingly greater fraction of molecules possessing sufficient energy ( $R T$ ) to overcome the activation barrier $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$, as shown in Figure $17.15(\\mathbf{b})$.

Entropy and Microstates - \nThe previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (Figure 12.4) is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. Initially, the gas molecules are confined to just one of the two flasks. Opening the valve between the flasks increases the volume available to the gas molecules and, correspondingly, the number of microstates possible for the system. Since $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the expansion process involves an increase in entropy $(\\Delta S>0)$ and is spontaneous.\n\nA similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two objects, each containing two particles, and two units of thermal energy (represented as \"*\") in Figure 12.9. The hot object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution (a), is $\\frac{3}{10}$. More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being $\\frac{7}{10}$. The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), the probability of this configuration being $\\frac{4}{10}$. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects' temperatures. And, again, this spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

The probability of finding the system in this configuration is $\\frac{6}{16}$ or $\\frac{3}{8}$.

By this description, microstates in which all the particles are in a single box are the most ordered, thus possessing the least entropy.

Entropy and Microstates - \nFollowing the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates ( $W$ ) possible for the system. A microstate is a specific configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The relation between a system's entropy and the number of possible microstates is\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nAs for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final ( $S_{\\mathrm{f}}$ ) and initial $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ values:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=S_{\\mathrm{f}}-S_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{f}}-k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\n\nFor processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the entropy of the system increases and $\\Delta S>0$. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}<W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, yield a decrease in system entropy, $\\Delta S<0$. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.\n\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of $N$ particles distributed among $n$ boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is $n^{N}$. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in $2^{4}=16$ different microstates as illustrated in Figure 12.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)",

One way we measure a change in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. The liquid in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature changes, and the position of the trapped liquid's surface along a printed scale may be used as a measure of temperature.\n\nTemperature scales are defined relative to selected reference temperatures: Two of the most commonly used are the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 ${ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is defined as the freezing temperature of water and $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is defined as $32^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ and the boiling temperature as $212^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$. The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).\n\nDefining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another ( $\\mathrm{y}=\\mathrm{mx}$ ). Using familiar length units as one example:\n\n$$\n\\text { length in feet }=\\left(\\frac{1 \\mathrm{ft}}{12 \\mathrm{in} .}\\right) \\times \\text { length in inches }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{y}=$ length in feet, $\\mathrm{x}=$ length in inches, and the proportionality constant, m , is the conversion factor. The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, however, do not share a common zero point, and so the relationship between these two scales is a linear one rather than a proportional one ( $y=m x+b$ ). Consequently, converting a temperature from one of these scales into the other requires more than simple multiplication by a conversion factor, $m$, it also must take into account differences in the scales' zero points (b).",

Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation - \nThe minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the activation energy $\\left(\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$. How this energy compares to the kinetic energy provided by colliding reactant molecules is a primary factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. If the activation energy is much larger than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, the reaction will occur slowly since only a few fast-moving molecules will have enough energy to react. If the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, a large fraction of molecules will be adequately energetic and the reaction will proceed rapidly.\n\nFigure 17.14 shows how the energy of a chemical system changes as it undergoes a reaction converting reactants to products according to the equation\n\n$$\nA+B \\longrightarrow C+D\n$$\n\nThese reaction diagrams are widely used in chemical kinetics to illustrate various properties of the reaction of interest. Viewing the diagram from left to right, the system initially comprises reactants only, $A+B$.

The unstable transition state can then subsequently decay to yield stable products, $C+D$.

Using a specific energy, the enthalpy (see chapter on thermochemistry), the enthalpy change of the reaction, $\\Delta H$, is estimated as the energy difference between the reactants and products.

In addition to these three generally useful methods, there is a fourth-ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy-that is applicable only to conjugated compounds. UV is less commonly used than the other three spectroscopic techniques because of the specialized information it gives, so we'll only discuss it briefly.\n\n| Mass spectrometry | Molecular size and formula |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| IR spectroscopy | Functional groups present |\n| NMR spectroscopy | Carbon-hydrogen framework |\n| UV spectroscopy | Conjugated $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ electron systems |\n\nThe ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum extends from the short-wavelength end of the visible region $\\left(4 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to the long-wavelength end of the X-ray region $\\left(10^{-8} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$, but the narrow range from $2 \\times$ $10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $4 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ is the part of greatest interest to organic chemists.

With IR irradiation, the energy absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to increase molecular vibrations. With UV radiation, the energy absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to promote an electron from a lower-energy orbital to a higherenergy one in a conjugated molecule. The conjugated diene 1,3-butadiene, for instance, has four $\\pi$ molecular orbitals, as shown previously in FIGURE 14.3.

Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation - \n$$\nk=A e^{-E_{\\mathrm{a}} / R T}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, which has a value $8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol} / \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{T}$ is temperature on the Kelvin scale, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the activation energy in joules per mole, $e$ is the constant 2.7183 , and $A$ is a constant called the frequency factor, which is related to the frequency of collisions and the orientation of the reacting molecules.\n\nPostulates of collision theory are nicely accommodated by the Arrhenius equation. The frequency factor, $A$, reflects how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An increased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for $A$ and faster reaction rates.\nThe exponential term, $e^{-E a / R T}$, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample of matter at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in Figure 17.15(a). Two shaded areas under the curve represent the numbers of molecules possessing adequate energy $(R T)$ to overcome the activation barriers $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$. A lower activation energy results in a greater fraction of adequately energized molecules and a faster reaction.\n\nThe exponential term also describes the effect of temperature on reaction rate. A higher temperature represents a correspondingly greater fraction of molecules possessing sufficient energy ( $R T$ ) to overcome the activation barrier $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$, as shown in Figure $17.15(\\mathbf{b})$. This yields a greater value for the rate constant and a correspondingly faster reaction rate.\n\n\nFIGURE 17.15 Molecular energy distributions showing numbers of molecules with energies exceeding (a) two different activation energies at a given temperature, and (b) a given activation energy at two different temperatures.\n\nA convenient approach for determining $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ for a reaction involves the measurement of $k$ at two or more different temperatures and using an alternate version of the Arrhenius equation that takes the form of a linear equation",

Entropy and Microstates - \nThe previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (Figure 12.4) is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. Initially, the gas molecules are confined to just one of the two flasks. Opening the valve between the flasks increases the volume available to the gas molecules and, correspondingly, the number of microstates possible for the system. Since $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the expansion process involves an increase in entropy $(\\Delta S>0)$ and is spontaneous.\n\nA similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two objects, each containing two particles, and two units of thermal energy (represented as \"*\") in Figure 12.9. The hot object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution (a), is $\\frac{3}{10}$. More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being $\\frac{7}{10}$. The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), the probability of this configuration being $\\frac{4}{10}$. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects' temperatures. And, again, this spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.",

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second $\\left[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right]$, is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, $\\left(1 \\mathrm{MHz}=1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$ and gigahertz $\\left(1 \\mathrm{GHz}=1 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$. The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 3.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed.

This C3 proton signal appears as a doublet centered at $7.49 \\delta$. Because it has one neighbor proton at C 2 , its signal is split into a doublet, with $J=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.\n- The C2 vinylic proton signal (blue) appears at $6.73 \\delta$ and shows an interesting, four-line absorption pattern. It is coupled to the two nonequivalent protons at C 1 and C 3 with two different coupling constants: $J_{1-2}=6$ Hz and $J_{2-3}=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.\n\nA good way to understand the effect of multiple coupling, such as that occurring for the C2 proton of trans-cinnamaldehyde, is to draw a tree diagram, like that in FIGURE 13.15. The diagram shows the individual effect of each coupling constant on the overall pattern. Coupling with the C3 proton splits the signal of the C2 proton in trans-cinnamaldehyde into a doublet with $J=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.

The two left-hand peaks are somewhat larger than the two right-hand peaks. Such a size difference occurs whenever coupled nuclei have similar chemical shifts-in this case, $7.49 \\delta$ for the C3 proton and $6.73 \\delta$ for the C 2 proton. The peaks nearer the signal of the coupled partner are always larger, and the peaks farther from the signal of the coupled partner are always smaller. Thus, the left-hand peaks of the C2 proton multiplet at $6.73 \\delta$ are closer to the C3 proton absorption at $7.49 \\delta$ and are larger than the right-hand peaks. At the same time, the right-hand peak of the C3 proton doublet at $7.49 \\delta$ is larger than the left-hand peak because it is closer to the C 2 proton multiplet at $6.73 \\delta$.

The chemical shift of TMS is set as the zero point, and other absorptions normally occur downfield, to the left on the chart. NMR charts are calibrated using an arbitrary scale called the delta ( $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ ) scale, where $1 \\delta$ equals 1 part-per-million ( 1 ppm ) of the spectrometer operating frequency. For example, if we were measuring the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum of a sample using an instrument operating at $200 \\mathrm{MHz}, 1 \\delta$ would be 1 part per million of $200,000,000 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, or 200 Hz . If we were measuring the spectrum using a 500 MHz instrument, $1 \\delta=500 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. The following equation can be used for any absorption:\n\n$$\n\\delta=\\frac{\\text { Observed chemical shift (number of Hz away from TMS) }}{\\text { Spectrometer frequency in } \\mathrm{MHz}}\n$$\n\nAlthough this method of calibrating NMR charts may seem complex, there's a good reason for it. As we saw earlier, the rf frequency required to bring a given nucleus into resonance depends on the spectrometer's magnetic field strength. But because there are many different kinds of spectrometers with many different magnetic field strengths available, chemical shifts given in frequency units ( Hz ) vary from one instrument to another. Thus, a resonance that occurs at 120 Hz downfield from TMS on one spectrometer might occur at 600 Hz downfield from TMS on another spectrometer with a more powerful magnet.\n\nBy using a system of measurement in which NMR absorptions are expressed in relative terms (parts per million relative to spectrometer frequency) rather than absolute terms (Hz), it's possible to compare spectra obtained\non different instruments. The chemical shift of an NMR absorption in $\\delta$ units is constant, regardless of the operating frequency of the spectrometer. A ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus that absorbs at $2.0 \\delta$ on a 200 MHz instrument also absorbs at $2.0 \\delta$ on a 500 MHz instrument.",

Coupling constants are measured in hertz and generally fall in the range 0 to 18 Hz . The exact value of the coupling constant between two neighboring protons depends on the geometry of the molecule, but a typical value for an openchain alkane is $J=6$ to 8 Hz . The same coupling constant is shared by both groups of hydrogens whose spins are coupled and is independent of spectrometer field strength. In bromoethane, for instance, the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{Br}$ protons\nare coupled to the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons and appear as a quartet with $J=7 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. The $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons appear as a triplet with the same $J=7 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ coupling constant.\n\nBecause coupling is a reciprocal interaction between two adjacent groups of protons, it's sometimes possible to tell which multiplets in a complex NMR spectrum are related to each other. If two multiplets have the same coupling constant, they are probably related, and the protons causing those multiplets are therefore adjacent in the molecule.\n\nThe most commonly observed coupling patterns and the relative intensities of lines in their multiplets are listed in TABLE 13.4. Note that it's not possible for a given proton to have five equivalent neighboring protons. (Why not?) A six-line multiplet, or sextet, is therefore found only when a proton has five nonequivalent neighboring protons that coincidentally happen to be coupled with an identical coupling constant $J$.\n\nTABLE 13.4 Some Common Spin Multiplicities",

                    "contents": "Summary - \nFinding the structure of a new molecule, whether a small one synthesized in the laboratory or a large protein found in living organisms, is central to the progression of chemistry and biochemistry. The structure of an organic molecule is usually determined using spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry (MS) tells the molecular weight and formula of a molecule; infrared (IR) spectroscopy identifies the functional groups present in the molecule.\n\nIn small-molecule mass spectrometry, molecules are first ionized by collision with a high-energy electron beam. The ions then fragment into smaller pieces, which are magnetically sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. The ionized sample molecule is called the molecular ion, $M^{+}$, and measurement of its mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by interpreting the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion. Mass-spectral fragmentations are usually complex, however, and interpretation is often difficult. In biological mass spectrometry, molecules are protonated using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the protonated molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy involves the interaction of a molecule with electromagnetic radiation. When an organic molecule is irradiated with infrared energy, certain frequencies are absorbed by the molecule. The frequencies absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular vibrations such as bond stretching and bending. Since every functional group has a characteristic combination of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal alkyne $\\equiv \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond absorbs IR radiation of $3300 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and the alkene $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ bond absorbs in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. By observing which frequencies of infrared radiation are absorbed by a molecule and which are not, it's possible to determine the functional groups a molecule contains.",

Not all organic substances exhibit this property, but those that do are said to be optically active.\n\nThe angle of rotation can be measured with an instrument called a polarimeter, represented in FIGURE 5.6. A solution of optically active organic molecules is placed in a sample tube, plane-polarized light is passed through the tube, and rotation of the polarization plane occurs. The light then goes through a second polarizer called the analyzer. By rotating the analyzer until the light passes through it, we can find the new plane of polarization and can tell to what extent rotation has occurred.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.6 Schematic representation of a polarimeter. Plane-polarized light passes through a solution of optically active molecules, which rotate the plane of polarization.\n\nIn addition to determining the extent of rotation, we can also find the direction. From the vantage point of the observer looking directly at the analyzer, some optically active molecules rotate polarized light to the left (counterclockwise) and are said to be levorotatory, whereas others rotate polarized light to the right (clockwise) and are said to be dextrorotatory. By convention, rotation to the left is given a minus sign (-) and rotation to the right is given a plus sign (+). (-)-Morphine, for example, is levorotatory, and (+)-sucrose is dextrorotatory.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

The others are the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force, and the nuclear weak force.) This force acts between protons, between neutrons, and between protons and neutrons. It is very different from the electrostatic force that holds negatively charged electrons around a positively charged nucleus (the attraction between opposite charges).

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 3.30.\n\nCovalent Radii of the Halogen Group Elements\n\n| Atom | Covalent radius (pm) | Nuclear charge |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| F | 64 | +9 |\n| Cl | 99 | +17 |\n| Br | 114 | +35 |\n| I | 133 | +53 |\n| At | 148 | +85 |\n\nTABLE 3.2\n\n\nFIGURE 3.30 (a) The radius of an atom is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei in a molecule consisting of two identical atoms joined by a covalent bond.

The nucleus consists of subatomic particles called neutrons, which are electrically neutral, and protons, which are positively charged. Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a distance of approximately $10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, the diameter of a typical atom is about $2 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$, or 200 picometers (pm), where $1 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$. To give you an idea of how small this is, a thin pencil line is about 3 million carbon atoms wide. Although most chemists throughout the world use the International System (SI) of units and describe small distances in picometers, many organic chemists and biochemists in the United States still use the unit angstrom ( $\\AA$ ) to express atomic distances, where $1 \\AA=100 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4.

Covalent radius increases as we move down a group because the $n$ level (orbital size) increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across a period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons increases, and the electrons are pulled in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained constant. Ionization energy (the energy associated with forming a cation) decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it is easier to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity (the energy associated with forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic) when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the nucleus. Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to right across the periodic table and decreases as we move down a group. For both IE and electron affinity data, there are exceptions to the trends when dealing with completely filled or half-filled subshells.",

The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Figure 3.34. Within a period, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ generally increases with increasing $Z$. Down a group, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ value generally decreases with increasing $Z$. There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as $l$ increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the $s$ electrons are lower in energy than the $p$ electrons. This means that an $s$ electron is harder to remove from an atom than a $p$ electron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2}$ ) is an $s$ electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}$ ) is a $p$ electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton.

Because they're positively charged, these spinning nuclei act like tiny magnets and can interact with an external magnetic field, denoted $\\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$. Not all nuclei act this way, but fortunately for organic chemists, both the proton $\\left({ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$ and the ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus do have spins. The more common ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ isotope, however, does not have nuclear spin. (In speaking about NMR, the words proton and hydrogen are often used interchangeably, since a hydrogen nucleus is just a proton.) Let's see what the consequences of nuclear spin are and how we can use the results.\n\nIn the absence of an external magnetic field, the spins of magnetic nuclei are oriented randomly. When a sample containing these nuclei is placed between the poles of a strong magnet, however, the nuclei adopt specific orientations, much as a compass needle orients in the earth's magnetic field. A spinning ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus can orient so that its own tiny magnetic field is aligned either with (parallel to) or against (antiparallel to) the external field. The two orientations don't have the same energy, however, and aren't equally likely. The parallel orientation is slightly lower in energy by an amount that depends on the strength of the external field, making this spin state very slightly favored over the antiparallel orientation (FIGURE 13.2).\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\nFIGURE 13.2 (a) Nuclear spins are oriented randomly in the absence of an external magnetic field but (b) have a specific orientation in the presence of an external field, $\\boldsymbol{B}_{\\mathbf{0}}$.

Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure - \nFIGURE 3.24 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale).\n\nElectrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the $5 p$ orbitals fill immediately after the $4 d$, and immediately before the $6 s$. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, $n$, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of 1 increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order $s>p>d>f$. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron-nucleus attractions slightly (recall\nthat all electrons have -1 charges, but nuclei have $+Z$ charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals ( $1 s$ through $3 p$ ), the increase in energy due to $n$ is more significant than the increase due to $l$; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.\n\nThe arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom. We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information (Figure 3.25):\n\n1. The number of the principal quantum shell, $n$,\n2. The letter that designates the orbital type (the subshell, $I$ ), and\n3. A superscript number that designates the number of electrons in that particular subshell.",

The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements.

Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a cation with a $2+$ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a $2+$ charge.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the mass number (A). Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same element. When referring to a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the notation ${ }_{Z}^{A} \\mathrm{X}$, where X is the symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for example, ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ ).

The stable nuclides are indicated in blue, and the unstable nuclides are indicated in green. Note that all isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 83 are unstable. The solid line is the line where $\\mathrm{n}=\\mathrm{Z}$.\n\nThe nuclei that are to the left or to the right of the band of stability are unstable and exhibit radioactivity. They change spontaneously (decay) into other nuclei that are either in, or closer to, the band of stability. These nuclear decay reactions convert one unstable isotope (or radioisotope) into another, more stable, isotope. We will discuss the nature and products of this radioactive decay in subsequent sections of this chapter.\n\nSeveral observations may be made regarding the relationship between the stability of a nucleus and its structure. Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable (see Table 20.1). Nuclei with certain numbers of nucleons, known as magic numbers, are stable against nuclear decay. These numbers of protons or neutrons $(2,8,20,28,50,82$, and 126 ) make complete shells in the nucleus. These are similar in concept to the stable electron shells observed for the noble gases. Nuclei that have magic numbers of\nboth protons and neutrons, such as ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He},{ }_{8}^{16} \\mathrm{O},{ }_{20}^{40} \\mathrm{Ca}$, and ${ }_{82}^{208} \\mathrm{~Pb}$, are called \"double magic\" and are particularly stable. These trends in nuclear stability may be rationalized by considering a quantum mechanical model of nuclear energy states analogous to that used to describe electronic states earlier in this textbook. The details of this model are beyond the scope of this chapter.\n\nStable Nuclear Isotopes\n\n| Number of Stable Isotopes | Proton Number | Neutron Number |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 157 | even | even |\n| 53 | even | odd |\n| 50 | odd | even |\n| 5 | odd | odd |\n\nTABLE 20.1",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

According to frontier orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene. The $2 E, 4 Z, 6 E$ isomer yields cis product; the $2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z$ isomer yields trans product (FIGURE 30.6).\n\n\nIn the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts conrotatory ring-closure. In practice, however, the conjugated diene reaction can be observed only in the reverse direction (cyclobutene $\\rightarrow$ diene) because of the position of the equilibrium. We therefore find that the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene ring opens in a conrotatory fashion. cis-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 Z$ )-2,4-hexadiene, and trans-3,4-dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 E$ )-2,4-hexadiene by conrotatory opening (FIGURE 30.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 30.7 Thermal ring-openings of cis- and trans-dimethylcyclobutene occur by conrotatory paths.",

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long. In addition, the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum shows a single sharp resonance line at $5.78 \\mathrm{\\delta}$, a value characteristic of an alkene rather than an aromatic molecule.\n\nWhat's so special about $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons? Why do $2,6,10,14 \\pi$ electrons lead to aromatic stability, while other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$. Any other number would leave an energy level partially filled.\n\nThe six $\\pi$ molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are shown again in FIGURE 15.6.

The Aufbau Principle - \nWe will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first and second periods of the periodic table. Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron ( $n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ ). The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 . The first two electrons in lithium fill the $1 s$ orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:\n\n\nAn atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4 , contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus.

Iron occurs everywhere-from the rings in your spiral notebook and the cutlery in your kitchen to automobiles, ships, buildings, and in the hemoglobin in your blood. Titanium is useful in the manufacture of lightweight, durable products such as bicycle frames, artificial hips, and jewelry. Chromium is useful as a protective plating on plumbing fixtures and automotive detailing.\n\nIn addition to being used in their pure elemental forms, many compounds containing transition metals have numerous other applications. Silver nitrate is used to create mirrors, zirconium silicate provides friction in automotive brakes, and many important cancer-fighting agents, like the drug cisplatin and related species, are platinum compounds.\n\nThe variety of properties exhibited by transition metals is due to their complex valence shells. Unlike most main group metals where one oxidation state is normally observed, the valence shell structure of transition metals means that they usually occur in several different stable oxidation states. In addition, electron transitions in these elements can correspond with absorption of photons in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, leading to colored compounds. Because of these behaviors, transition metals exhibit a rich and fascinating chemistry.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Each atom forms four single bonds to four other atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron ( $s p^{3}$ hybridization); this makes the diamond a giant molecule.

Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

Properties of the Transition Elements - \nFIGURE 19.4 Transition metals of the first transition series can form compounds with varying oxidation states.\nFor the elements scandium through manganese (the first half of the first transition series), the highest oxidation state corresponds to the loss of all of the electrons in both the $s$ and $d$ orbitals of their valence shells. The titanium(IV) ion, for example, is formed when the titanium atom loses its two $3 d$ and two $4 s$ electrons. These highest oxidation states are the most stable forms of scandium, titanium, and vanadium. However, it is not possible to continue to remove all of the valence electrons from metals as we continue through the series. Iron is known to form oxidation states from $2+$ to $6+$, with iron(II) and iron(III) being the most common. Most of the elements of the first transition series form ions with a charge of $2+$ or $3+$ that are stable in water, although those of the early members of the series can be readily oxidized by air.\n\nThe elements of the second and third transition series generally are more stable in higher oxidation states than are the elements of the first series. In general, the atomic radius increases down a group, which leads to the ions of the second and third series being larger than are those in the first series. Removing electrons from orbitals that are located farther from the nucleus is easier than removing electrons close to the nucleus. For example, molybdenum and tungsten, members of group 6, are limited mostly to an oxidation state of 6+ in aqueous solution. Chromium, the lightest member of the group, forms stable $\\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ ions in water and, in the absence of air, less stable $\\mathrm{Cr}^{2+}$ ions. The sulfide with the highest oxidation state for chromium is $\\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$, which contains the $\\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ ion.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (Figure 4.27), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O , and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).\n\n\nFIGURE 4.27 The overall dipole moment of a molecule depends on the individual bond dipole moments and how they are arranged.

It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.",

To make sure they accurately represent bond angles, bond lengths, torsional interactions, and steric interactions, the most stable geometry of each molecule has been calculated on a desktop computer using a commercially available molecular mechanics program based on work by Norman Allinger at the University of Georgia.\n\nThe idea behind molecular mechanics is to begin with a rough geometry for a molecule and then calculate a total strain energy for that starting geometry, using mathematical equations that assign values to specific kinds of molecular interactions. Bond angles that are too large or too small cause angle strain; bond lengths that are too short or too long cause stretching or compressing strain; unfavorable eclipsing interactions around single bonds cause torsional strain; and nonbonded atoms that approach each other too closely cause steric, or van der Waals, strain.\n\n$$\nE_{\\text {total }}=E_{\\mathrm{bond} \\text { stretching }}+E_{\\text {angle strain }}+E_{\\text {torsional strain }}+E_{\\text {van der Waals }}\n$$\n\n\n\nFIGURE 4.19 Computer programs make it possible to accurately represent molecular geometry.

Strain is recalculated for the new geometry, more changes are made, and more calculations are done. After dozens or hundreds of iterations, the calculation ultimately converges on a minimum energy that corresponds to the most favorable, least strained conformation of the molecule.\n\nSimilar calculations have proven to be particularly useful in pharmaceutical research, where a complementary fit between a drug molecule and a receptor molecule in the body is often the key to designing new pharmaceutical agents (FIGURE 4.20).\n\n\nFIGURE 4.20 The structure of Tamiflu (oseltamivir), an antiviral agent active against type A influenza, along with a molecular model of its minimum-energy conformation as calculated by molecular mechanics.",

Water ( $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, molecular mass 18 amu ) is a liquid, even though it has a lower molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between the two compounds to dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion forces. Additionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded ( 4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or 3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively small sizes of $\\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{O}$, or N atoms, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these atoms.

Electron-pair Geometry versus Molecular Structure - \nIt is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is not the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries shown in Figure 4.16 describe all regions where electrons are located, bonds as well as lone pairs. Molecular structure describes the location of the atoms, not the electrons.\n\nWe differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that includes all electron pairs the electron-pair geometry. The structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is called the molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on the central atom.\n\nFor example, the methane molecule, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, which is the major component of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure (Figure 4.17). On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, also has four electron pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape of the molecule (Figure 4.18).\n\n\nFIGURE 4.17 The molecular structure of the methane molecule, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, is shown with a tetrahedral arrangement of the hydrogen atoms.

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

The shape of the hybrid orbital suggests the answer to why. When an $s$ orbital hybridizes with three $p$ orbitals, the resultant $s p^{3}$ hybrid orbitals are unsymmetrical about the nucleus. One of the two lobes is larger than the other and can therefore overlap more effectively with an orbital from another atom to form a bond. As a result,\n$s p^{3}$ hybrid orbitals form stronger bonds than do unhybridized $s$ or $p$ orbitals.\nThe asymmetry of $s p^{3}$ orbitals arises because, as noted previously, the two lobes of a $p$ orbital have different algebraic signs, + and - in the wave function. Thus, when a $p$ orbital hybridizes with an $s$ orbital, the positive $p$ lobe adds to the $s$ orbital but the negative $p$ lobe subtracts from the $s$ orbital. The resultant hybrid orbital is therefore unsymmetrical about the nucleus and is strongly oriented in one direction.\n\nWhen each of the four identical $s p^{3}$ hybrid orbitals of a carbon atom overlaps with the $1 s$ orbital of a hydrogen atom, four identical $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are formed and methane results.

Because we are considering very small charges and distances, and because it is the relative separation of charge rather than the actual value for it that we are interested in, we will introduce a new unit called the Debye, named after the physical chemist Peter Debye:\n\n$$\n1 \\text { Debye }(\\mathrm{D})=3.336 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{m} \\quad \\mu=Q \\times d\n$$\n\nThe usefulness of the Debye unit will be shown by example:\nFor HCl , the bond dipole moment is known to be 1.08 D\nFor HI, the bond dipole moment is known to be 0.44 D\nComparing the two, we can see that HI is less polar than HCl , which is what we would expect based on electronegativity values.\n\nWe have now made a transition between the concept of an ionic compound and a partially ionic one. Of course, the partially ionic compound must also by definition be partially covalent.",

Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment - \nAs discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge ( $\\delta^{+}$) and the other atom with a partial negative charge ( $\\delta^{-}$), as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole moment. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu( $\\mu$ ) and is given by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and $r$ is the distance between the charges:\n\n$$\n\\mu=\\mathrm{Qr}\n$$\n\nThis bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and magnitude (Figure 4.26). Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference between the two atoms.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 4.26 (a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between C and H , represented as a short vector.

If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.",

Measuring Nutritional Calories - \nIn your day-to-day life, you may be more familiar with energy being given in Calories, or nutritional calories, which are used to quantify the amount of energy in foods. One calorie (cal) = exactly 4.184 joules, and one Calorie (note the capitalization) $=1000 \\mathrm{cal}$, or 1 kcal . (This is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.)\n\nThe macronutrients in food are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats or oils. Proteins provide about 4 Calories per gram, carbohydrates also provide about 4 Calories per gram, and fats and oils provide about 9 Calories/ g. Nutritional labels on food packages show the caloric content of one serving of the food, as well as the breakdown into Calories from each of the three macronutrients (Figure 9.18).\n\n[^7]\n\nFIGURE 9.18 (a) Macaroni and cheese contain energy in the form of the macronutrients in the food. (b) The food's nutritional information is shown on the package label. In the US, the energy content is given in Calories (per serving); the rest of the world usually uses kilojoules. (credit a: modification of work by \"Rex Roof\"/Flickr)\n\nFor the example shown in (b), the total energy per 228-g portion is calculated by:\n$(5 \\mathrm{~g}$ protein $\\times 4$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})+(31 \\mathrm{~g}$ carb $\\times 4$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})+(12 \\mathrm{~g}$ fat $\\times 9$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})=252$ Calories\nSo, you can use food labels to count your Calories. But where do the values come from? And how accurate are they? The caloric content of foods can be determined by using bomb calorimetry; that is, by burning the food and measuring the energy it contains. A sample of food is weighed, mixed in a blender, freezedried, ground into powder, and formed into a pellet. The pellet is burned inside a bomb calorimeter, and the measured temperature change is converted into energy per gram of food.",

Dispersion Forces - \nOne of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the London dispersion force in honor of German-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as simply the dispersion force. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron's location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species-a so-called dispersion force like that illustrated in Figure 10.6.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.6 Dispersion forces result from the formation of temporary dipoles, as illustrated here for two nonpolar diatomic molecules.\n\nDispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two molecules to each other. The forces are relatively weak, however, and become significant only when the molecules are very close.\n\nLarger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit stronger dispersion forces than do smaller and lighter atoms and molecules. $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ are gases at room temperature (reflecting weaker attractive forces); $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ is a liquid, and $\\mathrm{I}_{2}$ is a solid (reflecting stronger attractive forces).

Using the concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at \"time zero,\" when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle's initial rate-analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction-would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes ( $t_{0}$ ). A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment-call it $t_{1}$-would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car's average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop ( $\\Delta t$ ). Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. In a plot of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at any time $t$ is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time (Figure 17.3). These tangent line slopes may be evaluated using calculus, but the procedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter.",

In contrast to open-chain alkanes, where nearly free rotation occurs around $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ bonds, rotation is greatly reduced in cycloalkanes. Disubstituted cycloalkanes can therefore exist as cis-trans isomers. The cis isomer has both substituents on the same side of the ring; the trans isomer has substituents on opposite sides. Cis-trans isomers are just one kind of stereoisomer-compounds that have the same connections between atoms but different threedimensional arrangements.\n\nNot all cycloalkanes are equally stable. Three kinds of strain contribute to the overall energy of a cycloalkane: (1) angle strain is the resistance of a bond angle to compression or expansion from the normal $109^{\\circ}$ tetrahedral value, (2) torsional strain is the energy cost of having neighboring $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds eclipsed rather than staggered, and (3) steric strain is the repulsive interaction that arises when two groups attempt to occupy the same space.\n\nCyclopropane ( $115 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ strain) and cyclobutane ( $110.4 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ strain) have both angle strain and torsional strain.

According to frontier orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene. The $2 E, 4 Z, 6 E$ isomer yields cis product; the $2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z$ isomer yields trans product (FIGURE 30.6).\n\n\nIn the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts conrotatory ring-closure. In practice, however, the conjugated diene reaction can be observed only in the reverse direction (cyclobutene $\\rightarrow$ diene) because of the position of the equilibrium. We therefore find that the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene ring opens in a conrotatory fashion. cis-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 Z$ )-2,4-hexadiene, and trans-3,4-dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 E$ )-2,4-hexadiene by conrotatory opening (FIGURE 30.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 30.7 Thermal ring-openings of cis- and trans-dimethylcyclobutene occur by conrotatory paths.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The mathematical expression known as the wave function, $\\psi$, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 5.7).

Having now seen the valence bond approach, which uses hybrid atomic orbitals to account for geometry and assumes the overlap of atomic orbitals to account for electron sharing, let's look briefly at the molecular orbital approach to bonding. We'll return to this topic in Chapters 14, 15, and 30 for a more in-depth discussion.\n\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes covalent bond formation as arising from a mathematical combination of atomic orbitals (wave functions) on different atoms to form molecular orbitals, so called because they belong to the entire molecule rather than to an individual atom. Just as an atomic orbital, whether unhybridized or hybridized, describes a region of space around an atom where an electron is likely to be found, so a molecular orbital describes a region of space in a molecule where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nLike an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a specific size, shape, and energy. In the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule, for example, two singly occupied $1 s$ atomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals. There are two ways for the orbital combination to occur-an additive way and a subtractive way. The additive combination leads to formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy and roughly egg-shaped, while the subtractive combination leads to a molecular orbital that is higher in energy and has a node between nuclei (FIGURE 1.18). Note that the additive combination is a single, egg-shaped, molecular orbital; it is not the same as the two overlapping 1 s atomic orbitals of the valence bond description. Similarly, the subtractive combination is a single molecular orbital with the shape of an elongated dumbbell.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.18 Molecular orbitals of $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{2}}$.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

Just like electrons around isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized) energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital ( $\\Psi^{2}$ ). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.\n\nWe will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms ( $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ or $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, for example).

Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with troughs (Figure 5.28). In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.28 (a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive.

The structure of an organic molecule is usually determined using spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry (MS) tells the molecular weight and formula of a molecule; infrared (IR) spectroscopy identifies the functional groups present in the molecule.\n\nIn small-molecule mass spectrometry, molecules are first ionized by collision with a high-energy electron beam. The ions then fragment into smaller pieces, which are magnetically sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. The ionized sample molecule is called the molecular ion, $M^{+}$, and measurement of its mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by interpreting the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion. Mass-spectral fragmentations are usually complex, however, and interpretation is often difficult. In biological mass spectrometry, molecules are protonated using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the protonated molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy involves the interaction of a molecule with electromagnetic radiation. When an organic molecule is irradiated with infrared energy, certain frequencies are absorbed by the molecule. The frequencies absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular vibrations such as bond stretching and bending. Since every functional group has a characteristic combination of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal alkyne $\\equiv \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond absorbs IR radiation of $3300 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and the alkene $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ bond absorbs in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. By observing which frequencies of infrared radiation are absorbed by a molecule and which are not, it's possible to determine the functional groups a molecule contains.",

Internal energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m , and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 9.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).\n\n\nFIGURE 9.20 Paths $X$ and $Y$ represent two different routes to the summit of Mt.

These easy-to-use \"coffee cup\" calorimeters allow more heat exchange with the outside environment, and therefore produce less accurate energy values.\n\n\nFIGURE 9.12 A simple calorimeter can be constructed from two polystyrene cups. A thermometer and stirrer extend through the cover into the reaction mixture.\n\nCommercial solution calorimeters are also available. Relatively inexpensive calorimeters often consist of two thin-walled cups that are nested in a way that minimizes thermal contact during use, along with an insulated cover, handheld stirrer, and simple thermometer. More expensive calorimeters used for industry and research typically have a well-insulated, fully enclosed reaction vessel, motorized stirring mechanism, and a more accurate temperature sensor (Figure 9.13).\n\n\nFIGURE 9.13 Commercial solution calorimeters range from (a) simple, inexpensive models for student use to (b) expensive, more accurate models for industry and research.\n\nBefore discussing the calorimetry of chemical reactions, consider a simpler example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry. Suppose we initially have a high-temperature substance, such as a hot piece of metal $(M)$, and a low-temperature substance, such as cool water (W). If we place the metal in the water, heat will flow from M to W . The temperature of M will decrease, and the temperature of W will increase, until the two substances have the same temperature-that is, when they reach thermal equilibrium (Figure 9.14). If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two substances, with no heat gained or lost by either its external environment. Under these ideal circumstances, the net heat change is zero:\n\n$$\nq_{\\text {substance } \\mathrm{M}}+q_{\\text {substance } \\mathrm{W}}=0\n$$",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- State the first law of thermodynamics\n- Define enthalpy and explain its classification as a state function\n- Write and balance thermochemical equations\n- Calculate enthalpy changes for various chemical reactions\n- Explain Hess's law and use it to compute reaction enthalpies\n\nThermochemistry is a branch of chemical thermodynamics, the science that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and other forms of energy in the context of chemical and physical processes. As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.\n\nSubstances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy ( $\\boldsymbol{U}$ ), sometimes symbolized as $E$.\n\nAs a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat $(q)$ from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work ( $w$ ) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire's temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.\n\nThe relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U=q+w\n$$",

The number of microstates possible for such a system is $n^{N}$. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in $2^{4}=16$ different microstates as illustrated in Figure 12.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The spacing of the fringes depends on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for the shorterwavelength blue light. (credit: PASCO)",

Instead, the driving force appears to be related to the greater, more uniform dispersal of matter that results when the gas is allowed to expand. Initially, the system was comprised of one flask containing matter and another flask containing nothing. After the spontaneous expansion took place, the matter was distributed both more widely (occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each flask).\n\n\nFIGURE 12.4 An isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a\nsecond flask containing a vacuum.

X-Ray Crystallography - \nThe size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography.

X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal.

The subject is a bit complex, though, so we'll return to it in Chapter 11 for a more detailed study. For the present, it's enough to realize that alkenes are readily available from simple precursors-usually alcohols in biological systems and either alcohols or alkyl halides in the laboratory.\n\nJust as the chemistry of alkenes is dominated by addition reactions, the preparation of alkenes is dominated by elimination reactions. Additions and eliminations are, in many respects, two sides of the same coin. That is, an addition reaction might involve the addition of HBr or $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ to an alkene to form an alkyl halide or alcohol, whereas an elimination reaction might involve the loss of HBr or $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ from an alkyl halide or alcohol to form an alkene.\n\n\nThe two most common elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation-the loss of HX from an alkyl halide-and dehydration-the loss of water from an alcohol. Dehydrohalogenation usually occurs by reaction of an alkyl halide with strong base such as potassium hydroxide. For example, bromocyclohexane yields cyclohexene when treated with KOH in ethanol solution.\n\n\nBromocyclohexane Cyclohexene (81\\%)\nDehydration is often carried out in the laboratory by treatment of an alcohol with a strong acid.

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

One type of work ( $\\boldsymbol{w}$ ) is the process of causing matter to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle tire-we move matter (the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already in the tire.\n\nLike matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two types: potential energy, the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or condition, and kinetic energy, the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce electricity in a hydroelectric plant (Figure 9.3). A battery has potential energy because the chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 9.3 (a) Water at a higher elevation, for example, at the top of Victoria Falls, has a higher potential energy than water at a lower elevation. As the water falls, some of its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. (b) If the water flows through generators at the bottom of a dam, such as the Hoover Dam shown here, its kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Jurvetson; credit b: modification of work by \"curimedia\"/Wikimedia commons)\n\nEnergy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This observation is expressed in the law of conservation of energy: during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor destroyed, although it can be changed in form.

The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons.\n\nWhen using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1 , a double bond has a bond order of 2 , and a triple bond has a bond order of 3 . We define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but both methods describe the same phenomenon.\n\nIn the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\text { bond order }=\\frac{\\text { (number of bonding electrons) }- \\text { (number of antibonding electrons) }}{2}\n$$\n\nThe order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases. If the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not form.

This works well for preparing large amounts of a few substances, but it doesn't work so well for preparing small amounts of a great many substances. This latter goal is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry, where vast numbers of structurally similar compounds must be synthesized and screened to find an optimum drug candidate.\n\nTo speed the process of drug discovery, combinatorial chemistry has been developed to prepare what are called combinatorial libraries, in which anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred thousand substances are prepared simultaneously. Among the early successes of combinatorial chemistry is the development of a benzodiazepine library, a class of aromatic compounds commonly used as antianxiety agents.\n\n\nBenzodiazepine library\n( $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathbf{1}}-\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathbf{4}}$ are various organic substituents)\n\nTwo main approaches to combinatorial chemistry are used-parallel synthesis and split synthesis. In parallel synthesis, each compound is prepared independently. Typically, a reactant is first linked to the surface of polymer beads, which are then placed into small wells on a 96 -well glass plate. Programmable robotic instruments add different sequences of building blocks to the different wells, thereby making 96 different products. When the reaction sequences are complete, the polymer beads are washed and their products are released.\n\nIn split synthesis, the initial reactant is again linked to the surface of polymer beads, which are then divided into several groups. A different building block is added to each group of beads, the different groups are combined, and the reassembled mix is again split to form new groups. Another building block is added to each group, the groups are again combined and redivided, and the process continues. If, for example, the beads are divided into four groups at each step, the number of compounds increases in the progression $4 \\rightarrow 16 \\rightarrow 64 \\rightarrow 256$. After 10 steps, more than 1 million compounds have been prepared (FIGURE 16.23).",

If you place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g . The digits 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement of $\\pm 0.01$ gram. If the coin is weighed on a more sensitive balance, the mass might be 6.723 g . This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used\n(and the user's ability). All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant figures or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows \" 120 ,\" then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.\n\nA measurement result is properly reported when its significant digits accurately represent the certainty of the measurement process. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is significant and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require some thought. We will use the terms \"leading,\" \"trailing,\" and \"captive\" for the zeros and will consider how to deal with them.\n\n\nStarting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the left of the decimal point.\n\n\nCaptive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never significant-they merely tell us where the decimal point is located.\n\n\nThe leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation (as described in Appendix B) and express the number as $8.32407 \\times 10^{-3}$; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, and $10^{-3}$ locates the decimal point.",

We can use quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an $s$ orbital, a dumbbell shape for a $p$ orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization.\n\nValence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms' positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap.",

The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is based on solutions of the Schrödinger equation. In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.\n\nAnother quantum number is $l$, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take the values, $l=0,1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have only one value of $l, l=0$, whereas $n=2$ permits $l=0$ and $l=1$, and so on. Whereas the principal quantum number, $n$, defines the general size and energy of the orbital, the secondary quantum number 1 specifies the shape of the orbital. Orbitals with the same value of $l$ define a subshell.",

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThe next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively charged alpha particles ( $\\alpha$ particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of radium; $\\alpha$ particles consist of two protons and two neutrons (you will learn more about radioactive decay in the chapter on nuclear chemistry). Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a beam of $\\alpha$ particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering of the $\\alpha$ particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an $\\alpha$ particle.\nWhat did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source (Figure 2.9). Rutherford described finding these results: \"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you., ${ }^{\\underline{1}}$\n\n\nFIGURE 2.9 Geiger and Rutherford fired $\\alpha$ particles at a piece of gold foil and detected where those particles went, as shown in this schematic diagram of their experiment. Most of the particles passed straight through the foil, but a few were deflected slightly and a very small number were significantly deflected.\n\nHere is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving $\\alpha$ particles passed through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like charges repel one another, the few positively charged $\\alpha$ particles that changed paths abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:",

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea.

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively.

Among them were Marie Curie (the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in different sciences-chemistry and physics), who was the first to coin the term \"radioactivity,\" and Ernest Rutherford (of gold foil experiment fame), who investigated and named three of the most common types of radiation. During the beginning of the twentieth century, many radioactive substances were discovered, the properties of radiation were investigated and quantified, and a solid understanding of radiation and nuclear decay was developed.\n\nThe spontaneous change of an unstable nuclide into another is radioactive decay. The unstable nuclide is called the parent nuclide; the nuclide that results from the decay is known as the daughter nuclide. The daughter nuclide may be stable, or it may decay itself. The radiation produced during radioactive decay is such that the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than the parent nuclide, so the location of a nuclide relative to the band of stability can serve as a guide to the kind of decay it will undergo (Figure 20.5).\n\n\nFIGURE 20.5 A nucleus of uranium-238 (the parent nuclide) undergoes $\\alpha$ decay to form thorium-234 (the daughter nuclide).

IMFs are the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module. These forces serve to hold particles close together, whereas the particles' KE provides the energy required to overcome the attractive forces and thus increase the distance between particles.

Its effects are more pronounced in cells that reproduce rapidly, such as the stomach lining, hair follicles, bone marrow, and embryos. This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.\n\nDifferent types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 20.33). A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding. The ability of various kinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and some particles have almost no tendency to produce ionization.

Figure 5.2 illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 5.2.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm , which is the bond length observed for the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule.\n\nIn addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for two $s$ orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 5.3 illustrates this for two $p$ orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThe Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstax.org/1/16PhetScatter) allows you to investigate the differences between a \"plum pudding\" atom and a Rutherford atom by firing $\\alpha$ particles at each type of atom.\n\nAnother important finding was the discovery of isotopes. During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a \"new element\" produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the English chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopes-atoms of the same element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery.\n\nOne puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found evidence of neutrons, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The existence of the neutron also explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of\nneutrons, but they are chemically identical because they have the same number of protons. This will be explained in more detail later.",

(a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are distributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as argon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g., Ar). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end of one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (e.g., ICI molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to one of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom.

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of the halves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained that was so small that it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knife may be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek atomos, meaning \"indivisible\") (Figure 1.12). This atom would no longer be gold if it were divided any further.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.12 (a) This photograph shows a gold nugget.

However, it was not until the early nineteenth century that John Dalton (1766-1844), a British schoolteacher with a keen interest in science, supported this hypothesis with quantitative measurements. Since that time, repeated experiments have confirmed many aspects of this hypothesis, and it has become one of the central theories of chemistry. Other aspects of Dalton's atomic theory are still used but with minor revisions (details of Dalton's theory are provided in the chapter on atoms and molecules).",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges.

The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in Table 2.2. (An observant student might notice that the sum of an atom's subatomic particles does not equal the atom's actual mass: The total mass of six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons is 12.0993 amu , slightly larger than 12.00 amu . This \"missing\" mass is known as the mass defect, and you will learn about it in the chapter on nuclear chemistry.)\n\nProperties of Subatomic Particles\n\n| Name | Location | Charge (C) | Unit Charge | Mass (amu) | Mass (g) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| electron | outside nucleus | $-1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ | $1-$ | 0.00055 | $0.00091 \\times 10^{-24}$ |\n| proton | nucleus | $1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ | $1+$ | 1.00727 | $1.67262 \\times 10^{-24}$ |\n| neutron | nucleus | 0 | 0 | 1.00866 | $1.67493 \\times 10^{-24}$ |\n\nTABLE 2.2",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 3.30.\n\nCovalent Radii of the Halogen Group Elements\n\n| Atom | Covalent radius (pm) | Nuclear charge |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| F | 64 | +9 |\n| Cl | 99 | +17 |\n| Br | 114 | +35 |\n| I | 133 | +53 |\n| At | 148 | +85 |\n\nTABLE 3.2\n\n\nFIGURE 3.30 (a) The radius of an atom is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei in a molecule consisting of two identical atoms joined by a covalent bond.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Therefore, the colors of coordination compounds depend on many factors. As shown in Figure 19.38, different aqueous metal ions can have different colors.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

According to frontier orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene. The $2 E, 4 Z, 6 E$ isomer yields cis product; the $2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z$ isomer yields trans product (FIGURE 30.6).\n\n\nIn the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts conrotatory ring-closure.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

However, we do find exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27. For instance, the electron configurations (shown in Figure 3.29) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper ( Cu ; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling.\n\nIn the case of Cr and Cu , we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the $4 s$ into the $3 d$ orbital to gain the extra stability of a half-filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cr ) or a filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cu ). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium ( Nb , atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{2} 4 d^{3}$. Experimentally, we observe that its ground-state electron configuration is actually $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{1} 4 d^{4}$. We can rationalize this observation by saying that the electron-electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the $5 s$ orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the $5 s$ and $4 d$ orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nFIGURE 3.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as $2 s$, $3 p$, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, $n$. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a onedimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 3.7 shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen in Figure 3.7. The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths $n$. Since the number of nodes is $n-1$, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves.

These numbers of protons or neutrons $(2,8,20,28,50,82$, and 126 ) make complete shells in the nucleus. These are similar in concept to the stable electron shells observed for the noble gases. Nuclei that have magic numbers of\nboth protons and neutrons, such as ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He},{ }_{8}^{16} \\mathrm{O},{ }_{20}^{40} \\mathrm{Ca}$, and ${ }_{82}^{208} \\mathrm{~Pb}$, are called \"double magic\" and are particularly stable. These trends in nuclear stability may be rationalized by considering a quantum mechanical model of nuclear energy states analogous to that used to describe electronic states earlier in this textbook. The details of this model are beyond the scope of this chapter.\n\nStable Nuclear Isotopes\n\n| Number of Stable Isotopes | Proton Number | Neutron Number |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 157 | even | even |\n| 53 | even | odd |\n| 50 | odd | even |\n| 5 | odd | odd |\n\nTABLE 20.1",

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter.

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first.

The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The postulates of this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual laws. To do this, we must first look at speeds and kinetic energies of gas molecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.\n\nIn a gas sample, individual molecules have widely varying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules and collisions involved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This molecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it depicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a given speed (Figure 8.32).\n\n\nFIGURE 8.32 The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at 300 K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds. The number of molecules with intermediate speeds increases rapidly up to a maximum, which is the most probable speed, then drops off rapidly. Note that the most probable speed, $v_{p}$, is a little less than $400 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, while the root mean square speed, $u_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, is closer to $500 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) of a particle of mass ( $m$ ) and speed $(u)$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{KE}=\\frac{1}{2} m u^{2}\n$$\n\nExpressing mass in kilograms and speed in meters per second will yield energy values in units of joules ( $\\mathrm{J}=\\mathrm{kg}$ $\\mathrm{m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ ). To deal with a large number of gas molecules, we use averages for both speed and kinetic energy. In the KMT, the root mean square speed of a particle, $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathbf{r m s}}$, is defined as the square root of the average of the squares of the speeds with $n=$ the number of particles:",

Standard Enthalpy of Formation - \nA standard enthalpy of formation $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}$ is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess's law.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{~g})$ is $-393.5 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$.

The trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer by $2.8 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(0.66 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$ at room temperature, corresponding to a $76: 24$ ratio.\n\n\nCis alkenes are less stable than their trans isomers because of steric strain between the two larger substituents on the same side of the double bond. This is the same kind of steric interference that we saw previously in the axial conformation of methylcyclohexane (Section 4.7).\n\ncis-2-Butene\n\ntrans-2-Butene\n\nAlthough it's sometimes possible to find relative stabilities of alkene isomers by establishing a cis-trans equilibrium through treatment with strong acid, a more general method is to take advantage of the fact that alkenes undergo a hydrogenation reaction to give the corresponding alkane when treated with $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum.\n\n\nEnergy diagrams for the hydrogenation reactions of cis- and trans-2-butene are shown in FIGURE 7.6.

Hess's Law - \nThere are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.\n\nThis type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess's law, which states: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps. Hess's law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish.

Such a label doesn't mean that ATP is special or different from other compounds, it only means that ATP has relatively weak bonds that require a relatively small amount of heat to break, thus leading to a larger release of heat when a strong new bond forms in a reaction.

The structure of an organic molecule is usually determined using spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry (MS) tells the molecular weight and formula of a molecule; infrared (IR) spectroscopy identifies the functional groups present in the molecule.\n\nIn small-molecule mass spectrometry, molecules are first ionized by collision with a high-energy electron beam. The ions then fragment into smaller pieces, which are magnetically sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. The ionized sample molecule is called the molecular ion, $M^{+}$, and measurement of its mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by interpreting the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion. Mass-spectral fragmentations are usually complex, however, and interpretation is often difficult. In biological mass spectrometry, molecules are protonated using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the protonated molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy involves the interaction of a molecule with electromagnetic radiation. When an organic molecule is irradiated with infrared energy, certain frequencies are absorbed by the molecule. The frequencies absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular vibrations such as bond stretching and bending. Since every functional group has a characteristic combination of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal alkyne $\\equiv \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond absorbs IR radiation of $3300 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and the alkene $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ bond absorbs in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. By observing which frequencies of infrared radiation are absorbed by a molecule and which are not, it's possible to determine the functional groups a molecule contains.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the physical factors that lead to deviations from ideal gas behavior\n- Explain how these factors are represented in the van der Waals equation\n- Define compressibility (Z) and describe how its variation with pressure reflects non-ideal behavior\n- Quantify non-ideal behavior by comparing computations of gas properties using the ideal gas law and the van der Waals equation\n\nThus far, the ideal gas law, $P V=n R T$, has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from\nreaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.\n\nOne way in which the accuracy of $P V=n R T$ can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its molar volume, $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ ) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the compressibility factor ( $\\mathbf{Z}$ ) with:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Z}=\\frac{\\text { molar volume of gas at same } T \\text { and } P}{\\text { molar volume of ideal gas at same } T \\text { and } P}=\\left(\\frac{P V_{m}}{R T}\\right)_{\\text {measured }}\n$$\n\nIdeal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1 , and any deviation from 1 is an indication of non-ideal behavior. Figure 8.35 shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.35 A graph of the compressibility factor $(Z)$ vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.\n\nAs is apparent from Figure 8.35, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures. To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to $1 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}{ }^{2} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$, which is also called 1 newton-meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.\n\nWe now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of heat ( $q$ ) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change $(\\Delta T)$ of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):\n\n$$\nC=\\frac{q}{\\Delta T}\n$$\n\nHeat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive property-its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.\n\nFor example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast\niron frying pan is found by observing that it takes $18,150 \\mathrm{~J}$ of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by $50.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ :",

As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a onedimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 3.7 shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen in Figure 3.7. The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths $n$. Since the number of nodes is $n-1$, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves. Since the two end points of the string are held fixed, only waves having an integer number of half-wavelengths can form. The points on the string between the end points that are not moving are called the nodes.",

The frequency factor, $A$, reflects how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An increased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for $A$ and faster reaction rates.\nThe exponential term, $e^{-E a / R T}$, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample of matter at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in Figure 17.15(a). Two shaded areas under the curve represent the numbers of molecules possessing adequate energy $(R T)$ to overcome the activation barriers $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Explain the form and function of a rate law\n- Use rate laws to calculate reaction rates\n- Use rate and concentration data to identify reaction orders and derive rate laws\n\nAs described in the previous module, the rate of a reaction is often affected by the concentrations of reactants.\nRate laws (sometimes called differential rate laws) or rate equations are mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration of its reactants. As an example, consider the reaction described by the chemical equation\n\n$$\na A+b B \\longrightarrow \\text { products }\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are stoichiometric coefficients. The rate law for this reaction is written as:\n\n$$\n\\text { rate }=k[A]^{m}[B]^{n}\n$$\n\nin which $[A]$ and $[B]$ represent the molar concentrations of reactants, and $k$ is the rate constant, which is specific for a particular reaction at a particular temperature. The exponents $m$ and $n$ are the reaction orders and are typically positive integers, though they can be fractions, negative, or zero. The rate constant $k$ and the reaction orders $m$ and $n$ must be determined experimentally by observing how the rate of a reaction changes as the concentrations of the reactants are changed. The rate constant $k$ is independent of the reactant concentrations, but it does vary with temperature.\n\nThe reaction orders in a rate law describe the mathematical dependence of the rate on reactant concentrations. Referring to the generic rate law above, the reaction is $m$ order with respect to $A$ and $n$ order with respect to $B$. For example, if $m=1$ and $n=2$, the reaction is first order in $A$ and second order in $B$. The overall reaction order is simply the sum of orders for each reactant. For the example rate law here, the reaction is third order overall $(1+2=3)$.

Answer: - \n4; because $\\Delta_{\\text {tet }}$ is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the $t_{2}$ orbitals before pairing\n\nThe other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the $z$-axis. This changes the distribution of the $d$ orbitals, as orbitals on or near the $z$-axis become more stable, and those on or near the $x$ - or $y$-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ and the $e_{g}$ sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern, as depicted below:\n\n\nMagnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions\nExperimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nWhen an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_{6}\\right]^{4-}$ confirms that iron is diamagnetic,\nwhereas high-spin $d^{6}\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{2+}$ has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.",

When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current.

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called $\\sigma$ MOs. They can be formed from $s$ orbitals or from $p$ orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from $p$ orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called $\\pi$ orbitals.\n\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund's rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins.

Molecular polarity results from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule. As a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar substances are insoluble in water.\n\nNet polarity is measured by a quantity called the dipole moment and can be thought of in the following way: assume that there is a center of mass of all positive charges (nuclei) in a molecule and a center of mass of all negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don't coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.\n\nThe dipole moment, $\\mu$ (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge $Q$ at either end of the molecular dipole times the distance $r$ between the charges, $\\mu=Q \\times r$.

However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen molecule $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would write the following Lewis structure for $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ :\n\n\nThis electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an $\\mathrm{O}=\\mathrm{O}$ double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Figure 5.1. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?\n\nMagnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 5.27), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample.",

Neither structure is correct by itself; the true structure of the allyl radical is a resonance hybrid of the two. (You might want to review Section 2.4 to Section 2.6 to brush up on resonance.) As noted in Section 2.5, the greater the number of resonance forms, the greater the stability of a compound, because bonding electrons are attracted to more nuclei. An allyl radical, with two resonance forms, is therefore more stable than a typical alkyl radical, which has only a single structure.\n\nIn molecular orbital terms, the stability of the allyl radical is due to the fact that the unpaired electron is delocalized, or spread out, over an extended $\\pi$-orbital network rather than localized at only one site, as shown\nby the computer-generated MO in FIGURE 10.4. This delocalization is particularly apparent in the so-called spin-density surface in FIGURE 10.5, which shows the calculated location of the unpaired electron. The two terminal carbons share the unpaired electron equally.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.5 The spin density surface of the allyl radical locates the position of the unpaired electron and shows that it is equally shared between the two terminal carbons.",

Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure.

If so, we would observe only a single NMR absorption signal in the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ spectrum of a molecule, a situation that would be of little use. In fact, the absorption frequency is not the same for all ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or all ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nuclei.\n\nAll nuclei in molecules are surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field is applied to a molecule, the electrons moving around nuclei set up tiny local magnetic fields of their own. These local magnetic fields act in opposition to the applied field so that the effective field actually felt by the nucleus is a bit weaker than the applied field.\n\n$$\nB_{\\text {effective }}=B_{\\text {applied }}=B_{\\text {local }}\n$$\n\nIn describing this effect of local fields, we say that nuclei experience shielding from the full effect of the applied field by the surrounding electrons. Because each chemically distinct nucleus in a molecule is in a slightly different electronic environment, each nucleus is shielded to a slightly different extent and the effective magnetic field felt by each is slightly different. These tiny differences in the effective magnetic fields experienced by different nuclei can be detected, and we thus see a distinct NMR signal for each chemically distinct ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ or ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus in a molecule.

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

According to frontier orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene. The $2 E, 4 Z, 6 E$ isomer yields cis product; the $2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z$ isomer yields trans product (FIGURE 30.6).\n\n\nIn the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts conrotatory ring-closure. In practice, however, the conjugated diene reaction can be observed only in the reverse direction (cyclobutene $\\rightarrow$ diene) because of the position of the equilibrium. We therefore find that the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene ring opens in a conrotatory fashion. cis-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 Z$ )-2,4-hexadiene, and trans-3,4-dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 E$ )-2,4-hexadiene by conrotatory opening (FIGURE 30.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 30.7 Thermal ring-openings of cis- and trans-dimethylcyclobutene occur by conrotatory paths.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

The explanation for this follows from orbital-symmetry arguments.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThis view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstax.org/l/16combustion) illustrates the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into energy of motion.\n\nAs discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as $\\Delta U=q+w$. Internal energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m , and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 9.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).\n\n\nFIGURE 9.20 Paths $X$ and $Y$ represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path). (credit: modification of work by Paul Shaffner)\n\nChemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system's internal energy $(U)$ and the mathematical product of its pressure ( $P$ ) and volume ( $V$ ):\n\n$$\nH=U+P V\n$$",

Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (\"to build up\"). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 3.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 3.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 3.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order. For example, after filling the $3 p$ block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be $4 \\mathrm{~s}(\\mathrm{~K}, \\mathrm{Ca})$, followed by the $3 d$ orbitals.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.26 This diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state electron configurations.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.27 This partial periodic table shows electron configurations for the valence subshells of atoms.

However, we do find exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27. For instance, the electron configurations (shown in Figure 3.29) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper ( Cu ; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling.\n\nIn the case of Cr and Cu , we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the $4 s$ into the $3 d$ orbital to gain the extra stability of a half-filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cr ) or a filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cu ). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium ( Nb , atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{2} 4 d^{3}$. Experimentally, we observe that its ground-state electron configuration is actually $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{1} 4 d^{4}$. We can rationalize this observation by saying that the electron-electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the $5 s$ orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the $5 s$ and $4 d$ orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.",

In electrochemistry, the potentials of cells and halfcells are thermodynamic quantities that reflect the driving force or the spontaneity of their redox processes. The cell potential of an electrochemical cell is the difference in between its cathode and anode. To permit easy sharing of half-cell potential data, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is\nassigned a potential of exactly 0 V and used to define a single electrode potential for any given half-cell. The electrode potential of a half-cell, $E_{X}$, is the cell potential of said half-cell acting as a cathode when connected to a SHE acting as an anode. When the half-cell is operating under standard state conditions, its potential is the standard electrode potential, $E^{\\circ}{ }_{\\mathrm{X}}$. Standard electrode potentials reflect the relative oxidizing strength of the half-reaction's reactant, with stronger oxidants exhibiting larger (more positive) $E^{o}{ }_{X}$ values. Tabulations of standard electrode potentials may be used to compute standard cell potentials, $E^{o}$ cell, for many redox reactions. The arithmetic sign of a cell potential indicates the spontaneity of the cell reaction, with positive values for spontaneous reactions and negative values for nonspontaneous reactions (spontaneous in the reverse direction).",

Molecular orbitals with fewer nodes are lower in energy than isolated $p$ atomic orbitals and are bonding MOs; molecular orbitals with more nodes are higher in energy than isolated $p$ orbitals and are antibonding MOs. Pi molecular orbitals of ethylene and 1,3-butadiene are shown in FIGURE 30.2.\n\n\nA similar sort of molecular orbital description can be derived for any conjugated $\\pi$ electron system. 1,3,5-Hexatriene, for example, has three double bonds and six $\\pi$ MOs, as shown in FIGURE 30.3.

According to a series of rules formulated in the mid-1960s by R. B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann at Harvard University, a pericyclic reaction can take place only if the symmetries of the reactant MOs are the same as the symmetries of the product MOs. In other words, the lobes of reactant MOs must be of the correct algebraic sign for bonding to occur in the transition state leading to product.",

This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

Crystal Field Theory - \nIn an uncomplexed metal ion in the gas phase, the electrons are distributed among the five $d$ orbitals in accord with Hund's rule because the orbitals all have the same energy. However, when ligands coordinate to a metal ion, the energies of the $d$ orbitals are no longer the same.\nIn octahedral complexes, the lobes in two of the five $d$ orbitals, the $d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, point toward the ligands (Figure 19.33). These two orbitals are called the $\\boldsymbol{e}_{g}$ orbitals (the symbol actually refers to the symmetry of the orbitals, but we will use it as a convenient name for these two orbitals in an octahedral complex). The other three orbitals, the $d_{x y}, d_{x z}$, and $d_{y z}$ orbitals, have lobes that point between the ligands and are called the $\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\mathbf{2 g}}$ orbitals (again, the symbol really refers to the symmetry of the orbitals). As six ligands approach the metal ion along the axes of the octahedron, their point charges repel the electrons in the $d$ orbitals of the metal ion. However, the repulsions between the electrons in the $e_{g}$ orbitals (the $d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals) and the ligands are greater than the repulsions between the electrons in the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals (the $d_{z y}, d_{x z}$, and $d_{y z}$ orbitals) and the ligands. This is because the lobes of the $e_{g}$ orbitals point directly at the ligands, whereas the lobes of the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals point between them. Thus, electrons in the $e_{g}$ orbitals of the metal ion in an octahedral complex have higher potential energies than those of electrons in the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals. The difference in energy may be represented as shown in Figure 19.34.",

Measuring Nutritional Calories - \nIn your day-to-day life, you may be more familiar with energy being given in Calories, or nutritional calories, which are used to quantify the amount of energy in foods. One calorie (cal) = exactly 4.184 joules, and one Calorie (note the capitalization) $=1000 \\mathrm{cal}$, or 1 kcal . (This is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.)\n\nThe macronutrients in food are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats or oils. Proteins provide about 4 Calories per gram, carbohydrates also provide about 4 Calories per gram, and fats and oils provide about 9 Calories/ g. Nutritional labels on food packages show the caloric content of one serving of the food, as well as the breakdown into Calories from each of the three macronutrients (Figure 9.18).\n\n[^7]\n\nFIGURE 9.18 (a) Macaroni and cheese contain energy in the form of the macronutrients in the food. (b) The food's nutritional information is shown on the package label. In the US, the energy content is given in Calories (per serving); the rest of the world usually uses kilojoules. (credit a: modification of work by \"Rex Roof\"/Flickr)\n\nFor the example shown in (b), the total energy per 228-g portion is calculated by:\n$(5 \\mathrm{~g}$ protein $\\times 4$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})+(31 \\mathrm{~g}$ carb $\\times 4$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})+(12 \\mathrm{~g}$ fat $\\times 9$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})=252$ Calories\nSo, you can use food labels to count your Calories. But where do the values come from? And how accurate are they? The caloric content of foods can be determined by using bomb calorimetry; that is, by burning the food and measuring the energy it contains. A sample of food is weighed, mixed in a blender, freezedried, ground into powder, and formed into a pellet. The pellet is burned inside a bomb calorimeter, and the measured temperature change is converted into energy per gram of food.",

Entropy and Microstates - \nThe previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (Figure 12.4) is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. Initially, the gas molecules are confined to just one of the two flasks. Opening the valve between the flasks increases the volume available to the gas molecules and, correspondingly, the number of microstates possible for the system. Since $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the expansion process involves an increase in entropy $(\\Delta S>0)$ and is spontaneous.\n\nA similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two objects, each containing two particles, and two units of thermal energy (represented as \"*\") in Figure 12.9. The hot object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution (a), is $\\frac{3}{10}$. More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being $\\frac{7}{10}$. The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), the probability of this configuration being $\\frac{4}{10}$. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects' temperatures. And, again, this spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.",

After the spontaneous expansion took place, the matter was distributed both more widely (occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each flask).\n\n\nFIGURE 12.4 An isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a\nsecond flask containing a vacuum.

X-Ray Crystallography - \nThe size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal.

Properties of Liquids\nCapillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is immersed in a liquid, as illustrated in Figure 10.20. If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the inside of the tube until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive forces are in balance. The smaller the diameter of the tube is, the higher the liquid climbs. It is partly by capillary action occurring in plant cells called xylem that water and dissolved nutrients are brought from the soil up through the roots and into a plant. Capillary action is the basis for thin layer chromatography, a laboratory technique commonly used to separate small quantities of mixtures. You depend on a constant supply of tears to keep your eyes lubricated and on capillary action to pump tear fluid away.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.20 Depending upon the relative strengths of adhesive and cohesive forces, a liquid may rise (such as water) or fall (such as mercury) in a glass capillary tube. The extent of the rise (or fall) is directly proportional to the surface tension of the liquid and inversely proportional to the density of the liquid and the radius of the tube.\n\nThe height to which a liquid will rise in a capillary tube is determined by several factors as shown in the\nfollowing equation:\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{2 T \\cos \\theta}{r \\rho g}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is the height of the liquid inside the capillary tube relative to the surface of the liquid outside the tube, $T$ is the surface tension of the liquid, $\\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube, $r$ is the radius of the tube, $\\rho$ is the density of the liquid, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $9.8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nFIGURE 3.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as $2 s$, $3 p$, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, $n$. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

For example, acid-catalyzed addition of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ to 1-butene in the laboratory yields 2 -butanol, a chiral alcohol. What is the stereochemistry of this chiral product?

Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$.

Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically $>10^{23}$ atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When $N$ valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, $N / 2$ (filled) bonding orbitals and $N / 2$ (empty) antibonding orbitals will result.

The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band.

This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons for main group elements are those with the highest $n$ level. For example, gallium ( Ga , atomic number 31) has the electron configuration $[\\operatorname{Ar}] 4 s^{2} 3 d^{10} 4 p^{1}$, which contains three valence electrons (underlined).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively.

A second grouping includes calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba), which also are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical properties in common.

Both published tables with the elements arranged according to increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to aluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleev's work. Although Mendeleev and Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleev's contributions to the development of the periodic table are now more widely recognized (Figure 3.36).",

Rather, each $p$ orbital overlaps equally well with both neighboring $p$ orbitals, leading to a picture of benzene in which all six $\\pi$ electrons are free to move about the entire ring (FIGURE 15.4b). In resonance terms (Section 2.4 and Section 2.5), benzene is a hybrid of two equivalent forms. Neither form is correct by itself; the true structure of benzene is somewhere in between the two resonance forms but is impossible to draw with our usual conventions. Because of this resonance, benzene is more stable and less reactive than a typical alkene.\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFIGURE 15.4 (a) An electrostatic potential map of benzene and (b) an orbital picture.

Molecular (Covalent) Compounds - \nThe bonding characteristics of inorganic molecular compounds are different from ionic compounds, and they are named using a different system as well. The charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic compounds, so specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine chemical formulas. However, because covalent bonding allows for significant variation in the combination ratios of the atoms in a molecule, the names for molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios.\n\nCompounds Composed of Two Elements\nWhen two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination ratios are often possible.\n\nFor example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds CO and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Since these are different substances with different properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called carbon oxide). To deal with this situation, we use a naming method that is somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to specify the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic element (the one farther to the left and/or bottom of the periodic table) is first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to the right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix -ide. The numbers of atoms of each element are designated by the Greek prefixes shown in Table 4.6.\n\nWhen only one atom of the first element is present, the prefix mono- is usually deleted from that part. Thus, CO is named carbon monoxide, and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is called carbon dioxide. When two vowels are adjacent, the $a$ in the Greek prefix is usually dropped. Some other examples are shown in Table 4.7.\n\nNames of Some Molecular Compounds Composed of Two Elements",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain.

If you place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g . The digits 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement of $\\pm 0.01$ gram. If the coin is weighed on a more sensitive balance, the mass might be 6.723 g . This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used\n(and the user's ability). All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant figures or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows \" 120 ,\" then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.\n\nA measurement result is properly reported when its significant digits accurately represent the certainty of the measurement process. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is significant and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require some thought. We will use the terms \"leading,\" \"trailing,\" and \"captive\" for the zeros and will consider how to deal with them.\n\n\nStarting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the left of the decimal point.\n\n\nCaptive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never significant-they merely tell us where the decimal point is located.\n\n\nThe leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation (as described in Appendix B) and express the number as $8.32407 \\times 10^{-3}$; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, and $10^{-3}$ locates the decimal point.",

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant.\n\nIt should be noted that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nHeisenberg's principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it is also an exothermic quantity.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Significant Figures in Calculations - \nA second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement are at least as uncertain as the measurement itself. Take the uncertainty in measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct number of significant figures, which is determined by the following three rules for rounding numbers:\n\n1. When adding or subtracting numbers, round the result to the same number of decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal places (the least certain value in terms of addition and subtraction).\n2. When multiplying or dividing numbers, round the result to the same number of digits as the number with the least number of significant figures (the least certain value in terms of multiplication and division).\n3. If the digit to be dropped (the one immediately to the right of the digit to be retained) is less than 5, \"round down\" and leave the retained digit unchanged; if it is more than 5, \"round up\" and increase the retained digit by 1 . If the dropped digit is 5 , and it's either the last digit in the number or it's followed only by zeros, round up or down, whichever yields an even value for the retained digit. If any nonzero digits follow the dropped 5 , round up. (The last part of this rule may strike you as a bit odd, but it's based on reliable statistics and is aimed at avoiding any bias when dropping the digit \" 5 ,\" since it is equally close to both possible values of the retained digit.)\n\nThe following examples illustrate the application of this rule in rounding a few different numbers to three significant figures:\n\n- 0.028675 rounds \"up\" to 0.0287 (the dropped digit, 7 , is greater than 5 )\n- 18.3384 rounds \"down\" to 18.3 (the dropped digit, 3 , is less than 5)\n- 6.8752 rounds \"up\" to 6.88 (the dropped digit is 5 , and a nonzero digit follows it)\n- 92.85 rounds \"down\" to 92.8 (the dropped digit is 5 , and the retained digit is even)\n\nLet's work through these rules with a few examples.",

An inductive effect is simply the shifting of electrons in a $\\sigma$ bond in response to the electronegativity of nearby atoms. Metals, such as lithium and magnesium, inductively donate electrons, whereas reactive nonmetals, such as oxygen and nitrogen, inductively withdraw electrons. Inductive effects play a major role in understanding chemical reactivity, and we'll use them many times throughout this text to explain a variety of chemical observations.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Explain the process of measurement\n- Identify the three basic parts of a quantity\n- Describe the properties and units of length, mass, volume, density, temperature, and time\n- Perform basic unit calculations and conversions in the metric and other unit systems\n\nMeasurements provide much of the information that informs the hypotheses, theories, and laws describing the behavior of matter and energy in both the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement provides three kinds of information: the size or magnitude of the measurement (a number); a standard of comparison for the measurement (a unit); and an indication of the uncertainty of the measurement. While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented and will be discussed later.\n\nThe number in the measurement can be represented in different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation. (Scientific notation is also known as exponential notation; a review of this topic can be found in Appendix B.) For example, the maximum takeoff weight of a Boeing 777-200ER airliner is 298,000 kilograms, which can also be written as $2.98 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~kg}$. The mass of the average mosquito is about 0.0000025 kilograms,\nwhich can be written as $2.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nUnits, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for measurements. A 2-liter bottle of a soft drink contains a volume of beverage that is twice that of the accepted volume of 1 liter. The meat used to prepare a 0.25 -pound hamburger weighs one-fourth as much as the accepted weight of 1 pound. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patient's seizures and states a dosage of \" 100 \" without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing to the medical professional giving the dose, but the consequences can be dire: 100 mg given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of 100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Hess's Law - \nThere are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes.

And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.\n\nThis type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess's law, which states: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps. Hess's law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish.

For example, the hydrogen molecule, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 4.4 illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the $x$-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the $x$-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n\n\nFIGURE 4.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond.

An alternative approach involving a new thermodynamic property defined in terms of system properties only was introduced in the late nineteenth century by American mathematician Josiah Willard Gibbs. This new property is called the Gibbs free energy ( $\\boldsymbol{G}$ ) (or simply the free energy), and it is defined in terms of a system's enthalpy and entropy as the following:\n\n$$\nG=H-T S\n$$\n\nFree energy is a state function, and at constant temperature and pressure, the free energy change ( $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} \\boldsymbol{G}$ ) may be expressed as the following:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G=\\Delta H-T \\Delta S\n$$\n\n(For simplicity's sake, the subscript \"sys\" will be omitted henceforth.)\nThe relationship between this system property and the spontaneity of a process may be understood by recalling the previously derived second law expression:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{univ}}=\\Delta S+\\frac{q_{\\mathrm{surr}}}{T}\n$$\n\nThe first law requires that $q_{\\text {surr }}=-q_{\\text {sys }}$, and at constant pressure $q_{\\text {sys }}=\\Delta H$, so this expression may be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{univ}}=\\Delta S-\\frac{\\Delta H}{T}\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides of this equation by $-T$, and rearranging yields the following:\n\n$$\n-T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{univ}}=\\Delta H-T \\Delta S\n$$\n\nComparing this equation to the previous one for free energy change shows the following relation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G=-T \\Delta S_{\\text {univ }}\n$$",

Transition states for endergonic steps structurally resemble products, and transition states for exergonic steps structurally resemble reactants.\n\nHow does the Hammond postulate apply to electrophilic addition reactions? The formation of a carbocation by protonation of an alkene is an endergonic step. Thus, the transition state for alkene protonation structurally resembles the carbocation intermediate, and any factor that stabilizes the carbocation will also stabilize the nearby transition state. Since increasing alkyl substitution stabilizes carbocations, it also stabilizes the transition states leading to those ions, thus resulting in a faster reaction. In other words, more stable carbocations form faster because their greater stability is reflected in the lower-energy transition state leading to them (FIGURE 7.16).\n\n\nFIGURE 7.16 Energy diagrams for carbocation formation. The more stable tertiary carbocation is formed faster (green curve) because its increased stability lowers the energy of the transition state leading to it.\n\nWe can imagine the transition state for alkene protonation to be a structure in which one of the alkene carbon atoms has almost completely rehybridized from $s p^{2}$ to $s p^{3}$ and the remaining alkene carbon bears much of the positive charge (FIGURE 7.17). This transition state is stabilized by hyperconjugation and inductive effects in the same way as the product carbocation. The more alkyl groups that are present, the greater the extent of stabilization and the faster the transition state forms.\n\n\nFIGURE 7.17 The hypothetical structure of a transition state for alkene protonation. The transition state is closer in both energy and structure to the carbocation than to the alkene. Thus, an increase in carbocation stability (lower $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ ) also causes an increase in transitionstate stability (lower $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ), thereby increasing the rate of its formation.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.\n\nSubstances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy ( $\\boldsymbol{U}$ ), sometimes symbolized as $E$.\n\nAs a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat $(q)$ from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work ( $w$ ) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire's temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.\n\nThe relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U=q+w\n$$",
