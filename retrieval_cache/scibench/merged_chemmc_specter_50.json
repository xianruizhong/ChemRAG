By the 19th century, the debate was generally considered to have been settled in favor of the wave theory, as it was able to explain observed effects such as refraction, diffraction, interference, and polarization. James Clerk Maxwell had shown that electricity, magnetism, and light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon: the electromagnetic field. Maxwell's equations, which are the complete set of laws of classical electromagnetism, describe light as waves: a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism. Eventually, however, the photon model became favored. One of the most significant pieces of evidence in its favor was its ability to explain several puzzling properties of the photoelectric",

The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can.

In particular, we prove that all expectation-maximization algorithms and classes of Legendre minimization and variational bounding algorithms can be reexpressed in terms of CCCP. We show that many existing neural network and mean-field theory algorithms are also examples of CCCP. The generalized iterative scaling algorithm and Sinkhorn's algorithm can also be expressed as CCCP by changing variables.

Richard Feynman developed another functional integral, the path integral, useful for computing the quantum properties of systems. In Feynman's path integral, the classical notion of a unique trajectory for a particle is replaced by an infinite sum of classical paths, each weighted differently according to its classical properties. Functional integration is central to quantization techniques in theoretical physics. The algebraic properties of functional integrals are used to develop series used to calculate properties in quantum electrodynamics and the standard model of particle physics.

It was not bright enough nor did it last long enough to be practical, but it was the precedent behind the efforts of scores of experimenters over the next 75 years. Over the first three-quarters of the 19th century, many experimenters worked with various combinations of platinum or iridium wires, carbon rods, and evacuated or semi-evacuated enclosures.

In the 18th century, the study of series was dominated by power series, and summing a numerical series by expressing it as f(1) of some function's power series was thought to be the most natural strategy.

This interpretation is consistent with the observations. If an effect is coupled to fundamental physical processes, then coupled intrinsic patterns should emerge. Spectral analyses of the variations in photon emissions through the water that had been exposed to the magnetic fields revealed spectral power densities that peaked at spectral frequencies ~0.1 and 0.2. These results are shown in Figure 2. The actual wavelength is obtained by dividing 1 by the spectral frequency; these values are 10 nm and 5 nm, respectively. The results indicate that there is a relative peak in spectral power density of the photon transmission through the water exposed to these magnetic fields that occurs every approximately 10 nm and 5 nm.\n\nThe latter value approximates Del Guidice and Preparata's [14] derivation that the radius R of the coherent domain within which an \"evanescent electromagnetic wave pulsates with the frequency \u03ce\", is = 3/8\u2022\u03bb, effectively one-half a wavelength.

If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms).

The effect was only evident with 3 ms point durations but not with either 1 or 2 ms or 5 and 10 ms point durations. We have shown previously that 3 ms point durations are very likely to be associated with the intrinsic cosmological properties of the proton as inferred from Hubble's parameter [13].\n\nEmploying fluorescence spectrophotometry (Ultrospec 2100 pro uv visible spectrophotometer) with a stimulation wavelength of 250 nm we measured photon transmission over successive 1 nm wavelengths between 250 and 500 nm.

At this wavelength the shift of 10 nm is equivalent to a net change of 10 -20 J. One interpretation is that continuous application of this magnetic field pattern to spring water in darkness altered the intrinsic organization of the protons. This condition particularly affected the distribution of energy from the second shell hydrogen bonds that contribute to proton movements. If classic processes are assumed, then a shift occurred such that different vibrational phases within the ground state were produced by the maintained exposure to the magnetic field pattern.\n\nThat the quantitative shift in the wavelength (and intrinsic energy) reflects magnetic energy contained within the spring water from the magnetic field exposures can be estimated by quantification.

First it is the quantum of energy associated with the resting membrane potential produced by the electrical force between potassium ions each separated by about 11 nm over the surface of the membrane [2]. Second, this magnitude defines the energy associated with the effects of the net change in voltage of an action potential (~1.2\u202210 -1 V) on a unit charge.\n\nThird, the energy is within measurement error for the second shell hydrogen bonds (2.6 kcal\u2022M -1 ) that have been shown to be primarily contributory to the capacity for proton mobility [3] within water.\n\nAs aptly articulated by Decoursey [3] the proton is unique among cations because it is interchangeable with the protons that form water. Consequently water maintains its structure while the constituent protons move through space and time. This capacity is coupled to a very small concentration of free protons (H 3 O + ), the hydronium ion, particularly in physiological systems. Whereas the concentration of H + in water is 110 M, the concentration of hydronium ions is ~40 nM. Only one proton in about a billion comprises H 3 O + at any given instant [3].\n\nThe average life time of the H 3 O + ion has been estimated by more than a dozen researchers to range between 0.24 to 3 ps with a median of ~1 ps. When this temporal parameter (10 -12 s) is multiplied by the ratio of the proton's magnetic moment and charge (0.88\u202210 -7 m 2 \u2022s -1 ), the resulting area is 8.8\u202210 -20 m 2 , or 2.97\u202210 -10 m (0.297 nm).\n\nThe actual distance between water molecules is usually measured as 2.9 A or 0.29 nm. In other words, the duration of the hydronium ion is coupled to the diffusivity of the dynamics of H 2 O.\n\nProton mobility in water, which is ~3.6\u202210 -7 m 2 \u2022V -1 \u2022s -1 [3], has been shown quantitatively to be related to the movement of photons through tissue, including the human brain [4] through a Grotthuss chain-like effect associated with free protons.",

In some dense molecular clouds, such as the Orion Nebula, water is one of the most abundant molecules following molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide [18]. The water density is ~10 7 molecules per m 3 with a typical abundance ratio of [H 2 O]/[H 2 ]~10 -5 . According to Neronov and Vovk [19] the strength of magnetic fields in galaxies and galactic clusters is in the order of 10 -10 T. According to equation (2) the energy from this intensity field within 1 m 3 of those molecules would be 5\u202210 -15 J, which is effectively the same value associated with the photons emitted from the water that had been exposed in the dark to the experimental magnetic fields. Given the demonstration of non-local, excess correlations (\"entanglement\") at substantial distances at the macrolevel for concentrations of H + in water [6] and between two single atoms [20], the issue of relative density may not be a critical factor that determines the interaction between interstellar water molecules.\n\n\nAPPLICATION TO HUMAN CEREBRAL FUNCTION\n\nIf the unit force associated with the product of the viscosity of water and the ratio of the proton's magnetic moment-to-charge is applied across the length of an average cerebrum (11 cm), then the intrinsic energy for that volume of mass is 8.66\u202210 -12 J. Within the volume of the human brain, of about 1.33\u202210 -3 m 3 , the \"energy density\" would be an average 6.5\u202210 -9 J\u2022m -3 . If each action potential is associated with a unit of energy of ~2\u202210 -20 J, then the numbers of these information-carrying events per implicit second could involve be ~3 \u202210 11 neurons. If each neuron was discharging at the known peak power of cerebral output of ~10 Hz, then the electromagnetic energy from these transient ion flows of 30 billion neurons would be accommodated. This estimate is within the order of magnitude of the numbers of neurons in the human cerebral cortices [21].",

The induction of exclusion zones whose properties differ from bulk water near surface boundaries and the emergence of coherent domains within radii within the 100 \u00b5m range that can \"trap\" applied magnetic fields that in turn alter the intrinsic photon emissions, create the condition for the operation of \"consciousness\" and other complex functions.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. When Schr\u00f6dinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schr\u00f6dinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Thus the solutions are just the Legendre functions with , and , . Moreover, eigenvalues and scattering data can be explicitly computed.

For convenience, the DMC forces and energies evaluated at the seven different bond lengths are called a set of data. For each set of data, statistical noise is added where the noise is obtained from a Gaussian distribution with a variance specified by one standard error of the DMC force and energy estimates. 10 5 different sets of data are generated in this manner and a Morse potential is fitted to these sets. The bond lengths and frequencies are obtained for all sets, they are averaged, and their statistical error bars are determined. Throughout this work, we use the convention that one standard error corresponds to a one-sigma confidence interval.\n\nFor the SiH molecule, Figure 3 shows different DMC force estimates defined in Eqs. (6)- (17) and evaluated at different bond lengths. For reference, this figure also shows the DMC energies which are simultaneously calculated with the forces. A Morse potential fitted to the energies is also plotted together with its gradient. The dotted vertical line indicates the zero-force geometry obtained from the DMC energy curve. This figure shows that the geometry obtained from the minimum of the potential energy curve agrees well with the zero-force geometry obtained from the pure DMC total force estimates.\n\nSince we investigate molecules containing H atoms and a heavier atom, one could obtain equilibrium bond lengths and vibrational frequencies from the forces on the H atoms alone. However, to test the force estimators on heavier atoms directly, we report bond lengths and frequencies obtained using both the zero-force condition on the H atom and on the heavier atoms. For SiH 4 , the estimates of the forces on the Si atom should be zero by symmetry and this condition is satisfied within a standard error of less than 0.001 a.u. Also, the symmetries of the H 2 and SiH 4 molecules imply that the force on each H atom should have the same magnitude. Since we found this to hold within statistical errors, we average symmetry-related components to further reduce the statistical error bar.  \n\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\n\nA. Definitions",

In addition, an algorithmic strategy based upon a canonical transformation to the dimensionless form applied to the force distribution associated with a potential is presented.

On the one hand, it is a very valuable ingredient since it constitutes a reliable reference and calibration tool to test the accuracy of our numerical approach. On the other hand, it brings out an alternative three-parameter model based on a generalized Morse potential that has a definite advantage over the standard two-parameter model.

Due to the simplicity of the regular Morse potential (it only has three adjustable parameters), it is very limited in its applicability in modern spectroscopy. The MLR potential is a modern version of the Morse potential which has the correct theoretical long-range form of the potential naturally built into it. It has been an important tool for spectroscopists to represent experimental data, verify measurements, and make predictions. It is useful for its extrapolation capability when data for certain regions of the potential are missing, its ability to predict energies with accuracy often better than the most sophisticated ab initio techniques, and its ability to determine precise empirical values for physical parameters such as the dissociation energy, equilibrium bond length, and long-range constants.

Bound statesSolving the eigenvalue problem requires an efficient method for computing matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we relax the restriction of a diagonal matrix representation for the Hamiltonian. Instead, we split our original Hamiltonian into two parts as H = H 0 + V where H 0 is the part of the Hamiltonian that could be treated analytically while the remaining part, V, is to be handled numerically. In dealing with the matrix representation of H 0 , we do not require it to be diagonal but only that it is Hermitian and tridiagonal. That is, the matrix elements of the reference wave operator should take the following form \u03c6 n |H 0 \u2212 E|\u03c6 m = (a n \u2212 z)\u03b4 n,m + b n \u03b4 n,m\u22121 + b n\u22121 \u03b4 n,m+1 , (1.1) where z and the coefficients {a n , b n } \u221e n=0 are real and, in general, functions of the energy, angular momentum, and potential parameters. Thus, this approach embodies the analytical power in dealing with the reference H 0 problem as well as the very accurate numerical quadrature approach [21] used in the evaluation of the potential matrix elements. In addition, we benefit from the existence of two different bases that support a tridiagonal matrix representation of the reference Hamiltonian. Each one has two parameters which will be tuned to enhance convergence, stability, and of course accuracy. For a given potential model, the choice of basis is made with an eye on these three computational characteristics.",

The celebrated empirical potential has witnessed many important applications in various branches, such as molecular physics, solidstate physics, chemical physics, etc [2,3]. This potential has been studied also in several other contexts. For example, its generalized and photon-added coherent states are discussed [4,5]; series solution for D-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation with More potential presented [6]; controllability with a compact group SU(2) put forth [7]; a series expansion solution of position-dependent mass is given [8]; a proper quantization rule where the energy spectra is determined only from its ground-state energy has been proposed [9]; also its momentum representation by hypergeometric function is suggested [10]. It is well known that, exact analytical results are available only for \u2113 = 0 states, while the rotational Morse oscillator states must be approximated. Thus over the years, a large number of attractive efficient methodologies have been developed for better understanding of this model potential employing a multitude of approximations.",

In fact, as shown in the figure, for each of the two potential shapes, the curves corresponding to the potentials with large scattering length, potentials II and III, are almost identical to each other. Furthermore, the curves for these two potentials corresponding to the Gaussian (thick curves) and Morse (thin curves) potentials are not very different. Only the cases corresponding to potential I give rise to curves clearly different to the other ones.\n\nThis result is consistent with the idea of relating universal properties of quantum systems to the presence of relative s-waves and large scattering lengths.

Because of the additional term and parameter, the vibrational levels of the GMP cannot be solved analytically, unlike the case for the MP. We present several numerical approaches for solving the vibrational problem of the GMP based on Galerkin methods, namely, the Laguerre Polynomial Method (LPM), the Symmetrized LPM, and the Polynomial Expansion Method (PEM), and apply them to the vibrational levels of the homonuclear diatomic molecules B<sub2</sub, O<sub2</sub, and F<sub2</sub, for which high level theoretical near full configuration interaction (CI) electronic ground state potential energy surfaces and experimentally measured vibrational levels have been reported.

For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 (deuterium), and hydrogen-3 (tritium) which have finite mass, the constant must be slightly modified to use the reduced mass of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron. This includes the kinetic energy of the nucleus in the problem, because the total (electron plus nuclear) kinetic energy is equivalent to the kinetic energy of the reduced mass moving with a velocity equal to the electron velocity relative to the nucleus. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, the electron mass and reduced mass are nearly the same. The Rydberg constant RM for a hydrogen atom (one electron), R is given by",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

Applications Red He-Ne lasers have an enormous number of industrial and scientific uses. They are widely used in laboratory demonstrations in the field of optics because of their relatively low cost and ease of operation compared to other visible lasers producing beams of similar quality in terms of spatial coherence (a single-mode Gaussian beam) and long coherence length (however, since about 1990 semiconductor lasers have offered a lower-cost alternative for many such applications).",

While working on the maser, Townes realized that more accurate detections were possible as the frequency of the microwave emitted increased. This led to an idea a few years later to use the visible and eventually the infrared ranges of light for spectroscopy that became a reality with the help of Arthur Schawlow.

It is important in basic sciences, but particularly in diagnosis and therapy of various pathologic conditions of human organism. It is electromagnetic radiation, not X-irradiation and, as such, it is not expected to produce new generation of iatrogenic malignancies. Laser falls between infrared and ultraviolet on the spectrum mainly in the visible light spectrum. Properties of laser light are: monochromacity (the same color), coherence (all of the light waves are in phase both spatially and temporally), collimation (all rays are parallel to each other and do not diverge significantly even over long distances). Lasers were first conceived by Einstein in 1917 when he wrote his \"Zur Quantum Theorie der Strahlung\" (the quantum theory of radiation) which enumerated concepts of stimulated and spontaneous emission and absorption. Drs. Arthur Schawlow and Charles Townes, in 1956, extended lasers into the optical frequency range and Maiman, in 1960, operated the first laser using ruby as the active medium (ruby laser). Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. To understand the acronym, it is necessary to understand the basic physics of the atom. However, if the atom that is in the excited state is struck by another photon of energy before it returns to the ground state, two photons of equal frequency and energy, travelling in the same direction and in perfect spatial and temporal harmony, are produced. This phenomenon is termed stimulated emission of radiation. An external power source hyperexcites the atoms in the laser medium so that the number of atoms possessing upper energy levels exceeds the number of atoms in a power energy level, a condition termed a population inversion. This \"pumping system\" which imparts additional energy to the atoms may be optical, mechanical, or chemical. These atoms in a hyperexcited state spontaneously emit photons of light. The laser chamber or optical cavity contains an active lasing medium which usually determines the name of each laser. There are four types of lasing material commonly employed. Solid state lasers use a solid matrix material such as a ruby crystal. Gas lasers use a gas or mixture of gases such as helium, argon, and CO2. Dye lasers employ a complex organic dye in liquid solution or suspension such as rhodamine. Semiconductor lasers use two layers of semiconductor substances such as gallium arsenide.",

This is often useful, and the values are characterized by the azimuthal quantum number (l) and the magnetic quantum number (m). In this case the quantum state of the system is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators L2 and Lz, but not of Lx or Ly. The eigenvalues are related to l and m, as shown in the table below.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within < 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps. Such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge Z which each electron sees, is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic \"bare\" helium nucleus.",

The uncertainties are much smaller than those of the best experimental results, and approximately one-fourth the uncertainty of our previous work. We have extended our results in temperature down to 2.6 K, incorporating the effect of spin statistics that become important below approximately 7 K. Results are given for both the (3)He and (4)He isotopes. We have also performed PIMC calculations of the third acoustic virial coefficient \u03b3 a; our calculated values compare well with the limited experimental data available. A correlating equation for C(T) of (4)He is presented; differentiation of this equation provides a reliable and simpler way of calculating \u03b3 a.",

Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as \"radioactivity\" by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. Later, in 1903, Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays by Ernest Rutherford, who named Villard's rays \"gamma rays\" by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899.

He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms. He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions. For any real number (taken to be radians), Euler's formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies A special case of the above formula is known as Euler's identity,",

But such a framework can be more compelling if it is underpinned by dynamical arguments, and we show how this can be provided by stochastic thermodynamics, where an explicit link is made between the production of entropy and the stochastic dynamics of a system coupled to an environment. The separation of entropy production into three components allows us to select a stationary state by maximizing the change, averaged over all realizations of the motion, in the principal relaxational or nonadiabatic component, equivalent to requiring that this contribution to the entropy production should become time independent for all realizations. We show that this recovers the usual equilibrium probability density function (pdf) for a conservative system in an isothermal environment, as well as the stationary nonequilibrium pdf for a particle confined to a potential under nonisothermal conditions, and a particle subject to a constant nonconservative force under isothermal conditions. The two remaining components of entropy production account for a recently discussed thermodynamic anomaly between over- and underdamped treatments of the dynamics in the nonisothermal stationary state.

DINS is a powerful technique which allows the measurement of the mass resolved momentum distributions of each atomic species [26]. This technique in particular is sensitive to zero point quantum energy effects, which can be particularly relevant for light elements such as hydrogen [27]. In fact this technique is well suited for the comparison with computational modelling techniques such as Path Integral Monte Carlo and forms of ab initio MD, but often falls short with comparisons to classical force-fields [28].

This area of the spectrum elucidates much of the bonding properties of the system [29,30], but gives limited information on the delocalised motion of each atom.

QENS operates on the \u03bceV-meV scales, which broadly translates to the pico-second time domain (this varies greatly instrument to instrument). QENS also typically probes length scales of a few angstroms, to a few nanometers.

At a basic level QENS measurements provide two key variables associated with the exchange of kinetic energy between the incident neutron, and the sample under study. The first variable is that of the momentum change of the neutron, and this can be related directly to the reciprocal space vector Q giving distance information. The second variable is the energy change E of the neutron, which gives information on the energetic modes present in the sample. In fact, formally what we gain access to is the dynamic structure factor of the material; S(Q, E), with some weighting parameters which are dependent on the interactions of the neutron and each atom in the system. The details of this interaction can be reduced to a simple coefficient called the neutron scattering cross-section, which is dependent on the atomic species in question (note this is also dependent on isotope). Furthermore, the dynamic structure factor may be broken down into a coherent contribution, and an incoherent contribution, which provides information on cross-correlations and self-correlations, respectively. One of the chief benefits of Neutron Spectroscopy is the fact that the incoherent neutron cross-section of a proton is extremely large compared to almost any other atomic scattering crosssection. X-ray scattering techniques on the other hand rely on the interaction of the incident radiation with the electron density of each atom. As a consequence atomic species which are electron deficient, as is the case for most organic molecules, have very weak scattering. The scattering cross-sections for x-ray and Neutron scattering are summarised in figure 1. The consequence of the high proton incoherent cross-section for neutron spectroscopy is that organic molecules, which are typically proton rich, will give signals originating overwhelmingly from the self-correlated motions of the protons (i.e. those associated with self-diffusion). Furthermore as these protons are typically connected in a pseudo-rigid molecule, we effectively have a frame of reference for the self motion of the molecule as a whole. One of the axiomatic assumptions for the analysis of many QENS experiments, is that the signal originates completely from incoherent scattering (incoherent approximation), and thus coherent signals can be totally neglected. This allows the application of many simple",

E.g. in crystals the atoms order in a regular fashion on wide ranges to form even gigantic highly ordered crystals (Naica Mine). However, in reality, crystals are never perfect and have impurities or defects, which means that a foreign atom resides on a lattice site or in between lattice sites (interstitials). These small defects and impurities cannot be seen by methods such as X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction, because these methods average in their nature of measurement over a large number of atoms and thus are insensitive to effects in local structure. Methods in nuclear spectroscopy use specific nuclei as probe. The nucleus of an atom is about 10,000 to 150,000 times smaller than the atom itself. It experiences the electric fields created by the atom's electrons that surround the nucleus. In addition, the electric fields",

In 1913-1914 Moseley tested the question experimentally by using X-ray diffraction techniques. He found that the most intense short-wavelength line in the X-ray spectrum of a particular element, known as the K-alpha line, was related to the element's position in the periodic table, that is, its atomic number, Z.

This causes turbulence and a vortex that sucks more air into its center, creating external afterwinds and cooling itself. The speed of its rotating slows down as it cools, and may stop entirely during later phases. The vaporized parts of the weapon and ionized air cool into visible gases, forming the early cloud; the white-hot vortex core becomes yellow, then dark red, then loses visible incandescence.

Experiments aimed at synthesizing elements ranging in atomic number from 110 to 127 were conducted at laboratories around the world. These elements were sought in fusion-evaporation reactions, in which a heavy target made of one nuclide is irradiated by accelerated ions of another in a cyclotron, and new nuclides are produced after these nuclei fuse and the resulting excited system releases energy by evaporating several particles (usually protons, neutrons, or alpha particles). These reactions are divided into \"cold\" and \"hot\" fusion, which respectively create systems with lower and higher excitation energies; this affects the yield of the reaction. For example, the reaction between 248Cm and 40Ar was expected to yield isotopes of element 114, and that between 232Th and 84Kr was expected to yield isotopes of element 126.

This approach may seem obvious by modern standards, but it is a significant step from the point of view of the history of summing divergent series. In the 18th century, the study of series was dominated by power series, and summing a numerical series by expressing it as f(1) of some function's power series was thought to be the most natural strategy. Leibniz begins by observing that taking an even number of terms from the series, the last term is \u22121 and the sum is 0: 1 \u2212 1 = 1 \u2212 1 + 1 \u2212 1 = 1 \u2212 1 + 1 \u2212 1 + 1 \u2212 1 = 0. Taking an odd number of terms, the last term is +1 and the sum is 1: 1 = 1 \u2212 1 + 1 = 1 \u2212 1 + 1 \u2212 1 + 1 = 1.",

The nitrogen rule is only true for neutral structures in which all of the atoms in the molecule have a number of covalent bonds equal to their standard valency (counting each sigma bond and pi bond as a separate covalent bond for the purposes of the calculation).

The name nitrog\u00e8ne was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in several languages, including French, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Portuguese and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.",

Some authors also use the term to refer to the maximum number of valencies observed for an element. On the basis of atomicity, molecules can be classified as: Monatomic \u2013 composed of one atom e.g. He, Ne, Ar, Kr (all noble gases are monatomic) Diatomic \u2013 composed of two atoms e.g. H2 , N2 , O2 , F2 , Cl2 (all halogens are usually diatomic) Triatomic \u2013 composed of three atoms e.g. O3 Polyatomic \u2013 composed of three or more atoms e.g. P4 , S8 All metals and some other elements, such as carbon, do not have a simple structure but consist of a very large and indefinite number of atoms bonded together.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Maxwell's equations, which are the complete set of laws of classical electromagnetism, describe light as waves: a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism. Eventually, however, the photon model became favored. One of the most significant pieces of evidence in its favor was its ability to explain several puzzling properties of the photoelectric",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The local mode theory is then reviewed, showing how local vibrational modes are derived from fundamental normal modes. New features are introduced that add to current theoretical efforts: (i) a unique measure of bond strength based on local mode force constants ranging from bonding in single molecules in different environments to bonding in periodic systems and crystals and (ii) a new way to interpret vibrational spectra by pinpointing and probing interactions between particular bond stretching contributions to the normal modes. All of this represents a means to work around the very nature of normal modes, namely that the vibrational motions in polyatomic molecules are delocalized. Three current focus points of the local mode analysis are reported, demonstrating how the local mode analysis extracts important information hidden in vibrational spectroscopy data supporting current experiments: (i) metal-ligand bonding in heme proteins, such as myoglobin and neuroglobin; (ii) disentanglement of DNA normal modes; and (iii) hydrogen bonding in water clusters and ice. Finally, the use of the local mode analysis by other research groups is summarized. Our vision is that in the future local mode analysis will be routinely applied by the community and that this Feature Article serves as an incubator for future collaborations between experiment and theory.",

Our testing set comprises 66 molecules and 1304 distinct vibrational modes. Harmonic vibrational frequencies are computed using an efficient analytical algorithm developed and coded by the authors. The obtained results are compared to experiment and to other theoretical findings. Scaling factor for the SCC-DFTB method, determined by minimization of mean absolute deviation of scaled frequencies, is found to be 0.9933. The accuracy of the scaled SCC-DFTB frequencies is noticeably better than for other semiempirical methods (including standard DFTB method) and approximately twice worse than for other well established scaled ab initio quantum chemistry methods (e.g., HF, BLYP, B3LYP). Mean absolute deviation for the scaled SCC-DFTB frequencies is 56 cm(-1), while standard deviation is 82 cm(-1), and maximal absolute deviation is as large as 529 cm(-1). Using SCC-DFTB allows for substantial time savings; computational time is reduced from hours to seconds when compared to standard ab initio techniques.",

We benchmark VHCI on four molecules with 12-48 degrees of freedom and use anharmonic potential energy surfaces truncated at fourth and sixth orders.

When an excitation energy is 500 cm\u22121, then about 8.9 percent of the molecules are thermally excited at room temperature. To put this in perspective: the lowest excitation vibrational energy in water is the bending mode (about 1600 cm\u22121).

If springs are considered Hookean, for example, equations of motion can readily be solved when force is proportional to the displacement and we can find that vibrational frequencies are associated with force constants and masses of atoms. For instance, in a simple molecule like CO where there is only one spring, the frequency is calculated as in Eq. (3).\n\u03bd \u00bc 1 2\u03c0 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi k=\u03bc q(3)\nwhere 1 \u03bc \u00bc 1 mc \u00fe 1 ma and k is the spring constant. The value of k can be computed from DFT calculations at equilibrium state, bond length k \u00bc \u2202 2 E \u2202x 2 . It is essential to perform geometry optimization prior to frequency calculations as these calculations are effective only at fixed points on the potential energy surface.\n\n\nCalculating second derivative of energy\n\nBefore calculating the second derivative of energy, the first step in quantum chemical calculations is optimization of molecular geometry. Vibrational frequency calculations are done after optimizing geometry by using the same method and basis set as used for calculating vibrational frequency. Model's development is constructed on spontaneously rational values for interbond angles, bond distances and dihedral angles in the absence of experimental data. It is usually done by solving the following Schrodinger wave equation [15]:\nb H el \u00fe V NN \u03a8 el \u00bc U\u03a8 el (4)\nwhere b H el is the one-electron Hamiltonian and V NN is the operator of potential energy between the nuclei of molecular system intended for numerous molecular geometries to discover equilibrium geometry of the molecule, i.e., geometry optimization.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Early speculation suggested that the resulting bomb would be the most powerful nuclear weapon yet to have been developed. American physicist Ernest Lawrence used the potential military applications of mesons to obtain funding for its synchrocyclotron built between 1940 and 1946 at the University of California, Berkeley. Soon, however, the scientific consensus was that construction of such a bomb would be impossible; and in 1968 physicist M. Stanley Livingston wrote that \"no responsible scientists would attempt to justify support in this field with predictions of an 'anti-matter engine,' or a super 'meson bomb,' or a 'hyper-drive' for spaceships.\"",

Unlike an electron, a proton is a composite particle consisting of three \"valence quarks\" and an indeterminate number of \"sea quarks\" bound by gluons. Thus, when a proton encounters an antiproton, one of its quarks, usually a constituent valence quark, may annihilate with an antiquark (which more rarely could be a sea quark) to produce a gluon, after which the gluon together with the remaining quarks, antiquarks, and gluons will undergo a complex process of rearrangement (called hadronization or fragmentation) into a number of mesons, (mostly pions and kaons), which will share the total energy and momentum.

Chem. Chem. Phys., 2014, 16, 6602]. In the present report, the capacity of the positively charged muon in forming its own AIM is considered in a large set of molecules replacing muons with all protons in the hydrides of the second and third rows of the Periodic Table. Accordingly, in a comparative study the wavefunctions of both sets of hydrides and their muonic congeners are first derived beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) paradigm, assuming protons and muons as quantum waves instead of clamped particles. Then, the non-BO wavefunctions are used to derive the AIM structures of both hydrides and muonic congeners within the context of the multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results of the analysis demonstrate that muons are generally capable of forming their own atomic basins and the properties of these basins are not fundamentally different from those AIM containing protons. Particularly, the bonding modes in the muonic species seem to be qualitatively similar to their congener hydrides and no new bonding model is required to describe the bonding of muons to a diverse set of neighboring atoms. All in all, the positively charged muon is similar to a proton from the structural and bonding viewpoint and deserves to be placed in the same box of hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This conclusion is in line with a large body of studies on the chemical kinetics of the muonic molecules portraying the positively charged muon as a lighter isotope of hydrogen. ",

When the Stark mixing rate is much larger than all other transition rates, the statistical population of the nl-sublevels is determined by the principle of detailed balance. The relative importance of the various cascade processes in muonic and pionic hydrogen is demonstrated in Figs. 2a,b.

They decided to start the first fraternity that was \"a fraternity in which all men were brothers, no matter what their religion; a fraternity in which ability, open-mindedness, farsightedness, and a progressive, forward-looking attitude would be recognized as the basic attributes.\" Chapters at other universities started soon after.

Young's double slit experiment demonstrates the dependence of interference on coherence, specifically on the first-order correlation. This experiment is equivalent to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the caveat that Young's double slit experiment is concerned with spatial coherence, while Mach-Zehnder interferometer relies on temporal coherence.

A large number of interference fringes with strong visibility have been observed using a single set of slits made of polished cylinders. For very small apertures, asymmetrical slits generate asymmetrical patterns. This pattern is calculated from the theory of electromagnetic field propagation and compared with experiment in the far-field regime. The use of guard slits to remove Fraunhofer diffraction from the beam-defining slits is treated theoretically. Numerical simulations yield the optimum aperture of the guard slits with respect to the distance to the primary slits.

We examine the roles played by the slit-width, by the film thickness, and by the real and imaginary parts of the host material's dielectric constant in determining the transmission efficiency. We also show that the slit's sharp edges can be rounded to eliminate highly-localized electric dipoles without significantly affecting the slit's throughput.

The quantum number represented the sense (positive or negative) of spin. The choice of the orientation of the magnetic field used in the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment is arbitrary. In the animation shown here, the field is vertical and so the atoms are deflected either up or down. If the magnet is rotated a quarter turn, the atoms are deflected either left or right.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

He also thought that an electron would be still attracted to the proton by Coulomb's law, which he had verified still held at small scales. As a result, he believed that electrons revolved around the proton. Niels Bohr, in 1913, combined the Rutherford model of the atom with the quantisation ideas of Planck. Only specific and well-defined orbits of the electron could exist, which also do not radiate light. In jumping orbit the electron would emit or absorb light corresponding to the difference in energy of the orbits. His prediction of the energy levels was then consistent with observation.",

Namely, \"how does one now explain the reality that system's here on Earth radiate blackbody radiation whose thermal signature cannot be approximated as some linear function of temperature?\"\n\nTemperature is a comparative based upon the Zeroth law.

WHAT IS THERMAL ENERGY?\n\nThermal energy resides within condensed matter, as both intermolecular vibrations that are between molecules, and intramolecular vibrations that are between the various atoms within a molecule. A better definition may be that thermal energy consists of a spectrum of thermal photons (thermal radiation) whose wavelengths are sufficiently long that they are readily absorbed by condensed matter plus any phonons that are associated with molecular vibrations (both inter and intra). Of course, a most rudimentary definition being that thermal energy is heat.\n\nHere on Earth, thermal energy primarily involves frequencies at, and/or close to the infrared spectrum with the emphasis on the \"thermal infrared\" [aka mid infrared: (3\u03bcm < \u03bb < 8\u03bcm)] and into the far infrared [aka long infrared (8\u03bcm < \u03bb < 15\u03bcm)].\n\nShorter wavelength photons, such as those in the near infrared (740nm < \u03bb < 3\u03bcm) and those considered as visible light (380nm < \u03bb < 740nm) can also contribute as thermal energy, e.g., when they are absorbed by matter. This absorbed energy becomes part of that matter's various vibrational energies. And this energy is generally, then reradiated as thermal photons, i.e., at a lower frequency (infrared) than the absorbed frequencies.\n\n\nVI. WHAT ABOUT BLACKBODY RADIATION?\n\nBlackbody radiation is theoretically limited to cavities within crystalline matter. Strangely, it is also association with radiation from both our Sun, and very hot molten metal, neither of which are crystalline.\n\nMoreover, both liquids and amorphous solids lack any crystalline structure, and yet it is accepted that the thermal energy resides. \"Is this not also blackbody?\"\n\nBased upon accepted theory one might argue that there is some profound difference between thermal energy and blackbody radiation beyond their associations with temperature. Yet when considering their heat capacities, all condensed matter fundamentally adheres to the same principles, e.g., the law of Dulong and Petit. It strikes this author as odd that crystalline solids thermally behave the same as amorphous solids, yet theoretically they are not theoretically considered the same it comes to their radiation.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nTraditionally in thermodynamics the notion of thermal energy lacks the precision of clarity. One considers temperature (T) as the parameter that relates to the kinematic motions at the molecular level in most matter. This actually forms the basis of statistical thermodynamics, as can be found in most contemporary books [1,2]. Statistical arguments are based upon the kinematics of matter, hence the bizarre notion that all vacuums have no temperature, has become accepted. When measuring a system's temperature, a thermometer is placed into thermal contact with that system. Thermal equilibrium occurs once the influx of thermal energy equals the efflux between both the thermometer, and the system. This actually forms the basis of the transitive property known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics which states that \"If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other\" [1, pg 282]. Intuitively, the third system may be considered a thermometer.",

Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 Macedonio Melloni demonstrated that black-body radiation could be reflected, refracted and polarised in the same way as light. James Clerk Maxwell's 1862 insight that both light and radiant heat were forms of electromagnetic wave led to the start of the quantitative analysis of thermal radiation. In 1879, Jo\u017eef Stefan observed that the total radiant flux from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and stated the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law. The law was derived theoretically by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1884.",

It is important in basic sciences, but particularly in diagnosis and therapy of various pathologic conditions of human organism. It is electromagnetic radiation, not X-irradiation and, as such, it is not expected to produce new generation of iatrogenic malignancies. Laser falls between infrared and ultraviolet on the spectrum mainly in the visible light spectrum. Properties of laser light are: monochromacity (the same color), coherence (all of the light waves are in phase both spatially and temporally), collimation (all rays are parallel to each other and do not diverge significantly even over long distances). Lasers were first conceived by Einstein in 1917 when he wrote his \"Zur Quantum Theorie der Strahlung\" (the quantum theory of radiation) which enumerated concepts of stimulated and spontaneous emission and absorption. Drs. Arthur Schawlow and Charles Townes, in 1956, extended lasers into the optical frequency range and Maiman, in 1960, operated the first laser using ruby as the active medium (ruby laser). Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. To understand the acronym, it is necessary to understand the basic physics of the atom. However, if the atom that is in the excited state is struck by another photon of energy before it returns to the ground state, two photons of equal frequency and energy, travelling in the same direction and in perfect spatial and temporal harmony, are produced. This phenomenon is termed stimulated emission of radiation. An external power source hyperexcites the atoms in the laser medium so that the number of atoms possessing upper energy levels exceeds the number of atoms in a power energy level, a condition termed a population inversion. This \"pumping system\" which imparts additional energy to the atoms may be optical, mechanical, or chemical. These atoms in a hyperexcited state spontaneously emit photons of light. The laser chamber or optical cavity contains an active lasing medium which usually determines the name of each laser. There are four types of lasing material commonly employed. Solid state lasers use a solid matrix material such as a ruby crystal. Gas lasers use a gas or mixture of gases such as helium, argon, and CO2. Dye lasers employ a complex organic dye in liquid solution or suspension such as rhodamine. Semiconductor lasers use two layers of semiconductor substances such as gallium arsenide.",

If the star's distance is known, its overall luminosity can also be estimated. A comparison of the two figures yields the star's radius. Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius B and 40 Eridani B must be very dense. For example, when Ernst \u00d6pik estimated the density of some visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the Sun's, which was so high that he called it \"impossible\".",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. When Schr\u00f6dinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schr\u00f6dinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons. In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang. The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons.",

By giving the atom additional energy (for example, by the absorption of a photon of an appropriate energy), the electron is able to move into an excited state (one with one or more quantum numbers greater than the minimum possible). If the photon has too much energy, the electron will cease to be bound to the atom, and the atom will become ionized.",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

INTRODUCTION\n\nImportance of the exponentially varying Morse potential [1] in context of vibrationrotation states of diatomic molecules has been realized in an enormous amount of work ever since its inception about 85 years ago. The celebrated empirical potential has witnessed many important applications in various branches, such as molecular physics, solidstate physics, chemical physics, etc [2,3]. This potential has been studied also in several other contexts. For example, its generalized and photon-added coherent states are discussed [4,5]; series solution for D-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation with More potential presented [6]; controllability with a compact group SU(2) put forth [7]; a series expansion solution of position-dependent mass is given [8]; a proper quantization rule where the energy spectra is determined only from its ground-state energy has been proposed [9]; also its momentum representation by hypergeometric function is suggested [10]. It is well known that, exact analytical results are available only for \u2113 = 0 states, while the rotational Morse oscillator states must be approximated. Thus over the years, a large number of attractive efficient methodologies have been developed for better understanding of this model potential employing a multitude of approximations.",

On the one hand, it is a very valuable ingredient since it constitutes a reliable reference and calibration tool to test the accuracy of our numerical approach. On the other hand, it brings out an alternative three-parameter model based on a generalized Morse potential that has a definite advantage over the standard two-parameter model.

These often require a significant number of spatial grid points chiefly because of their uniform distributional nature. In the GPS method, however, a nonuniform optimal spatial discretization could be achieved efficiently as detailed below, maintaining similar kind of good accuracy at both small and large r regions. Therefore it requires much lesser grid points to reach convergence, compared to many other methods in the literature. One can have a denser mesh at smaller r while a coarser mesh at large r regions.

Bound statesSolving the eigenvalue problem requires an efficient method for computing matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we relax the restriction of a diagonal matrix representation for the Hamiltonian. Instead, we split our original Hamiltonian into two parts as H = H 0 + V where H 0 is the part of the Hamiltonian that could be treated analytically while the remaining part, V, is to be handled numerically. In dealing with the matrix representation of H 0 , we do not require it to be diagonal but only that it is Hermitian and tridiagonal. That is, the matrix elements of the reference wave operator should take the following form \u03c6 n |H 0 \u2212 E|\u03c6 m = (a n \u2212 z)\u03b4 n,m + b n \u03b4 n,m\u22121 + b n\u22121 \u03b4 n,m+1 , (1.1) where z and the coefficients {a n , b n } \u221e n=0 are real and, in general, functions of the energy, angular momentum, and potential parameters. Thus, this approach embodies the analytical power in dealing with the reference H 0 problem as well as the very accurate numerical quadrature approach [21] used in the evaluation of the potential matrix elements. In addition, we benefit from the existence of two different bases that support a tridiagonal matrix representation of the reference Hamiltonian. Each one has two parameters which will be tuned to enhance convergence, stability, and of course accuracy. For a given potential model, the choice of basis is made with an eye on these three computational characteristics.",

The condition that fits the modified potential for molecular description were deduced together with the expression for the screening parameter. The vibrational energies of SiC, NbO, CP, PH, SiF, NH and Cs 2 molecules were computed by inserting their respective spectroscopic constants into the calculated energy equation. It was shown that the calculated results for all the molecules agreement perfectly with the experimental RKR values.

Finally, the real Morse potential model was obtained as a special case of the modified shifted potential.The solutions of wave equations under different potential models are of great interest in sciences since the study of their solutions give the conceptual understanding in quantum systems. These solutions generate valuable means to check and improve models as well as numerical techniques developed to simplify complicated systems.

Plyler. The combined section, called Molecular Spectroscopy, was led by David Lide. Plyler had constructed what was probably the most advanced high-resolution infrared instrument in the world at that time and had brought in several young spectroscopists including Arthur Maki, Walter Lafferty (shown in Fig. 3), and Bruce Olson. This merger led to highly productive symbiosis between the microwave and infrared laboratories. A number of molecules were investigated in both spectral regions, yielding new information on vibrationrotation interactions.  Examples include:\n\n\u2022 HCN and DCN [62,63,64,65] \u2022 FCN [66] \u2022 ClCN [67] \u2022 N 2 O [68] \u2022 HCCCN [69] \u2022 CH 3 CN [69] \u2022 DCCD [70] \u2022 OCS [71,72] \u2022 OCSe [73] The work on HCN was notable in that it was used to explain the mechanism of far infrared laser action in HCN, which had been incorrectly attributed to the CN molecule [62,63]. This work led to other measurements that shed light on other gas phase laser transitions such as CS 2 [74] and DCN and other HCN laser transitions [64,65]. The HCN laser played a significant part in the 1972 measurement of the speed of light to unprecedented accuracy, a measurement that led to a new definition of the meter as the standard of length. In 1968 Lide received the NBS Stratton Award (see Fig. 4) with the citation: \"For outstanding research and distinguished authorship in the field of microwave spectroscopy\".",

This is particularly evident in the Q branches, which are the strongest, the lines usually denoted by Q (1), Q (3) and Q (5) being much more intense than the intervening lines Q (2) and Q (4). For some time I have had evidence which, though in some respects incomplete, pointed to the con clusion th at in any band the mean value of the intensities of any two consecutive odd-numbered lines such as Q (1) and Q (3) was nearly equal to three times the intensity of the intervening line such as Q (2).

Dennison solved this problem in 1927 by postulating that the spin of protons does not transition frequently during measurements. This new theory agreed precisely with experiments given that the proton's spin was 1/2. In 1932 Dennison and Uhlenbeck solved the two-minima \"reversing umbrella\" problem for the position of nitrogen in ammonia. This result predicted absorption at microwave wavelengths, which inspired Neal Williams to build a molecular microwave spectrograph, one of the first ever built.",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom. Bohr won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to our understanding of the structure of atoms and how that is related to line spectra emissions.",

The Bohr model posits that electrons revolve around the atomic nucleus in a manner analogous to planets revolving around the sun. In the simplest version of the Bohr model, the mass of the atomic nucleus is considered to be infinite compared to the mass of the electron, so that the center of mass of the system, the barycenter, lies at the center of the nucleus. This infinite mass approximation is what is alluded to with the subscript. The Bohr model then predicts that the wavelengths of hydrogen atomic transitions are (see Rydberg formula):",

The experimental results instead show that electrons are dislodged only when the light exceeds a certain frequency\u2014regardless of the light's intensity or duration of exposure. Because a low-frequency beam at a high intensity could not build up the energy required to produce photoelectrons, as it would have if light's energy were coming from a continuous wave, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but a swarm of discrete energy packets, known as photons.",

In quantum electrodynamics the electromagnetic field is quantized and, like the harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics, its lowest state is not zero. Thus, there exist small zero-point oscillations that cause the electron to execute rapid oscillatory motions. The electron is \"smeared out\" and each radius value is changed from r to r + \u03b4r (a small but finite perturbation). The Coulomb potential is therefore perturbed by a small amount and the degeneracy of the two energy levels is removed. The new potential can be approximated (using atomic units) as follows: The Lamb shift itself is given by with k(n, 0) around 13 varying slightly with n, and with log(k(n,)) a small number (approx. -0.05) making k(n,) close to unity.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature.
