Bond Strength: Covalent Bonds - \nTABLE 9.4\n\nThe bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of energy is required to break the bond. For the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule shown in Figure 5.2, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is $7.24 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$ lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number. However, as we will learn in more detail later, bond energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis.

Take methane, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, for instance. As we've seen, carbon has four valence electrons $\\left(2 s^{2} 2 p^{2}\\right)$ and forms four bonds. Because carbon uses two kinds of orbitals for bonding, $2 s$ and $2 p$, we might expect methane to have two kinds of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. In fact, though, all four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds in methane are identical and are spatially oriented toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, as shown previously in FIGURE 1.7. How can we explain this?\n\nAn answer was provided in 1931 by Linus Pauling, who showed mathematically how an $s$ orbital and three $p$ orbitals on an atom can combine, or hybridize, to form four equivalent atomic orbitals with tetrahedral orientation. Shown in FIGURE 1.11, these tetrahedrally oriented orbitals are called $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. Note that the superscript 3 in the name $s p^{3}$ tells how many of each type of atomic orbital combine to form the hybrid, not how many electrons occupy it.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.11 Four $s p^{3}$ hybrid orbitals, oriented toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, are formed by the combination of an $s$ orbital and three $\\boldsymbol{p}$ orbitals (red/blue). The $s p^{3}$ hybrids have two lobes and are unsymmetrical about the nucleus, giving them a directionality and allowing them to form strong bonds to other atoms.",

Calculations of this type will also tell us whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An exothermic reaction ( $\\Delta H$ negative, heat produced) results when the bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds in the reactants. An endothermic reaction ( $\\Delta H$ positive, heat absorbed) results when the bonds in the products are weaker than those in the reactants.\n\nThe enthalpy change, $\\Delta H$, for a chemical reaction is approximately equal to the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (energy \"in\", positive sign) plus the energy released when all bonds are formed in the products (energy \"out,\" negative sign). This can be expressed mathematically in the following way:\n\n$$\n\\Delta H=\\Sigma \\mathrm{D}_{\\text {bonds broken }}-\\Sigma \\mathrm{D}_{\\text {bonds formed }}\n$$",

The probability that the quantum particle will be found in the classically forbidden region is small. In the classically allowed region, meanwhile, the probability the quantum particle will be found in a given interval is approximately the fraction of time the classical particle spends in that interval over one period of motion. Since the classical particle's velocity goes to zero at the turning points, it spends more time near the turning points than in other classically allowed regions. This observation accounts for the peak in the wave function (and its probability density) near the turning points.

De Broglie also proposed that the wavelength \u03bb for a moving particle was equal to h/p where p is the particle's momentum. The period (one cycle of the wave) is equal to 1/f. This precise Compton periodicity of a matter wave is said to be the necessary condition for a clock, with the implication that any such matter particle may be regarded as a fundamental clock.

Bond Strength: Covalent Bonds - \nTABLE 9.4\n\nThe bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of energy is required to break the bond. For the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule shown in Figure 5.2, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is $7.24 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$ lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number. However, as we will learn in more detail later, bond energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires $7.24 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$ to break one $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond, but it takes $4.36 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~J}$ to break 1 mole of $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in Figure 5.2 and Table 9.3. We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table provides average values. For example, breaking the first $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond in $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ requires $439.3 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, while breaking the first $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond in $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5}$ (a common paint thinner) requires $375.5 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$.",

Molecular polarity results from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule. As a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar substances are insoluble in water.\n\nNet polarity is measured by a quantity called the dipole moment and can be thought of in the following way: assume that there is a center of mass of all positive charges (nuclei) in a molecule and a center of mass of all negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don't coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.\n\nThe dipole moment, $\\mu$ (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge $Q$ at either end of the molecular dipole times the distance $r$ between the charges, $\\mu=Q \\times r$. Dipole moments are expressed in debyes $(\\mathrm{D})$, where $1 \\mathrm{D}=3.336 \\times 10^{-30}$ coulomb meters ( $\\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$ ) in SI units. For example, the unit charge on an electron is $1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. Thus, if one positive charge and one negative charge are separated by 100 pm (a bit less than the length of a typical covalent bond), the dipole moment is $1.60 \\times 10^{-29} \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$, or 4.80 D .\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mu=Q \\times r \\\\\n& \\mu=\\left(1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}\\right)\\left(100 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1 \\mathrm{D}}{3.336 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{~m}}\\right)=4.80 \\mathrm{D}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

Protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms. Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, and each has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, they are both referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. The chemical properties of an atom are mostly determined by the configuration of electrons that orbit the atom's heavy nucleus. The electron configuration is determined by the charge of the nucleus, which is determined by the number of protons, or atomic number. The number of neutrons is the neutron number. Neutrons do not affect the electron configuration, but the sum of atomic and neutron numbers is the mass of the nucleus.",

Neutrons, which are electrically neutral, stabilize the nucleus in two ways. Their copresence pushes protons slightly apart, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, and they exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on protons. For this reason, one or more neutrons are necessary for two or more protons to bind into a nucleus. As the number of protons increases, so does the ratio of neutrons to protons necessary to ensure a stable nucleus (see graph at right). For example, although the neutron:proton ratio of is 1:2, the neutron:proton ratio of is greater than 3:2. A number of lighter elements have stable nuclides with the ratio 1:1 (Z = N). The nuclide (calcium-40) is observationally the heaviest stable nuclide with the same number of neutrons and protons. All stable nuclides heavier than calcium-40",

Entropy and Microstates - \nFollowing the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates ( $W$ ) possible for the system. A microstate is a specific configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The relation between a system's entropy and the number of possible microstates is\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nAs for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final ( $S_{\\mathrm{f}}$ ) and initial $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ values:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=S_{\\mathrm{f}}-S_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{f}}-k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\n\nFor processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the entropy of the system increases and $\\Delta S>0$. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}<W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, yield a decrease in system entropy, $\\Delta S<0$. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.\n\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of $N$ particles distributed among $n$ boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is $n^{N}$. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in $2^{4}=16$ different microstates as illustrated in Figure 12.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)",

Beta particles $\\left({ }_{-1}^{0} \\beta\\right.$, also represented by the symbol $\\left.{ }_{-1}^{0} \\mathrm{e}\\right)$ are high-energy electrons, and gamma rays are photons of very high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Positrons $\\left({ }_{+1}^{0} \\mathrm{e}\\right.$, also represented by the symbol $\\left.{ }_{+1}^{0} \\beta\\right)$ are positively charged electrons (\"anti-electrons\"). The subscripts and superscripts are necessary for balancing nuclear equations, but are usually optional in other circumstances.

Entropy and Microstates - \nFollowing the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates ( $W$ ) possible for the system. A microstate is a specific configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The relation between a system's entropy and the number of possible microstates is\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nAs for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final ( $S_{\\mathrm{f}}$ ) and initial $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ values:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=S_{\\mathrm{f}}-S_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{f}}-k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\n\nFor processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the entropy of the system increases and $\\Delta S>0$. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}<W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, yield a decrease in system entropy, $\\Delta S<0$. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.\n\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of $N$ particles distributed among $n$ boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is $n^{N}$. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in $2^{4}=16$ different microstates as illustrated in Figure 12.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)",

Beta particles $\\left({ }_{-1}^{0} \\beta\\right.$, also represented by the symbol $\\left.{ }_{-1}^{0} \\mathrm{e}\\right)$ are high-energy electrons, and gamma rays are photons of very high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Positrons $\\left({ }_{+1}^{0} \\mathrm{e}\\right.$, also represented by the symbol $\\left.{ }_{+1}^{0} \\beta\\right)$ are positively charged electrons (\"anti-electrons\"). The subscripts and superscripts are necessary for balancing nuclear equations, but are usually optional in other circumstances.

This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of energy is required to break the bond. For the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule shown in Figure 5.2, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is $7.24 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$ lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number. However, as we will learn in more detail later, bond energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis.

The nucleus consists of subatomic particles called neutrons, which are electrically neutral, and protons, which are positively charged. Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a distance of approximately $10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$. Thus, the diameter of a typical atom is about $2 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$, or 200 picometers (pm), where $1 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$. To give you an idea of how small this is, a thin pencil line is about 3 million carbon atoms wide. Although most chemists throughout the world use the International System (SI) of units and describe small distances in picometers, many organic chemists and biochemists in the United States still use the unit angstrom ( $\\AA$ ) to express atomic distances, where $1 \\AA=100 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

For example, a carbon atom weighs less than $2 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~g}$, and an electron has a charge of less than $2 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ (coulomb). When describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the atomic mass unit (amu) and the fundamental unit of charge (e). The amu was originally defined based on hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu . (This isotope is known as \"carbon-12\" as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of one carbon-12 atom: $1 \\mathrm{amu}=1.6605 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~g}$. (The Dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative units that are equivalent to the amu.) The fundamental unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of an electron (e) with $\\mathrm{e}=1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.",

Such estimation is based on perturbation theory analysis. Therefore, CISD calculations with the Davidson correction included are frequently referred to as CISD(Q). Application The Davidson correction is very popular due to its low computational cost. The correction improves the contribution of electron correlation to the energy. The size-consistency and size-extensivity problems of truncated CI are alleviated but still exist.

Some of these inequalities generalize and improve previous results for the symmetric division deg index. In addition, we computationally apply the $ SDD_\\alpha(G) $ index on random graphs and we demonstrate that the ratio $ \\langle SDD_\\alpha(G) \\rangle/n $ ($ n $ is the order of the graph) depends only on the average degree $ \\langle d \\rangle $.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

An atomic orbital is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most probable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is based on solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.\n\nAnother quantum number is $l$, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take the values, $l=0,1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have only one value of $l, l=0$, whereas $n=2$ permits $l=0$ and $l=1$, and so on. Whereas the principal quantum number, $n$, defines the general size and energy of the orbital, the secondary quantum number 1 specifies the shape of the orbital. Orbitals with the same value of $l$ define a subshell.",

The Third Law of Thermodynamics - \nThe previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K ). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal ( $W=1$ ). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero.\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W=k \\ln (1)=0\n$$\n\nThis limiting condition for a system's entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.\n\nCareful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance's entropy and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions. Standard entropies ( $\\boldsymbol{S}^{\\circ}$ ) are for one mole of substance under standard conditions (a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 298.15 K ; see details regarding standard conditions in the thermochemistry chapter of this text).

Its moment is directed up (in the positive direction of the $z$ axis) for the $\\frac{1}{2}$ spin quantum number and down (in the negative $z$ direction) for the spin quantum number of $-\\frac{1}{2}$. A magnet has a lower energy if its magnetic moment is aligned with the external magnetic field (the left electron on Figure 3.23) and a higher energy for the magnetic moment being opposite to the applied field. This is why an electron with $m_{s}=\\frac{1}{2}$ has a slightly lower energy in an external field in the positive $z$ direction, and an electron with $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$ has a slightly higher energy in the same field.
