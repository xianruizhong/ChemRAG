All of them 1) are proportional to the nuclear spin I and 2) have strong singularity. The similar nature of these operators leads to a suggestion that the calculations depend very little on their specific form. It allows us to expect that the relative contributions of different many-body parts of calculations will remain approximately the same for all operators. As we will show below this suggestion is fully justified.\n\n\nA. Electron-nucleon P,T-odd interactions",

For this purpose we have used the correlation consistent polarized weighted core-valence triple zeta (cc-pwCVTZ) basis set of Koput and Peterson [11]. To assess the convergence with basis set of the calculated core-valence contribution, we performed single point calculations at the equilibrium bond separation for the ground state with a larger basis set (cc-pwCVQZ). The effect of increasing the basis set from TZ to QZ changed the core-valence energy by ∼ 8 cm −1 at the R e of the B 2 Σ + g state. These results indicate that the core-valence contribution to the total energy is adequately converged with the TZ basis sets.",

II, suggesting that the FM phase is energetically more favored than the PM phase. Evidence for soft ferromagnetism, consistent with the well-localized bands and strong Coulomb repulsion we find, has recently appeared in experiments [8]. In the spin-polarized orbital projections shown in Fig. 13, 14, the quasi-flat bands of Cu near E f have a large spin-splitting of about 0.6 eV, while the bands of trigonal-O have negligible spin-splitting. The calculated magnetic moment is about 0.6 µ B for Cu and small moments for O atoms surrounding Cu which sum to about 0.3 µ B in total, in agreement with the fact that the two flat bands near E f in the PM phase also have about 30% weight from O. We also calculate the total energy of the A-type antiferromagnetic phase (AFM), i.e., FM inplane and AFM out of the plane, as shown in Table. II.

Based on this observation we estimate the accuracy of the In certain cases it is possible to impose additionally the constraints on the strength of the couplings for protons and neutrons. Below we will obtain such constraints for a simple case of the spherical shell model of a nucleus. This model describes well the nuclei of 129 Xe and 199 Hg. The former contains a neutron in the s 1/2 state and the latter contains a neutron in the p 1/2 state above the closed shells. Although the nuclei in the atoms have a valence neutron it is possible to deduce also the proton contribution to the total nuclear spin using the information on the nuclear magnetic moments. If we assume that the magnetic moment of the nucleus is composed entirely from the spin magnetic moment of the valence neutron and spin magnetism of polarized nuclear core, then As is seen from Table VIII the contribution of the proton spin into the total nuclear spin of 129 Xe is as high as 30%, and therefore the proton couplings C p T and C p P (see the equations below Eq. (5)) are also limited in the experiments searching for the EDM. For 199 Hg the limit on the proton couplings is 10 times weaker than the limit on the neutron couplings. Note that the simple shell model of a nucleus considered above is hardly applicable to the nuclei of 171 Yb, 211 Rn, and 225 Ra. The problem is that the nucleus of 171 Yb is quadrupole-deformed and the nuclei of 211 Rn and 225 Ra are octupole-deformed. For this reason more sophisticated nuclear models are required for a proper description of these nuclei.\n\n\nVI. CONCLUSION",

For this purpose we have used the correlation consistent polarized weighted core-valence triple zeta (cc-pwCVTZ) basis set of Koput and Peterson [11]. To assess the convergence with basis set of the calculated core-valence contribution, we performed single point calculations at the equilibrium bond separation for the ground state with a larger basis set (cc-pwCVQZ). The effect of increasing the basis set from TZ to QZ changed the core-valence energy by ∼ 8 cm −1 at the R e of the B 2 Σ + g state. These results indicate that the core-valence contribution to the total energy is adequately converged with the TZ basis sets.",
