The basic assumption is that each vibration can be treated as though it corresponds to a spring. In the harmonic approximation the spring obeys Hooke's law: the force required to extend the spring is proportional to the extension. The proportionality constant is known as a force constant, k. The anharmonic oscillator is considered elsewhere. By Newton's second law of motion this force is also equal to a reduced mass, μ, times acceleration. Since this is one and the same force the ordinary differential equation follows. The solution to this equation of simple harmonic motion is A is the maximum amplitude of the vibration coordinate Q. It remains to define the reduced mass, μ. In general, the reduced mass of a diatomic molecule, AB, is expressed in terms of the atomic masses, mA and mB, as",

Definition In materials of high atomic number (e.g. W, U, Pu) the electrons of energies >~10 MeV predominantly lose energy by bremsstrahlung, and high-energy photons by pair production. The characteristic amount of matter traversed for these related interactions is called the radiation length , usually measured in g·cm−2. It is both the mean distance over which a high-energy electron loses all but of its energy by bremsstrahlung, and of the mean free path for pair production by a high-energy photon. It is also the appropriate length scale for describing high-energy electromagnetic cascades. The radiation length for a given material consisting of a single type of nucleus can be approximated by the following expression: , where is the atomic number and is mass number of the nucleus.

The minima for the potentials on the Planck brane and TeV brane are different and causes the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to change throughout the fifth dimension. This configuration generates a potential for the radion causing it to have a vacuum expectation value and a mass.

Consequently, Gaussian functions are also associated with the vacuum state in quantum field theory. Gaussian beams are used in optical systems, microwave systems and lasers. In scale space representation, Gaussian functions are used as smoothing kernels for generating multi-scale representations in computer vision and image processing. Specifically, derivatives of Gaussians (Hermite functions) are used as a basis for defining a large number of types of visual operations.",

To construct the full quantum spin operator of light, longitudinal polarized photon modes have to be introduced.",

Note that the NDDO approximation is still in effect, and that only a few of the possible TERIs are explicitly computed. The values of the explicit TERIs are scaled using empirically-derived functions to obtain experimentally relevant results. One-center two-electron repulsion integrals (OCTEs) are derived initially to reproduce atomic properties. These values are then fixed and carried forward as further elemental parameterization proceeds. The performance of SAM1 for C, H, O, N, F, Cl, Br, and I was claimed to be superior to other semiempirical methods. Especially noteworthy were the smaller systematic errors for heats for formation. .

Note that it says nothing about the intensity for scattering or the displacement of the atoms of the adsorbate, but its total dipole moment is the operator in the matrix element. This is important as a vibration of the atoms parallel to the surface can also cause a vibration of the dipole moment normal to the surface. Therefore, the result in the \"dipole scattering\" section above is not exactly correct.",

It treats the vibrations of the atomic lattice (heat) as phonons in a box, in contrast to the Einstein model, which treats the solid as many individual, non-interacting quantum harmonic oscillators. The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity, which is proportional to – the Debye T 3 law. Just like the Einstein model, it also recovers the Dulong–Petit law at high temperatures. But due to simplifying assumptions, its accuracy suffers at intermediate temperatures.",

One could, for instance, allow only single and double excitations from some strongly occupied subset of active orbitals, or restrict the number of electrons to at most 2 in another subset of active orbitals.

The key point is that individual eigenstates can show patterns of order that may be invisible to thermodynamic averages over eigenstates. Indeed, a thermodynamic ensemble average isn't even appropriate in MBL systems since they never reach thermal equilibrium. What's more, while individual eigenstates aren't themselves experimentally accessible, order in eigenstates nevertheless has measurable dynamical signatures. The eigenspectrum properties change in a singular fashion as the system transitions between from one type of MBL phase to another, or from an MBL phase to a thermal one---again with measurable dynamical signatures.",

The key point is that individual eigenstates can show patterns of order that may be invisible to thermodynamic averages over eigenstates. Indeed, a thermodynamic ensemble average isn't even appropriate in MBL systems since they never reach thermal equilibrium. What's more, while individual eigenstates aren't themselves experimentally accessible, order in eigenstates nevertheless has measurable dynamical signatures. The eigenspectrum properties change in a singular fashion as the system transitions between from one type of MBL phase to another, or from an MBL phase to a thermal one---again with measurable dynamical signatures.",

Like all other properties of a quantum particle, angular momentum is quantized, meaning it can only equal certain discrete values, which correspond to different rotational energy states. When a particle loses angular momentum, it is said to have transitioned to a lower rotational energy state. Likewise, when a particle gains angular momentum, a positive rotational transition is said to have occurred. Rotational transitions are important in physics due to the unique spectral lines that result. Because there is a net gain or loss of energy during a transition, electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency must be absorbed or emitted.

For gold with Z = 79, v ≈ 0.58c, so the 1s electron will be moving at 58% of the speed of light. Plugging this in for v/c in the equation for the relativistic mass, one finds that mrel = 1.22me, and in turn putting this in for the Bohr radius above one finds that the radius shrinks by 22%. If one substitutes the \"relativistic mass\" into the equation for the Bohr radius it can be written It follows that",

The particle is in a bound state because of the presence of the strong interaction potential. It will constantly bounce from one side to the other, and due to the possibility of quantum tunneling by the wave through the potential barrier, each time it bounces, there will be a small likelihood for it to escape.

The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an integral over all possible modes with representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in momentum space. In mathematical terms, we say that is the Fourier transform of and that x and p are conjugate variables. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.

The oxygen atoms form a bipartite lattice: they can be divided into two sets, with all the neighbors of an oxygen atom from one set lying in the other set. Focus attention on the oxygen atoms in one set: there are N/2 of them. Each has four hydrogen bonds, with two hydrogens close to it and two far away. This means there are allowed configurations of hydrogens for this oxygen atom. Thus, there are 6N/2 configurations that satisfy these N/2 atoms. But now, consider the remaining N/2 oxygen atoms: in general they won't be satisfied (i.e., they won't have precisely two hydrogen atoms near them). For each of those, there are possible placements of the hydrogen atoms along their hydrogen bonds, of which six are allowed. So, naively, we would expect the total number of configurations to be Using Boltzmann's principle, we conclude that",

It is one of the minor but noticeable components of the atmospheres of all the giant planets, with abundances from about 30 ppm to about 200 ppm.
