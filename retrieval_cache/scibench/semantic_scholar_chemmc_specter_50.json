The typical range of E for many organic molecules is also shown. From the plot, it is obvious that the approximation that Im(γ res ) dominates γ T K3 I is not a good one for most values of E; and, in the range of typical E, γ I is smaller than Im(γ res ) by as much as a factor of 3. Clearly, there are big differences between the two at various values of E. For example, while γ T K3 I remains well behaved and goes to zero at E → 1, Im(γ res ) diverges. Furthermore, while γ T K3 I = 0 at E = 1/2, Im(γ res ) ≈ −4×10 −43 cm 6 eV −1 . We conclude that γ T K3 I can not be approximated on or near double resonance by Im(γ res ). For the typical values of E that are found in organic molecules, the two are -on average -different by and Im(γres) as a function of E, with parameters that are typical for organic molecules: X = 0.5, E10 = 2eV , Γ10 = Γ20 = 0.1eV , and N = 1. a factor of 3.",

The potassium-39 isotope atoms are predominant (93.3%). In figure 1 we show the level diagram of the D 1 line (770.1 nm) of potassium-39. The ground level frequency splitting is smaller than the Doppler width of the optical transitions (0.77 GHz at 300 K). The spectrum of potassium is much less studied than those of Na, Rb, and Cs. Several features distinguish K from the other alkali atoms; in particular, the hf ground-state splitting is smaller than the Doppler width. Thanks to this fact, the hf transitions starting from a single ground level are completely overlapped. Moreover, the hf components from both the ground state levels cannot be spectrally resolved. As a result, the crossover (CO) resonances that involve both ground state levels, being negligible for Cs and Rb and suppressed for Na, are usually dominant for K [5].   \n\n\nExperimental setup",

A very successful and easyto-implement model is the Drude free-electron model of a metal (33). This model of a metal is likely a good approximation to relate reflectance to fundamental properties of a metal. A recent band structure analysis of the I4 1 /amd space group by Borinaga et al. (9) shows that for this structure, electrons in SMH are close to the freeelectron limit, which supports the application of a Drude model. The Drude model has two parameters, the plasma frequency w p and the relaxation time t. The plasma frequency is given by w 2 p ¼ 4pn e e 2 =m e , where m e and e are the electron mass and charge and n e is the electron density. The complex index of refraction of MH is given by N 2 H ¼ 1−w 2 p =ðw 2 þ jw=tÞ, where w is the angular frequency of the light. The MH is in contact with the stressed diamond that has an index of refraction N D ; this has a value of~2.41 in the red region of the spectrum at ambient conditions. We measured reflectance RðwÞ ¼ jðN D −N H Þ=ðN D þ N H Þj 2 as a function of energy or (angular) frequency w. We used a least-squares fit to the corrected reflectance data to determine the Drude parameters at 5 K, 32.5 ± 2.1 eV, and Dias \n\n\nRESEARCH |",

This author's calculations appear to show that the relation R K = h/e 2 is not exact but should be written as R K = (h/e 2 )[1 + C], where the correction C is due to vacuum polarization and is given by C = −(2/45)(α/π)(B/B 0 ) 2 . Here B is the magnetic flux density applied to the quantum Hall effect device and B 0 = 2πc 2 m 2 e /he ≈ 4.4 × 10 9 T. However, since B is generally no larger than 20 T, the correction, approximately −2 × 10 −21 , is vanishingly small and can be completely ignored. Further, Penin (2009) argues that because of the topological nature of the quantum Hall effect, there can be no other type of correction including finite size effects.\n\n\nIX. MEASUREMENTS INVOLVING SILICON CRYSTALS\n\nExperimental results obtained using nearly perfect single crystals of natural silicon are discussed here, along with a new result for N A with a relative standard uncertainty of 3.0 × 10 −8 obtained using highly-enriched silicon. For this material, x( 28 Si) ≈ 0.999 96, compared to x( 28 Si) ≈ 0.92, for natural silicon, where x( A Si) is the amount-of-substance fraction of the indicated isotope.\n\nThe new N A result (see Sec. IX.F below), as well as much of the natural silicon data used in the current and previous CODATA adjustments, were obtained as part of an extensive international effort under way since the early 1990s to determine N A with the smallest possible uncertainty. This worldwide enterprise, which has many participating laboratories and is called the International Avogadro Coordination (IAC), carries out its work under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) of the CIPM.",

Josephson and quantum Hall effect relations\n\nThe theoretical and experimental evidence accumulated over the past 50 years for the Josephson effect and 30 years for the quantum Hall effect that supports the exactness of the relations K J = 2e/h and R K = h/e 2 has been discussed in the three previous CODATA reports and references cited therein. The vast majority of the experimental evidence for both effects over the years comes from tests of the universality of these relations; that is, their invariance with experimental variables such as the material of which the Josephson effect and quantum Hall effect devices are fabricated. However, in both the 2002 and 2006 adjustments, the input data were used to test these relations experimentally in an \"absolute\" sense, that is by comparing the values of 2e/h and h/e 2 = µ 0 c/2α implied by the data assuming the relations are exact with those implied by the data under the assumption that they are not exact. Indeed, such an analysis is given in this report in Sec. XIII.B.3. Also briefly discussed there is the \"metrology triangle.\" Here we discuss other developments of interest that have occurred between the closing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjustments.",

Panel (a) shows the so-called loss function, Im(−1/ε) [56], while panel (b) shows the imaginary part of the dielectric function, ε 2 [49]. The potassium concentration increases from MnPc over phase 1 to phase 2 and 3. Thicker lines depict the spectra for particular doped phases as described in the text.",

These complexes, which are assembled by several proteins creating circular pores through the membrane, operate quickly and precisely. KcsA is a potassium channel conducting K + ions with a high efflux rate (~10 7 -10 8 ions per second (MacKinnon, 2003) while selecting K + over Na + with a remarkable rate of 10 4 to 1 (Doyle et al., 1998). It is worth noting that the difference in atomic radii of K + and Na + is about 0.38 nm. In many ion-channel proteins, the flow of ions through the pore is controlled by a gate comprised of a selectivity filter activated by electrical, chemical, light, thermal and/or mechanical interactions. Following the determination of an atomic resolution structure of the bacterial KcsA channel by Jiang et al. (2003), doubt has been cast on the appropriateness of classical descriptions such as the \"snug-fit\" model (Noskov et al., 2004), which are unlikely to adequately explain such a subtle selectivity process. Recently, Vaziri and Plenio (2010) and Ganim et al. (2011) put forth a quantum coherence mechanism for the operation of a selectivity filter and investigated quantum vibrational excitations in K + ion-channels. They calculated resonant effects at the picoseconds (ps) scale taking place in the backbone amide groups and concluded that they play an important role in mediating ion-conduction and ion-selectivity processes selectivity filter. Summhammer et al. (2012) also carefully studies the interaction of a single potassium ion within the surrounding carbonyl dipoles by solving the Schrödinger equation for the bacterial KcsA ionchannel and analyzing its solutions. They discovered that alkali ions could become highly delocalized in the selectivity filter region even at temperatures as high as the physiological temperature. Eccles (1992, 2003) investigated the neurotransmitter release process occurring in the neuronal synapses and proposed that it is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. They further suggested that this process involves quantum mechanical tunneling. They also stated that quantum indeterminacy into neurotransmitter release mechanisms would provide a means for the emergence of the human free will of action. In particular, a quantum process involved",

Peculiar plasmon dispersion in potassium intercalated picene\n\nIn the next section we present measurements on a recently reported organic superconductor, potassium doped picene [54]. Picene (C 22 H 14 ) is a molecule that consists of five benzene rings arranged in a zigzag like manner and forms a herringbone, monoclinic crystal structure, similar to other aromatic molecules [55].\n\nThe addition of potassium results in a charge transfer of the outer s electrons to the picene molecules, i. e., a doping of the molecular crystal. For such crystals superconductivity has been reported with a transition temperature up to 18 K [54], which is rather high as compared to many other doped molecular crystals or charge transfer salts. The only molecular materials that shows superconductivity at higher temperatures are the fullerides, the discovery of which represented a breakthrough in the field of superconductivity [56,57].\n\nnorm. Intensity (arb. units) We have successfully prepared thin films of K 3 Picene for EELS investigations as described in [58]. Upon potassium addition to picene, various changes in the electronic excitation spectrum are induced. This is outlined in the left panel of Fig. 7. These data are taken with a small momentum transfer q of 0.1Å −1 , which represents the optical limit. For undoped picene, we can clearly identify maxima at about 3.3, 4.6, 6.4, and 7.3 eV, which are due to excitations between the occupied and unoccupied electronic levels [22,59] and which recently have been well reproduced using density functional based calculations [59]. Note that the spectra in Fig. 7  Kronig analysis of the measured spectra as describe in [60], we can attribute this low energy spectral feature to a collective plasmon excitation of potassium doped picene.",

For smaller ε, W ε (x) results reflect the real portions of S(x) and are thus essentially unimodal Gaussians centered on the corresponding values of x 0 . As ε increases, this initial unimodal density tends to increase in width and then ultimately to develop a structure that reflects the underlying stationary phase regions of the problem.\n\nThe sharpness of the resulting stationary phase feature(s) varies with ε, being most highly focused when the ε length scale matches the natural width(s) of those region(s).\n\nThe ε-dependence of the SPMC density is conveniently summarized by the associated information entropy. Shown in Fig. (2), for example, are plots of the information entropy for the densities of the system described in Fig. (1a) for λ = -16 and -25 as a function of the SPMC length scale, ε. The increases in entropy visible in the small ε regions of Fig. (2) correspond to the broadening of the initial unimodal Gaussian densities centered at x 0 .\n\nAs ε continues to increase, the information entropies peak, go through minima, and ultimately increase as the initial unimodal densities first split, sharpen, and then broaden.\n\nThe peak in the information entropy as a function of ε thus serves as a rough indicator of the ε value for which the SPMC importance function begins to reflect qualitatively the inherent stationary phase character of the problem, roughly 0.2 for the systems in Fig. (2).",

Another approach is through zonal polynomials, developed by Constantine, James and others, see for example James (Annals of Mathematics, 74(1961), 456-469) and Constantine (Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 34(1963Statistics, 34( ), 1270Statistics, 34( -1285)).In this definition a general hypergeometric function with r upper parameters and s lower parameters is defined as follows:\nr F s (X) = r F s (a 1 , ..., a r ; b 1 , ..., b s ; X) = ∞ k=0 K (a 1 ) K ...(a r ) K (b 1 ) K ...(b s ) K C K (X) k!

(1.1) is complex. A major one is the choice of an importance function. A tempting choice is the modulus, |exp(-S)|. However, the (potentially) highly oscillatory nature of the integrand means that the important regions of the integrand are no longer dictated exclusively by |exp(-S)|, but by a competition between that modulus and the stationary phase regions of the problem. Stationary Phase Monte Carlo (SPMC) techniques, described in detail elsewhere, 5-7 have been developed for dealing with complex averages. Briefly summarized, these approaches are based on the observation that there exists a group of transformations of integrands that leave the value of the associated integrals unchanged. Specifically, for integrals over an infinite or periodic domain and which converge sufficiently rapidly such that orders of integration can be interchanged, integrals of a function and of its convolution with an arbitrary probability density are equal. That is, given a function f(x)\n\n\n(3.3) by (3.4) is valid, but large enough that the irrelevant, non-stationary phase regions are suppressed and the important regions emphasized.

Together with some other, closely related polynomials, the Θ n (z) are called Bessel polynomials.

The so-called B function was introduced by Filter and Steinborn as an anisotropic generalization of the reduced Bessel function (Eq. (2.14) of [92]), where α > 0 and n ∈ Z. Because of the factorial (n + ℓ)! in the denominator, B functions are defined in the sense of classical analysis only if n + ℓ ≥ 0 holds. However, the definition of a B function remains meaningful even for n + ℓ < 0. If r = 0, B m −n−ℓ,ℓ (r) with n ∈ N is zero, but for r = 0, its value is ∞/∞ and therefore undefined. In fact, such a B function can be interpreted as a derivative of the three-dimensional Dirac delta function (Eq. (6.20) of [113]):",

For smaller ε, W ε (x) results reflect the real portions of S(x) and are thus essentially unimodal Gaussians centered on the corresponding values of x 0 . As ε increases, this initial unimodal density tends to increase in width and then ultimately to develop a structure that reflects the underlying stationary phase regions of the problem.\n\nThe sharpness of the resulting stationary phase feature(s) varies with ε, being most highly focused when the ε length scale matches the natural width(s) of those region(s).\n\nThe ε-dependence of the SPMC density is conveniently summarized by the associated information entropy. Shown in Fig. (2), for example, are plots of the information entropy for the densities of the system described in Fig. (1a) for λ = -16 and -25 as a function of the SPMC length scale, ε. The increases in entropy visible in the small ε regions of Fig. (2) correspond to the broadening of the initial unimodal Gaussian densities centered at x 0 .\n\nAs ε continues to increase, the information entropies peak, go through minima, and ultimately increase as the initial unimodal densities first split, sharpen, and then broaden.\n\nThe peak in the information entropy as a function of ε thus serves as a rough indicator of the ε value for which the SPMC importance function begins to reflect qualitatively the inherent stationary phase character of the problem, roughly 0.2 for the systems in Fig. (2).",

(1.1) is complex. A major one is the choice of an importance function. A tempting choice is the modulus, |exp(-S)|. However, the (potentially) highly oscillatory nature of the integrand means that the important regions of the integrand are no longer dictated exclusively by |exp(-S)|, but by a competition between that modulus and the stationary phase regions of the problem. Stationary Phase Monte Carlo (SPMC) techniques, described in detail elsewhere, 5-7 have been developed for dealing with complex averages. Briefly summarized, these approaches are based on the observation that there exists a group of transformations of integrands that leave the value of the associated integrals unchanged. Specifically, for integrals over an infinite or periodic domain and which converge sufficiently rapidly such that orders of integration can be interchanged, integrals of a function and of its convolution with an arbitrary probability density are equal. That is, given a function f(x)\n\n\n(3.3) by (3.4) is valid, but large enough that the irrelevant, non-stationary phase regions are suppressed and the important regions emphasized.

Together with some other, closely related polynomials, the Θ n (z) are called Bessel polynomials. They are applied in such diverse fields as number theory, statistics, and the analysis of complex electrical networks [142]. The so-called B function was introduced by Filter and Steinborn as an anisotropic generalization of the reduced Bessel function (Eq. (2.14) of [92]), where α > 0 and n ∈ Z. Because of the factorial (n + ℓ)! in the denominator, B functions are defined in the sense of classical analysis only if n + ℓ ≥ 0 holds. However, the definition of a B function remains meaningful even for n + ℓ < 0. If r = 0, B m −n−ℓ,ℓ (r) with n ∈ N is zero, but for r = 0, its value is ∞/∞ and therefore undefined. In fact, such a B function can be interpreted as a derivative of the three-dimensional Dirac delta function (Eq. (6.20) of [113]):",

To demonstrate concavity, we first note that\n( 1 + (1 − ) 2 ) = ( 1 ) + (1 − ) ( 2 )\nholds by the linearity of ↦ → ( ).

Concavity of the ground-state energy is thus an immediate consequence of the Rayleigh-Ritz variation principle and of the linearity of the Hamiltonian in the external potential. We note that the proof of concavity does not carry through for excited states (except for the lowest state of each symmetry) since the Rayleigh-Ritz minimization is then subject to orthogonality constraints that depend on the external potential, precluding the inequality in Eq.

We assume that the reader is skilled in operating in Hilbert spaces. To deepen in the field of Hilbert spaces we recommend the book by Debnath and Mikusińki [21]. If the reader needs a brief review of the main concepts required for understanding this paper, we may recommend Nielsen and Chuang's Quantum Computing book [22]. It is also required some basic knowledge about infinitesimal calculus, like integration, derivation, and the resolution of simple differential equations, To help the readers, we have made a glossary of the most used mathematical terms. It can be used also as a checklist of terms the reader should be familiar with.\n\n\nGlossary:\n\n• H represents a Hilbert space, usually the space of pure states of a system.\n\n• |ψ ∈ H represents a vector of the Hilbert space H (a column vector).\n\n• ψ| ∈ H represents a vector of the dual Hilbert space of H (a row vector).\n\n• ψ|φ ∈ C is the scalar product of vectors |ψ and |φ .\n\n• |||ψ || is the norm of vector |ψ . |||ψ || ≡ ψ|ψ .\n\n• B(H) represents the space of bounded operators acting on the Hilbert space B : H → H.\n\n• 1 H ∈ B(H) is the Identity Operator of the Hilbert space H s.t. 1 H |ψ = |ψ , ∀|ψ ∈ H.\n\n• |ψ φ| ∈ B(H) is the operator such that (|ψ φ|) |ϕ = φ|ϕ |ψ , ∀|ϕ ∈ H.\n\n• O † ∈ B(H) is the Hermitian conjugate of the operator O ∈ B(H).\n\n• U ∈ B(H) is a unitary operator iff U U † = U † U = 1.\n\n• H ∈ B(H) is a Hermitian operator iff H = H † .",

For example, when a scalar is added to the potential, the energy changes linearly, in the manner ↦ → ( + ) = ( ) + where is the number of electrons. Also, we have ( ) = 0 for all repulsive potentials ≥ 0, thereby violating strict concavity. There may be more ways in which strict concavity is violated, but these two violations can easily be explored by a one-dimensional model. In Figure 1.4, we have plotted a model energy E : R → (−∞, 0] that is linear on [−1, −1/2] with slope 3/2 and linear on [0, +∞) with slope 0.

The emissivity ϵ (λ, T) describes the spectral emittance of a blackbody as a function of wavelength and temperature, whereby the limit ϵ (λ, T) = 1 represents the case of an ideal blackbody radiator. Typical blackbody emitters are the Nernst glower and the globar, whereby either a ceramic rod (e.g., SiC) or a tungsten filament, respectively, are resistively heated.\n\nEven though thermal emitters are inexpensive, the emitted radiation-central wavelength and radiant intensitycan only be controlled by the temperature of the emitter element. Figure 1 shows the blackbody radiation of an ideal emitter and the temperature dependence of the emitted radiation in terms of wavelength. This dependence renders thermal emitters for specific applications in the fingerprint region (e.g., 6-15 µm) of limited utility, as for this spectral regime a thermal emitter would have to be operated at room temperature, and thus would have only low emissivity. To overcome these limits, one may refer to Kirchhoff's law of radiation. Kirchhoff's law states that the emissivity of a blackbody radiator at a given temperature and wavelength is equal to the ratio of emissivity ϵ and absorptivity α at that same wavelength and temperature constant:\n\nwhere R is the reflectivity, T the transmissivity and θ the angle of incidence of the light. Thus, following from Kirchhoff's law an adequate absorber must also be an adequate blackbody emitter, which can be exploited for the development of advanced thermal emitters. Despite evident progress in light source technology, a large number of the systems reported to date are based on either a change of a specific property of a natural material or a temperature change, and are, therefore, limited by operation at high temperatures, a limited operating frequency, or a slow modulation speed.",

The peak intensity varies significantly across the spectral range as a result of the spectral variation of the supercontinuum source. The integration time is changed at every wavelength during measurements to maintain a fixed reference intensity.\n\nThe alternative broadband light source consist of a white LED (Luxeon LXHL-MW1D) (see Fig. 2) with an emission spectrum covering the range from 400 nm to 700 nm as shown in Fig. 3. This source is not filtered.\n\nFor all phosphor plates, we measured the transmission spectra with both the narrowband and the broadband light source to check the consistency in the spectral range where both methods can be applied (λ ≤ λ l and λ ≥ λ r ). For the broadband light source the total transmission is obtained by normalizing the measured spectrum I(λ) to a reference spectrum I 0 (λ) measured in the absence of a sample. For the narrowband light source the total transmission is determined as the ratio of the transmitted intensity I(λ i ) and a reference intensity I 0 (λ i ) without the sample at the designated wavelength λ i that is set with the monochromator. The total transmission is reproducible to within a few percent points on different measurements with different light sources.\n\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\n\nA. Transmission measurements",

The apparatus was baked out in the usual w ay ; then the anode was heated bright red-hot in a good vacuum. At this temperature beryllium oxidizes readily in the gas given off by itself and it was found that, after heating, the plate, which was originally polished, was covered with a faint yellowish film. The excitation curve was taken and it was found that, for the first time, no trace of the peaks A, B or C was visible. The curve is given in fig. 5, curve I. A very thin film of beryllium was then evaporated on to the plate and the result, curve II, shows the peaks rather weakly. With a thicker layer of beryllium, curve III, the peaks had resumed their normal magnitude. The anode was now heated red-hot in the vacuum; the surface still looked perfect, but as curve IV shows the peaks are con siderably reduced in strength. Finally the beryllium plate was heated with a small pressure of air in the apparatus (pressure about 5 • 10\" 5 mm.). The surface now showed considerable signs of oxidation. Curve V was very similar to curve I in that the peaks had gone. I t may probably be fairly claimed that these experiments establish the fact that the peaks A, B, C are due to clean metallic beryllium. We also have come to the interesting conclusion that the K-excitation curve for metallic beryllium is quite different from that of beryllium in the form of the oxide. It is true th at curves I and V, fig. 5, are not quite alike ; but one must remember that the oxide is a good insulator and so it may be hard to obtain reproducible results. Also it is difficult to say what the true break-potential is as one does not know what correction to apply for contact voltages, etc. I t seems there fore best to leave the experimental value uncorrected. From curve I we obtain the value 115 volts, from curve V the value 117 volts.",

Silicon carbide rods which are resistively heated and commonly known as a Globar.An electric current is passed through the rod which becomes very hot (1300 K) and emits large amounts of IR radiation.Previously, cooling with water was required to avoid damaging electrical components; however, advances in metal alloys have led to the production of Globars that do not require cooling by water.2. Nichrome and Kanthanl wire coils were once popular IR sources and did not require cooling as they ran at lower temperatures than Globars, however, this also resulted in lower amounts of IR radiation being emitted.3. Nernst Glowers are manufactured from a mixture of refractory oxides and are capable of reaching hotter temperatures than a Globar; however, they are not capable of producing IR radiation above 2000 cm -1 .\n\n\nInterferometer\n\nThe first interferometer was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson, who received a Nobel Prize for his work in 1907.Without this essential piece of optical equipment the modern day FTIR system would not exist.The interferometer consists of a beam splitter, a fixed mirror, and a moving mirror.\n\n\nBeam Splitter\n\nThe beam splitter is made of a special material which transmits half of the incident radiation and reflects the other half.IR radiation from the source strikes the beam splitter and is separated into two beams.One beam is transmitted through the beam splitter to the fixed mirror while the other beam is reflected from the beam splitter to the moving mirror.Both mirrors reflect the radiation back to the beam splitter where the two beams interfere to produce an interferogram.\n\n\nMoving Mirror\n\nThe moving mirror is a flat highly reflective surface mounted on air bearings that allow for high speed movement of the mirror (movements are made once every millisecond).The moving mirror only moves a few millimeters away from the beam splitter.\n\n\nFixed Mirror\n\nThe fixed mirror is a flat highly reflective surface.\n\n\nLaser\n\nMany instruments employ a Helium-Neon laser as an internal wavelength calibration standard.It is imperative that the position of the moving mirror is known at any given moment.The moving mirror moves back and forth at a precise constant velocity that is timed using a very accurate laser wavelength.",

BerylliumActually, when the material of the photoelectric sphere was changed from copper to nickel, it was decided to banish copper completely from the apparatus. It was noticed that under certain conditions copper in the form of a compound has a tendency to be distilled about the apparatus during the bake-out. The copper anode A was therefore replaced by one of nickel. This had a beryllium plate let into the nickel holder, because it seemed desirable to investigate the behaviour of beryllium metal without distillation; the holder was so shaped that no appreciable amount of radiation could reach the photocell from the nickel parts.\n\nMost of the more accurate experiments were carried out with the apparatus with a tungsten filament, a nickel photoelectric cell, and the remaining parts entirely of nickel, tungsten and molybdenum. The anode was not externally heated as in the experiments with lithium ; it was allowed to take up its equilibrium temperature in the neighbourhood of the filament. With the tungsten filament and nickel anode, the working temperature of the anode was possibly 200° or 300° C. With the dull-emitter and copper anode, the temperature was very little above that of the room. No investigation was carried out to determine whether this temperature change had any effect on the soft X-ray curves ; but it is certain that the main characteristics of the curves are uninfluenced by it.",

The mechanism of the revealed upconversion is not completely clear at the moment and needs further detailed studies. It should be noted that there are some indications of TTA rather than TPA mechanism in the phenomenon observed. First, the revealed upconversion takes place upon excitation with the low-power photons, which is characteristic of the TTA mechanism. For example, the double monochromator of  a uorimeter in our experiments provides sample illumination by monochromatic light with power of the order of 0.1 W cm À2 at best, whereas excitation of TPA requires power of >10 6 W cm À2 . Second, the formation of aggregates to facilitate the observed upconversion emission was found to be necessary, suggesting that the intermolecular energy transfer takes place in the system. Third, the revealed anti-Stokes shi (which varies from 0.62 to 0.94 eV, Fig. 4) is of a similar value to that reported for typical upconversion systems with the TTA mechanism (i.e., from $0.4 to 0.9 eV (ref. 7)).",

Figure 7(a) shows that the steepest slope appears at the wavelength λ=460 nm, which corresponds to the peak of the absorption curve. The maximum absorption cross section is σ abs =30 µm 2 , which agrees reasonably well with the typical measured absorption cross section for YAG : Ce +3 of the order of 10 µm 2 (Ref. 13, 37-41). Figure 7(b) shows the extracted normalized absorption spectrum of µ a for the polymer plates with different phosphor concentrations. All absorption curves are normalized to their maximum, and they coincide with each other within a few percent points. Absorption mean free path l abs scales linearly with the phosphor concentration. All absorption curves tend to zero outside 400 < λ < 530 nm.\n\nIn Fig. 7(b) we also compare the shape of the absorption curve of the phosphor in powder form that was used to manufacture the samples to µ a curves. The black dot-dashed line shows absorption spectra of the YAG : Ce +3 in powder. These two sets of data were normalized to their maxima, so the positions of maximums of these two graphs coincide. The µ a spectrum appear to have broader tails compared to the YAG : Ce +3 in powder form. The absorption spectra of YAG : Ce +3 in powder has a FWHM=54 nm, that is 10 nm smaller than the FWHM of the measured absorption spectra. One possible reason is that light is multiply internally reflected in the YAG : Ce +3 particles 13 , so particles can not be treated as an independent point scatterers.",

The wavelength of the incident light was varied from 230 to 700 nm with a bandwidth of 20 nm. Light from a Hamamatsu lamp (150 W) was routed to the cantilever by means of a glass fiber cable, the output of which was fixed perpendicularly to the cantilever at a distance of 2 cm. The power output from the glass fiber cable was measured with an ORION/PD powermeter (Ophir, North Logan, Utah, USA) at 5 nm intervals. The built-in PMT of a wavelength-calibrated JASCO fluorescence spectrometer was used to compare power output at different wavelength settings. At wavelengths 230-700 nm, the relative intensities of power output determined by the powermeter on one hand and by the PMT on the other hand, were in good agreement. Measurements above 700 nm were not included in the analysis, because the measurements of relative power output diverged between the two methods.\n\nFigure 1 :\n1Fast deflection of microcantilever upon irradiation with visible light.

To correct these values in order to obtain the true break-potentials, we must take into account (1) the contact potential difference between the filament and the anode, and (2) the acceleration of the electrons in passing into the metal of the anode. As Richardson and Chalklin* have shown, these two corrections amount together simply to the addition of the work-function of the filament. So far as I am aware, this correction has not so far received any experimental confirmation. In fact, in a recent paper,* a failure to observe any change in the excitation point on changing from a thoriated filament with an effective work function of 2*6 volts to a tungsten filament with an effective work-function of 4*9 volts was reported. It is therefore of great interest that in these experiments on beryllium, a shift of all the measured excitation points of about 2*5 volts was observed when the tungsten filament was substituted for a dull-emitter. This can be seen in fig. 2, which shows the small section of the excitation curves for beryllium in which the changes of Ai/AV are most violent. The curves are direct plots of Aif AY in arbitrary units against V, measured from the centre of the filament, (a) for a tungsten filament and (6) for a dull-emitter.f I t is seen that the two curves are almost alike except for the shift due to the change of filament. The theoretical shift, assuming the work function of the dull-emitter to be about 2 volts, should be 2 • 9 volts. Thus the values for the break potentials, cor rected as described above, are within the limits of error independent of the nature of the filament. * Davies, Horton and Blundell, ' Proc. Roy. Soc.,' A, vol. 126, p. 668 (1930). f It happened that curve (a) was taken with a copper photocell and curve (6) with a nickel photocell. We have seen that the results are unaffected by this change, but to allow comparable variations in the ordinates of the two curves, we have divided those of curve (a) by a factor of two relative to those of curve (6).\n\n\n. 283",

Traditionalists claim that the act of placing a thermometer into the vacuum, is the act of giving that vacuum a temperature. Certainly, the energy associated with thermal radiation is generally minute, when compared to the thermal energy of molecular motions. Therefore, more often than not, ignoring a system's thermal radiation, enables one to still accurately calculate a system's total thermal energy. This does not mean that a vacuum has no temperature.\n\nWhen a spectrum of photons strikes matter, the photons are either, (a) reflected by the matter's surface, where Published on March 9, 2020. reflected visible spectrum photons give the matter its color, (b) transmitted through the matter, i.e., do not interact with the matter except for the photon's refraction, or (c) absorbed into the matter becoming molecular vibrations within that matter, i.e., thermal phonons.\n\nA blackbody is considered to be the perfect absorber, which is to say that all incident radiation is absorbed by the matter thus explaining its blackness, e.g., carbon black is considered as the perfect absorber, i.e., its absorptivity approaches unity. A perfect absorber by definition is also a perfect emitter, and this is Stewart's Law [3], i.e., a perfect emitter's emissivity also approaches unity. A graybody is a substance whose emissivity is less than unity.\n\n\nII. INTRODUCTION: BLACKBODY RADIATION\n\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total emitted power (P) is proportional to the matter's temperature to the fourth power, which is generally considered as being blackbody radiation [3]:\n= 4(1)\nwhere = emissivity = 2π 5 k 4 /15c 2 h 3 = 5.670400x10 -8 J/sm 2 k 4 , and A = surface area [4] The spectral radiancy gives the power emitted [ ( ) ] at each frequency ( ), [4]. Confusingly, the radiance (W/sr . m 2 ) (aka intensity) of a substance is the radiant flux emitted or received, by a surface in a given direction per unit solid angle per unit area. Irradiance is the power received per unit surface area with units being W/m 2 . And The spectral irradiance is the irradiance per unit wavelength or frequency.",

The so-called B function was introduced by Filter and Steinborn as an anisotropic generalization of the reduced Bessel function (Eq. (2.14) of [92]), where α > 0 and n ∈ Z. Because of the factorial (n + ℓ)! in the denominator, B functions are defined in the sense of classical analysis only if n + ℓ ≥ 0 holds. However, the definition of a B function remains meaningful even for n + ℓ < 0. If r = 0, B m −n−ℓ,ℓ (r) with n ∈ N is zero, but for r = 0, its value is ∞/∞ and therefore undefined.

As ε increases, this initial unimodal density tends to increase in width and then ultimately to develop a structure that reflects the underlying stationary phase regions of the problem.\n\nThe sharpness of the resulting stationary phase feature(s) varies with ε, being most highly focused when the ε length scale matches the natural width(s) of those region(s).\n\nThe ε-dependence of the SPMC density is conveniently summarized by the associated information entropy. Shown in Fig. (2), for example, are plots of the information entropy for the densities of the system described in Fig. (1a) for λ = -16 and -25 as a function of the SPMC length scale, ε. The increases in entropy visible in the small ε regions of Fig. (2) correspond to the broadening of the initial unimodal Gaussian densities centered at x 0 .\n\nAs ε continues to increase, the information entropies peak, go through minima, and ultimately increase as the initial unimodal densities first split, sharpen, and then broaden.\n\nThe peak in the information entropy as a function of ε thus serves as a rough indicator of the ε value for which the SPMC importance function begins to reflect qualitatively the inherent stationary phase character of the problem, roughly 0.2 for the systems in Fig. (2).",

Because the lowest zero is about 2.34, the asymptotic behavior already dominates for every zero. So far we have covered basics in most methods books, such as Arfken [36]. But now we approach this from a more modern viewpoint, which holds that often, with the right procedure, much more useful information can be extracted from such an expansion, especially in cases that occur in physical problems, i.e., functions that are solutions to relatively simple differential equations [30]. These methods might generically be called hyperasymptotics [35,37], and often begin with the 'asymptotics of the asymptotics', i.e., asking what is the behavior of c n for large n in Eq. 1. Knowing this, one can use a variety of techniques to approximate the rest of the sum to infinity, and extract features that are entirely missed in the definition given above. However, to take advantage of such techniques, one must be able to write the expansion to arbitrary order, and then deduce its behavior. In Fig. 1, we see the first two zeroes, at about 2.34 and 4.09. In Fig. 3, we plot both the magnitude of the correction and the magnitude of the error, on a log (base 10) scale, as a function of the order of the approximation, M , in Eq. 8. We see the generic nature of the asymptotic expansion. For small M , the additions are quite large. To zero order, the error is of order 0.02. As more terms are added, the magnitude of the additions becomes smaller, as does the error. But at M = 4, the magnitude of the correction is larger than that of M = 3, so 3 is the optimal truncation point. We see that indeed the error also begins to grow. For large M , the additions become so big that they dominate the error, so the two curves merge. Thus, with simple optimal truncation, our best possible estimate for the lowest zero is with M = 3.

If the electromagnetic field is \"trapped\" within the coherent domain one would 6 ILCPA Volume 21 expect more photon transmission and greater scatter to shift to the lower wavelengths as photons intrinsic to the water aggregates shift between states. This interpretation is consistent with the observations. If an effect is coupled to fundamental physical processes, then coupled intrinsic patterns should emerge. Spectral analyses of the variations in photon emissions through the water that had been exposed to the magnetic fields revealed spectral power densities that peaked at spectral frequencies ~0.1 and 0.2. These results are shown in Figure 2. The actual wavelength is obtained by dividing 1 by the spectral frequency; these values are 10 nm and 5 nm, respectively. The results indicate that there is a relative peak in spectral power density of the photon transmission through the water exposed to these magnetic fields that occurs every approximately 10 nm and 5 nm.\n\nThe latter value approximates Del Guidice and Preparata's [14] derivation that the radius R of the coherent domain within which an \"evanescent electromagnetic wave pulsates with the frequency ώ\", is = 3/8•λ, effectively one-half a wavelength.

This is a relevant value for several reasons. First, the quantum is within the same order of magnitude as the essential bond strengths within water associated with proton movements and with the hydrogen bond which determines the majority of aqueous properties. Secondly, the gravitational force between two potassium ions separated by the distance (11 nm) reflecting the density of the layer of these ions that defines the resting membrane potential, is (6.2 •10 -26 kg) 2 divided by (1.1 •10 -8 m) 2 multiplied by G (6.67•10 -11 m 3 kg -1 s -2 ), or, 4.1 •10 -46 International Letters of Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy Vol. 21 N.

The 10 nm shift is consistent with the more quantum-like phenomenon described by Del Giudice and Preparata [14]. They pursued the concept that above a given atomic density and below a specific temperature the Dicke Hamiltonian relation exhibited a spontaneous phase transition. Within this Superradiant Phase Transition (SPT) large classical electromagnetic fields become contained within arrangements of atomic \"networks\" and oscillate in phase with the atomic transitions between these specific states and the ground state.

The effect was only evident with 3 ms point durations but not with either 1 or 2 ms or 5 and 10 ms point durations. We have shown previously that 3 ms point durations are very likely to be associated with the intrinsic cosmological properties of the proton as inferred from Hubble's parameter [13].\n\nEmploying fluorescence spectrophotometry (Ultrospec 2100 pro uv visible spectrophotometer) with a stimulation wavelength of 250 nm we measured photon transmission over successive 1 nm wavelengths between 250 and 500 nm. An example of\n\n\nILCPA Volume 21\n\nthese results is shown in Figure 1. It shows the mean values of photon counts for triplicate replications for each successive 1 nm λ between 350 and 466 nm. The 10 nm shift to the longer wavelength occurred only in the water exposed to the < 0.3 to 0.6 µT fields but not to the more intense strengths. At this wavelength the shift of 10 nm is equivalent to a net change of 10 -20 J. One interpretation is that continuous application of this magnetic field pattern to spring water in darkness altered the intrinsic organization of the protons. This condition particularly affected the distribution of energy from the second shell hydrogen bonds that contribute to proton movements. If classic processes are assumed, then a shift occurred such that different vibrational phases within the ground state were produced by the maintained exposure to the magnetic field pattern.\n\nThat the quantitative shift in the wavelength (and intrinsic energy) reflects magnetic energy contained within the spring water from the magnetic field exposures can be estimated by quantification. The net increase in photon counts s -1 for the medium intensity field was ~100 ( Figure 1).\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPhoton counts from the fluorescence spectrophotometer over wavelengths through water that had been exposed to the high, medium, and low intensity magnetic fields in darkness.",

First it is the quantum of energy associated with the resting membrane potential produced by the electrical force between potassium ions each separated by about 11 nm over the surface of the membrane [2]. Second, this magnitude defines the energy associated with the effects of the net change in voltage of an action potential (~1.2•10 -1 V) on a unit charge.\n\nThird, the energy is within measurement error for the second shell hydrogen bonds (2.6 kcal•M -1 ) that have been shown to be primarily contributory to the capacity for proton mobility [3] within water.\n\nAs aptly articulated by Decoursey [3] the proton is unique among cations because it is interchangeable with the protons that form water. Consequently water maintains its structure while the constituent protons move through space and time. This capacity is coupled to a very small concentration of free protons (H 3 O + ), the hydronium ion, particularly in physiological systems. Whereas the concentration of H + in water is 110 M, the concentration of hydronium ions is ~40 nM. Only one proton in about a billion comprises H 3 O + at any given instant [3].\n\nThe average life time of the H 3 O + ion has been estimated by more than a dozen researchers to range between 0.24 to 3 ps with a median of ~1 ps. When this temporal parameter (10 -12 s) is multiplied by the ratio of the proton's magnetic moment and charge (0.88•10 -7 m 2 •s -1 ), the resulting area is 8.8•10 -20 m 2 , or 2.97•10 -10 m (0.297 nm).\n\nThe actual distance between water molecules is usually measured as 2.9 A or 0.29 nm. In other words, the duration of the hydronium ion is coupled to the diffusivity of the dynamics of H 2 O.\n\nProton mobility in water, which is ~3.6•10 -7 m 2 •V -1 •s -1 [3], has been shown quantitatively to be related to the movement of photons through tissue, including the human brain [4] through a Grotthuss chain-like effect associated with free protons.",

In some dense molecular clouds, such as the Orion Nebula, water is one of the most abundant molecules following molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide [18]. The water density is ~10 7 molecules per m 3 with a typical abundance ratio of [H 2 O]/[H 2 ]~10 -5 . According to Neronov and Vovk [19] the strength of magnetic fields in galaxies and galactic clusters is in the order of 10 -10 T. According to equation (2) the energy from this intensity field within 1 m 3 of those molecules would be 5•10 -15 J, which is effectively the same value associated with the photons emitted from the water that had been exposed in the dark to the experimental magnetic fields. Given the demonstration of non-local, excess correlations (\"entanglement\") at substantial distances at the macrolevel for concentrations of H + in water [6] and between two single atoms [20], the issue of relative density may not be a critical factor that determines the interaction between interstellar water molecules.\n\n\nAPPLICATION TO HUMAN CEREBRAL FUNCTION\n\nIf the unit force associated with the product of the viscosity of water and the ratio of the proton's magnetic moment-to-charge is applied across the length of an average cerebrum (11 cm), then the intrinsic energy for that volume of mass is 8.66•10 -12 J. Within the volume of the human brain, of about 1.33•10 -3 m 3 , the \"energy density\" would be an average 6.5•10 -9 J•m -3 . If each action potential is associated with a unit of energy of ~2•10 -20 J, then the numbers of these information-carrying events per implicit second could involve be ~3 •10 11 neurons. If each neuron was discharging at the known peak power of cerebral output of ~10 Hz, then the electromagnetic energy from these transient ion flows of 30 billion neurons would be accommodated. This estimate is within the order of magnitude of the numbers of neurons in the human cerebral cortices [21].",

The average pressure within the universe assuming a density of 1 proton per m 3 and the velocity of light in a vacuum is 1.44•10 -10 Pa [15]. The implicit velocity within water, assuming a density of 10 3 kg•m -3 is 1.44•10 -13 m 2 •s -2 or 3.79•10 -7 m•s -1 . The time required for this process to traverse a plasma membrane of 10 nm is ~26 msec. This is the average time involved with the recursive cerebral waves associated with consciousness.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe solutions for rational comparisons of quantitative values for universal constants of the proton within the context of the water and the presence of additional H + within this remarkable structure suggest that all of the major and apparently \"complex\" properties relevant to livings systems can be predicted from basic physical constants. The induction of exclusion zones whose properties differ from bulk water near surface boundaries and the emergence of coherent domains within radii within the 100 µm range that can \"trap\" applied magnetic fields that in turn alter the intrinsic photon emissions, create the condition for the operation of \"consciousness\" and other complex functions. Because the fundamental quantum of energy associated with the physical-chemical dynamics of protons in water are within the same order of magnitude (~10 -20 J) as the unit energy that could integrate energies distributed within all levels of space as well as gravitational-electromagnetic interactions, water on earth and within living systems, including the human brain, may reflect many of the intrinsic conditions within the universe at a local level.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2Mean (of triplicates) of spectral power density for the successive 1 nm increments of photon emissions\n\n\nwhere a = 9.6•10 -11 m (0.96 A) for the length of a single O-H bond, which is the radius of that dipole, δ is the viscosity of water, k = the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature.The quantification is:",

Assuming the total energy of the universe as ~10 69 J, which can be derived from a number of different approaches and assumptions [22], and the volume (based upon the current age) of ~10 78 m 3 , the average value within the whole set would be 10 -9 J•m -3 . Clearly the energy is not distributed homogeneously within spacetime. However if the average does reflect the units [23], similar to the observation that the plasma membrane's time-constant (~100 ms, or 10 Hz) of a typical neuronal system reflects the average temporal variation of the entire set (the cerebral cortices), then this convergence between available power density from the intrinsic energy from the physical-chemical bases of water applied across the length of the human cerebrum and the average density of all energy within the universe, including dark matter and energy, may have potential meaning.\n\nCerebral function, particularly within the cerebral cortices, is related to recursive productions of rostral-caudal waves of electromagnetic fields integrated over remarkably large cortical areas that are recreated every 20 to 25 ms. This \"40 Hz\" field is considered to be the primary correlate of consciousness [24].

In the tradition of Bohr and others [1] the basic properties of the unit particles, the electron and proton, should be reflected in the spatial and temporal characteristics of larger aggregates. Establishing the quantitative relationships between the properties of water, the primary constituent of living systems and the most voluminous solvent on the planet, and the fundamental constants that define the characteristics of matter may facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms and processes by which mass and energy interact within this medium. Here I present quantitative evidence that the basic physical units predict the major properties of water that define living systems and that the energies associated with these interactions could reflect universal constants. \n\n\nPROTON PROPERTIES AND THE UNIVERSAL QUANTAL UNIT\n\nDividing the magnetic moment of a proton (1.41•10 -26 A•m 2 ) by the unit charge (1.6•10 -19 A•s) displayed by a proton (or an electron) results in a term of diffusion which is 0.88•10 -7 m 2 •s -1 .

It can be described by the electromagnetic wave equation derived from Maxwell's equations [55]. Depending on the wavelength in ascending order, it can be classified into radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. In a vacuum, electromagnetic radiation, regardless of what kind, propagates at the same constant velocity c, the speed of light [55]. According to the wave-particle duality electromagnetic radiation carries quantized energy in the form of photons [56]. The energy E carried by a photon is proportional to the radiation's frequency and is given by E = hν where h is Planck's constant and ν the frequency of the radiation [57].\n\nLight from the Sun in the visible spectrum is the main natural source of electromagnetic radiation on Earth and absorbing photons from the Sun's radiation is the major primary resource of free energy for biological processes on Earth today. Since Earth's atmosphere is not transparent for gamma rays and ultraviolet rays [58], visible light is the window of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum with the highest frequency and thus the highest energy of individual photons that can reach the Earth's surface. Even on primitive Earth visible light at wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm provided 70 mW·cm -2 which was by far more energy than electromagnetic radiation of all other wavelengths could deliver [59], and light energy was presumably also the most abundant source of energy on the prebiotic Earth [60]. An organism's ability to transform the energy of photons from the Sun into biochemical energy in form of ATP is called phototrophy. If concomitantly CO 2 is reduced to form biomass this kind of phototrophy is termed photosynthesis [61]. The importance of photosynthesis to biology in general is impressively demonstrated by the notion \"big bang of evolution\" when its origin is mentioned [62]. The most abundant electron donor for photosynthesis is water and during this so called oxygenic photosynthesis the majority of atmospheric oxygen is produced [63]. In general, phototrophic organisms absorb photons of visible light from the Sun at many different wavelengths [64].",

When the two H + that organize the polarity of water are accommodated this is equivalent to 1.6•10 -20 J as a quantum per hydrogen unit. Because voltage is energy divided by charge (1.6•10 -20 J divided by 1.6•10 -19 A•s), the resulting intrinsic value would be 100 mV. This quantity is the median value for the potential difference generated between bulk water and interfacial water that has been attributed to the shell of protons that separate the boundaries.",

Precise coefficients of this order of magnitude are consistent with the mechanisms associated with proton (H +) mobility and duration of the hydronium atom. When applied to aggregate properties of water that involve exclusion zones defined by boundaries containing marked proton density and coherent domains within which specific patterns of applied magnetic fields can be contained for protracted periods, these intrinsic properties suggest that the major features of the cell plasma membrane and living systems can be accommodated by proton movements within water. Water exposed in the dark to weak magnetic fields displayed a ~10 nm shift in peak wavelength as measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Given the persistent emergence of 10 -20 J as a functional unit of energy across the universe, the physical significance of the interaction between weak, temporally patterned magnetic fields and the organization of water within astronomical and abiogenic contexts may have been underestimated.\n\nINTRODUCTION",

For convenience, the DMC forces and energies evaluated at the seven different bond lengths are called a set of data. For each set of data, statistical noise is added where the noise is obtained from a Gaussian distribution with a variance specified by one standard error of the DMC force and energy estimates. 10 5 different sets of data are generated in this manner and a Morse potential is fitted to these sets. The bond lengths and frequencies are obtained for all sets, they are averaged, and their statistical error bars are determined. Throughout this work, we use the convention that one standard error corresponds to a one-sigma confidence interval.\n\nFor the SiH molecule, Figure 3 shows different DMC force estimates defined in Eqs. (6)- (17) and evaluated at different bond lengths. For reference, this figure also shows the DMC energies which are simultaneously calculated with the forces. A Morse potential fitted to the energies is also plotted together with its gradient. The dotted vertical line indicates the zero-force geometry obtained from the DMC energy curve. This figure shows that the geometry obtained from the minimum of the potential energy curve agrees well with the zero-force geometry obtained from the pure DMC total force estimates.\n\nSince we investigate molecules containing H atoms and a heavier atom, one could obtain equilibrium bond lengths and vibrational frequencies from the forces on the H atoms alone. However, to test the force estimators on heavier atoms directly, we report bond lengths and frequencies obtained using both the zero-force condition on the H atom and on the heavier atoms. For SiH 4 , the estimates of the forces on the Si atom should be zero by symmetry and this condition is satisfied within a standard error of less than 0.001 a.u. Also, the symmetries of the H 2 and SiH 4 molecules imply that the force on each H atom should have the same magnitude. Since we found this to hold within statistical errors, we average symmetry-related components to further reduce the statistical error bar.  \n\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\n\nA. Definitions",

Bound statesThe S-wave ( = 0) Morse potential has been solved analytically [3,8] and its bound-state energy is given in a closed form. A brief derivation of this analytic result will be given below for two reasons. On the one hand, it is a very valuable ingredient since it constitutes a reliable reference and calibration tool to test the accuracy of our numerical approach. On the other hand, it brings out an alternative three-parameter model based on a generalized Morse potential that has a definite advantage over the standard two-parameter model. If we consider the case = 0 in equation (2.1), then the S-wave Schrödinger equation for the generalized Morse potential reads as follows,\n−h 2 2m d 2 dr 2 + D e e −2α( r r e −1) − 2β e −α( r r e −1) − E χ = 0, (3.1)\nwhere the potential strength D e > 0, the parameters α and r e are positive and β is a deformation parameter of the classical Morse potential. This equation has an exact analytic solution for the bound state energy spectrum. Its derivation goes as follows. If we let\nx = r/r e , E 0 =h 2 /mr 2 e , A = 2D e e α /E 0 , ε = 2E/E 0 , then equation (3.1) becomes d 2 dx 2 − A[e α e −2αx − 2β e −αx ] + ε χ = 0.

Bound statesSolving the eigenvalue problem requires an efficient method for computing matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we relax the restriction of a diagonal matrix representation for the Hamiltonian. Instead, we split our original Hamiltonian into two parts as H = H 0 + V where H 0 is the part of the Hamiltonian that could be treated analytically while the remaining part, V, is to be handled numerically. In dealing with the matrix representation of H 0 , we do not require it to be diagonal but only that it is Hermitian and tridiagonal. That is, the matrix elements of the reference wave operator should take the following form φ n |H 0 − E|φ m = (a n − z)δ n,m + b n δ n,m−1 + b n−1 δ n,m+1 , (1.1) where z and the coefficients {a n , b n } ∞ n=0 are real and, in general, functions of the energy, angular momentum, and potential parameters. Thus, this approach embodies the analytical power in dealing with the reference H 0 problem as well as the very accurate numerical quadrature approach [21] used in the evaluation of the potential matrix elements. In addition, we benefit from the existence of two different bases that support a tridiagonal matrix representation of the reference Hamiltonian. Each one has two parameters which will be tuned to enhance convergence, stability, and of course accuracy. For a given potential model, the choice of basis is made with an eye on these three computational characteristics.",

We may choose, for example, the value of V (x) in a nearby minimum or in the global one. In the classically inaccessible parts of Ω h we set V (x) = ∞, i.e. we allow no nodes there. The nodes are then chosen similiarly to [7], but using Figure 1 illustratesṼ (x) for a Morse potential. In 1-D and 2-D problems this approach should not pose serious difficulty, the \"hard\" potential regions and nearby minima may be identified by inspection of the potential surface. In higher dimensions potential surface geometry is not so easy to visualize, yet simple ways may still exist for modifying the choice of nodes and width parameters. We defer their discussion to section 5. [7], where Gaussian RBFs are used in Galerkin eigenvalue calculations, it is observed that accuracy improves as the global width parameter c is decreased until unstable calculations appear.\nV (x) instead of V (x).\n\nIn",

INTRODUCTION\n\nImportance of the exponentially varying Morse potential [1] in context of vibrationrotation states of diatomic molecules has been realized in an enormous amount of work ever since its inception about 85 years ago. The celebrated empirical potential has witnessed many important applications in various branches, such as molecular physics, solidstate physics, chemical physics, etc [2,3]. This potential has been studied also in several other contexts. For example, its generalized and photon-added coherent states are discussed [4,5]; series solution for D-dimensional Schrödinger equation with More potential presented [6]; controllability with a compact group SU(2) put forth [7]; a series expansion solution of position-dependent mass is given [8]; a proper quantization rule where the energy spectra is determined only from its ground-state energy has been proposed [9]; also its momentum representation by hypergeometric function is suggested [10]. It is well known that, exact analytical results are available only for ℓ = 0 states, while the rotational Morse oscillator states must be approximated. Thus over the years, a large number of attractive efficient methodologies have been developed for better understanding of this model potential employing a multitude of approximations.",

In particular r ∞ 1D and r ∞ 2D take the values 0.769 and 1.474, in units of b, for the Gaussian shape, and 1.478 and 3.128 for the Morse shape, respectively. This is a way to normalize the size of the bound state in the final dimension, d f , to the value corresponding to the potential, which, in principle, is expected to provide a universal connection between d and b ho . In fact, as shown in the figure, for each of the two potential shapes, the curves corresponding to the potentials with large scattering length, potentials II and III, are almost identical to each other. Furthermore, the curves for these two potentials corresponding to the Gaussian (thick curves) and Morse (thin curves) potentials are not very different. Only the cases corresponding to potential I give rise to curves clearly different to the other ones.\n\nThis result is consistent with the idea of relating universal properties of quantum systems to the presence of relative s-waves and large scattering lengths.

Since both the pathways and the connectivity are of interest here, we use a steepest descent technique for minimizations, employing analytic second derivatives, following Page and McIver. 30 Our algorithm for exploring the PES is similar to that used by Tsai and Jordan in a study of small Lennard-Jones and water clusters. 31 Starting from a known minimum:\n\n1.

INTRODUCTION\n\nEver since the early days of quantum mechanics, diatomic molecular potentials have received much attention due to their importance to describe intra-molecular and intermolecular interactions as well as atomic-pair correlations. Over the years, a large number of such potentials have been adopted in a multitude of physical/chemical problems. Since the literature is quite vast, here we mention a few prominent ones, such as generalized Morse, Mie, Kratzer-Fues, pseudoharmonic, non-central, deformed Rosen-Morse, generalized Woods-Saxon, Pöschl-Teller potential etc [1]. They have fundamental relevance and utility in quantum description of natural phenomena, processes and systems, not only in the 3D world, but also in non-relativistic and relativistic D-dimensional physics. This work focuses on generalized Kratzer (Kratzer-type) potential, which is a simple realistic zero-order model for describing the vibration-rotation motion of diatomic molecules. It has important properties like (i) correct asymptotic behaviour at r = 0 and r = ∞ (ii) exactly solvable for a given state with an arbitrary angular momentum (iii) allows the system to dissociate, which is forbidden for a harmonic oscillator-based model. The mixed energy spectrum of this potential contains both discrete and continuum parts, corresponding to bound and scattering states respectively. While bound-state wave functions have been widely used in studies related to molecular spectroscopy, latter states are important in the context of the photo-dissociation process, diatomic molecular scattering, radiative recombination in an atom-atom collision [2], etc. Recently its use as a universal potential for diatomic molecules has been reported in two excellent review articles [3,4]. Apart from these, this has also been heavily studied in molecular, chemical and solid-state physics, due to its general feature of true interaction energy as well as interatomic, inter-molecular and dynamical properties [5][6][7].\n\nIn recent years, there has been a burgeoning activity in studies related to informationtheoretic measures in quantum chemical systems. The delocalizing properties of electronic distribution that characterize the quantum states of these molecular potentials have been analyzed quite extensively by information theoretical tools such as Shannon entropy (S) [8],",

Attempts were made by Born and his assistants to discuss the stationary state energy levels of 'simple' non-trivial systems such as He, H + 2 , H 2 , H 2 O. The molecular species were tackled as problems in electronic structure, that is, as requiring the calculation of the energy levels for the electron(s) in the field of fixed nuclei as a calculation separate from the rotation-vibration of the molecule as a whole. Pauli gave a lengthy qualitative discussion of the possible Bohr orbits for the single electron moving in the field of two fixed protons in H + 2 but could not obtain the correct stationary states [32]. Nordheim investigated the forces between two hydrogen atoms as they approach each other adiabatically 6 in various orientations consistent with the quantum conditions. Before the atoms get close enough for the attractive and repulsive forces to balance out, a sudden discontinuous change in the electron orbits takes place and the electrons cease to revolve solely round their parent nuclei. Nordheim was unable to find an interatomic distance at which the energy of the combined system was less than that of the separated atoms; this led to the conclusion that the use of classical mechanics to discuss the stationary states of the molecular electrons had broken down comprehensively [33], [34]. This negative result was true of all the molecular calculations attempted within the Old Quantum Theory framework which was simply incapable of accounting for covalent bonding [35].",

At present the group at Yale has found a conveniently close vibrational level of the upper 3 Σ u state for v = 138, but where the sensitivity is only ∼ 200 cm −1 [81].

INTRODUCTION\n\nInterest in empirical potential energy functions of diatomic molecules has remained unabated ever since the inception of the celebrated Morse potential [1], proposed nearly 85 years ago. This three-parameter, exponentially varying function has inspired numerous works in the direction of constructing a universal energy-distance relationship, having varied number of parameters. In recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in this direction. Thus, an enormous number of publications exist in the literature spanning over several decades. Some of the most prominent ones include Morse [1][2][3], Rydberg [4], Pöschl-Teller [5,6], Manning-Rosen potential in 3D [7][8][9], in higher dimension [10], in relativistic domain [11,12] and scattering states [13], Rosen-Morse [14], Wood-Saxon [15], pseudoharmonic potential [16,17] in 2D [18], Kratzer [19], Hulthén [20], hyperbolic [21], Linnett [22], Lippincott [23], Tietz [24], Schlöberg [25], Zavitsas [26], Hajigeorgiou [27], along with many other variants of these and numerous others.\n\nIn this work, we focus on the important Deng-Fan (DF) potential [28] for diatomic molecules, proposed little more than half a century ago, but attracting much interest lately, V (r) = D e 1 − b e ar − 1 eigenfunctions for ℓ = 0 were investigated by the SO(2, 1) algebraic method [31]. About a decade later, approximate analytical solutions of Schrödinger equation with rotating DF potential for arbitrary n, ℓ states were presented in terms of the generalized hypergeometric functions 2 F 1 (a, b; c; z) [32]. In another development, an improved approximation scheme was used for the centrifugal term, along with a super-symmetric shape invariance approach [33].",

As all the bands have the same final electronic state they are tabulated under the various initial electronic states. These are all identical with one or other of the states which go down to 2 p 1S and are desi as 4 *A, 4 xy, 3 10 which have been given to them provisionally by Richardson and Davidson ( l o c. c i t . ) .In this symbolism the first nu means that the level is thought to have a principal quantum number 4 and the prefix 1 means that the levels are thought to be singlet levels. The letters are mere labels without physical significance except that when the same letter is assigned to two levels such as 3 4A and 4 XA there is a close similarity between them. In fact they are thought to be corresponding electronic levels with different principal quantum numbers 3 and 4. In Table I, the letter a means that the position of the line is known, but that it is not found in Gale, Monk and Lee's tables. The letter i means that the position of the line is known, but its presence or absence is uncertain owing to interference by other lines. A blank space means that the position of the line is unknown so that it may, or it may not, occur. The mark f denotes a wave-number which is correct but is claimed by some other line. Such lines generally have too high an intensity in the present bands. Where the two coincident lines both occur in the present bands, the f is placed after the line which should be weaker. A question mark means that the line seems to be the one which is required by the combinations with the lines in the extreme ultra-violet, the data being insufficient to test the combinations in the visible. The ultra-violet combinations are, of course, very rough. All lines, except those queried and some coming from 4 1VF, which show defects exceeding 0-2 wave-number are believed to have been discarded. Most of the discrepancies do not exceed 0 • 1 wave-number, but it does not seem reasonable to demand this accuracy with the present lines as in most combinations one line is either a weak line in the infra-red or",

These are set out in fig. 1.\n\nThe main structure of the spectrum of H 2 is undoubtedly closely analogous to that of the spectrum of atomic helium. Whether we derive the ground state from the union of two unexcited H atoms or from the splitting up of the nucleus of a helium atom we conclude that the ground state of H 2 has the con figuration ls21E, where Is2 (or Is Is) means that both electrons have principal quantum number 1 and azimuthal or analogous quantum number l, denoted by s, = 0 , £ denotes that the total component A = 2X of L = resultant l along the internuclear axis is 0 and the prefix 1 that the state is a singlet state. Both in absorption and emission we have transitions from and to this state with each of the states B ( = 2 JS) and C the final state of the present bands. In 2 X S the rotational levels are all present and they are single levels. This is, therefore, a x2 state. In contrast to the ground state its lowest rotational level is a strong level, the next weak and so on. This means that -Xx -f-l2 -X2, the suffixes referring to the individual atoms of the molecule, is now an odd number (X is the component of l along the internuclear axis). This is necessary to satisfy the rule that the complete proper function of the molecule must be antisymmetric in both the qjectrons and the protons. The B or 2 hS level is the lowest which goes down to the ground level; so that its excited electron will have principal quantum number 2, a fact which is confirmed by the value of the effective quantum number (1-959).

The bands shown as going from the levels designated m p zUaib to 2s 3S, m = 3, 4, 5, are the HO J H^, Hy bands.* null lines of these bands follow a Rydberg formula which enables the final level to be determined. Its effective quantum number is 1-933, so that it is clearly an n = 2 level. We have used up all the expected singlet 2 levels and it is not identical with any of them so that we expect this to be a triplet level. The rotational analysis shows that it is single and all levels are present. I t must, therefore, be a S level and could be either 2s 3N or 2 32. The upper levels are double with the lowest rotational level alone missing. They are therefore II levels. Neither initial nor final levels show appreciable uncoupling. This favours the interpretation of the upper levels as rather than dYl terms. Furthermore they are almost identical with the 3P terms of the orthohelium spectrum. I therefore conclude that these terms are 3IIa = 3, 4, 5), and this fixes the final level as 2s 3E, as strong transitions to 2 3S should not occur from m p3 II levels. The bands shown on the right of fig. 1  These values make it uncertain whether n -2 or n -3, and some of the possibilities of this alternative have been discussed by Richardson and Das.J If n = 2 the interpretation as np 3£ levels, 2, 3, w established.\n\nThe level marked ? 2 p3 JTo6, in fig. 1 is the lower level of some bands w I have recently found but have not yet had time to examine in detail.

The emissivity ϵ (λ, T) describes the spectral emittance of a blackbody as a function of wavelength and temperature, whereby the limit ϵ (λ, T) = 1 represents the case of an ideal blackbody radiator. Typical blackbody emitters are the Nernst glower and the globar, whereby either a ceramic rod (e.g., SiC) or a tungsten filament, respectively, are resistively heated.\n\nEven though thermal emitters are inexpensive, the emitted radiation-central wavelength and radiant intensitycan only be controlled by the temperature of the emitter element. Figure 1 shows the blackbody radiation of an ideal emitter and the temperature dependence of the emitted radiation in terms of wavelength. This dependence renders thermal emitters for specific applications in the fingerprint region (e.g., 6-15 µm) of limited utility, as for this spectral regime a thermal emitter would have to be operated at room temperature, and thus would have only low emissivity. To overcome these limits, one may refer to Kirchhoff's law of radiation. Kirchhoff's law states that the emissivity of a blackbody radiator at a given temperature and wavelength is equal to the ratio of emissivity ϵ and absorptivity α at that same wavelength and temperature constant:\n\nwhere R is the reflectivity, T the transmissivity and θ the angle of incidence of the light. Thus, following from Kirchhoff's law an adequate absorber must also be an adequate blackbody emitter, which can be exploited for the development of advanced thermal emitters. Despite evident progress in light source technology, a large number of the systems reported to date are based on either a change of a specific property of a natural material or a temperature change, and are, therefore, limited by operation at high temperatures, a limited operating frequency, or a slow modulation speed.",

Today, laser-based sensing of chemical species offers high sensitivity and specificity, large dynamic range, multi-component capability, and lack of pretreatment or preconcentration. The availability of broadly tunable mid-infrared sources -particularly in the important 3-4 lm wavelength range -such as quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) [1][2][3][4], tunable radiation generated by nonlinear optical processes such as difference frequency generation (DFG) [5,6] and optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) [5,7,8], interband cascade diode lasers (ICLs) [9][10][11], distributed feedback (DFB) diode lasers [12,13], or the most recent development of diode-pumped lead salt vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers (VECSELs) [14,15] has certainly eased the implementation of laser-based sensing devices.\n\nFurthermore, detection schemes such as multipass absorption, cavity-enhanced and cavity-ringdown or photoacoustic detection are by now well-established techniques so that their implementation has become straightforward.",

In this graph, we can see the spectral lines reported by [34] as vertical colored lines, where the corresponding wavelengths are indicated alongside each line. The line spectrum for this source is shown in the insert. From this graph, we can see that the spectrum obtained with the homemade spectrometer consists of four peaks with wavelengths 403, 428, 486 and 667 nm, which correspond to radiation emitted in the transition of electrons from a higher energy level to a lower energy level 1 . The lines obtained deviate from the most intense emission lines of hydrogen in, at most, 2%. Again, this deviation is very small and reinforces the observation that the homemade spectrometer gives results of sufficient accuracy to perform the analysis of different light sources, which can reinforce the knowledge of modern physics in undergraduate students. In this sense, we have found the resolving power of the homemade spectrom- 1 The violet (403 nm) line corresponds to a transition from the 6 th to the 2 nd energy level, the blue line (428 nm) to a transition from the 5 th to the 2 nd , the green (486 nm) is produced in the 4 th to the 2 nd transition, and the red (667 nm) in the 3 rd to 2 nd energy level transition.

This short summary of own projects is just meant to illustrate some main features and possibilities but also limitations of this technique. The main issue remains the availability of appropriate broadly tunable laser sources and sensitive detection schemes. Hence, the development of new laser types enables new possibilities, e.g., more field capabilities in ambient and industrial monitoring or point-of-care instrumentation in medical applications.

Source: By the author. When comparing the FWHM and the time shift of the intensity maximum for each distance between the excitation and collection fibers (figures 41, 42), an increase in both parameters was observed as the scatterer concentration increased. For the 14.5 mm distance, the signals of low photon count rate had 0.1 ns more of FWHM for concentrations equal or above 1%, and approximately 0.05 ns less of time shift for concentrations equal or below 1%. This behavior was not observed for the other distances measured. For the 24.4 mm, 33.3 mm and 44.0 mm distance and above, the FWHM for 378 nm was, respectively, around 0.5 ns, 1 ns and 1.5 ns above the 445 nm signal. When considering the 44.0 mm distance, this FWHMdifference became observable at 1% concentration. By comparing the FWHM and time shift behavior for both wavelengths, we observed the FWHM may be sensitive to wavelength-dependent effects due to scattering processes, while the time shift is mainly sensitive to wavelength-independent scattering processes.\n\nFigure 41 -\n41The FWHM of time-of-flight signals for distances of 14.5 mm (A), 24.4 mm (B), 33.3 mm (C), and 44.0 mm (D) increase with the scatterer concentration. As the scatterer concentration and distances increase, the 378 nm FWHM becomes higher than the 445 nm one, which suggests that the wavelength-dependent scattering effects become relevant for the distances and concentrations where the FWHMs for these wavelengths are separated.

This equation demands a power of 0.3 W for the line scan, not including the losses in the optical system (a factor of 3 or more) and the excess of power caused by the fact that the excitation line is longer by at least a factor of 3 than required by the field of view (so that the intensity distribution along the line is uniform). As a result, it is experimentally very difficult to capture the signals in both configurations with the camera when using the very different powers predicted by Equation (3), either because the point-scan power cannot be lowered enough and still achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio with the camera, or the laser cannot achieve the required power to match the line-scan to the point-scan. The net result of this is that the sensitivity achieved in the line-scan configuration will be inevitably underestimated.",

New attractive possibilities have been opened up for wide industrial use of highly sensitive mid-infrared spectroscopy. Besides, devices for mobile usage are easy to realize as of now. In the meantime, first measurement systems are available on the market that use quantum cascade lasers as radiation sources  for different industrial and research-related applications, as offered by neoplas control GmbH in Greifswald, Germany, for example ( Fig. 1). Quantum cascade laser measurement systems are characterized by a high time resolution at an extremely high selectivity and sensitivity that reaches detection limits in the low ppb-range for some gases. Under certain process conditions, even measurements in the ppt-range (parts per trillion) can be done. The systems are compact, robust and easy to handle and calibrate. Absolute concentrations of gases and plasma components can be determined virtually in real-time through high time resolutions down to nanoseconds. Examples include C x H y , CO, CO 2 , COCl 2 , NH 3 , NO, NO 2 , N 2 O, NF 3 , B 2 H 6 , BCl 3 , SiF 4 . A high level of flexibility and ex-tensibility is guaranteed by the system's modular design. Neoplas control's \"Q-MACS Process fibre\" is a quantum cascade laser measurement and control system that was exclusively developed for online measurements in plasma reactors. The system is equipped with an optical fiber coupling and a two-channel structure with a measuring and reference channel that allow highly sensitive online measurements within a plasma reactor. The optical fiber creates a direct connection between measurement system and the reactor chamber. For this to work, the laser beam is guided to the reactor through a window. Within the plasma, the laser beam's intensity is reduced by absorption and finally reflected by a mirror and conducted back into the measurement system (Fig. 2). Thereby interferences affecting the measurement, which are caused by a temperature-induced extension of the reactor walls, can be compensated. The two-channel structure serves to compensate the laser beam's small fluctuations in its wavelength.",

This compact, diode-pumped, solid-state, modelocked Nd:YLF laser produces 1047 nm light, and studies have shown that cell viability increases dramatically at wavelengths above one micron (see sidebar).\n\nThe Vitesse and the Vitesse-XT are turnkey systems that combine our Verdi ® (DPSS) pump source and a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser in a compact, fully integrated package. The standard Vitesse operates at a fixed wavelength. The Vitesse-XT includes fully computer-controlled wavelength tunability and is ideal for many MPE applications.

Mira Optima 900 modelocked Ti:Sapphire lasers offer several advantages in scientific research environments.

With confocal imaging at approximately 520 nm, cell division stopped. With MPE imaging at 1047 nm, cell division continued unabated. The embryo was then implanted in a female hamster and brought to term. The result-a healthy female hamster who now has a litter of her own. 10\n\n\nCritical Equipment -Microscope and Laser\n\nBecause of their simplicity and hands-off operation, the BioLight-1000 and Vitesse family of lasers are particularly suited for biology laboratories where the researchers have not had extensive laser experience. In this case, the benefits of hands-free control will outweigh any constraints due to wavelength limitations. However, the Mira Optima 900 is still the industry standard for ultrafast lasers. The Mira can be used with a variety of pump sources and, when combined with Mira accessories, this system provides tunable ultrafast performance from the UV to the mid-IR. The ultimate choice of laser will depend on both the specific experimental requirements and a customer's needs.\n\n\nAttaching the Laser and Microscope",

BENCHMARK COMPARISON TO LASER-BASED UNITS\n\nA few years ago, Pharmanex R developed a laser-based Raman instrument for detecting carotenoid molecules in human skin tissue.It was based on a larger laboratory research device [12,21,22].A fiber-coupled laser was focused onto the hand, and backwards-directed fluorescence was fiber-coupled into a grating spectrometer.The light intensity in the Raman peak was measured in the spectrometer trace.Raman measurements correlate with carotenoid serum levels [25] and both resonance and nonresonance Raman measurement can be used to identify, quantify, and monitor molecular content in skin tissue [9,11,23,24,26,27,28].\n\nPharmanex R developed an arbitrary scale for quantifying carotenoid levels in skin tissue that is proportional to the Raman signal.On this scale, the average American has a reading in the neighborhood of 25,000 for measurements made in the palm of the hand.The palm has the advantage of being relatively homogeneous and melaninfree.Typical scores range from 10,000 to 50,000, similar to the spread of the population seen in Fig. 4 and the measurement uncertainty is less than 3,000.",

It contains fundamental vibrational-rotational absorption bands of various gases, which allows remote [1,2] or local gas analysis of the atmosphere [3,4] using lasers with appropriate wavelengths. The absorption of water vapour in the atmosphere significantly limits the spectral regions in which laser radiation passes through the open atmosphere. The main transparency windows of the atmosphere are located in the ranges of 3-5 µm and 8-12 µm. In addition to water vapour, atmospheric carbon dioxide, which has strong broad absorption bands centred near 4.3 and 14 μm, also restricts the propagation of laser radiation. In the spectral range of 8-12 μm, tunable CO 2 lasers are traditionally used for various purposes (including atmospheric gas analysis). These lasers emit at various vibrational-rotational transitions in the range of 9.2-10.8 μm [5,6]. Optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are widely used in the range of 3-5 μm and 8-12 μm [10]. Currently, gaseous pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and hydrocarbons (HC), as well as their reaction products, such as acids and oxidants, are of primary interest. SO 2 , NO x and hydrocarbons are the primary pollutants, while the reaction products are referred to as secondary pollutants. In industrialized countries with high traffic density, air pollution is mainly caused by human activities, that is, anthropogenic sources. In contrast, the contribution of natural sources to air pollution is often negligible. In Europe, the importance of SO 2 as an air pollutant has been slowly declining since ~ 1970 due to the decline in the sulfur content of fuel oil used for heating. On the contrary, NO x and HC emissions are increasing. As a result, by the beginning of the XXI century, their concentrations turned out to be about 10 times higher than in the middle of the XX century. This increase is mainly related to cars, as up to 70% of NO x emissions and ~ 25% of HC emissions are caused by vehicles.",

The usage of infrared laser absorption spectrometer made it possible to clearly identify gases and plasma components as well as to determine their absolute concentration. Devices fulfilling current industrial standards in terms of costs, compactness and robustness exclusively function within the near infrared range (NIR; 0.7 -3 μm). The absorption of most molecules is relatively low in this range so that the required highly sensitive measurements cannot be performed most of the time. The highest absorption of many molecular gases and plasma components is in the mid-infrared range (3 -20 μm) where, in contrast, very high sensitivities in the ppb-range can be realized. Some gases, like SiF 4 and NF 3 that are important for plasma-technological processes, can only be detected in the mid-infrared range. However, tunable diode lasers (TDL) were the only option for laser absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared range for quite some time. Those required extensive cooling with liquid nitrogen or even helium. Furthermore, in order to attain an applicable signalto-noise ratio, the detector had to be cooled due to the tunable diode lasers' low integral power. Consequently, corresponding spectrometers are too cumbersome, not robust enough or too expensive for industrial applications.\n\n\nQuantum Cascade Laser measurement systems\n\nIn recent years, quantum cascade lasers (QCL) have substantially improved the practical applicability of laser absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared range. Quantum cascade lasers have become increasingly more important in spectroscopic research, especially in industrial applications, since its first successful manufacture in 1994. These devices denote a class of highly efficient and powerful lasers with a wavelength between 3.5 μm and 14.1 μm in the mid-to far infrared range. They can be manufactured in a very compact form factor and can be used at room temperature without extensive cooling. Quantum cascade lasers, available on the market, often only have the size of a match head. They have high radiation intensities and can be spectrally tuned, what favors its application in optical measurement, especially in absorption spectroscopy. These lasers deliver the desired radiation without elaborate cooling.",

We can see interference effects in the green lines of the spectrum, separated approximately 10 nm (less than the FWHM of the spectrometer for the green lines, approximately 18 nm, as can be seen in table 1). On the other hand, it is important to remember that the spectrum obtained with the homemade spectrometer is accurate in terms of wavelengths but not in intensities. This remark is revealed in the helium spectrum too, as the blue line with measured wavelength 446 nm should have, according to the measurements reported in [34], an intensity greater than the intensities of the two green lines at 492 nm and 502 nm, which are shown with higher intensity in the spectrum obtained with the homemade spectrometer.\n\nThis effect, and also the absence of the red lines at 667, 687 and 707 nm persistent in the helium spectrum shows the effects of the filter in the webcam or mobile phone camera.

This also explains why the web-based application spectralworkbench.org, when used with a laptop or smartphone camera, shows the green peaks with greater intensity than the blue or the red peaks, even though their intensity should not be that high, as can be seen in figure 2 with the red line measured at 667 nm (which should be the one with maximum intensity).",

We work to order 1/c 2 and assume that the leading-order contribution to A is of order 1/c 2 . According to the principle of minimal coupling, the Hamiltonian in the Dirac rep-resentation becomes [17] \nH = cα α α · (p − qA) + βmc 2 + qΦ,(15)\nwhere q is the electron's electric charge. It is important now to distinguish between the canonical momentum p = p =p + O(1/c 3 ) and the total kinetic momentum π π π = p − qA =π π π + O(1/c 3 ) of the electron. It isπ π π rather thanp that obeys the Lorentz force law [32,33,49],\ndπ π π dt = q(E + α α α × B).(16)\nHere, E = E(r, t) = −∇ ∇ ∇Φ −Ȧ is the electric field and B = B(r, t) = ∇ ∇ ∇ × A is the magnetic field.

These distinctions are important. Consider, for example, r q =r M = r. Here, two different physical quantities (r q andr M ) are expressed in two different representations (primed and unprimed) by the same mathematical operator (r).\n\n\nII.

For the purposes of this paper, we find it necessary to identify and distinguish between the instantaneous positionr q of the electron's electric charge, the kinetic positionr q of the electron and the so-called mean positionr M of the electron. As the electron is free, these positions can be defined as follows.\n\n\nA.

However, this leaves the fourth term unaccounted for. To proceed, we must recognise that the kinetic momentum should be cast in terms of the kinetic velocityv q , rather than the mean velocityv M . This leads us to recast the spin-dependent term in (21) as\n− βq(s × ∇ ∇ ∇Φ) 2mc 2 = βq(s × ∇ ∇ ∇Φ) 2mc 2 − βq(s × ∇ ∇ ∇Φ) mc 2 = βm(v q −v M ) +m ×Ê c 2 + O( 1 c 3 ),(22)\nwithm = βqs/m the magnetic-dipole moment of the electron.

We attribute this hidden momentum to a modification of the electron's Zitterbewegung by the electric field E. For the special case in which E is due to a \"test particle\", a complementary result was derived in [8].

In this paper we use both the Dirac and Foldy-Wouthuysen representations because some quantities such as the positionr q = r of charge have simple operator representatives in the Dirac representation whilst others such as the mean positionr M = r have simple operator representatives in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation instead.

In this paper we have established that even a single particle like the electron can harbour a hidden momentum associated with its spin. We can now conceive, therefore, of systems containing such particles in which there is no imbalance of the kinetic momenta of the particles and yet the total hidden momentum of the particles is non-zero: ' γmv = 0' but ' m × E/c 2 = 0'. One might say that such a system harbours hidden hidden momentum, in distinction to hidden kinetic momentum. A loop of electric current (driven through a resistive element by a battery) encircling the tip of a (long) magnetised needle is one such system. To appreciate this, consider a simple model of such a system in which the loop is circular and lies in the x − y plane whilst the tip of the needle coincides with the centre of the loop, at the origin. If we imagine that the magnetic-dipole moment 'm' of each charge carrier is aligned radially due to the magnetic field of the needle whilst the electric field 'E' driving the current around the loop is aligned azimuthally, then the hidden momentum 'm × E/c 2 ' of each charge carrier is aligned axially. Thus, the system harbours a hidden hidden momentum ' m × E/c 2 = 0', with no hidden kinetic momentum to speak of: ' γmv = 0'. Hall effects [68,69] have been neglected in our argument. We do not expect these to dramatically alter the underlying physics, however.\n\n\nVI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the EPSRC (EP/M004694/1) and The Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2017-048).

Then, consequences of these equations are investigated and compared with experiment. In our approach, we describe results of measurements in a probabilistic way and ask what is the mathematical apparatus that can describe this situation. In this way, the basic mathematical structure of quantum theory except for equations of motion is obtained. Equations of motion are found from requirement of the relativistic invariance of the probabilistic description.\n\nProbably the best approach is to start with measurement of the space coordinates and time. In this paper, we show that the basic mathematical structure of quantum mechanics like the probability amplitude, Born rule, probability density current, commutation relations, momentum operator, uncertainty relations, rules for including the scalar and vector potentials and existence of antiparticles can be derived from the definition of the mean values of the space coordinates and time (sections II-VI). Equations of motion of quantum mechanics, the Klein-Gordon equation, Schrödinger equation and Dirac equation are obtained from requirement of the relativistic invariance of the theory (section VII). Limit case of localized probability densities yields the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics (section VIII). Generalization to many particle systems is performed in section IX.\n\n\nII.

It can be argued that this is the origin of the electron's spin and magnetic-dipole moment [18,24,27,28,34]. It seems natural, therefore, to anticipate that an electron in an electric field harbours hidden momentum associated with its spin, due to a modification of its Zitterbewegung by the field.\n\n\nIII.

Test calculations were performed for four configurations where all atoms form an equilateral triangle with the side length equal to R side = 4, 5.6, 7, or 9 bohr, and two centrosymmetric linear configurations with the distance between central atom and two outer atoms equal to R sep = 4 or 5.6 bohr. These test configurations will be further referred to as Equilat(R side ) and LinSym(R sep ), respectively. In the following, we discuss in detail results, shown in Tables I, III,  were then employed to calculate the potentials for all configurations, generated as described in Sec. III, which were used to produce analytic fits. A list of ab initio values and estimated uncertainties of the potentials for these configurations is included in the ESI. †\n\n\nC. BO energy",

The separation between the outer two electrodes in the stack is 1.5 cm and the four electrodes are equally spaced. The inner two electrodes are used to ensure the homogeneity of the electric field in the photoexcitation region. To generate magnetic fields perpendicular (parallel) to the electric field, two coils are used with a center-to-center distance of 50 mm (33 mm) and inner and outer radii of 84 (44.5) and 114.6 (75.1) mm, respectively.

The spectra measured at F=60 and 78 V cm −1 show the repeated structure of the five peaks discussed above (see figure 15(a)). The spectral structure at F=30 V cm −1 is dominated by three closely spaced peaks. Figure 17 illustrates the complex energy-level structure, with multiple avoided crossings also apparent in figures 15(b) and 7(b). Adiabatic traversals of these crossings change m l and often also the electric dipole moment, with consequences for the deceleration and trapping experiments of the kind described in the introduction.",

The measured absolute OOSs of 1s 21 S 0 → 1snp 1 P 1 series (n = 3-7) for helium are all in excellent agreement with the sophisticated calculations and most experimental measurements in literatures. The present results provide a rigorous test of the theoretical methods and confirm the validity of the high resolution dipole (γ, γ) method. Because the dipole (γ, γ) method is not subject to the line-saturation effect and its Bethe-Born conversion factor varies much slowly with the excitation energy compared with that of electron-impact method, the OOS determined by the dipole (γ, γ) method can serve as benchmark data and provide a cross-check to those measured by the optical method and the dipole (e, e) method, especially for the transitions with very low excitation energies. The present work shows that the dipole (γ, γ) method based on the inelastic x-ray scattering technique at the third generation synchrotron radiation is a powerful tool to determine the absolute optical oscillator strengths of valence-shell excitations of other atoms and molecules.\n\n\nthe absolute OOS of the atom and molecule, a simple normalization method is used:\n\nFigure 2 .\n2The Bethe-Born conversion factors of the dipole (γ, γ) method ω ( ′ ( )) γ B n determined by simulating the light path of the present experimental setup, and the high-resolution dipole (e, e) method ω ( ′ ( )) B e n produced according to the typical parameters in Chan et al. 14 .

Due to numerical complexity of the FCI calculations for a six-electron system, we were able to obtain this correction using basis sets with the cardinal numbers only up to X = 3. Moreover, since basis sets with X = 2 and X = 3 are too small to ensure reliable extrapolations, we consider the a3Z results as our recommended values and estimate the uncertainty as the absolute difference between the a2Z and a3Z results.

[26][27][28][29] In their original work, Tulkki and Å berg noticed that for incident beam energies tuned below an x-ray absorption edge (called the off-resonance region), the shape of the x-ray emission spectrum is proportional to the unoccupied density of states of an atom. However until recently, the potential of extracting the electronic structure from a single x-ray emission spectrum recorded at off-resonant excitations was not explored, likely due to the extremely weak scattering cross section as compared to the resonant x-ray emission spectrum. 28,29 By combining off-resonant excitation and an x-ray spectrometer operating in a dispersive geometry at a synchrotron, HEROS has been experimentally demonstrated. 22,23 HEROS is an alternative to XAS, with significant advantages when used with pulsed x-ray sources. By taking advantage of its ability to record an x-ray spectrum in a single measurement, it has been applied to monitoring the kinetics of a chemical reaction. 22 In this work, we explore the use of the HEROS technique to measure the electronic structure of copper and copper oxides at an XFEL. The experiment was performed at the Coherent X-ray Imaging instrument 30 at the Linac Coherent Light Source, USA. As reported previously 22,23 HEROS requires monochromatic photon energies for the incoming beam. One approach to generating this type of beam at an XFEL is the so-called \"self-seeding\" method, 31 which allows the FEL to produce a narrow energy bandwidth beam with more stable beam characteristics than during normal SASE operation with a monochromator. 6,18 The experimental setup is schematically drawn in Figure 1. The x-rays delivered by the LCLS are generated by SASE and monochromatized to seed the electron beam in the second part of the undulator, imparting a suitable structure to the electron bunch to enable it to produce monochromatic pulses. 18,31 However, because fine scanning of the seeded",

It is for example not normalizable, but the above example shows that it is characterized by strong localization. This is in contrast to a continuum state, but resembles the situation for a bound state. The resonant state has a well defined life-time due to the coupling to the continuum, and mathematically it can be described as a complex pole of the S-matrix. With a long life-time, compared to e.g. the classical orbiting time, the resonance is \"almost\" bound and behaves as such a state, but there are also very short lived resonances whose life-time is of the same order of magnitude as the orbiting time. To understand the role resonances play in atomic processes the localization is very important. It provides a much better overlap with bound states than obtained with continuum electrons, increasing the probability of transitions. The long life-time also leads to a longer interaction time, compared to a non-resonant electron that just passes by. It is interesting to note that a time-dependent calculation of the process of dielectronic recombination of He + [6] shows a situation very similar to that depicted in figure 2; when an incoming electron is on resonance a wave packet builds up in the vicinity of the nucleus, and it stays localized in this region for a time that is very long compared to that of a non-resonant electron with a nearby energy.\n\n\nRecombination -when structure matters\n\nAs an example of a process where resonances are truly important we will now discuss electron-ion recombination. To start with we need a few basic facts about recombination.\n\n\nDielectronic Recombination",

In addition, he has called the radiation discovered in the following year, by Villard, gamma rays.\n\n• Alpha rays were less known than beta rays until Rutherford discovered their vital role in radioactive phenomena and found that they carry the largest portion of the emitted energy in the form of ionising rays, much more than beta rays.\n\n• He has shown that alpha rays are deflected by both electric and magnetic fields, and that they are positively charged. He has proposed that alphas are doubly charged helium atoms.\n\n• Rutherford has insisted on the material nature of the emanation process and has done experiments to verify his hypothesis.\n\nHere I would like to add a short aside, as the latter point was a matter of much dispute. As an example, one of the greatest authorities of the time, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) declared that radium receives its energy by absorption of ethereal waves. You may have read in your textbooks that Michelson and Morley had discovered, already in 1887, that there is no ether. That is a widely propagated misconception. Ether was alive until a much later date, but that is not a subject that will concern us here. I would only like to quote what Rutherford said about ether:\n\n\"With regard to the question \"What is Electricity?\" so often asked the scientist by the layman, science cannot at present venture an adequate answer. ....Attempts have been made to explain electricity as a manifestation of the universal medium or ether ...Even if we may ultimately explain electricity in terms of ether, there remains the still more fundamental problem, \"What is ether?\". An attempt to explain such fundamental conceptions seems of necessity to end in metaphysical subtleties.\"\n\nThese words were uttered in 1905, almost two decades after the Michelson-Morley experiment, and by one of the greatest scientists of the time.",

This is an effect of angular momentum coupling and does not depend on the size of the hyperfine splitting, but without any hyperfine splitting the decay to different F can of course not be distinguished. The example of Sc 18+ has highlighted the fact that dielectronic recombination can be used as an accurate spectroscopical tool. For heavy [41], and perhaps even radioactive, nuclei this development has opened a new path to accurate information concerning nuclear properties. Although measurements on hyperfine structure and isotope shifts have been used for this purpose during many decades, the method has always been hampered by the limitations of the atomic theory necessary to extract the nuclear information. The use of highly charged ions, where a suitable electron configuration can be freely chosen, changes this dramatically.\nK tot F j high j low J I 2 .(24",

So quantum mechanics predicts an approximately flat initial survival probability (close to unity) for sometime, because quantum mechanical unitary time evolution is time-reversible and cannot by itself lead to time-irreversible exponential decay process. However the quantum mechanical reversible decay process certainly cannot persist for a long time, because long-time exponential behavior of a decaying system is experimentally very well established. So we may think (approximately) that the exponential decay of an unstable state starts after a quantum mechanical time delay. This non-exponential decay time scale or quantum mechanical delay time depends on the system concerned and its estimate is model dependent. Recently Wilkinson et al.[26] observed non-exponential decay (flat survival probability at early time) in quantum tunnelling of an atomic system. So far nonexponential decay of the radioactive nuclei has not been seen[27] because of their expected very short time scale of the order of ≥ ħ/(energy release)[23][24][25]. However the nonexponential nuclear decay time scales might be comparable to the lifetime of highly excited compound nuclei and play a role in their decays. As a result of this quantum mechanical delay (nonexponential decay time scale), an unstable quantum state with a large Breit-Wigner width (which should result in a very short lifetime) is expected to live for a significantly longer time. Since lithium and other emitted fragment nuclei are bound states of nucleons, so their exponential decay (in the presence of the residual nucleus) should also start after a quantum mechanical delay, thus",

The natural lifetime of the initial state is represented by C initial , and E stands for the energy of the photoelectron. The XAS(E) function describes the p-projected density of unoccupied electronic states. Energies (E initial and E final ) and lifetime (C initial ) were taken from tabulated values, 34,35 while for the XAS(E) dependence we used a high energy resolution XAS spectrum of a Cu reference foil measured at a synchrotron facility (see Figure 2 inset). The computed curve is plotted in Figure 2 as a blue line together with the separate contributions of the final states (dashed lines). As shown, good agreement is obtained indicating that the same electronic states are probed with HEROS at an XFEL as with XAS at a synchrotron source. Following the XAS data interpretation in the literature, 36,37 the resonances A and B relate to 1s ! 4p and multiple scattering of the photoelectron processes probed by the 2p 3/2 ! 1s core-core electronic transition. The features A 0 and B 0 are sensitive to the same 1s electron excitation paths, however, probed by the 2p 1/2 ! 1s decay channel. The second set of resonances are shifted down in energy according to the binding energy difference between the 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 states (i.e., 20 eV), as shown by dashed lines in Figure 2. HEROS, as shown here, provides a complementary method for studying changes in the electronic structure induced by the chemical surrounding of the scattering atom at an XFEL. In order to test the capability of HEROS for chemical speciation, HEROS spectra for metallic Cu (Cu 0 ) and powder CuO (Cu 2þ ) were recorded, and are plotted in Figure 3.

We achieve this confirmation by performing a pump-probe experiment with a few-cycle probe pulse being 10 times weaker than the pump pulse. We determine that the ionization probability for H 2 + is maximized at inter-nuclear separations of 6.5 a.u. and 12 a.u. in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our numerical simulations agree well with the measurements and confirm our interpretation. Our results also confirm the validity and usefulness of the fixed-nuclei approximation for understanding ultrafast molecular dynamics. The well-resolved double peak structure also suggests that high degree of precision and control could be achieved in experiments on light diatomic molecules, opening new avenues in exploration of a variety of ultrafast processes and phenomena.\n\n\nMethods",

This timing optimizes the data collection rate, but reduces sensitivity to a time-modulated decay rate because the modulation for nuclei produced at different times would destructively interfere. An oscillating effect would be most clearly seen when decay time and modulation period are very similar. On the other hand, the effect would be difficult to see for lifetimes much shorter than the modulation period. For 140 Pr and 142 Pm, typical long bombardment and production times would preclude the observation of a 5 to 10 second modulated decay time spectrum.\n\nWe found one earlier experiment which did have the necessary short time bombardment followed by a long counting period: a study of the isomeric decay of 142 Eu to states in 142 Sm [8]. In that work, the 142 Eu was prepared using short irradiations from 0.1 to 2.0 s, which would preserve a 5 to 10 second oscillation, but with a diminution of the modulation amplitude from the suggested 20% to between 19.9% and 15% (depending on the irradiation time). The decays of the ground (1 + ) (T 1/2 = 2.4 s) and (8 − ) isomer (T 1/2 = 1.22 m) states were observed by subsequent gamma decay of excited states of 142 Sm populated uniquely by ground or isomer decays.

In any statistical model calculation, concerned Breit-Wigner widths are assumed to be zero and then the entropy function and the corresponding temperature of the exit-channel dinuclear system become approximately proportional to the square root of the thermal energy of the exit-channel dinuclear system. However the Breit-Wigner width of an exit-channel dinuclear state might not be negligible for heavy-ion emissions. It should depend on the stability of the heavy-ion fragment in the vicinity of the residual nucleus and also be proportional to the transmission coefficient of the fragment. An alpha particle in the presence of a residual nucleus is not expected to break apart and so the Breit-Wigner width of a dinuclear state comprising an alpha particle and the residual nucleus should only be proportional to the transmission coefficient of the alpha particle and might be approximated as a sharp state, as assumed in the statistical models. However a dinuclear state comprising a6 Li and the residual nucleus should be very short-lived, because6 Li should promptly break apart in the nuclear and Coulomb field of the residual nucleus.

In the absence of collisions, these pathways involved radiationless transitions promoted by inter-electronic state coupling with neighbouring iso-energetic bound electronic states, or to continuum states leading to dissociation. Prior to the 1960s the non-radiative pathways had been very poorly understood but during that decade a ferment of activity rapidly provided a quantitative theoretical basis, the theory of radiationless transitions.\n\nSydney, with his great perception and fearless grasp of both theory and cleverly crafted experiment, very quickly recognized the unique advantages of using molecular ions to test the new theory, particularly their open-shell electronic structures and the relative ease of their manipulation and detection, compared with the equivalent neutral species. If their (exponential) fluorescence lifetimes, τ F , and quantum efficiencies, φ F, could be measured, their non-radiative transition rates, k nr (averaged over the spread of vibrational levels accessed in the initial excitation process), could be determined through the simple relationship k nr = (1 -φ F ) τ F -1 (6,11). To achieve this, an elegant armoury of photoion-or photoelectron-fluorescence photon coincidence techniques, PIFCO or PEFCO, was developed, in collaboration with Sydney's gifted and green-fingered colleagues, John Eland (FRS 2006), Michel Devoret and, later, Gerald Dujardin. Measurements of the radiative (and non-radiative) quantum yields and decay rates of a wide range of ions, of increasing molecular complexity, provided rigorous quantitative tests of the three general cases of radiationless transition theory:",

As the mass is gradually increased, the lineshapes get narrower and deeper while the position of minima and maxima shift towards higher energies. The infinite mass limit obtained in our calculation agrees well with the ab initio calculations performed for the hydrogen molecule in the fixed nuclei approximation in [27] (see the inset of figure 5).\n\nThe transformation of the spectra in figure 5 can be understood by analyzing the time dependence of the transition probability for different masses.

Within this approximation, the passive electrons experience an abrupt change in Hamiltonian so that there is a possibility that they too may be excited into the continuum (we neglect the very weak bound±bound transitions) giving rise to a multiple-electron excitation. The effect of the core-hole potential on these electrons can be described in terms of the sudden approximation (Schiff, 1968).",

When a beam of light passes through a material medium it suffers gradual extinction, mainly through molecular scattering, but partly also through conversion into heat. The two processes should be clearly distinguished, as there is some danger of confusing the issue if the term \" absorption \" is applied to what is a mere diversion of the light energy from its original direction.\n\nI t is easy enough to form an idea of the mechanism involved in scattering, but the process of absorption is more difficult to represent analytically. In order to obtain a clearer view of its fundamental features, I propose to discuss the transmission of light through a medium the molecules of which have only one free period of vibration.\n\nWe may base the discussion on the differential equation defining the position of an oscillator z + 2 kz + n2z = F cos cot.",

The small value of k enables us to conclude that it can only affect our calculations in the region in which n is so nearly equal to w that our spectroscopic appliances cannot distinguish between them. In explaining the so-called anomalous dispersion, k can be left out of account altogether.\n\nAs regards the rate of propagation of waves through such a medium as we are considering, it is important to notice that while the terms of equation (3) are spectroscopically identical there is this important difference; the phases of the terms under the summation are independent of the incident light, but those which are under the integral sign are determined by it.

For a typical excited state energy of 2 eV and width 100 meV , the onset is about 50 meV from the peak, leading to a fractional error of 2.5 %. For functions that vary as the fifth power of the energy, this contributes an error of less than 15 %the low end for the experimental uncertainty of the more accurate nonlinear-optical measurements. So, in using the peak values to obtain the energies, our calculations have an uncertainty of about 15 %; and, the positions of the peaks in our dispersion plots could be off by about 50 meV .\n\n\nA. Influence of the number of electrons\n\nA simple consequence of the Thomas-Khun sum-rules is that the two-photon cross-section of a molecule depends quadratically on the effective number of electrons. With the aid of the sum-rules one can rewrite γ T K3 I as:\nγ T K∞ I = e √ 2m 2 N 2 ef f E 5 10 Φ,(32)\nwhere Φ is a dimensionless function that depends on the energy ratios, the transition dipole moment ratios and the inverse radiative lifetimes but does not depend on N ef f . This is a general result that applies to molecules with any number of levels. Eq. 32 together with Eq. 1 predict a quadratic dependence on the effective number of electrons for the TPA cross-section: Fig. 9 shows a plot of the TPA cross-sections of the different molecules as a function of N 2 ef f . The data follow an approximately linear relationship, indicating that even though the performance of a molecule is dictated by many factors, it correlates with the square of the effective electrons. Note that while this scaling appears to be approximately universal for the molecules studied, it may not hold in other classes of molecules.     \nδ(ω) ∝ E 2 20 E 5 10 N 2 ef f Φ.(33)\n\nB.

(3) in which the limit on L has been replaced by using the approximate ESMF ansatz.This target function is bounded from below, and so a series of optimizations in which µ is made progressively smaller and then set to zero can immediately employ either BFGS or NR.Once we are close to convergence, we can in the case of NR then switch χ to zero and rely on NR's ability to hone in on an energy saddle point.Of course, in practice, it may be system specific when and if switching χ to zero is advantageous.If one does not switch χ to zero, then it is important to realize that it is possible for an optimization to end at a point where ∇|∇E| 2 = 0 but |∇E| 2 = 0, so the user must be careful to verify at the end of the optimization that the energy gradient is indeed zero as expected.In the results below, we did not encounter any optimizations converging to a stationary point of |∇E| 2 that was not a stationary point of E, but such points clearly exist and so this simple check should be standard procedure.",

DINS is a powerful technique which allows the measurement of the mass resolved momentum distributions of each atomic species [26]. This technique in particular is sensitive to zero point quantum energy effects, which can be particularly relevant for light elements such as hydrogen [27]. In fact this technique is well suited for the comparison with computational modelling techniques such as Path Integral Monte Carlo and forms of ab initio MD, but often falls short with comparisons to classical force-fields [28]. If we come down in energy somewhat, to the 1-500 meV range, we enter the regime of broad band inelastic neutron spectroscopy. Here we see a mix of intra-molecular and inter-molecular vibrations, methyl rotations, and phonons. This area of the spectrum elucidates much of the bonding properties of the system [29,30], but gives limited information on the delocalised motion of each atom. For these less localised motions, we must use the technique of Quasi-elastic Neutron Spectroscopy (QENS). QENS operates on the μeV-meV scales, which broadly translates to the pico-second time domain (this varies greatly instrument to instrument). QENS also typically probes length scales of a few angstroms, to a few nanometers. Here we find the most suitable length and time scales for direct comparison to MD, where trajectories of a few nanoseconds can provide the relevant temporal correlations, and box sizes of a few nanometers are easily obtainable. These length and time-scales are particularly relevant to the sizes of nanoscopic porous materials, whose unit cells are on the nanometer scale, and diffusive motion typically occurs on the ps time scale.",

At a basic level QENS measurements provide two key variables associated with the exchange of kinetic energy between the incident neutron, and the sample under study. The first variable is that of the momentum change of the neutron, and this can be related directly to the reciprocal space vector Q giving distance information. The second variable is the energy change E of the neutron, which gives information on the energetic modes present in the sample. In fact, formally what we gain access to is the dynamic structure factor of the material; S(Q, E), with some weighting parameters which are dependent on the interactions of the neutron and each atom in the system. The details of this interaction can be reduced to a simple coefficient called the neutron scattering cross-section, which is dependent on the atomic species in question (note this is also dependent on isotope). Furthermore, the dynamic structure factor may be broken down into a coherent contribution, and an incoherent contribution, which provides information on cross-correlations and self-correlations, respectively. One of the chief benefits of Neutron Spectroscopy is the fact that the incoherent neutron cross-section of a proton is extremely large compared to almost any other atomic scattering crosssection. X-ray scattering techniques on the other hand rely on the interaction of the incident radiation with the electron density of each atom. As a consequence atomic species which are electron deficient, as is the case for most organic molecules, have very weak scattering. The scattering cross-sections for x-ray and Neutron scattering are summarised in figure 1. The consequence of the high proton incoherent cross-section for neutron spectroscopy is that organic molecules, which are typically proton rich, will give signals originating overwhelmingly from the self-correlated motions of the protons (i.e. those associated with self-diffusion). Furthermore as these protons are typically connected in a pseudo-rigid molecule, we effectively have a frame of reference for the self motion of the molecule as a whole. One of the axiomatic assumptions for the analysis of many QENS experiments, is that the signal originates completely from incoherent scattering (incoherent approximation), and thus coherent signals can be totally neglected. This allows the application of many simple",

Coherent elastic neutron scattering emerges from the static correlations lim t→∞ < α nν α mµ (t) > between distinct scattering centers in the crystal. It is basically answerable to interference between scattered waves and produces a signal if and only if strict geometrical conditions are satisfied. Now, we remind that one experimentally understands by diffraction any scattering method by which one collects outgoing neutrons in the spatial directions for which one meets the geometrical conditions for coherent elastic scattering, but without energy discrimination. It is then characterized by a cross section integrated over the outgoing neutron kinetic energy: dσ/dΩ = (∂ 2 σ/∂Ω∂E f )dE f . If the ingoing neutron kinetic energy is fixed then this amounts to integrate over the energy transferhω. The method provides a snapshot of the states and correlations in the crystal. Along the diffracting directions the elastic scattering due to constructive interference most often dominates and one gets a Bragg peak superimposed over a background associated with all the other scattering processes. The elastic signal is deduced by subtracting the measured background in nearby spatial directions where no elastic scattering contributes.",

This allows the application of many simple analytically derived models for diffusive motion which can interpret experimental data without requiring computational models. In general a typical set of QENS results consists of spectra from a range of detectors which are positioned at different scattering angles. These different angles probe different momentum changes Q, and thus provide information on different length scales. The spectra themselves differ from that of more traditional forms of spectroscopy. Instead of many discrete peaks, representing different motions, QENS spectra are most commonly a single peak positioned at zero energy transfer (note methyl tunneling can present as an extra distinct peak), which has a different peak shape and width, dependent on the motions present. Each spectrometer will have an energy range which it can probe, that is determined by the incident spectrum of neutron kinetic energies, and the geometry of the flight path of the neutron to and from the instrument. The upper energy change is a hard limit based on the fastest neutrons that can be detected, and the lower limit is that of the minimum change in energy of the neutron that can be discerned (this is primarily dictated by our level of ignorance of the neutron flight path). This lower bound presents itself as an approximately gaussian peak shape centred at zero energy transfer (see figure 2, with a width corresponding to the energy resolution of our measurement. Any motion that is slower than the energy resolution of our instrument will fall within this resolution function and thus not be differentiable from any other static atomic species in the sample. Stochastic molecular motions such as diffusion and rotation which fall within the energy range of the instrument will present as Lorentzian signals convoluted with the aforementioned resolution function of the instrument. The width of these Lorenzian peak shapes (usually measured as the full width half maxima; Γ) as a function of Q are the primary set of variables which characterise the motions of the system.",

The energy dependence of the scattering length, which varies abruptly around absorption edges, is described by semi-empirical atomic scattering factors f 1 and f 2 , leading to the following expression for the refraction index where N denotes the number concentration of the given atom:\nn X = 1 − 1 2π Nr 0 λ 2 ( f 1 + i f 2 )(7)\nFor neutrons, the energy-independent nuclear scattering length b substitutes the electron radius in the previous expression and one gets\nn n 0 = 1 − 1 2π λ 2 ρ .(8)\nAs can be intuitively expected from the nature of their interaction, in the case of neutrons the scattering lengths of different isotopes of the same element differ from each other. This isotopic dependency of b is seemingly random [44], but it is very interesting to observe that, in the case of hydrogen and deuterium, the difference is very large, b H being −3.74 fm for hydrogen and b D = 6.67 fm for deuterium.\n\nFrom those observations, it is clear that X-rays and neutrons will experience a different index of refraction between the components of the sample, thereby introducing a contrast between those regions. As hinted in the Introduction, one can thus obtain additional independent information about the system under investigation by: (a) combining X-ray and neutron measurements; and/or (b) varying the isotopic composition of the sample used for neutron scattering while keeping its chemical composition and structural details essentially unchanged. In the context of molecular biology, it is clear that advantage can be taken of this method by tuning the isotopic composition of the ubiquitous water molecules. By simply mixing H 2 O and D 2 O, one can adjust the contrast with precision [45,46].

Beginning with the first models of argon in the 60s [1], the scrutiny of force-fields against experimental results has been a major focus of study. These first studies compared pair correlation functions between experiment and theory in order to determine the structural accuracy of the new models, as well as comparing self diffusion coefficients as a measure of the accuracy of the dynamics. At this early stage the structural and dynamic agreement was very positive, reporting only a 15% deviation in the self-diffusion coefficient. Even in this very first study the focus was on a direct comparison with neutron scattering observables, with the iconic opening paragraph in the 1964 seminal paper by A. Rahman;'If neutron scattering data of unlimited accuracy and completeness was available, then the kind of work presented here would serve the useful though unexciting purpose of confirming the results already obtained with neutrons'. Classical force-fields by design omit certain degrees of freedom of the system. At any level of approximation, the removal of degrees of freedom from a model, whether it be the removal of electronic degrees of freedom, or the coarse-graining of molecular groups, introduces a change to the excess entropy of the system. This change in excess entropy has a well documented effect on the resultant dynamics of the system [2][3][4]. It is clear therefore that in order to reproduce the self-diffusion of a system accurately, a parameterisation with respect to experimental results for the self-correlation function is a suitable avenue of enquiry.",

This complementarity is sharpened because neutrons interact most strongly with hydrogen atoms, which, with just a single electron, are difficult to detect by X-ray methods. The ability of neutrons to detect hydrogen atoms is enhanced by the very different neutron scattering properties of hydrogen and its heavier isotope, deuterium, which can be incorporated relatively easily into proteins (Blakeley et al. 2008). Neutron crystallography is therefore particularly useful for biochemists seeking to track the positions of hydrogen atoms as they are moved around in enzyme-catalysed metabolic reactions.\n\nThe technique does not challenge the supremacy of X-ray crystallography for protein structure determination because neutron beams are relatively weak; data collection requires very large crystals (at least 0.1 mm 3 in volume, compared to 0.0000001 mm 3 for X-ray experiments), days rather than minutes of beam time, and is restricted to macromolecules smaller than about 0.02 µm (Blakeley et al. 2008). However, it can still provide atomic-resolution information and is firmly established as a method to probe the reaction mechanisms of many different classes of enzyme for which X-ray crystal structures have already been determined, such as proteases, esterases, isomerases, and reductases, all of which catalyse the exchange of hydrogen atoms in their manipulation of the hydrogen economy of the cell. It remains an important but somewhat niche technique -most working protein crystallographers will not have strayed from X-ray sources. Nevertheless, thanks to recent increases in the intensity of neutron sources, the sensitivity of detectors, and data processing software, neutron crystallography looks set to maintain a valuable role in structural biology (Blakeley et al. 2008).\n\n\nSolution scattering",

XRS probes not only dipole but also higher-order transitions, depending on the momentum transfer involved. The momentum transfer is related to the angle between the incident beam and the detection angle for the scattered photons. At low momentum transfer (vide infra) the spectra are dominated by dipole transitions. XRS utilizes hard X-rays; hence it is effectively an alternative technique for measuring NEXAFS that avoids the experimental challenges associated with the use of soft X-rays. The deep penetration depth (∼2 mm at 10 keV) of hard X-rays makes XRS a bulk-sensitive technique, with the added benefit of significantly inhibited self-absorption distortions of the spectra. 26 The use of hard X-rays also allows the design of ambient-pressure environmental cells with precise temperature and pressure control. It has been shown previously that these characteristics make the technique suitable for studying molecular structure in the bulk of liquid water and aqueous solutions, 26,27 including comparisons of structure in liquid water and ice 28,29 and exploring the effect of isotope substitution on local structure. 30 More recently, XRS has been applied to examine the effects of organic solutes on the structure of water. 31 Here, we show that XRS can be used as an in situ technique for characterizing solute speciation during cooling crystallization, from the undersaturated state through the metastable zone with high supersaturation until the onset of crystallization.",

There is then a variation range of known 'physiological conditions'. In the laboratory we can explore extremes of any one of the biological structures, be it widening for example the temperature range or the pressure range beyond 'physiological'. Ultimately any structure that is to be of worth, i.e. to be more than an entry in an atlas of structures, has to have predictive value with respect to a biological function or in altering that function, as in my comments on David Blow's lament above.\n\n3. Basics about our three diffraction probes: X-rays, neutrons and electrons X-rays are scattered by the electron charge cloud of an atom, i.e. in proportion to the atomic number of an atom; H atoms offer the weakest scattering and uranium the strongest. Electrons are scattered by the electrostatic potential surface of the atom's electrons and nuclear charges. Neutrons are scattered by the nucleus and approximately independently of atomic number, with interesting exceptions such as hydrogen and deuterium, which scatter negatively and positively, respectively. Deuterium scatters neutrons with a strength basically the same as those of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Neutrons are also nondestructive, i.e. there is no radiation damage. Electron scattering is the strongest and requires the smallest samples. Neutrons are the most weakly scattered and require the largest samples.\n\nThese are then the important, core, details in the use of X-rays, electrons or neutrons for structural biology. Indeed, we can ask: is there an ideal probe in structural biology? For protein and nucleic acid crystallography, neutrons are in principle the ideal scattering probe compared with X-rays or electrons as they are free of causing radiation damage. The practical problem for neutrons is that such sources have a weak flux, and first of all solving the structure requires X-rays. The full structure elucidation comes then from combined X-ray and neutron studies. If a crystal cannot be grown then electrons (cryoEM) can be used, but to circumvent beam damage cryo-temperatures have thus far proved to be essential. Electrons are sensitive to hydrogens, which is an advantage over X-rays.\n\n\nNonphysiological crystallization (pH, high salt)",

However, it is possible to obtain structural information on molecules in the solution state -without crystallization -using small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques. X-ray (SAXS) and neutron (SANS) variants of SAS are both available. As the names of these methods imply, the INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS, Vol. 40 No. 3, September 2015 incident beams are only deflected though small angles and the information obtained is therefore of relatively low resolution. This degradation occurs because, freed from the serried ranks imposed by crystallization, molecules tumble rapidly in solution and present themselves to the interrogating beam in all possible orientations; the resulting diffraction pattern, instead of consisting of defined arrays of spots is smeared by averaging into a fuzzy disc, bright in the middle but fading towards the outer edge. Because this diffraction disc is circularly symmetric, the recorded scattering profile varies only in one dimension -along the radius.\n\nThe information loss as a result of the averaging is certainly troubling. Nevertheless, experiments performed through the 60s, 70s and 80s -notably on the structure of the ribosome (Moore et al. 1986), the protein synthesis factory of the cell -showed that it was possible to retrieve three-dimensional information from one-dimensional SAXS and SANS data. The technical difficulty of these early experiments meant there were few adopters so the rate of output has lagged far behind that of crystallography. But that situation is changing.",

CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented three neutron scattering methods which allow the determination of the magnetic induction in absolute value in magnetic films: the Larmor precession, the Zeeman spatial beam-splitting and the neutron spin resonance. For the Larmor precession and the beamsplitting we have compared experiments performed on similar films of the same material FeAlSi. We have shown that these films are homogeneous and uniformly magnetized. The neutron methods have the advantages that they have the potential to provide information about the homogeneity of the magnetization of the film through its thickness. The refraction method in particular can easily identify differences in magnetization at the top or bottom interfaces of a system. Besides, the neutron beamsplitting method presented here is not sensitive to the thickness of the film and thus an accurate knowledge of the film thickness is not necessary in contrast to bulk magnetometry. Such techniques could find applications to the study of thick films of permanent magnets. The neutron spin resonance was used for the investigation of a non-saturated magnetic film. The magnetic state of the film was characterized by polarized neutron reflectometry and VSM which are averaging methods over an ensemble of the magnetic domains. The method of neutron spin resonance provides the value of magnetic induction inside an individual magnetic domain. This is a unique way of obtaining such quantitative information on the induction value compared to other techniques such as Kerr microscopy or MFM.\n\nFIG. 1 :\n1(a) Geometry of the Larmor precession experiment.

The monograph covers the enabling theoretical frameworks, such as the Debye approximation (Debye, 1915) relating the total scattering from a particle to the scattering from volume elements within it, as well as advances facilitating laboratory measurements, such as the development of laboratory-based X-ray cameras with pin-hole or slit collimation, and further breakthroughs in data interpretation and analysis such as the Kratky plot (Kratky & Porod, 1949), used to assess flexibility in a scattering particle, and the Porod law (Porod, 1951) describing the high-angle scattering. The scattering of neutrons is also covered in the monograph, as researchers were beginning to consider how the distinctive properties of neutrons might be used to expand the opportunities for SAS. However, it would be a couple of decades before small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) would begin to grow, notably aided by the advocacy of Bernard Jacrot (Jacrot, 1976) and neutron scattering facilities at the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France.",

The wavelength dependence of the imaginary part of the neutron anomalous dispersion is relatively smooth and is still significant over the hot and thermal neutron range of 0.3 to 3 Å wavelength. For this study a neutron wavelength of 1.17 Å was selected on the basis of a compromise between the proximity to the Cd absorption resonance at 0.68 Å 19 , and the difficulty of resolving Bragg reflections at short wavelength. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature up to 1.75 Å resolution and were corrected for neutron attenuation arising almost solely from the single 113 Cd atom in the unit cell. The quality of the neutron data is shown by the low value of the precision indicating (multiplicity weighted) R p.i.m. value of 14.9% for the highest resolution shell and 4.2% overall (see Table 1).",

Assuming T Kis = 600 K, a variation of E A between 50 and 500 kJ/mol results in a variation of ε between 0.01 and 0.1. As for θ T the quotient q/c corresponds to the adiabatic temperature rise. The adiabatic temperature rise is typically around 1000 K [13,49]. However, in the case of metalorganic precursors, combustion has been observed in powders for q/c values of few hundred Kelvins [17,45,50,51].

Spontaneous transitions between 2s-1s are forbidden by selection rules, while transitions involving the ground state n = 1 give rise to the Lyman series d . The so called Ly-α cooling originates from the collisional excitation of hydrogen atoms from the ground electronic state to the 2p state, which in the subsequent emission process produces Ly-α photons at 10.2 eV (left sketch in Fig. 4). In metal-free cloud this contribution is crucial to bring the gas down to 8000 K. The cooling function is usually expressed as Λ Lyα = n e i u n i E i ul σ i ul u e , with n e the electron density, n u and n l the density of the upper and lower levels, E ul the energy difference between the two levels, σ ul the excitation cross-section, and u e the electron velocity.

Each nucleus of these atoms can have its own spin. Depending on the direction of the nuclei's spin, hydrogen can exist in two different configurations: ortho in which spins of both nuclei are in the same direction, and para in which spins of both nuclei are in the opposite direction. The difference between these two configurations manifests itself in the rotational energy of H 2 . The rotational energy relates to the rotational quantum level J as E J = BJ(J + 1), where B ∼ 60.85 cm −1 is the rotational constant of H 2 . In fact, the rotational ground state (E J = 0) of hydrogen is only occupied by para (J = 0), while the lowest state (J = 1) for ortho (E rot = 2B/k",

About their origin we only have speculations, such as the merger of black holes or neutron stars, along with fireball shock models for the GRB generation. In any case their existence is suggestive for a high precision test of the photon dispersion relation, which represents a purely kinematic facet of LI [22]. A deviation from the linear dispersion relation, i.e. a photon group velocity v γ (E γ ) = const. , can be obtained most simply by introducing a photon mass m γ > 0 (through a modified Higgs mechanism, keeping the photon MAV unaltered). However, the bound based on laboratory experiments, m γ < 10 −18 eV [3], is so tiny that its impact would still not be detectable in GRBs [22].

A subset of flares is 'eruptive' in the sense that the flare is associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME) that carries away a large fraction of the energy released. All flares have an 'impulsive' phase in which a large fraction of the energy released goes into 10-20 keV electrons: the electrons that precipitate into the denser regions of the solar atmosphere produce hard x-ray bursts (HXBs) [5,6] and Hα brightenings, and the electrons that escape produce typeIII solar radio bursts. Explicit time-dependence is included in some MHD models for the acceleration of a CME [7][8][9], but this is not the same as including the EMF as the driver of the flare. In the discussion of the energetics in this paper, emphasis is given to the acceleration of energetic electrons, as a defining feature of the impulsive phase of any flare. The general problem of the acceleration of solar energetic particles has been studied extensively [10,11], with most acceleration mechanisms applying to a small fraction of already suprathermal particles. In early literature, the acceleration of the electrons that produce HXBs was called 'bulk energization' to indicate it involves all the electrons in a localized region having their mean energy increased by a large factor [12][13][14]. It has since been confirmed that the number density of the precipitating electrons in HXBs is comparable with the ambient electron number density [15]. More recent observations [16] suggest that the precipitating electrons are confined to very narrow current channels where they are accelerated by a parallel electric field [17,18]. A flare model needs to include this bulk energization as the main form of dissipation for the released magnetic energy.",

The heat deposited per formed molecular hydrogen is defined similarly to the chemical cooling as Γ chem = n i n j k(T)∆H, where ∆H = 4.48 eV, 3.53 eV, and 1.83 eV respectively for the reactions cited above. At variance with chemical cooling, chemical heating is weighted by a critical density factor = (1 + n crit /n) −1 depending on the critical density n crit , i.e. the ratio between the Einstein coefficient and the collisional de-excitation rate (Hollenbach and McKee, 1979). This critical density factor keeps into account the amount of energy which is radiated away and do not contribute to the heating. We can define two extreme cases: if (i ) n n crit , then → 1, the gas is heated up by ∆H; (ii ) if n n crit , then → 0, and the energy ∆H is fully lost by radiative emission. The cases in between contributes to the heating of the gas to the extent of an amount of energy smaller than ∆H.\n\n\nPhotoheating",

By this mechanism, any ion-electron collision resonance bound at least by the energy to which the electron collisionally thermalizes can remain bound. Thus, T e determines the largest orbital radius stabilized by three-body recombination (the Thomson radius [23]) by the energy balance:\n3 2 k B T e = e 2 4π 0 r T(8)\nThis largest, lowest binding energy orbital dominates recombination by virtue of the cross sections for electron capture and collisional thermalization, which scale as r 2 . Thus, the rate of three-body recombination vastly accelerates as the electron temperature approaches 0 K. Various collision theory formulations developed to model three-body recombination consistently yield third order rate constants that scale with temperature as T −4.5 e [19,23,24,25,26,27]. Calculations for ultracold atomic plasmas show that three-body recombination makes it difficult to form a plasma with an electron temperature less than 25 K [19].\n\nThe very high rates predicted for low-temperature three-body recombination follow directly from the very large values of r T sampled in theory by low-energy recombining and deactivating electrons, or equivalently, the very high-values of maximum principal quantum number, n max (and accompanying orbital degeneracy), set by temperature in detailed-balance integrals.",

A 77-min rotation period radio pulsar is excluded because the rotational energy loss rate from such a pulsar is insufficient to power the radio emission unless the magnetic field is extreme (.10 18 G) or the distance is unreasonably small (,0.5 pc). Another conceivable option is that 77 min is an orbital period and the outbursts are flux variations as a function of orbital phase similar to the pulsar PSR J0737-3039B (ref. 28). This scenario does not explain the transient behaviour from the source or the lack of interburst emission, and favours a distance of the order of 1 kpc or less.\n\nOne other class of sources to consider are magnetars, neutron stars with immense (10 14 -10 15 G) magnetic fields whose radiation is powered by field decay 29 . Coherent emission from the magnetosphere of a magnetar addresses the energy budget difficulties seen in the pulsar models, but all known magnetars have much shorter spin periods (,10 s) than the 77-min period observed for GCRT J1745-3009. An investigation of whether a new, long-period type of magnetar could produce the observed emission timescales and transient behaviour is under way (K. S. Wood, P.S.R., S.D.H., T.J.W.L. & N.E.K., manuscript in preparation).",

On the contrary, endothermic reactions need to absorb energy from the medium to take place. The outcome of endothermic reactions is a net cooling effect, with cooling function proportional to the energy needed for the reaction to occurs (∆H), the abundances of the reactants (i, j), and the reaction rate k(T), which regulates the speed of the entire process e .

Therefore, the greater the frequency of the peak intensity for the collision induced photons would be. Moreover, it would help explain what is witnessed, whether one is considering the blackbody radiation from either condensed matter, or from a polyatomic gas, i.e., the witnessed radiation is due to molecular collisions, and this creates a blackbody spectrum.\n\nCertainly, it would explain why one witnesses blackbody radiation in an enclosure, whether that enclosure is a vacuum, or is filled with a gas. Equally, it should help provide a correlation between P-T relationships and the sun's insolation. In so far as this would explain so much, at this point, it still must be taken as speculation.\n\nAnother question arises, \"to what degree is the measured solar radiance at sea level actually due to our Sun's solar influx, versus being a result of heat created during the numerous atmospheric intermolecular inelastic collisions [10,14], e.g., P-T relation [10,15]?\" It should be some combination of both. And if they are all related by similar Stephen-Boltzmann relationships (blackbody radiations) then thermal equilibrium may mean that we may never be able to separate them, when taking a measurement.\n\n\nXII. TEMPERATURE'S LIMITS\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, at the temperatures of hot blast furnaces (T=1,800 K) the peak radiation is in the near infrared. At such high temperatures, the thermal energy density is best defined by (2), e.g., it is not a linear function of temperature. Moreover, at such high temperatures the energy density associated with the blast furnace will be significantly greater than that of the surrounding atmosphere, hence the blast furnaces thermal energy will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a blast furnace is a system whose interaction with other system's cannot be expressed in terms of a linear function of temperature. This explains the white-hot blackbody radiation witnessed from hot molten metal, even though the visible part of the spectrum remains rather small for blackbody spectrum for T=1,800 K.",

It relies on rapid, uniform preheating of the sample until adiabatic thermal explosion occurs. A representation of a typical ETE setup is shown in Figure 1. Briefly, the sample is clamped between two metallic electrodes with sufficient clamping pressure to ensure adequate contact. The power is then initiated, leading to preheating of the sample until a set T off point. After initiation, the resulting time-temperature profiles are simultaneously collected across a number of high-speed photodiodes. In the commonly used ETA-100 system (Aloft, Inc., Berkley, CA), there are 16 photodiodes present, with 1 mm in between them; this corresponds to 0.5 mm spatial resolution. The photodiodes have a temporal resolution of 10 À5 s and are accurate within 900-3000 K. Once the sample is heated to the selected T off point, the equipment heating is halted, with the consequent rate of self-heating determined solely by the chemical reaction rate. Due to the experimental conditions, i.e., the rapid initial preheating, the reaction occurs in the adiabatic mode. Once thermal ignition occurs, analysis of the time-temperature profile enables extraction of the kinetic parameters (see details in [12]). This technique can be used to study the kinetics at temperatures much higher than can be achieved in other experiments. However, it is often limited in the systems that can be studied due to the stringent heating conditions caused by Joule preheating.",

These calculations were repeated with different random-number seeds using the fluctuation-suppression algorithm described in Appendix A. The results were the same to 1 or 2 %.\n\n\nFusion \"ignition attractor\" phenomenon\n\nIn comparing several ignition calculations (like cases A-D) with similar starting conditions, it is found that the plasma rapidly relaxes to a definite ignition heating trajectory and self-heats along this well-defined path in the space of T e , T i , T r . The heating path can be considered to be an attractor in the parameter space [4].\n\n\nNon-Maxwell ion distribution\n\nMost fusion events involve an ion that has energy >> kT. While the bulk of the ion distribution is quite close to a Maxwellian (at a changing temperature), the most important ions are a small minority in the high-energy tail of the distribution, which we consider to be the range from 2 kT i to perhaps 10 kT i . Molecular dynamics is able to calculate this minority population with no a priori assumption aside from the geometry and boundary conditions.\n\nA non-Maxwell ion distribution f(E) can result from 1.)

In fact the MD calculations do not seem to support this expectation, probably because the heating rate is itself limited by the same couplings that relax the ion velocity distribution.\n\n\n4.)",

The location of the acceleration region, and the acceleration mechanism are different in different models.\n\nA CSHKP model favors acceleration along the neutral plane separating oppositely directed magnetic field lines, see figure 1. One suggestion is that the electron acceleration is associated with contracting magnetic islands during reconnection [57]. Such acceleration involves a parallel electric field, E P , in the collapsing magnetic island. However, the number problem provides a strong argument against this being the bulk-energization mechanism: it seems impossible for such a model to account for the large number of electrons accelerated. However, this is an argument against the specific model, rather than against acceleration by E P in general. The quantitative argument favors acceleration in or near the chromosphere, where there is a copious supply of electrons. Other arguments in favor of acceleration relatively low in the solar atmosphere include a suggested analogy with the acceleration of auroral electrons in a geomagnetic substorm [55,56], an Alfvén-wave model for energy transport [31] and observational evidence for the number density of the precipitating electrons being of order the ambient number density [15].\n\nThe fact that the details of the acceleration mechanism remain uncertain is not surprising: acceleration by E P is poorly understood in any space or astrophysical context. In particular, the acceleration of auroral electrons is attributed to the potential ΔΦ changing from across field lines to along field lines, producing E P [53]. However, despite the acceleration region being probed by spacecraft, the detailed plasma physics remains inadequately understood. Various specific models for ¹  E 0 have been suggested including double layers, anomalous conductivity and phase-space holes [58].",

He wrote an experimental PhD thesis at Harvard, but then traveled to Europe where he made several important theoretical contributions to the early development of quantum mechanics. Dissatisfaction with 'formal theory' led him to develop a large research group at MIT devoted to solving the Schrödinger equation numerically to calculate the physical properties of atoms, molecules, and solids. He authored or co-authored thirteen books and over 150 research papers. An important paper he published in 1951 turned out to bear directly on Kohn's density functional theory (Morse 1982).\n\n[17] A Course in Pure Mathematics is an elegant and rigorous introduction to mathematical analysis for serious first-year college students. The subject matter includes the notions of limit and convergence applied to series, sequences, functions, derivatives, and integrals. All the main theorems of the calculus of a real variable are discussed, as is the general theory of logarithmic, exponential and sinusoidal functions.\n\n[18] The undergraduate course Slater taught at MIT using Introduction to Chemical Physics proved to be too difficult for most of its intended audience. In later years, a separate \"modern physics\" course devoted to atoms, molecules, and the structure of matter became a prerequisite for a senior-level \"thermal physics\" course which retained Slater's idea to combine thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in a single presentation. A textbook written specifically for the latter by two of Slater's MIT colleagues expanded his treatment of thermodynamics and contracted his treatment of statistical mechanics (Allis and Herlin 1952).",

As ε increases, this initial unimodal density tends to increase in width and then ultimately to develop a structure that reflects the underlying stationary phase regions of the problem.\n\nThe sharpness of the resulting stationary phase feature(s) varies with ε, being most highly focused when the ε length scale matches the natural width(s) of those region(s).\n\nThe ε-dependence of the SPMC density is conveniently summarized by the associated information entropy. Shown in Fig. (2), for example, are plots of the information entropy for the densities of the system described in Fig. (1a) for λ = -16 and -25 as a function of the SPMC length scale, ε. The increases in entropy visible in the small ε regions of Fig. (2) correspond to the broadening of the initial unimodal Gaussian densities centered at x 0 .\n\nAs ε continues to increase, the information entropies peak, go through minima, and ultimately increase as the initial unimodal densities first split, sharpen, and then broaden.\n\nThe peak in the information entropy as a function of ε thus serves as a rough indicator of the ε value for which the SPMC importance function begins to reflect qualitatively the inherent stationary phase character of the problem, roughly 0.2 for the systems in Fig. (2).",

However, determining whether these roots are all on the critical line σ = 1/2 is a bit more tricky: The method by which this has been verified by high-speed computers is to consider a specific real function, Z(t), such that |Z(t)| = |ζ(1/2 + ti)|, so that the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to Z(t) having only real and pure imaginary roots. The computer determines the number of real roots of Z(t) in which 0 < t < T by examining the sign changes in Z(t) (and if necessary the sign changes in its derivatives) and compares this number to the calculated total number of roots of the ζ function in the domain, {s = σ + ti : 0 < σ < 1, 0 < t < T }. If the numbers are equal, then the Riemann Hypothesis is verified for this domain. And if not, then the Riemann Hypothesis is false (Pugh, 1998). Now, let us observe the following, which will explain why there is a very good chance that the Riemann Hypothesis is unprovable, just like the Collatz 3n + 1 Conjecture: Since there is no closed formula for the real roots of Z(t) (no formula that does not involve the function Z(t) like the formula for the roots ρ = σ + ti = −2, −4, −6, ... of ζ when σ ≤ 0), the number of real roots of Z(t), where 0 < t < T , can only be determined by examining the changes in sign of Z(t) and (if necessary) its derivatives; therefore, determining the number of real roots",

For smaller ε, W ε (x) results reflect the real portions of S(x) and are thus essentially unimodal Gaussians centered on the corresponding values of x 0 . As ε increases, this initial unimodal density tends to increase in width and then ultimately to develop a structure that reflects the underlying stationary phase regions of the problem.\n\nThe sharpness of the resulting stationary phase feature(s) varies with ε, being most highly focused when the ε length scale matches the natural width(s) of those region(s).\n\nThe ε-dependence of the SPMC density is conveniently summarized by the associated information entropy. Shown in Fig. (2), for example, are plots of the information entropy for the densities of the system described in Fig. (1a) for λ = -16 and -25 as a function of the SPMC length scale, ε. The increases in entropy visible in the small ε regions of Fig. (2) correspond to the broadening of the initial unimodal Gaussian densities centered at x 0 .\n\nAs ε continues to increase, the information entropies peak, go through minima, and ultimately increase as the initial unimodal densities first split, sharpen, and then broaden.\n\nThe peak in the information entropy as a function of ε thus serves as a rough indicator of the ε value for which the SPMC importance function begins to reflect qualitatively the inherent stationary phase character of the problem, roughly 0.2 for the systems in Fig. (2).",

(1.1) is complex. A major one is the choice of an importance function. A tempting choice is the modulus, |exp(-S)|. However, the (potentially) highly oscillatory nature of the integrand means that the important regions of the integrand are no longer dictated exclusively by |exp(-S)|, but by a competition between that modulus and the stationary phase regions of the problem. Stationary Phase Monte Carlo (SPMC) techniques, described in detail elsewhere, 5-7 have been developed for dealing with complex averages. Briefly summarized, these approaches are based on the observation that there exists a group of transformations of integrands that leave the value of the associated integrals unchanged. Specifically, for integrals over an infinite or periodic domain and which converge sufficiently rapidly such that orders of integration can be interchanged, integrals of a function and of its convolution with an arbitrary probability density are equal. That is, given a function f(x)\n\n\n(3.3) by (3.4) is valid, but large enough that the irrelevant, non-stationary phase regions are suppressed and the important regions emphasized.

B functions and other exponentially decaying functionsIf K ν (z) is a modified Bessel function of the second kind (p. 66 of [94]), the reduced Bessel function is defined by (Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) of [141])k\nν (z) = (2/π) 1/2 z ν K ν (z) . (4.1)\nIf the order ν of a reduced Bessel function is half-integral, ν = n+1/2 with n ∈ N 0 , the reduced Bessel function can be written as an exponential multiplied a terminating confluent hypergeometric series 1 F 1 (Eq. (3.7) of [138]):\nk n+1/2 (z) = 2 n (1/2) n e −z 1 F 1 (−n; −2n; 2z) . (4.\n2) The polynomial part in (4.2) was also treated independently in the mathematical literature [142], where the notation\nΘ n (z) = e zk n+1/2 (z) , n ∈ N 0 , (4.3)\nis used. Together with some other, closely related polynomials, the Θ n (z) are called Bessel polynomials. They are applied in such diverse fields as number theory, statistics, and the analysis of complex electrical networks [142]. The so-called B function was introduced by Filter and Steinborn as an anisotropic generalization of the reduced Bessel function (Eq. (2.14) of [92]), where α > 0 and n ∈ Z. Because of the factorial (n + ℓ)! in the denominator, B functions are defined in the sense of classical analysis only if n + ℓ ≥ 0 holds. However, the definition of a B function remains meaningful even for n + ℓ < 0. If r = 0, B m −n−ℓ,ℓ (r) with n ∈ N is zero, but for r = 0, its value is ∞/∞ and therefore undefined. In fact, such a B function can be interpreted as a derivative of the three-dimensional Dirac delta function (Eq. (6.20) of [113]):",

Multivariate analysis of data\n\nOur multivariate analysis of the data employs a well known least-squares method that takes correlations among the input data into account. Used in the three previous adjustments, it is described in Appendix E of CODATA-98 and references cited therein. We recall from that appendix that a least-squares adjustment is characterized by the number of input data N , number of variables or adjusted constants M , degrees of freedom ν = N − M , measure χ 2 , probability p (χ 2 |ν) of obtaining an observed value of χ 2 that large or larger for the given value of ν, Birge ratio R B = χ 2 /ν, and normalized residual of the ith input datum r i = (x i − x i )/u i , where x i is the input datum, x i its adjusted value, and u i its standard uncertainty.\n\nThe observational equations for the input data are given in Tables XXXI, XXXIII, and XXXV. These equations are written in terms of a particular independent subset of constants (broadly interpreted) called, as already noted, adjusted constants. These are the variables (or unknowns) of the adjustment. The least-squares calculation yields values of the adjusted constants that predict values of the input data through their observational equations that best agree with the data themselves in the least squares sense. The adjusted constants used in the 2010 calculations are given in Tables XXX, XXXII, and XXXIV.",

Figure 1A demonstrates: a) this is a bell-shaped probability density function (pdf) symmetrical around its mean (0); b) area under the pdf = 1.0, ie, it \"covers\" 100% of the probability; c)one detail indicates that this t-distribution with 177 d.f. slightly \"deflects\" from the normal distribution: the middle 95% of the distribution, ie, the area from its 2.5th to 97.5th percentile is defined as mean ±1.973 standard deviations (ie, its estimate, SE), while in the case of the normal distribution, the middle 95% extend within ±1.96 standard deviations from the mean; d) the 2.5% of t-scores that are above the 97.5th percentile (in this specific t-distribution>tscore of 1.973) and 2.5% of t-scores that are below the 2.5th percentile (in this specific t-distribution<t-scores of -1.973) are considered to be the extreme values in the distribution; e) this view that a total of 5% of the values in the distribution are considered extremes has existed from the very beginning of the concept of statistical tests and was defined largely arbitrarily but not without a reason (see 3 for the historical perspective); f) the criterion about a cut-off value pertaining to which part of the values are extremes is called α level. Since in symmetrical distributions a half of the extremes are above the 97.5th percentile and a half of the extremes are below the 2.5th percentile, the overall α level is designated as two-sided α level. The cumulative region of extreme values is called α region [(α/2) + (α/2)], while the middle region of the distribution is called 1-α region; g) the value of the area under the curve above the",

In such a double-slit scattering experiment, however, there is no experimental way to identify from the detected photon or electron, either predictively or retrodictively, the path of the projectile, i.e. there is no experimental way to determine through which slit each projectile passed because the slit distance is smaller than the de Broglie wave length of the projectile. The photon or electron carries no measurable fingerprint in which slit it was scattered. Therefore, the detected scattering distribution as a function of the transverse momenta must be calculated from a super-position of the wave packets of the two non-distinguishable pathways, yielding the well-known interference pattern. In his famous discussions with Bohr, Einstein argued if one could measure the tiny transverse momentum given to the slit system after single projectile scattering one could measure through which slit it passed and the interference would disappear (Bohr, 1949).\n\nIn the SGE, on the other hand, one can clearly identify, in the retrodictive case, the spin orientation of each atom. The process of momentum exchange of each single atom with the apparatus proceeds in a very different manner in the SGE than in the case of photon or electron scattering in a double slit system. When the atoms enter the first \"very thin layer\" of the magnetic field (at the entrance) the directional quantization of the two spin states must occur extremely sudden, but without any measurable amount of momentum exchange similar to the photon or electron case. When the spin oriented atoms are then passing through the SG magnetic field each atom is continuously accelerated in z-direction due to the acting force µ ∂B ∂z(t) . The final transverse momentum in z direction ±p z0 of each spin state after leaving the magnet is ±p z = µ ∂B ∂z(t) dt, where the limits of the integral are t = 0 and t = T F . This maximum value (which has always been found in all the numerous SGE experiments performed so far) can only be reached if the atomic magnetic moment µ always points in the + or −z-direction during the entire passage through the magnetic field. The final transverse momentum in zdirection, measured by the detector, is a direct measure of the time-integral over the acting force. The SG apparatus measures only this transverse momentum and never spin orientations.",

Each bright dot corresponds to a single molecule that scatters thousands of fluorescence photons during detection. At first glance we observe a qualitative difference between the singleslit pattern and the other two: Diffraction at a single slit leads to a structureless, broad signal while the doubleand triple-slit pattern exhibit a sub-structure. This is what we expect based on Eq. (1) and Fig. 2.\n\nTo illustrate the level of detail in the patterns, we vertically sum over the velocity band between 140 and 150 m/s as shown in the lower trace of Fig. 4.

When a wave traverses a slit, its position is confined to the width s. This induces a transverse momentum uncertainty with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of\n∆p = 0.89 h/s,(2)\nwhich evolves into a position uncertainty further downstream (see Appendix C).

Effective open fraction: In far-field diffraction, the interference maxima of the multi-slit pattern are located at sin θ = nλ/d, with n ∈ N , while the single-slit minima are aligned along sin θ min = nλ/s, with n ∈ N . With d = 2s, all even orders are suppressed. For molecules s 2 is reduced by the van der Waals interaction to an effective slit width. As d = 2s eff , the even diffraction orders are not suppressed any more.\n\n9. Velocity selection: Without any velocity selection, the visibility depends on the grating parameters (s and d) and on ∆v/v as the latter defines the coherence length. Introducing a vertical slit before the grating restricts the range of molecular velocities that can contribute to the pattern at a certain height of the detector. This changes ∆v and thus increases the longitudinal coherence length. Thus, we can observe more diffraction orders.\n\n10.

This might lead to relaxation via photon emission. Photon emission entails three complementary processes: Firstly, the molecule provides some information about its position. From Bohr's complementary principle we know that you cannot have particle character (position) and wave character (interference) at the same time. Secondly, we can follow Heisenberg's microscope argument for motivating his position-momentum uncertainty relation: if we want to resolve a very small distance, we need light of very short wavelength, incident from the broadest possible angle. This means that a position measurement will add a momentum perturbation. Thirdly, we can argue that the emission of a photon entangles the molecule quantum mechanically with the environment. It turns out, that these three pictures are all quantitatively equivalent.\n\nFor undergraduate teaching, Heisenberg's microscope argument is often the most intuitive of all three. If a single photon cannot resolve the different paths the molecule takes through the grating, scattering more photons can actually provide more optical information: The barycenter of a point spread function can be measured ever more precisely, the more photons are scattered. In Heisenberg's words, this will however, induce a momentum diffusion, which after scattering of many photons will destroy the interference.\n\nThermal decoherence has actually been observed in molecule interference experiments. 68 Note, that in complex molecules, rotational emission typically occurs in the microwave region, while vibrational photons have usually a wavelength between 3 − 20 m, depending on the bond strengths. Following Abbe's diffraction and microscopy theory, a single photon of even 3 µm can at best resolve a path separation of 1.5 µm in high vacuum. The emission or scattering of a single infrared or microwave photon hence cannot destroy the interference pattern.",

However, there are also some major differences. The most outstanding feature is that the diffraction orders are not parallel but bent.

Coherence\n\nIn order to observe multi-slit diffraction, the wavelets along different paths from the source to the detector need to have defined phase relations, i.e. they need to be coherent. Mathematically, coherence is defined as the normalized correlation function of the waves in space and time. There are several examples for coherent sources: lasers in optics or Bose-Einstein condensates in matter-wave science, where all photons or atoms are highly correlated over macroscopic distances in space and time. But even thermal light and molecular beams can be prepared to be coherent.\n\nIt is often useful to distinguish between transverse and longitudinal coherence. As for laser radiation, they describe the distance along the propagation direction (longitudinal) and perpendicular to it (transverse) over which the phase of the matter-wave is correlated.\n\nTransverse coherence can be visualized as the uncertainty in the particle's transverse position, which makes it impossible to predict through which grating slit the particle will go. Since both the transverse coherence function and the diffraction pattern behind a single slit are described by a Fourier transform, they share the same functional form: (sin(x)/x) 2 . 31 If we define the transverse coherence width X T by the distance between the first order minima of this coherence function, we find X T = 2L 1 λ dB /s, which grows inversely proportional with the source width s (see Appendix C).\n\nLongitudinal coherence is a measure of spectral purity of the beam and thus depends on the distribution of molecular velocities. If the distribution is too broad, the interference pattern vanishes, as soon as the constructive interference of one wavelength overlaps with the destructive interference of another one. This definition leads to the respective coherence length X L = λ 2 /∆λ. It differs by a factor of 1/2π from a definition based on propagating Gaussian wave packets. 32 However, it has proven surprisingly useful in real-world experiments, which are not necessarily well described by Gaussian wave packets (see Appendix C).\n\nWhile the transverse coherence grows with the distance behind the source, this is not the case for the longitudinal coherence X L because the spectrum does not change in free flight. We can, however, increase X L by spectral filtering, that is, by selecting molecular velocities.\n\n\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP",

Examples for highly coherent emitters are continuous narrow-band lasers or atom lasers emitting quantum degenerate atoms from Bose-Einstein condensates. 57 Formally, coherence can be defined as a normalized correlation function C ∝ ψ * (r 1 , t 1 )ψ(r 2 , t 2 ) . Both for educational purposes and to describe advanced research experiments, it is often more intuitive to introduce transverse (spatial) and longitudinal (spectral) coherence separately. The correlation function can then be associated with two characteristic coherence lengths. In the literature various approaches exist to define those coherence lengths, resulting in different prefactors. We summarize these concepts here to clear-up the quantitative differences that students may find in the literature.\n\n\nTransverse coherence",

The expression in Eq. (3) is justified for gratings whose thickness is about 10 4 times the size of the diffracted particles. 38 For ultra-thin gratings, however, the molecule can actually be thicker than the grating itself. 39 Thus, the approach to the grating and the departure from it also have to be considered. 40 To fully describe the interaction we would have to characterize the molecule, the grating, and the interaction between them to a high level. 40,41 Such an analysis is very demanding: Each molecule consisting of n atoms has 3n − 6 vibrations and many (often up to 500) rotational levels excited. Flexible molecules can adopt a number of different conformations, which may interconvert within picoseconds. And even for rigid molecules such as PcH 2 , the polarizability is often not isotropic. In consequence, the force depends on the orientation of the molecule during the transit through the grating. Moreover, charges implanted in the grating material may lead to an attractive force several times stronger than expected. 40 Here, we resort to a phenomenological analysis: Close to the grating walls, the phase shift becomes so large that small position changes cause large phase fluctuations and the interference terms are averaged out. In a few nanometer distance the molecule may even be adsorbed by the grating. 42 Hence, we divide the slit into two regions: In the center φ is small and multi-slit diffraction is possible. Close to the grating walls, however, the molecule cannot contribute to the diffraction pattern any more. In this picture the influence of the van der Waals interactions reduces the slit width from s geo to an effective slit width s eff . 38 There are several options to modify the van der Waals interactions. First, altering the grating material changes the coefficient C 3 , which determines the phase shift. Second, one can minimize the grating's thickness T -ultimately to just a single layer of atoms. This has recently been demonstrated using patterned single-layer graphene, which was stable enough to withstand the impact of fast molecules, and to yield high contrast molecule diffraction patterns. 39 Finally, we",

Our work expands on an earlier discussion of fullerene diffraction in this journal in 2003, 28  longitudinal coherence of the molecular matter wave. To visualize the wave-particle duality we use fluorescence imaging: Each molecule can be identified as a single particle on the detector and a large number of molecules then leads to the emergence of a diffraction pattern, as shown before for single photons 29 and electrons. 30 While diffraction of molecules and light share many fundamental features, we also see pronounced differences resulting from the particles' mass and electronic structure. Molecules fall visibly in the gravitational field and they interact with the grating walls because of van der Waals forces. These forces are studied by rotating the grating relative to the molecular beam, which changes with the average distance between the molecules and the slit wall. The role of the internal molecular structure opens numerous interesting questions, which are treated as problems and solutions for class work in the Appendix. Like many textbooks, we discuss diffraction through a thin mask in the far-field approximation, that is, in the Fraunhofer regime.

Waves with different wavelengths (energies) act differently. Wavelengths with certain energies will produce the effects associated with an x-ray to microwaves. The general properties of waves of certain energies allow us to classify them across the full EM spectrum. Another property of light is the manner in which energy is transferred from itself to whatever it may encounter. Light, as well as being a wave, consists of photons. Photons have properties of both waves and particles. For this discussion, we will think of photons as the \"carriers\" and \"transferers\" of energy. Now that we have discussed light and its properties, it is appropriate to talk about matter. Matter is defined as anything which has mass and takes up space. Matter (pen, paper, ink) is made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of smaller constituents known as neutrons, protons, and electrons. Protons are charged electrically positive, neutrons have no charge, and electrons are negatively charged. This means that protons and electrons are attracted to one another in a similar manner as are magnets of differing polarities. This also means that protons are repelled by other protons, and electrons are repelled by other electrons. These small particles can be arranged in many different ways. The simplest model is shown in Figure 3.",

The silver beam had to pass first through a tiny oven aperture (1 mm diameter), then in 2.5 cm distance through a nearly circular aperture (area of 3 · 10 −3 mm 2 ) and then just before the entrance into the magnetic field (at a distance of 3.5 cm from the second aperture) it passed through a rectangular aperture of 0.8mm length and 0.3-0.4 mm width. It was nearly impossible to get a controlled beam with enough intensity passing through all three holes. In the first days of February 1922, Stern and Gerlach met at a small conference in Göttingen (Friedrich and Herschbach, 2003) and decided to exchange one circular aperture by a rectangular slit. This modification proved immediately to be the right thing to do. A few days later, in the night from February 7 th to 8 th , 1922, the SGE was successful (Gerlach and Stern, 1922b). 12 See Figure 3 for a sketch of the eventually successful SGE setup. Being a night worker, only Gerlach had supervised the experiment this night. A PhD student Wilhelm Schütz joined him in the morning of February 8 th (Schütz, 1969). Stern was already back in Rostock. Because of the small size of the SG apparatus (about 3 cm distance between collimators) the observed doublet structure was barely separable (about 0.1 mm) but a microscopic photograph of the detector plate clearly showed a distinct separation of two beams, see Figure 4.",

To those familiar with the view, first suggested by Gouy and the late Lord Rayleigh, that white light may be represented as consisting of a series of discontinuous and irregularly distributed impulses, and that, when the intensities within unit range of frequency are constant along the spectrum, these impulses are of infinitely short duration, the proposition which I have stated will be self-evident. There can be no distinction between the effect of the impulses due to light and those that have their origin in molecular encounters.

For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist.

So, in using the peak values to obtain the energies, our calculations have an uncertainty of about 15 %; and, the positions of the peaks in our dispersion plots could be off by about 50 meV .\n\n\nA. Influence of the number of electrons\n\nA simple consequence of the Thomas-Khun sum-rules is that the two-photon cross-section of a molecule depends quadratically on the effective number of electrons. With the aid of the sum-rules one can rewrite γ T K3 I as:\nγ T K∞ I = e √ 2m 2 N 2 ef f E 5 10 Φ,(32)\nwhere Φ is a dimensionless function that depends on the energy ratios, the transition dipole moment ratios and the inverse radiative lifetimes but does not depend on N ef f . This is a general result that applies to molecules with any number of levels. Eq. 32 together with Eq. 1 predict a quadratic dependence on the effective number of electrons for the TPA cross-section: Fig. 9 shows a plot of the TPA cross-sections of the different molecules as a function of N 2 ef f . The data follow an approximately linear relationship, indicating that even though the performance of a molecule is dictated by many factors, it correlates with the square of the effective electrons. Note that while this scaling appears to be approximately universal for the molecules studied, it may not hold in other classes of molecules.     \nδ(ω) ∝ E 2 20 E 5 10 N 2 ef f Φ.(33)\n\nB.

Section II covers Berne and Pecora's treatment 1 of the field correlation function for dilute Brownian particles, while Section III covers Doob's First Theorem 20 for correlation functions of stationary, jointly Gaussian-random, Markoff processes. Section IV obtains the actual relationship between the scattering spectrum and the mean-square and higher moments of the distribution of particle displacements. If the light-scattering spectrum of a suspension of dilute particles is determined by the mean-square particle displacement, then it is necessarily also true that the light scattering spectrum is a simple exponential. Conversely, if the light scattering spectrum is not a simple exponential, for example if it has a secondary slow mode or if it decays as a stretched exponential in time at large time, then the spectrum is not determined by the mean-square particle displacements through different times. Section V analyzes in detail a specific model system, thereby clarifying issues related to low-q limits and spectral cumulants. A Discussion closes the paper.\n\n\nII. LIGHT SCATTERING SPECTRUM OF IDEAL BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\nThis Section considers the light scattering spectrum of a dilute solution of identical true\n\nBrownian particles, showing that in this special case the QELSS spectrum does determine the mean-square particle displacement during different intervals. In a QELSS experiment, an equilibrium solution or suspension is illuminated by a narrow pencil of coherent light.\n\nThe light scattered by the solution through a fixed angle is collected. The time-dependent intensity I(t) of the collected light is measured. In time domain, the QELSS spectrum S(q, t)\n\nis obtained as the time correlation function S(q, τ ) = I(t)I(t + τ ) .",

This last condition is not really necessary. Any other frame of reference would do equally well instead, the encounters considered being defined by the values of the momenta relative to it, together with its velocity (V' say) relative to the assembly as a whole, so as to make the probability coefficients independent of V1. This remark applies also to the following investigations of radiative processes, although, for definiteness, it is convenient to think in terms of the normal frame of reference, this being the one in which the resultant momentum of the systems and the radiation taking part in an encounter is infinitesimal.\n\n\n* § 4.

(A4)\nObtaining the coefficients c n is thus equivalent to expanding the function L(x) for x ∈ [−1, 1], which can be done by using a Chebyshev-Gauss quadrature and evaluating it at the Chebyshev nodes [35]:\nc n = 2 N + 1 N j=0 L(x j )T k (x j ),(A5)\nwhere N is the degree used for the polynomial expansion and x j = cos π(j + 1 2 )/(N + 1) are the roots of T N +1 (x).\n\nWhen applying this operator computationally, Eq. (A3) should be calculated using Horner's rule for Chebyshev polynomials (also known as Clenshaw's rule) for computational stability and efficiency [35,36]. This makes the number of applications ofH the same as the degree of the Chebyshev expansion for buildingL.\n\nAppendix B: Lanczos procedure details\n\n\nInvert operation",

For the constant which occurs in the electromagnetic theory, we have k = which gives a = 2'5 x 10~23. The small value of k enables us to conclude that it can only affect our calculations in the region in which n is so nearly equal to w that our spectroscopic appliances cannot distinguish between them. In explaining the so-called anomalous dispersion, k can be left out of account altogether.\n\nAs regards the rate of propagation of waves through such a medium as we are considering, it is important to notice that while the terms of equation (3) are spectroscopically identical there is this important difference; the phases of the terms under the summation are independent of the incident light, but those which are under the integral sign are determined by it. Each light impulse produces a molecular oscillation which is definitely related to it, and combines with it in forming the wave-front. This accounts for the retardation which determines the refractive index.",

The typical range of E for many organic molecules is also shown. From the plot, it is obvious that the approximation that Im(γ res ) dominates γ T K3 I is not a good one for most values of E; and, in the range of typical E, γ I is smaller than Im(γ res ) by as much as a factor of 3. Clearly, there are big differences between the two at various values of E. For example, while γ T K3 I remains well behaved and goes to zero at E → 1, Im(γ res ) diverges. Furthermore, while γ T K3 I = 0 at E = 1/2, Im(γ res ) ≈ −4×10 −43 cm 6 eV −1 . We conclude that γ T K3 I can not be approximated on or near double resonance by Im(γ res ).

APPENDIX\n\nThe FTC diagram analysis presented in this work greatly reduces the amount of mathematical effort required to produce an expression for each component of the final signal. Although there is a formal isomorphism between the mathematical expressions and the FTC diagrams [137,138], it is informative to include selected analytic calculations in addition to the FTC diagram analysis. In this appendix we demonstrate the lengthy integration and algebra required for four of the 128 signal components, one of which is zero. The approach is to insert the response function and electric fields into Eqn. 5 and the goal is to arrive at the expression in the Tables that correspond to the terms G II11αi , G II12βi , C I12αii , and C I12αi . We reiterate that while perhaps new to readers more familiar with femtosecond-pulse measurements, the assumptions and protocols used here are based in almost thirty years of experimental and theoretical work on noisy-light spectroscopy.\n\n\nA.

The e −iΩx(ti−tj ) factors are the Liouville propagators during the intervals between field-matter interaction events, and Ω x = ω x − iγ x where ω x is the Bohr frequency of the coherence during the time interval between field interaction events, and γ x is the phenomenological decay rate constant for that coherence. For population terms, Ω xx = −iΓ xx , where Γ xx is the excited-state lifetime of state x. A factor of (−1) n , where n is the number of interactions on the ket side of the diagram, is also present to account for the sign difference of the excited-state-absorption pathways. The factor of µ (4) represents the product of four transition dipole moments specific to the Liouville pathway. For the four-level system depicted in Fig. 2, there are 32 distinct Liouville paths that are triply resonant, 16 of which involve the higher energy state, f , and 16 which do not. Since noisy light is effectively cw, all orderings of fields E A , E B , and E C must be considered. Because fields E A and E C are in-phase with one another, the 32 possible Liouville paths double to 64 when field ordering is taken into account. Each of the 64 Liouville pathways can be represented by a wave-mixing energy level (WMEL) diagram [102] or by a double-sided Feynman diagram [126]. Both sets of diagrams are shown in Fig. 3. Rephasing (S I ), nonrephasing (S II ), and two-quantum (S III ) pathways all potentially contribute to the signal at all delay times in the I (4) 2D ES experiment, whereas in a femtosecond 2D ES experiment these sets of pathways are distinguishable by time ordering the fields. Because differentiation by time ordering is not particularly helpful, we have instead chosen to organize and label the groups of pathways according to the type of dynamics occurring during the second time period: G for ground-state bleach, P for population (stimulated emission), C for coherent oscillation, and T for two-quantum coherence. Excitedstate absorption pathways carry an additional symbol.",

In other words, there is not a strict requirement on the delays internal to the pump and probe sequences as long as the pump sequence 'happens' before the probe sequence. The 2D spectra for this term under four different timing conditions are displayed in Fig. 13. The Liouville pathway suggests that, under rephasing time-delay conditions, this term should give rise to a cross peak that should decay slowly with no oscillatory behavior; in I (4) 2D ES this term leads to a diagonal peak with an oscillating amplitude during time period τ which dephases (very slowly) at a rate given by γ e1g −γ ge2 . Under certain dephasing conditions the signal could even grow in amplitude as a function of τ . As a reminder, here we have chosen γ e1g = γ ge2 , thus the oscillations neither grow nor dephase during τ .",

It can provide information about structures as well as associated dynamics as has e.g. been shown for proton-coupled electron transfer in the excited state. [15] Among the different techniques in vibrational spectroscopy, infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy are the most common ones used experimentally. The spectra may in general easily be analyzed for structurally simple, small molecules but become increasingly crowded and complicated for larger compounds. Here, calculations are of great help for in-depth interpretation of spectra.",

If springs are considered Hookean, for example, equations of motion can readily be solved when force is proportional to the displacement and we can find that vibrational frequencies are associated with force constants and masses of atoms. For instance, in a simple molecule like CO where there is only one spring, the frequency is calculated as in Eq. (3).\nν ¼ 1 2π ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi k=μ q(3)\nwhere 1 μ ¼ 1 mc þ 1 ma and k is the spring constant. The value of k can be computed from DFT calculations at equilibrium state, bond length k ¼ ∂ 2 E ∂x 2 . It is essential to perform geometry optimization prior to frequency calculations as these calculations are effective only at fixed points on the potential energy surface.\n\n\nCalculating second derivative of energy\n\nBefore calculating the second derivative of energy, the first step in quantum chemical calculations is optimization of molecular geometry. Vibrational frequency calculations are done after optimizing geometry by using the same method and basis set as used for calculating vibrational frequency. Model's development is constructed on spontaneously rational values for interbond angles, bond distances and dihedral angles in the absence of experimental data. It is usually done by solving the following Schrodinger wave equation [15]:\nb H el þ V NN Ψ el ¼ UΨ el (4)\nwhere b H el is the one-electron Hamiltonian and V NN is the operator of potential energy between the nuclei of molecular system intended for numerous molecular geometries to discover equilibrium geometry of the molecule, i.e., geometry optimization.",

For a simple oscillator carrying an electric charge, the total energy radiated into space is known.\n\nIf U be the energy of the oscillator, it is found that JJ~1d\\J/dt = 2e2a> 2/Spc, where p is the mass of the electron and c the velocity of light. The diminution of energy being proportional to e~2kt, the value of k is given by e2oo2/Spc.Hence in terms of th 2ire2/Sp\\. Substituting 2,3 x l 0~13 for g2/p, we find for kjo) the value 5 x lO~13/X.. For blue light, this is of the order 10-8. For the constant which occurs in the electromagnetic theory, we have k = which gives a = 2'5 x 10~23. The small value of k enables us to conclude that it can only affect our calculations in the region in which n is so nearly equal to w that our spectroscopic appliances cannot distinguish between them. In explaining the so-called anomalous dispersion, k can be left out of account altogether.\n\nAs regards the rate of propagation of waves through such a medium as we are considering, it is important to notice that while the terms of equation (3) are spectroscopically identical there is this important difference; the phases of the terms under the summation are independent of the incident light, but those which are under the integral sign are determined by it. Each light impulse produces a molecular oscillation which is definitely related to it, and combines with it in forming the wave-front. This accounts for the retardation which determines the refractive index.",

But how could that be possible when there was no medium through which such waves could move? In his article on the Wave Theory of Light in the 9th Edition (effectively, its 100th anniversary) of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Lord Rayleigh (J. W. Strutt) [10] emphasized this apparent quandary stating: \"… For although the evidence is overwhelming in favor of the conclusion that light is propagated as a vibration, we are almost entirely in the dark as to what it is that vibrates and the manner of vibration …..\"\n\nThere are few examples of light scattering more familiar (though perhaps most often misunderstood) than the blueness of the sky on a clear day. It was only after Maxwell expressed the then-known phenomena of electricity and magnetism with a set of four equations, that Lord Rayleigh was able to explain the blueness quantitatively. Considering the scattering of monochromatic light of wavelength λ by a spherical particle of refractive index n and diameter d, much smaller than λ, he showed from Maxwell's equations that the total scattering,σ S , from such a particle was\nσ s = 2π 5 d 6 3λ 4 ( n 2 − 1 n 2 + 2 ) 2(1)\nIn other words, small particles such as the molecules of air, where d << λ, scatter light inversely as the 4th power of the incident wavelength. Thus the blue light components of sunlight would be scattered much more than their longer wavelength companions (red, green, yellow, …). If you have a sheet of Polaroid and look at the sky away from the sun, you should notice that the blue sky light is highly polarized in a plane perpendicular to the earth. Fig. 2, a photograph of the horizon at sunrise, shows vividly the scattering of the sun's various colors. As the sun is below the horizon, the light most scattered into the atmosphere is farthest from the horizon and is clearly blue with colors towards the red undergoing the least scattering.\n\n\nEarly measurements of molar mass",

(10) from the main text, where the peak transition energy and width are extracted from the fit to Eq. (7) for approximately 250 million combinations of the 5 unknown parameters over a broad input value interval (see below). The program then subtracts these model results from the experimental data to calculate the residual, and stores the product of the absolute value of the residuals (peak and width) in an array corresponding to the parameter values used for that particular calculation. The parameter interval ranges are then iteratively reduced until convergence of the results is achieved within the expected experimental uncertainty (±10%). The coordinates of the minimum value in this final 5-D array then correspond to the parameter values that best reproduce the experimental spectra, according to our model. Note that the experimental data are sufficient to solve simultaneously for 5 parameters, given that for convergence, a global fit must be obtained for the values of the peak transition energy and its first 2 derivatives vs. ε, as well as the values for the width and its first derivative vs. ε (see Figures S4, S5).

Rutherford on the Photon, Atomic Energy, and the Laws of Nature 11.1. The Photon In a letter dated January 26, 1917, Rutherford nominates Charles Barkla (1877-1944 to the Nobel Prize in Physics. Arriving late, this nomination is taken to be valid for 1918. This is the only nomination Barkla ever receives and is sufficient to earn him, in 1918, the Nobel Prize for 1917, which had not yet been awarded. Barkla's \"competitors\" on the Nobel scene, Einstein and Planck, have each had six nominations in 1918; in 1919, Planck receives the 1918 Prize in Physics. Rutherford nominates Barkla for:\n\n\"his important original contributions to our knowledge of the nature of X-rays, and particularly for his discovery of the characteristic X-radiations of the elements.\n\nThe proof that each element under certain conditions emits an X-radiation of the element is a contribution that, in my opinion, ranks only second in importance to the subsequent discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by Laue. ...\" (Max von Laue had already been awarded the 1914 Nobel Prize.)\n\nIn praising Barkla, at the end of his nomination, Rutherford adds a surprising statement:\n\n\"Professor Barkla was throughout a staunch adherent of the view that X-rays were a type of wave motion, and championed this with vigour when a more materialistic hypothesis appeared to be gaining ground.\"\n\nThis means that, in 1917, neither Barkla nor Rutherford believe in Einstein's photon of 1905! However, a nomination letter by Rutherford in 1929, proposing Richardson to the Prize, suggests that he (perhaps) accepts the photon.\n\nHow fortunate he was not to know about atomic bombs! 11.3. The Laws of Nature Rutherford was not so keen on the quantum mechanics of Heisenberg and Schrödinger. On uncertainty relations, he writes in 1933 (the year in which Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Prize and Schrödinger and Dirac the 1933 Prize):",

From the plot, it is obvious that the approximation that Im(γ res ) dominates γ T K3 I is not a good one for most values of E; and, in the range of typical E, γ I is smaller than Im(γ res ) by as much as a factor of 3. Clearly, there are big differences between the two at various values of E. For example, while γ T K3 I remains well behaved and goes to zero at E → 1, Im(γ res ) diverges. Furthermore, while γ T K3 I = 0 at E = 1/2, Im(γ res ) ≈ −4×10 −43 cm 6 eV −1 . We conclude that γ T K3 I can not be approximated on or near double resonance by Im(γ res ).

It is a very fast collisional process because the exotic atoms with Z = 1 are small and electroneutral and have no electrons, so that they can easily pass through the regions of the strong electric field inside ordinary atoms. When the Stark mixing rate is much larger than all other transition rates, the statistical population of the nl-sublevels is determined by the principle of detailed balance. The relative importance of the various cascade processes in muonic and pionic hydrogen is demonstrated in Figs. 2a,b. The cascade models of the exotic atoms with Z = 1 are listed in Table 2; they are of two types. In one group, there are various implementations of the MCM [1,7,8,10] where the kinetic energy is assumed to be constant through the whole cascade.

The muonic field ψ µ interacts with the photon field A ′ ν and A ′ ν excludes the photon field produced by the muon itself.

The self-coupling terms with coupling constants g 2 and g 3 for the σ meson are introduced which turned out to be crucial [12]. Since the muon couples only electromagnetically to nucleons, no additional parameters need to be introduced, and no readjustment of the present parameters is needed. Varying the effective Lagrangian, one can obtain the Dirac equation for nucleons and muons, and the Klein-Gordon equations for mesons. The calculations are performed in coordinate space using a mesh size of 0.01 fm and different box sizes for different muonic states, and the paring correlations are accounted in the BCS formalism with an energy gap ∆ obtained from the observed odd even mass differences for an open shell and ∆ = 0 for a closed shell.

X-ray transition energies in muonic atoms are strongly affected by the size of the nuclei, and can be used efficiently to determine the nuclear charge distribution [1,2]. A detailed introduction about muonic atoms can be found in Ref. [3]. Moreover, the muonic atom tends to play an important role in investigation on other subjects. A recent study demonstrated that muonic atoms in strong laser fields can be used to dynamically gain structure information on nuclear ground states [4]. Masafumi Koike et al. proposed a new process of µ − e − −→ e − e − in a muonic atom for a quest of charged lepton flavor violation (This violation is known to be one of the important rare processes to search for new physics beyond the standard model) in consideration of the fact that this process in a muonic atom has various significant advantages [5]. An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of proton root-mean square radius is provided by muonic hydrogen [6]. In addition, some potential synergies of combining muons with radioactive nuclei may become a new tool to be used at future RIB facilities, as suggested in Ref. [7].

The largest positive real root, assuming such exists, gives the desired result; otherwise, classical orbiting does not occur.\n\nFIG. 1 :\n1Associative ionization cross sections for collisions of two mercury atoms in the indicated states.

Once the Brueckner orbitals are computed, we solve the CI problem in the model space. The model space Hamiltonian includes the Coulomb interaction between valence electrons. We do not include so-calledscreening corrections to the Hamiltonian. As demonstrated [4], these corrections, although \n\ncomputationally expensive, are relatively insignificant for divalent atoms. \n\n\n\n\n. The results of Ellingsen et al. presumably should be of of higher accuracy since they account for core polarization; also, their value for the groundstate polarizability is in excellent agreement with the experimental value. This comparison is shown in Table IV. The triplet and singlet excited-state polarizabilties of Rosenkrantz et al. are ∼ 11% and ∼ 78% larger, respectively, than those of Ellingsen et al.. This agreement is quite satisfactory for the triplet states, but less so for the singlet states.\n\nTABLE I :\nIQuadrupole matrix elements of the excited mercury atom (Hg 6s6p) in atomic units.(a) Reduced matrix elements. \n\n3 P 0 \n3 P 1 \n3 P 2 \n1 P 1 \n\n3 P 0 \n0 \n0 \n−10.22 \n0",

The highly-energetic π − p atoms were discovered experimentally in [52], and a multicomponent structure of the energy distribution was found in [46]. Recent experiments in liquid and gaseous hydrogen [47,48] found the shape of the kinetic energy distribution to be consistent with the Coulomb mechanism. The cascade calculations [29] show that the π − p atoms with kinetic energy E ≥ 50 eV are not significantly decelerated between the Coulomb de-excitation and the nuclear reaction. For the atoms with E ≤ 20 eV the deceleration is important and the Coulomb peaks are expected to be smeared out.\n\nThe earlier calculations of the Coulomb transitions [16][17][18][19] were rather controversial. The latest calculations [20][21][22] seem to clarify the theoretical picture. This removes one of the uncertainties in the cascade calculation of the past where a Coulomb rate-tuning parameter was used to normalize the calculated high-energy component to the measurements in pionic hydrogen [29]. It is not excluded that the Coulomb de-excitation can be part of a multistep process. For instance, the formation of excited molecular states can be followed by a Coulomb-like decay [2,54,55].\n\n\nAtomic Cascade in H-D Mixtures",

[1][2][3][4] However, there have been various evidence that the positively charged muon ( + µ ), one of heavier congeners of electron ( − e ) in the group of leptons, 5 may also serve as a lighter isotope of hydrogen whereas the negatively charged muon ( − µ ), the antiparticle of + µ , may replace electron in an atom, orbiting around positively charged nucleus tightly. 6 Although both types of muons as elementary particles have found vast applications beyond the traditional muon catalyzed nuclear fusion reactions, 7,8 deserved to be called \"muon science\", 9 because of their short life time, ~2.2×10 -6 s, less was known about \"muonic chemistry\" and most of knowledge was limited to Muonium ( Mu ) (an exotic atom composed of + µ and − e ). 6 This is not an exceptional situation since tau/position, as other members of the lepton family, 5 are also unstable prone to decaying to/annihilation with electrons, leaving \"leptonic chemistry\" as a curiosity with less direct relevance with real life chemistry, 10,11 but a sub-branch of studying \"exotic\" species.

The perspective of ab initio cascade calculations is outlined.1 In the literature, it has also been called the standard cascade model (SCM).\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen heavy negative particles (µ − , π − ,p, etc.) stop in matter, they usually form exotic atoms in highly excited states with principal quantum number n ∼ m/m e where m is the reduced mass of the exotic atom and m e is the electron mass. The exotic-atom formation is followed by an atomic cascade consisting of multistep transitions to lower atomic states. For hadronic atoms, the atomic cascade is a complete life history because the hadrons get absorbed by the nuclei with high probability before reaching the ground state. Muonic atoms (where the absorption is weak) de-excite to the ground state and engage in various reactions (muon catalyzed fusion, muon transfer, molecular formation) with initial conditions determined by the atomic cascade. In both cases, the atomic cascade can reveal important information about the properties of exotic atoms and reactions with atoms in excited states. This paper, supplementing the earlier reviews [1][2][3][4], focuses on the recent progress in theoretical studies of the atomic cascade in light muonic and pionic atoms.\n\n\nMechanism Example\n\nE-dependence Refs.",

In these effective equations, a non-Coulombic potential is added to the orthodox coulomb and exchange potential energy terms, which describes the interaction of the muon and the electrons effectively and is optimized during the self-consistent field cycles. While in the two-component HF equations muon is treated as a quantum wave, in the effective HF equations it is absorbed into the effective potential and practically transformed into an effective potential field experienced by electrons. The explicit form of the effective potential depends on the nature of muon's vibrations and is derivable from the basis set used to expand the muonic spatial orbital. The resulting effective Hartree-Fock equations are implemented computationally and used successfully, as a proof of concept, in a series of the muonic molecules containing all atoms from the second and third rows of the PeriodicTable.To solve the algebraic version of the equations muon-specific gaussian basis sets are designed for both muon and surrounding electrons and it is demonstrated that the optimized exponents are quite distinct from those derived for the hydrogen isotopes. The developed effective HF theory is quite general and in principle can be used for any muonic system while it is the starting point for a general effective electronic structure theory that incorporates various types of quantum correlations into the muonic systems beyond the HF equations.KeywordsIsotope effects; ab initio electronic structure calculations; Positively charged muon; nonadiabatic effective Hamiltonian Pages 3-9: Deriving the EHF equations for [1s1p1d] muonic basis set and their computational implementation (containing Tables S1 and S2 andFigures S1-S3).

A BRIEF SUMMARY\n\nFollowing the approach in our recent work we study whether two D ( * ) s or B ( * ) s mesons can form a hadronic molecule within the B-S framework. In Ref. [30][31][32][33][34] the B-S equations were applied to the systems of one particle and one antiparticle. In Ref. [26] we studied the possible bound states of particle-particle system (two D ( * ) or B ( * ) mesons). In this work we extend this framework to the D ( * ) s or B ( * ) s systems and compute binding energy of such hadronic molecules by solving B-S equations.\n\nWe employ heavy meson chiral perturbation theory and leading order (single-meson exchange) approximation to calculate the interaction kernels of the B-S equations for the D ( * ) s or B ( * ) s systems, where η or φ is exchanged. All coupling constants are taken from relevant references. Adopting the fixed value of Λ from the analysis of T + cc under the hypothesis that T + cc is a bound state of D 0 D * + with I = 0 and J = 1 we find all these B-S equations have no solution. Then we set the binding energy ∆E = 1 MeV and test different values of Λ for two D ( * ) s or B ( * ) s systems with defined quantum number. We find for most states, a larger Λ or coupling constants are needed to form bound states. It is noted that the Λ values of B * s B * s with J P = 0 + is close to that fixed from T + cc , which suggests that such a molecular bound state may exist. Since in our calculations, the values of model parameters are estimated based on previous literature which span a relatively large range, we cannot expect all the numerical results to be very accurate. However, the major goal of this work is to qualitatively analyze whether two D ( * ) s or B ( * ) s mesons can form a molecular state. Even if the numerical estimation is not precise, our result can still provide a useful guidance for the future study of double charmed hardonic molecular state. Further theoretical and experimental works are needed for gaining a better understanding of the double charmed exotic states.",

In this paper, we extend the theory presented in Refs. 36,37 to handle this case. This theory will be applicable to a broad set of experimentally important systems, including interactions of molecules such as OH, NO, ClO, and CH with alkali-metal and other magnetically trappable atoms. As an example, we present numerical results for collisions between OH( 2 Π) and N( 4 S) in a magnetic field, with both colliding species initially in their fully spin-stretched low-field-seeking states. OH was one of the first molecules to be decelerated and trapped 19,38 , and many pioneering experiments with it have been reported. Gilijamse et al. 19 carried out a crossed-beam experiment, colliding velocity-controlled OH molecules with Xe atoms; they were able to resolve state-to-state inelastic cross sections as a function of the collision energy. Similar experiments with improved sensitivity have recently been performed for OH colliding with Ar, He, and D 2 39-41 . An experiment to collide two velocity-controlled beams, of OH and NO, is in preparation 42 .

For every protonated/sodiated nucleotide, its molecular geometry has been optimized in vacuo. All the possible prerequisites for the base-base coupling before the electron attachment have been qualitatively analyzed on the basis of ab initio quantum-chemical results obtained in our earlier work [14]. It should be noted that in the PM3 approximation, Na + ions are treated as classical point electrostatic charges. Figure 2 shows the production rates of neutral-particles vs. the relative energies for protonated and sodiated dinucleotide monocations with homo-nucleotide sequences. For the protonated dinucleotides, one of their both bases should covalently bind one proton to maintain the overall charge state of +1, except in the case of thymine (described later): the phosphate groups (which are the most acidic sites) are most probably neutralized by protonation. Meanwhile, for the sodiated dinucleotides, the number of Na + ions bound to a given dinucleotide correlates with the number of protons that can be removed from the bases. The most acidic hydrogens among the four bases are N1 in guanine and N3 in thymine: therefore, the dinucleotides containing G and T readily provide additional deprotonation sites, whereas there are no such favorable deprotonation sites for A and C.   Figure 2 shows strong resonant bumps with maxima at 4-5 eV for protonated d(GG) and d(AA). These bumps are enhanced by adding one or two Na + ions. For d(GG), the bump is further enhanced by adding three Na + ions. In contrast, for protonated d(CC), the strength of the bump is weak, and no bump at all can be observed for protonated d(TT). However, for sodiated d(TT), bumps appear, which are gradually enhanced with the addition of one and two Na + ions and are further amplified upon the addition of three or four Na + .\n\n\nResults and discussion",

Particularly, the formed AIM of muonic helium are very similar to the AIM formed by the orthodox isotopes of hydrogen thus neglecting its microsecond life time, it seems safe to claim that muonic helium behaves exactly in the same way as one expects from a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This is an interesting observation since other exotic heavy isotopes of hydrogen discovered recently, [44][45][46][47] including H H H 6 5 4 , , and H 7 , have extremely short lifetimes, ~10 -22 s, and probably not amenable to kinetic experiments similar to those performed recently on species containing muonic helium. 24 However, extrapolating present MC-QTAIM analysis to larger masses, it seems safe to claim that atomic basins containing such heavy particles are not much different from the AIM produced from the orthodox isotopes of hydrogen. The case of AIM containing + µ seems more tricky since its associated AIM behave rather differently; though, even in this case one may yet claim that we are faced with a light isotope of hydrogen with a smaller electronegativity (a more radical approach will be placing + µ in a new box in the periodic table before hydrogen though in a very recent authoritative review on the \"chemistry\" of + µ it has been described as just the \"second\" radioisotope of hydrogen). 48 Although More MC-QTAIM analysis on larger molecules containing + µ is also needed to firmly distinguish the similarities and dissimilarities of the AIM containing + µ and the other hydrogen isotopes.\n\n\n. 4 3",

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn terms of the constituent quark model proposed by Gellmann [1] and Zweig [2,3], hadrons can be classified either as mesons made of a pair of quark and anti-quark or baryons made of three quarks, the property of which can be well described in the conventional quark model [4,5]. However, more and more the so-called exotic states beyond the traditional quark model have been discovered experimentally, starting from X(3872) in 2003 [6]. To clarify the nature of these exotic states, a lot of theoretical interpretations were proposed, such as hadronic molecules, compact multiplet quark sates, kinetic effects, and so on (for recent reviews, see Refs. [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] ). Among them, the hadronic molecular picture is rather popular because many (if not all) of these states are located near the mass threshold of a pair of conventional hadrons. Nevertheless, how to confirm the molecular nature of these exotic states remains a big challenge for both experiments and theory.",

Although the first two signals are not resolved in the frequency domain for T> 10 K, it is possible to fit both components in the time domain by fixing A 1 = A 2 . In eq. 4 the envelops of the oscillating functions are exponentials. We also tried Gaussian damping, but it was not possible to discriminate between exponential or Gaussian damping terms. The resulting frequencies ν 1 and ν 2 are almost not influenced by the choice of the envelop function. For B ext || c we have analysed the spectra using the following two-component depolarisation function, G c (t):From the measured frequencies we have determined the Knight shift K=(B loc /B ext )-1=(ν/ν 0 )-1,where B loc is the field at the muon localisation site and ν 0 = γ µ B ext /2π. The Knight shift components for B ext || a, K a, ν 1 (T) and K a, ν 2 (T), and for B ext || c, K c, ν (T), follow a Curie-Weiss behaviour in a limited T-range only (50-100 K). For T> 100 K the difference, ν 1 -ν 2 , between the two frequencies (B ext || a) becomes smaller and above 150 K the data can only be fitted with one frequency. This indicates that slow muon hopping takes place for T> 100 K. As the muon diffuses, it experiences an average local magnetic field.Next we compare the Knight shift with the susceptibility in order to determine the dipolar tensor components, A ii . The susceptibility was measured on a different crystal using a SQUID magnetometer. For T> 30 K χ(T) follows a modified Curie-Weiss law, χ=χ 0 +C/(T-θ). The data are in excellent agreement with the results reported in Ref.30.

The expectation value of H is contaminated by the CM energy, while the expectation value of H int is not. We notice that in the case of mono-muonic hydrogen, the contaminating contribution of the CM energy, although significant, is almost independent of c, as Figure 5 illustrates. We remark that, in the case of the mono-muonic hydrogen, the minimum of the expectation value of H is about −49.613 a.u. both for c = 0 and for c = 0.3. This means that, for 0 < c < 0.3 the system is not properly described by any one of these configurations. The appropriate description is then provided by a resonance between those configurations. A similar observation applies to the expectation value of H int , which is −58.91 a.u. for c = 0 and −58.9 a.u. for c = 0.28 a.u. (see Figures 3 and 5). It seems very likely that the resonance effect will lead to a weak binding between the non-muonic hydrogen atom and the muonic hydrogen atom, since the expectation values of H and H int for c = 0 almost coincide with the respective values for c = ∞. In the resonant state, the two protons are very close to each other, which is related to the catalytic property of the muon for fusion reactions. In the case of non-muonic hydrogen, the contaminating contribution of the CM energy is extremely small; see Figure 6. On the other hand, in the case of dimuonic hydrogen, the contaminating contribution of the CM energy fluctuates a lot with c, (see Figures 2 and 7). Nevertheless, the binding energy is not strongly affected by the CM energy. Indeed, the calculated binding energy is 7.63 a.u. if the CM correction is not taken into account and is 7.38 a.u. otherwise.\n\n\nOutline",

It is suggested that it is valid only for di-hydrogen.\n\nGreat interest in µ-mesonic molecules arose in connection with cold fusion processes.\n\nMuons are leptons, like electrons, but are about 200 times heavier. If an electron is replaced by a muon in a hydrogen molecule, the nuclei become about 200 times closer [3], and when the nuclei are so near to each other, the probability of nuclear fusion increases enormously.\n\nOur aim is to understand the stability of the µ-mesonic molecules on the basis of simple models satisfying the important requirement of consistently describing atoms and molecules of hydrogen. By consistent description we mean that the schematic model wave function of the µ-mesonic molecule should contain as factors the schematic model wave functions of the atoms, at least for some particular value of parameters specifying correlations between electrons and protons, or between muons and protons, belonging to distinct atoms.\n\nIt should be noted at this point that the idea of allocating wave-functions to nuclei as well as electrons is not new, with the reader being addressed to the literature [8,9,10] for details.",

As is evident from Table 4  / − , the total ab initio computed electric dipoles increase. In contrast to the populations and energies, the electric dipole of each species is decomposed to various charge transfer (CT) and polarization (P) (sometimes also called first moments) contributions, only the latter is composed of basin contributions. 35 The CT dipoles in Table 5 have been calculated for each species assuming the (3, -3) CPs of the PCPs' one-densities as the centers of the local coordinate systems, 35,36 each located in a separate basin (Figures 3 and 4), while the basin P dipoles have also been computed employing the same local coordinate systems. Using these local coordinate systems, the P dipoles of the PCP's distributions are null and just the electronic P dipoles contribute to the total dipole of each species composed of two basins denoted by A (encompassing the lighter PCP) and B (encompassing the heavier PCP). 35 Accordingly, the final equation relating total electric dipole to CT and P contributions is considerably simplified yielding:   Table 5 reveals the fact that CT dipoles as well as the P dipoles of muonic basins are large in this series, though counteracting, revealing the origin of the aforementioned large total dipole moments.

[19] suggested that the mesonic resonance states π, σ, ρ, A 1 go smoothly through T c with increasing temperature, simply changing from being chirally broken to chirally restored. The same general idea is retained in the resonance gas picture [20] in which resonances in addition to the above hadrons are included so as to make the transition smooth. As noted in Sec. 2, the π, σ, ρ, A 1 can be constructed as vibrations in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio language below T c so that our present scenario is not new in making them vibrations above T c . However, it is easier to do the thermodynamics above T c , because theqq molecules form a degenerate unperturbed configuration, so that all of the strength ends up in the collective state, none in the noncollective ones. This degeneracy endows the ∼ > T c region with greatly enhanced interaction strengths.\n\nThe pressure must be nonnegative at T c . This is achieved in the resonance gas picture by introducing mesonic excited states as well as resonances, as well as other hadrons than we consider.\n\nIndeed, at T c we will need additional degrees of freedom because in order to bring the ρ and A 1 masses to zero we must polarize them in the time direction, and this leaves us with only 8 degrees of freedom, which together with the π and σ give 16 at T c . As noted, with this degeneracy we have only ∼ 1 boson/fm 3 at T c , which in Boltzmann approximation gives a pressure of p = 0.9T c /fm 3 = 158MeV/fm 3 , a bit higher when calculated in detail for bosons. Now in BGLR [14] we found that ∼ half of the ∼ 500 MeV bag constant was melted in the soft glue by T = T c , ∼ > half remaining in the epoxy, or hard glue. The −250 MeV/fm 3 contribution from this to the pressure leaves us with a deficit of ∼ 100 MeV/fm 3 .",

Data from muonic hydrogen, with the assumption that the muon and electron interact with the proton at short distances in exactly the same way, are so inconsistent with the other data that they have not been included in the determination of r p and thus do not have an influence on R ∞ . The 2010 value of R ∞ exceeds the 2006 value by the fractional amount 1.1 × 10 −12 and the 2010 value of r p exceeds the 2006 value by 0.0007 fm.\n\nC. Outline of the paper Section II briefly recalls some constants that have exact values in the International System of Units (SI) (BIPM, 2006), the unit system used in all CODATA adjustments. Sections III-XII discuss the input data with a strong focus on those results that became available between the 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2010 closing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjustments. It should be recalled (see especially Appendix E of CODATA-98) that in a least-squares analysis of the constants, both the experimental and theoretical numerical data, also called observational data or input data, are expressed as functions of a set of independent variables called directly adjusted constants (or sometimes simply adjusted constants). The functions themselves are called observational equations, and the least-squares procedure provides best estimates, in the least-squares sense, of the adjusted constants. In essence, the procedure determines the best estimate of a particular adjusted constant by automatically taking into account all possible ways of determining its value from the input data. As already noted, the recommended values of those constants not directly adjusted are calculated from the adjusted constants.",

The results of 11 of these are given in Tables 43 to 45 and are discussed in the following paragraphs. Because the adjusted value of the Rydberg constant R ∞ is essentially the same for all six adjustments summarized in Table 43 and equal to that of adjustment 4 of Table 45, the value of R ∞ is not listed in Table 43. It should also be noted that adjustment 4 of all three tables is the same adjustment.\n\nAdjustment 1. This initial adjustment includes all of the input data, four of which have normalized residuals r i with absolute magnitudes significantly greater than 2; the values of r i for these four data resulting from adjustments 1-6 are given in Table 44. Consistent with the previous discussion, the four most inconsistent items are the molar volume of silicon V m (Si), the quotient h/m n d 220 (W04), the XROI measurement of the {220} lattice spacing d 220 (NR3), and the NIST-89 value of Γ ′ p−90 (lo). All other input data have values of r i considerably less than 2, except those for νp 3 He (32, 31 : 31, 30) and νp 3 He (36, 33 : 34, 32), items C20 and C22, for which r 20 = 2.09 and r 22 = 2.06. However, the self sensitivity coefficients S c for these input data are considerably less than 0.01; hence, because their contribution to the adjustment is small, their marginally large normalized residuals are of little concern. In this regard, we see from Table 44 that three of the four inconsistent data have values of S c considerably larger than 0.01; the exception is Γ ′ p−90 (lo) with S c = 0.0099, which is rounded to 0.010 in the table.",

Introducing a vertical slit before the grating restricts the range of molecular velocities that can contribute to the pattern at a certain height of the detector. This changes ∆v and thus increases the longitudinal coherence length. Thus, we can observe more diffraction orders.\n\n10.

In such a double-slit scattering experiment, however, there is no experimental way to identify from the detected photon or electron, either predictively or retrodictively, the path of the projectile, i.e. there is no experimental way to determine through which slit each projectile passed because the slit distance is smaller than the de Broglie wave length of the projectile. The photon or electron carries no measurable fingerprint in which slit it was scattered. Therefore, the detected scattering distribution as a function of the transverse momenta must be calculated from a super-position of the wave packets of the two non-distinguishable pathways, yielding the well-known interference pattern. In his famous discussions with Bohr, Einstein argued if one could measure the tiny transverse momentum given to the slit system after single projectile scattering one could measure through which slit it passed and the interference would disappear (Bohr, 1949).\n\nIn the SGE, on the other hand, one can clearly identify, in the retrodictive case, the spin orientation of each atom. The process of momentum exchange of each single atom with the apparatus proceeds in a very different manner in the SGE than in the case of photon or electron scattering in a double slit system. When the atoms enter the first \"very thin layer\" of the magnetic field (at the entrance) the directional quantization of the two spin states must occur extremely sudden, but without any measurable amount of momentum exchange similar to the photon or electron case. When the spin oriented atoms are then passing through the SG magnetic field each atom is continuously accelerated in z-direction due to the acting force µ ∂B ∂z(t) . The final transverse momentum in z direction ±p z0 of each spin state after leaving the magnet is ±p z = µ ∂B ∂z(t) dt, where the limits of the integral are t = 0 and t = T F . This maximum value (which has always been found in all the numerous SGE experiments performed so far) can only be reached if the atomic magnetic moment µ always points in the + or −z-direction during the entire passage through the magnetic field. The final transverse momentum in zdirection, measured by the detector, is a direct measure of the time-integral over the acting force. The SG apparatus measures only this transverse momentum and never spin orientations.",

However, since these partial waves all impinge under different angles, they will cause diffraction patterns that are shifted with respect to each other.

For neutrons this requires 'only' to adjust position, momentum, energy, and spin, which is nonetheless experimentally hard. 66 For atoms, this requirement seems to become much more demanding -because atoms have infinitely many internal states. However, atoms can be extremely well controlled by laser light, both in their motion and in their internal states. It has thus become almost routine in advanced research labs to prepare large ensembles of atoms at nK temperatures and all of them in only a single internal state. In these Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), all atoms are indistinguishable. They all contribute to the same interference pattern. However, the de Broglie wavelength is always that of a single atom alone and removing one atom from the ensemble does not destroy the BEC. To first order, even in these ultra-cold quantum degenerate gases one probes single particle interference. However, higher order coherence has also been studied, meanwhile. 67 In all quantum interference experiments with complex molecules so far, every single molecule interfered with itself.

This might lead to relaxation via photon emission. Photon emission entails three complementary processes: Firstly, the molecule provides some information about its position. From Bohr's complementary principle we know that you cannot have particle character (position) and wave character (interference) at the same time. Secondly, we can follow Heisenberg's microscope argument for motivating his position-momentum uncertainty relation: if we want to resolve a very small distance, we need light of very short wavelength, incident from the broadest possible angle. This means that a position measurement will add a momentum perturbation. Thirdly, we can argue that the emission of a photon entangles the molecule quantum mechanically with the environment. It turns out, that these three pictures are all quantitatively equivalent.\n\nFor undergraduate teaching, Heisenberg's microscope argument is often the most intuitive of all three. If a single photon cannot resolve the different paths the molecule takes through the grating, scattering more photons can actually provide more optical information: The barycenter of a point spread function can be measured ever more precisely, the more photons are scattered. In Heisenberg's words, this will however, induce a momentum diffusion, which after scattering of many photons will destroy the interference.\n\nThermal decoherence has actually been observed in molecule interference experiments. 68 Note, that in complex molecules, rotational emission typically occurs in the microwave region, while vibrational photons have usually a wavelength between 3 − 20 m, depending on the bond strengths. Following Abbe's diffraction and microscopy theory, a single photon of even 3 µm can at best resolve a path separation of 1.5 µm in high vacuum. The emission or scattering of a single infrared or microwave photon hence cannot destroy the interference pattern.",

The expression in Eq. (3) is justified for gratings whose thickness is about 10 4 times the size of the diffracted particles. 38 For ultra-thin gratings, however, the molecule can actually be thicker than the grating itself. 39 Thus, the approach to the grating and the departure from it also have to be considered. 40 To fully describe the interaction we would have to characterize the molecule, the grating, and the interaction between them to a high level. 40,41 Such an analysis is very demanding: Each molecule consisting of n atoms has 3n − 6 vibrations and many (often up to 500) rotational levels excited. Flexible molecules can adopt a number of different conformations, which may interconvert within picoseconds. And even for rigid molecules such as PcH 2 , the polarizability is often not isotropic. In consequence, the force depends on the orientation of the molecule during the transit through the grating. Moreover, charges implanted in the grating material may lead to an attractive force several times stronger than expected. 40 Here, we resort to a phenomenological analysis: Close to the grating walls, the phase shift becomes so large that small position changes cause large phase fluctuations and the interference terms are averaged out. In a few nanometer distance the molecule may even be adsorbed by the grating. 42 Hence, we divide the slit into two regions: In the center φ is small and multi-slit diffraction is possible. Close to the grating walls, however, the molecule cannot contribute to the diffraction pattern any more. In this picture the influence of the van der Waals interactions reduces the slit width from s geo to an effective slit width s eff . 38 There are several options to modify the van der Waals interactions. First, altering the grating material changes the coefficient C 3 , which determines the phase shift. Second, one can minimize the grating's thickness T -ultimately to just a single layer of atoms.

The second term 2Re(Z * 1 Z 2 ) describes the interference between the direct and the single scattering waves, and it partly includes the double-slit effect because Z 2 has the above two different path. 2Re(Z * 1 Z 2 ) cannot be compared with classical double-slit because the direct amplitude Z 1 is characteristic of photoemission. First we study in the case of linear polarization e ∥ z. Angular distributions of |Z 2 | 2 for O 1s photoelectrons from H 2 O are shown in figure 2. We observe prominent double-slit peaks in the direction of z in low-energy region (ϵ k ≤ 300 eV), whereas a small peak is observed at ϵ k = 500 eV. This behavior is explained by the sharp forward peak in the differential cross section (DCS) from a H atom, as shown in figure 3. In the direction of z, the scattering angle is about 50 • , and the DCS is nearly zero at ϵ k = 500 eV. The ratio of |Z 2 | 2 /|Z 1 | 2 is about 1/20 even at ϵ k = 100    [9].

Coherence\n\nIn order to observe multi-slit diffraction, the wavelets along different paths from the source to the detector need to have defined phase relations, i.e. they need to be coherent. Mathematically, coherence is defined as the normalized correlation function of the waves in space and time. There are several examples for coherent sources: lasers in optics or Bose-Einstein condensates in matter-wave science, where all photons or atoms are highly correlated over macroscopic distances in space and time. But even thermal light and molecular beams can be prepared to be coherent.\n\nIt is often useful to distinguish between transverse and longitudinal coherence. As for laser radiation, they describe the distance along the propagation direction (longitudinal) and perpendicular to it (transverse) over which the phase of the matter-wave is correlated.\n\nTransverse coherence can be visualized as the uncertainty in the particle's transverse position, which makes it impossible to predict through which grating slit the particle will go. Since both the transverse coherence function and the diffraction pattern behind a single slit are described by a Fourier transform, they share the same functional form: (sin(x)/x) 2 . 31 If we define the transverse coherence width X T by the distance between the first order minima of this coherence function, we find X T = 2L 1 λ dB /s, which grows inversely proportional with the source width s (see Appendix C).\n\nLongitudinal coherence is a measure of spectral purity of the beam and thus depends on the distribution of molecular velocities. If the distribution is too broad, the interference pattern vanishes, as soon as the constructive interference of one wavelength overlaps with the destructive interference of another one. This definition leads to the respective coherence length X L = λ 2 /∆λ. It differs by a factor of 1/2π from a definition based on propagating Gaussian wave packets. 32 However, it has proven surprisingly useful in real-world experiments, which are not necessarily well described by Gaussian wave packets (see Appendix C).\n\nWhile the transverse coherence grows with the distance behind the source, this is not the case for the longitudinal coherence X L because the spectrum does not change in free flight. We can, however, increase X L by spectral filtering, that is, by selecting molecular velocities.\n\n\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP",

The possibility to realize even complex structures with nanometer precision in these materials led to the fabrication of slits 6 and gratings, 12 sieves 13,14 and holograms. 15 They are used to focus beams of neutral helium 16 and study weakly bound clusters 17,18 as well as higher-order matter-wave interference. 11,19 Nanomechanical gratings became essential for three-grating interferometers with electrons, 20,21 neutrons, 22 atoms, 23 and molecules [24][25][26] up to masses beyond 25,000 u -and even for experiments with antimatter. 27 Here we put molecule diffraction at nanomechanical masks into a pedagogical context.

To visualize the wave-particle duality we use fluorescence imaging: Each molecule can be identified as a single particle on the detector and a large number of molecules then leads to the emergence of a diffraction pattern, as shown before for single photons 29 and electrons. 30 While diffraction of molecules and light share many fundamental features, we also see pronounced differences resulting from the particles' mass and electronic structure. Molecules fall visibly in the gravitational field and they interact with the grating walls because of van der Waals forces. These forces are studied by rotating the grating relative to the molecular beam, which changes with the average distance between the molecules and the slit wall. The role of the internal molecular structure opens numerous interesting questions, which are treated as problems and solutions for class work in the Appendix. Like many textbooks, we discuss diffraction through a thin mask in the far-field approximation, that is, in the Fraunhofer regime. In this regime the curvature of the wavefronts can be neglected, and the diffracted intensity pattern is described by the Fourier transform of the transmission function of the diffracting mask",

A band filter transmitting in the wavelength region from 700 to 725 nm is used to separate the fluorescence from the laser light, and the image is recorded with an electron multiplying (EM) CCD camera.\n\nIn the experiments we use phthalocyanine (cf. Fig. 1) due to its high thermal stability and fluorescence quantum yield. This allows detection of single molecules with high contrast, which is required to visualize even weak signals. 33 Furthermore, PcH 2 is non-polar and therefore essentially unperturbed by residual charges in the mechanical masks. 34 We use a thermal beam, containing a wide range of molecular velocities and thus de Broglie wavelenghts. If all these velocities were to overlap at the detection screen, it would obscure many of the details present in the diffraction pattern. To prevent this, we restrict different velocities to different regions of the quartz plate. For that purpose, we use a horizontal delimiter S y (see Fig. 3). In combination with the source, it defines the free-flight parabolas of the molecules in the presence of gravitational acceleration g. As the free-fall distance H = g(L 1 + L 2 ) 2 /(2v 2 ) depends on the molecular velocity v, slow molecules fall further than fast ones and thus they are separated at the position of the detector.

It was nearly impossible to get a controlled beam with enough intensity passing through all three holes. In the first days of February 1922, Stern and Gerlach met at a small conference in Göttingen (Friedrich and Herschbach, 2003) and decided to exchange one circular aperture by a rectangular slit. This modification proved immediately to be the right thing to do. A few days later, in the night from February 7 th to 8 th , 1922, the SGE was successful (Gerlach and Stern, 1922b). 12 See Figure 3 for a sketch of the eventually successful SGE setup. Being a night worker, only Gerlach had supervised the experiment this night. A PhD student Wilhelm Schütz joined him in the morning of February 8 th (Schütz, 1969). Stern was already back in Rostock.

The molecules get close only to the edges of the grating, as shown in Fig. 5. This effect has been used to characterize nanomechanical gratings, 43,44 and the ensuing reduction in slit width was key to study weakly bound clusters. 45 In these experiments the maximum angle of 42 • was limited by the membrane thickness. 44 Here we use an ultra-thin grating with a thickness of T = 21 ± 2 nm and a large opening fraction to achieve rotation angles up to 60 • .

Then the coherent sum of two single scattering amplitudes in equation (5) vanishes at the direction parallel to z axis. The factor cosθ α ∝ Y 10 (R α ) comes from G L10 in equation (3), which exists in all power of X. Thus the XPD intensity vanishes along z axis, even if the spherical wave effect and the full multiple scatterings are taken into account.\n\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAt low and intermediate energies the double-slit effects have appreciable contribution only when DCS is non-negligible at the bisecting angle. We should note that the interference term 2Re(Z * 1 Z 2 ) can make negative contribution at the expected direction and can cancel the doubleslit effects.

Ohmura, Quantum theory of scattering, Prentice Hall, 1st edn, 1962, p. 50).The design of electron microscopes for energies up to 3MeV has been described in detail in the literature, and several 1 MeV machines are currently operating.The difficulties in designing a diffraction camera to operate above 1 MeV are likely to be: 1.The design of the required area detector.Those currently used in 1MeV TEMs should be carefully studied, based on 45 degree mirrors.2. The very small Bragg angles, and correspondingly powerful very high current lenses needed to magnify these patterns up to the pixel size of the detectors.(Quadrupoles might be used instead, to reduce current.)3.",

Kam can disentangle the orientational disorder (see Kirian, J. Phys.B: At.Mol.Opt.Phys., 45, 223001 (2012)).This requires a coherence width shorter than the distance between molecules.If the plan is for a coherent beam whose size is about equal to that of one molecule (\"isolated molecules\"?), using a pulsed photoeld source and lenses to demagnify the beam to nanometer dimensions, then there will not be much signal, or even one scattered electron per picosecond, despite the high elastic cross section (see question 609).",

It is accepted that our Solar radiation is; 5% ultraviolet (300-370 nm), 43% visible (370-740 nm), and 52% infrared [13].

Traditionalists claim that the act of placing a thermometer into the vacuum, is the act of giving that vacuum a temperature. Certainly, the energy associated with thermal radiation is generally minute, when compared to the thermal energy of molecular motions. Therefore, more often than not, ignoring a system's thermal radiation, enables one to still accurately calculate a system's total thermal energy. This does not mean that a vacuum has no temperature.\n\nWhen a spectrum of photons strikes matter, the photons are either, (a) reflected by the matter's surface, where Published on March 9, 2020. reflected visible spectrum photons give the matter its color, (b) transmitted through the matter, i.e., do not interact with the matter except for the photon's refraction, or (c) absorbed into the matter becoming molecular vibrations within that matter, i.e., thermal phonons.\n\nA blackbody is considered to be the perfect absorber, which is to say that all incident radiation is absorbed by the matter thus explaining its blackness, e.g., carbon black is considered as the perfect absorber, i.e., its absorptivity approaches unity. A perfect absorber by definition is also a perfect emitter, and this is Stewart's Law [3], i.e., a perfect emitter's emissivity also approaches unity.

It is probably the case that the thermal energy from our Sun's insolation can be approximated by some linear function of temperature. Hence, our Sun's radiance may help us understand temperature's linear functionality, as witness here on Earth, with our atmosphere being the massive heat sink/bath to which most other systems are compared.\n\nClarity as to the exact meaning concerning thermal energy remains awkward.

WHAT IS THERMAL ENERGY?\n\nThermal energy resides within condensed matter, as both intermolecular vibrations that are between molecules, and intramolecular vibrations that are between the various atoms within a molecule. A better definition may be that thermal energy consists of a spectrum of thermal photons (thermal radiation) whose wavelengths are sufficiently long that they are readily absorbed by condensed matter plus any phonons that are associated with molecular vibrations (both inter and intra). Of course, a most rudimentary definition being that thermal energy is heat.\n\nHere on Earth, thermal energy primarily involves frequencies at, and/or close to the infrared spectrum with the emphasis on the \"thermal infrared\" [aka mid infrared: (3μm < λ < 8μm)] and into the far infrared [aka long infrared (8μm < λ < 15μm)].\n\nShorter wavelength photons, such as those in the near infrared (740nm < λ < 3μm) and those considered as visible light (380nm < λ < 740nm) can also contribute as thermal energy, e.g., when they are absorbed by matter.

INTRODUCTION\n\nTraditionally in thermodynamics the notion of thermal energy lacks the precision of clarity. One considers temperature (T) as the parameter that relates to the kinematic motions at the molecular level in most matter. This actually forms the basis of statistical thermodynamics, as can be found in most contemporary books [1,2]. Statistical arguments are based upon the kinematics of matter, hence the bizarre notion that all vacuums have no temperature, has become accepted. When measuring a system's temperature, a thermometer is placed into thermal contact with that system. Thermal equilibrium occurs once the influx of thermal energy equals the efflux between both the thermometer, and the system. This actually forms the basis of the transitive property known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics which states that \"If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other\" [1, pg 282]. Intuitively, the third system may be considered a thermometer.",

Arguably at such temperatures the energy associated with the surrounding atmosphere will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a system at 300 K radiates thermal centered blackbody energy, which disperses into the atmosphere, whose thermal radiation energy is clearly a linear function of temperature.\n\nSimilarly, the kinematic energies of the atmospheric gases are influenced by their absorption of the surrounding atmosphere's thermal radiation. This occurs even though they are not necessarily in a fully enclosed system, as is used to calculate their heat capacities and their relations to kinetic theory. This applies whether it be the traditional, or the more exacting kinetic theory developed by this author [11,12].\n\nInterestingly, at T=3 K, the blackbody radiation is dominated by microwave radiation, which is not exactly what one considers, as being true/pure thermal energy. It becomes increasingly obvious that as T→0, any clear relationship between temperature and thermal energy density will be lost.\n\nOf interest, the traditional assertion is that the heat capacities are not constant for all temperature regimes, e.g., heat capacity falters as T→0. One can now consider that it is not the notion of heat capacity that falters, rather it is our concept of temperature that collapses. Of course, this raises the question of, \"when is a system's temperature no longer directly proportional to its thermal energy density?\" At this time, the answer is really a guess, 10 K, 100 K, 250 K. Clearly, the relationships between the thermal energy density, and blackbody radiation is not the same for all temperature regimes.\n\n\nXIII. IMPLICATIONS TO GLOBAL WARMING\n\nThis author has previously challenged traditional assertions concerning climate change [10]. \"Does what was discussed herein change our modelling for global warming?\"\n\nConsider that our Sun's insolation is better depicted by Fig. 2, than Fig. 1. Therefore, the Sun's insolation is actually dominated by thermal photons, that being at infra-red frequencies. Such thermal photons are readily adsorbed and then radially re-radiated by most all of our atmospheric gases, including the so-called greenhouse gases.",

This would be similar to how ozone in the upper atmosphere protects us from UV radiation.\n\nIt raises the question as to \"do the greenhouse gases in the upper atmosphere actually heat or cool our planet?\" It would certainly help explain why Earth's thermosphere is so hot.\n\nIf true, then this adds credence to the idea that it is man's actual activities that are to blame for global warming rather than the so-called greenhouse effect [10]. By man's activities I mean the heat created/generated by our actual activities i.e., the powering of, and movements of such things like cars, planes, trains etc.\n\nIt must be understood that the consideration of this rewriting of the science should be a priority, especially in light of the fact that this changes our understanding of climate change, that arguably being the biggest issue facing mankind.\n\nI recently saw a show on public TV titled, \"Climate change by the numbers\" (by BBC). They discussed that based upon statistics that there is over a 95% chance that Earth's recent warming is due to man's activities. Of course, they then wrongly assumed that the accepted green-house effect science was correct. The mistake is founded in the infrared spectrometry mistake discussed in this paper, and my other paper [10], i.e., mistake being the subtraction of blanks during calibration in infrared spectrometry.\n\nIt becomes rather obvious that a gas's ability to absorb thermal energy should be based upon their heat capacities and not their infrared spectrums. At least not on the infrared spectrums in their current forms.\n\n\nXIV. NEW THERMODYNAMICS\n\nThis author previously discussed the concept behind his new thermodynamics in this journal [9]. Concerning global warming I would emphasize, \"Never forget: Intermolecular collisions are inelastic, therefore most all forced changes to our atmosphere's natural state will result in its heating.\" This means that the movements of electric cars will also heat our planet, probably not quite to the same degree as the internal combustion engine, but the true answer will lay in how the electricity is generated.\n\nOur reality remains climate change is due to Man's activities, and this must be addressed.\n\n\nXV.

This was avoided by Planck's realization that electromagnetic radiation is quantized, i.e., that being the photon. Leaving the details to others, this has also led to the concept that blackbody radiation can only be mathematically related to crystalline condense matter [3].\n\n\nIII. INTRODUCTION: EMISSIVITY VS ABSORPTIVITY\n\nAn object with no internal heat source is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, when that object emits as much radiation energy as it absorbs. Consider a thermometer placed in a vacuum filled with blackbody radiation. When in thermal equilibrium, based upon (2) the measured temperature is:\n= ( / ) 1/4(3)\nAgain, ask did the vacuum have a temperature prior to the placement of the thermometer into it? Based upon (3), I would argue that it had a temperature. Of course, this assumes that the vacuum is sufficiently immense that its total thermal radiation is significantly greater than the total thermal energy that was contained within the thermometer, prior to its placement. As previously stated, the above contravenes traditional assertions?\n\n\nIV. INTRODUCTION: TEMPERATURE VS THERMAL ENERGY",

There is also another result for which we are indebted to the mathematical solution of the problem of terrestrial temperature. The effect of internal heat on the earth's superficial temperature must have been, during a long period, constantly decreasing, as already stated. Also the rate at which the internal heat decreases as the depth beneath the earth's surface increases, must, for a like period of time, have been constantly decreasing. The present effect of the internal heat, as above-stated, is about ~oth of a degreee ; and the rate of increase of temperature below the earth's surface is about 1 ~ F. for every 60 feet. Now we learn from mathematical investigation that this effect of the internal heat on the superficial temperature bears a constant ratio to the rate of increase just mentioned. Consequently, knowing this ratio at the present time, we can ascertain the rate at which the temperature must have increased in descending, at any past geological epoch at which the effect of the earth's internal heat on the superficial temperature was of any assigned amount. Thus, when the superficial temperature was raised 1 ~ F., twenty times the present amount, by this cause, the descending rate of increase must have been twenty times as great as at present, about 20 ~ F. for every 60 feet; and, if the superficial temperature were thus raised about 10 ~ F., the temperature at the depth of 60 feet would, according to the same law, exceed 200 ~ F., and all but surface-springs would be springs of boiling water. This physical state of our planet would scarcely perhaps be deemed consistent with the conditions of animal life at the more recent geological epochs.",

Are we to believe that \"polyatomic gas molecules do not adsorb thermal radiation, i.e., the above vibrational energy is all attained from what, their collisions with wall molecules?\" Such an assertion is troublesome, especially when one contemplates all the various shapes, and sizes of gas molecules.\n\nThere remains only one viable solution, which explains why most polyatomic gases adhere to (14). That is as follows. All polyatomic gas molecules absorb and, then reradiate thermal radiation, as part of their vibrational energy. So, the next question becomes, \"is this thermal radiation, actually blackbody radiation?\"\n\nAnswering yes, then one begins to fully understand why there are such strong discrepancies between their heat capacities, and the traditionally accepted infrared spectrums of so many polyatomic gases. For example, it is traditionally thought that homonuclear gases have no absorption spectra in the infrared [10], even though they all clearly absorb thermal energy, as indicated by their heat capacities [11,12].\n\nOne must conclude that all polyatomic gases adsorb, and then re-radiate infrared thermal radiation, when in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, even when inside of a spectrometer. This is part of any polyatomic gas' vibrational energy, and that this is infrared thermal radiation, as defined by the Stephen-Boltzmann law, i.e., blackbody radiation!

The theoretical mistakes have been re-enforced by the subtraction of blanks in infrared spectrometry.\n\nHeat capacities clearly demonstrate that gases, liquids and solids (both amorphous and crystalline) all can, and will adsorb/radiate their surrounding thermal/blackbody radiation, most often in rather similar manners.\n\nThermal energy, was considered as the energy that causes molecular vibrations (both inter and intra). This then raises the question as to \"is thermal energy a form of blackbody radiation?\" The answer is probably that not all thermal energy is necessarily blackbody.\n\nAlthough, thermal energy is not always blackbody, molecular vibrations will result in blackbody radiation. It has been hypothesized that this is all due to their inelastic molecular collisions (both inter and intra), i.e., blackbody radiation is the spectrum that is a result of inelastic molecular collisions. This would explain temperature functionality of blackbody radiation, i.e., higher temperature, the greater the impacts between molecules, and hence the greater the mean frequency of the resultant radiation due to these inelastic collisions.\n\nIt should be reemphasized that thermal equilibrium does not mean that matter emits the exact same spectrum that it absorbs, rather thermal equilibrium means that the flux/rate of thermal energy emitted equals the rate of energy absorbed, for any system without an internal heat source.\n\nAs was previously discussed, the energy of thermal/blackbody radiation tends to be insignificant when compared to the energy associated with the kinematics of matter for most systems. So much so, that the energy associated with the radiation often can be approximated as being zero, when calculating a system's total thermal energy.",

In July, on the contrary, the mean sea-temperature at the Irish Lightship is 56'3°, or 4° below the mean temperature of the air in Dublin (60'3°). From these figures it is clear that the proximity of the sea is a source of warmth in winter and of coolness in summer. The isothermals indicative of the mildest British climate in winter are seen enveloping Ireland in January. The veteran Scottish meteorologist, Dr. Alexander Buchan, whose recent death we all deplore, shows that the lowest temperature in winter is found in the interior towards the north-east, or lee, side of the island ; and from tllis central area, in which the January mean does not exceed 40° F. (4'4° C.), temperature rises all round, but especially towards the southwest, on advancing in which direction it rises successively to nearly 45° F. (7'2' C.).

Moreover, it would help explain what is witnessed, whether one is considering the blackbody radiation from either condensed matter, or from a polyatomic gas, i.e., the witnessed radiation is due to molecular collisions, and this creates a blackbody spectrum.\n\nCertainly, it would explain why one witnesses blackbody radiation in an enclosure, whether that enclosure is a vacuum, or is filled with a gas. Equally, it should help provide a correlation between P-T relationships and the sun's insolation. In so far as this would explain so much, at this point, it still must be taken as speculation.\n\nAnother question arises, \"to what degree is the measured solar radiance at sea level actually due to our Sun's solar influx, versus being a result of heat created during the numerous atmospheric intermolecular inelastic collisions [10,14], e.g., P-T relation [10,15]?\" It should be some combination of both.

TEMPERATURE'S LIMITS\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, at the temperatures of hot blast furnaces (T=1,800 K) the peak radiation is in the near infrared. At such high temperatures, the thermal energy density is best defined by (2), e.g., it is not a linear function of temperature. Moreover, at such high temperatures the energy density associated with the blast furnace will be significantly greater than that of the surrounding atmosphere, hence the blast furnaces thermal energy will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a blast furnace is a system whose interaction with other system's cannot be expressed in terms of a linear function of temperature. This explains the white-hot blackbody radiation witnessed from hot molten metal, even though the visible part of the spectrum remains rather small for blackbody spectrum for T=1,800 K.",

Expressed by the same unit, the quantity adopted by Sir J. Herschel as the amount of the sun's radiation, viz. that which would melt 40 feet thick of ice in a minute (at the sun's surface), is 1,280,000. The 2\\·th of this, or 64,000, expresses, therefore, the quantity which we have estimated the lime under Parker's lens to have radiated, per square foot of ita surface, at its estimated temperature of 4000° Fah. If now we calculate ita temperature by the above formula, from the estimated radiation, the result is 1166° Cent. or 2130° Fah. This is manifestly much below the real temperature, and so far below that there can be no doubt the formula of Dulong and Petit has failed. at the melting point of lime. If instead of the co-efficient 8·377 we had used the larger co-efficient 12·808 which Hopkins gives for unpolished limestone, the formula would have been reduced only 53° Cent. It best suits the direction of our inquiry to use the smallest co-efficient which Hopkins' experiments gave, since we are seeking the highest temperature which can be plausibly deduced fl'Om the sun's radiation. For ease of expression, the curve which we will imagine for representing the actual relation of radiation to temperature, the horizontal ordinate standing for the temperature and the vertical ordinate for the radiation corresponding thereto, may be called the curve of radiation. The course of this curve from the freezing point of water to a point somewhat below the boiling point of mercury is correctly marked out to us by the formula. Beyond that we have but the rough approximation which we can get by means of the above comparison, to the single point of the curve where the radiation is 2\\,th that of the sun's photosphere. The attempt, from these data, to extend the curve till it reaches the full radiation of that photosphere, must be mainly conjectural. As a bURis for the most plausible conjecture I am able to make let us assume: first, that the upward concavity of the curve of radiation, which increases very rapidly with the temperature as far as",

The latter question depends on the mechanical equivalent of this heat for a cubic foot of the layer of gas, and the two questions, together with that of the depth at which the layer would be situated below the theoretic upper limit of the atmosphere, are answered by equations (17), (18), and (19), provided we knew the value of' Ie and the value of (J in the body of gas. The less the atomic weight of the gas the greater the value of (J, and the greater the density of the layer of 54000° Fah. and the greater the quantity of heat which a cubic foot of it would give out in cooling down. I therefore base the first calculation on hydrogen as it is known to us. The value of (J is in that case about 800 feet, and the value of k about 1'4, nearly the same as in common air. These values would give for the layer of 54000° Fah. a specific gravity about '00000095 that of water, or about one 90th that of hydrogen gas at common temperature and pressure, and the mechanical equivalent of the heat that a cubic foot of the layer would give out in cooling down under pressure to absolute zero would be only about 9000 foot pounds, whereas the mechanical equivalent of the heat radiated by one square foot of the sun's surface in one minute is about 254,000,000 foot pounds.

Dalton's earliest scientific endeavours were in meteorology and astronomy, showing the influence of his earliest mentor Robinson, and his first major publication was Meteorological Observations and Essays from 1793. 15 Although the first part of the book is concerned primarily with meteorology, the Essays give an indication of his interest in chemistry, heat and gases. The first essay is entitled On the Atmosphere; its Constitution Figure, Height, &c and the fourth On the Relation between Heat and other Bodies. Dalton considered air to be a mixture of \"elastic fluids, or gasses\" including \"dephlogistated air\". That description together with subsequent references to Mr Kirwan (of whom more later) indicates that in 1793 he adhered to the phlogiston theory. This theory postulated that the substance phlogiston was found in all combustible materials and was released upon burning (or oxidation in modern terms). The phlogiston theory either ignored or used elegant circumlocutions to explain the increase in mass upon oxidation.\n\nHe joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1794 and many of his ideas were first presented as papers at its meetings. However, the critical period for Dalton and the atomic theory was in the first decade of the 19 th Century and he was exposed to the pre-eminent scientists of the day, such as Humphry Davy, when he lectured at the Royal Institution in London in 1803-1804.\n\nAfter the publication of the two volumes (three parts) of A New System of Chemical Philosophy, [16][17][18][19] his reputation in the scientific community grew, although he remained in Manchester as a lifelong bachelor. However, honours and recognition began to flow towards this humble quaker. He was elected a Corresponding Member and subsequently Foreign Associate, of the Paris Academy of Sciences, made a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford. In 1833 he was awarded a Civil Pension of £150 per annum and in 1834, the University of Edinburgh awarded him an L.L.D. Manchester eventually came to recognize the greatness of its adopted son and a statue of Dalton was commissioned from Francis Leggatt Chantrey for 2000 guineas.",

And this has led to a poorly understood science, e.g., a probably grandiose mistake in our modelling climate change upon greenhouse effect by certain gases [10].\n\nThis above subtraction of a blank is the removal of the gas's blackbody spectrum, as defined by (1). \"Could this the subtraction of the spectrometer's content's actual thermal signature?\" Let us now examine this plausibility in more depth than was previously discussed [10].\n\n\nVII. PROBLEMATIC INFRARED SPECTROMETRY\n\nIn spectrometry the gases are in thermal equilibrium, and therefore the molecules adsorb as much thermal energy, as they radiate. Therefore, concerning infrared spectrometry, one is left with two choices. Either: 1) Polyatomic gases neither adsorb, nor radiate, blackbody/thermal radiation.\n\n2) Polyatomic gases do adsorb, and then re-radiate blackbody/thermal radiation.\n\nNumber 1) is the accepted traditional assertion. This is in part based upon the mathematical narrative that limits blackbody radiation to cavities within crystalline solids.\n\nStrangely, polyatomic gas' heat capacity indicate that they all absorb thermal energy, as part of their intramolecular vibrational energy (Ev). And this vibrational energy was shown by this author to be related to the number of atoms in the molecule (n\"), its temperature (T) and Boltzmann's constant (k) by:\n̅ ≅ ( \" − 1)(14)\nEquation (14) is based upon an improved kinetic theory that is a superior fit to known heat capacities [11,12].",

The heat so received by any body so placed in the focus, must, after the body has acquired its highest temperature, be emitted from it at the same rate_ The heat so enutted will consist: first, of heat radiated into that part of space toward which the radiating surface of the body looks; secondly, of heat carried of by convection of the air; thirdly, of heat conducted away by the body supporting the body subjected to experiment; fourthly, of heat rays, if any, reflected, and not absorbed, by the body subjected to experiment. Assuming it as a reasonable conjecture that full half of all this* consists of heat radiated into the single hemisphere looking upon a flat surface, we may conclude that the body, at its highest acquired temperature, radiated not less th.an 2'.th as much heat as is radiated by an equal extent of surface of the sun's photosphere, over and above such part of that radiation as may be intercepted by the sun's atmosphere, and such rays of low intensity as are totally absorbed by our own atmosphere, the whole of which apparently cannot be great. No allowance seems necessary for the chromatic and spherical dispersion of the lenses, since the diameter of the focus is stated at half an inch, while the true diameter of the sun's image would be not less than one-third of an inch. Now we are not without the means of forming a probable approximate estimate of this temperature at which the radia~ion becomes 2~th, more or less, of that of the sun's photosphere.

IISummary.\n\nThe previously described method is made more tractable by some simplifica tions, and the diffuseness of radiations from terrestrial sources is taken into account. Preliminary estimates of the rate of cooling of the upper layers of the stratosphere, and consideration of independent observational evidence lead to the belief that mixing of the constituents is general far above the tropopause. The radiation from the stratosphere must then be less, and since the absorption of solar energy is the same, higher temperatures result. The question of the maximum temperature attainable is examined, it being governed by the rate of thermal decomposition of ozone, and the rate at which ozone is formed in the atmosphere. The assumption of radiative equilibrium is re examined in the light of the occurrence of sufficient convection to ensure mixing, but is retained. The effect of the two distributions of water vapour is illustrated by calculations for various conditions, as are also the effects of different distributions and amounts of ozone, and different zenith angles of the sun. It is concluded that plausible distributions of ozone and water vapour provide the basis for a quantitative explanation of sound wave and meteor phenomena.\n\n\nGlossary of Terminology.\n\nCoefficient of Absorption.-Suppose a parallel beam of radiation, whose intensity is I 0 passes through a thickness of gas x, and on emerging the intensity is I. Then I = I 0 10-0*, where a is the coefficient of absorption. For ozone x is measured in centimetres of the pure gas at N.T.P. ; for water-vapour it is the thickness in centimetres of the layer of water which would result if the vapour were all condensed.\n\nAbsorption.-This is the ratio of the energy absorbed to the incident energy, and is therefore (I0 -I)/I0 = 1 -10-aX.",

Frequency and linewidth fluctuations and frequency calibration problems associated with such lasers were overcome by starting with a cw \"seed\" laser beam of frequency ν cw , known with u r < 4 × 10 −10 through its stabilization by an optical frequency comb, and then amplifying the intensity of the laser beam by a factor of 10 6 in a cw pulse amplifier consisting of three dye cells pumped by a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The 1 W seed laser beam with wavelength in the range 574 nm to 673 nm was obtained from a pumped cw dye laser, and the 1 W seed laser beam with wavelength in the range 723 nm to 941 nm was obtained from a pumped cw Ti:sapphire laser. The shorter wavelengths (265 nm to 471 nm) for inducing transitions were obtained by frequency doubling the amplifier output at 575 nm and 729 nm to 941 nm or by frequency tripling its 794 nm output. The frequency of the seed laser beam ν cw , and thus the frequency ν pl of the pulse amplified beam, was scanned over a range of ±4 GHz around thep He + transition frequency by changing the repetition frequency f rep of the frequency comb.\n\nThe resonance curve for a transition was obtained by plotting the area under the resulting DATS peak vs. ν pl . Because of the approximate 400 MHz Doppler broadening of the resonance due to the 10 K thermal motion of thep He + atoms, a rather sophisticated theoretical line shape that takes into account many factors must be used to obtained the desired transition frequency.",

The frequency ν pl can deviate from ν cw due to sudden changes in the index of refraction of the dye in the cells of the amplifier. This chirp, which can be expressed as ∆ν c (t) = ν pl (t) − ν cw , can shift the measuredp He + frequencies from their actual values. Hori et al. (2006) eliminated this effect by measuring ∆ν c (t) in real time and applying a frequency shift to the seed laser, thereby canceling the dye-cell chirp. This effect is the predominant contributor to the correlations among the 12 transitions (Hori, 2006). The collisional shift was eliminated by measuring the frequencies of ten transitions in helium gas targets with helium atom densities ρ in the range 2 × 10 18 /cm 3 to 3 × 10 21 /cm 3 to determine dν/dρ. The in vacuo (ρ = 0) values were obtained by applying a suitable correction in the range −14 MHz to 1 MHz to the initially measured frequencies obtained at ρ ≈ 2 × 10 18 /cm 3 .",

The related vibrational transitions, which all infrared-active small molecules, the most common functional groups, as well as biomolecules like proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates exhibit, reveal information about molecular structure and composition. However, light sources and detectors in the mid-infrared have been inferior to those in the visible or near-infrared, in terms of power, bandwidth, and sensitivity, severely limiting the performance of infrared experimental techniques. This article demonstrates the generation of femtosecond radiation with up to 5 W at 4.1 mm and 1.3 W at 8.5 mm, corresponding to an order-of-magnitude average power increase for ultrafast light sources operating at wavelengths longer than 5 mm. The presented concept is based on power-scalable near-infrared lasers emitting at a wavelength near 1 mm, which pump optical parametric amplifiers. In addition, both wavelength tunability and supercontinuum generation are reported, resulting in spectral coverage from 1.6 to 10.2 mm with power densities exceeding state-of-the-art synchrotron sources over the entire range. The flexible frequency conversion scheme is highly attractive for both up-conversion and frequency comb spectroscopy, as well as for a variety of time-domain applications.\n\nINTRODUCTION",

Indeed, it is seen from Figure 14(b) that the higherorder harmonic with the smallest frequency is that at λ 193 nm, while the higher-order harmonic at λ 112 nm is approximately the second-order harmonic with respect to the smallest-frequency one (at λ 193 nm) and the third-order harmonic with respect to the laser wavelength of λ l = 300 nm used to excite H + 2 . Needless to add that, as usual, harmonic at λ 193 nm corresponds to the frequency of ω ρ 1 ≈ ω osc , while harmonic at λ 112 nm corresponds to the doubled frequency of ρ-oscillations ω ρ 2 ≈ 2ω osc , where the oscillation frequency ω osc corresponds to the wavelength λ osc 200 nm.\n\nFinally, in Figure 15, power spectra A z (ω) and A ρ (ω) are presented for the case when H + 2 is excited by one-cycle laser pulse at the laser wavelength of λ l = 400 nm.

Despite the seven times longer crystal used in the OPA setup, the MIR Fourier transform limit, on the other hand, only increased by a factor of less than 2. This makes the approach also highly attractive for demanding applications in strongfield physics and extreme nonlinear optics, such as high-harmonic generation in gases (21). The tuning curve of Fig. 4 covers a wide range of the MIR spectrum. The highest spectral power densities are achieved in the atmospheric transmission windows from 3 to 5 mm and 8 to 13 mm, which are particularly important for trace gas analysis (14). The high average powers are especially useful for stand-off detection (24). Using frequency comb spectroscopy for this purpose would require to lock a multiple of the laser repetition rate to a precise frequency reference or to use a second femtosecond laser for dual-comb spectroscopy (14,17). To extend the tuning range further, double-stage amplification schemes should be used (11). The presented scheme is limited by the seed bandwidth (supporting wavelengths down to about 3.3 mm; see Fig. 2) in shortwavelength MIR and by the LGS transparency (see section S5) in long-wavelength MIR.",

Waves with different wavelengths (energies) act differently. Wavelengths with certain energies will produce the effects associated with an x-ray to microwaves. The general properties of waves of certain energies allow us to classify them across the full EM spectrum. Another property of light is the manner in which energy is transferred from itself to whatever it may encounter. Light, as well as being a wave, consists of photons. Photons have properties of both waves and particles. For this discussion, we will think of photons as the \"carriers\" and \"transferers\" of energy. Now that we have discussed light and its properties, it is appropriate to talk about matter. Matter is defined as anything which has mass and takes up space. Matter (pen, paper, ink) is made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of smaller constituents known as neutrons, protons, and electrons. Protons are charged electrically positive, neutrons have no charge, and electrons are negatively charged. This means that protons and electrons are attracted to one another in a similar manner as are magnets of differing polarities. This also means that protons are repelled by other protons, and electrons are repelled by other electrons. These small particles can be arranged in many different ways. The simplest model is shown in Figure 3.",

In practice, the latter quantity, the ratio U /V, is determined by counterbalancing an electrostatic force arising from the voltage U with a known gravitational force.\n\nA measurement of K J can also provide a value of h.

The average errors are 200 K, 0.20 dex, 0.15 dex, and 2 km s −1 for T eff , log g, [M/H], and v e sin i, respectively. The metallicty is just an estimation of the overall metal content in the spectral region analyzed by SIR. The line-by-line derivation of the metal content is done in Section 5, where we have used well-studied lines with accurate atomic data. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is derived for all spectra between 4450 and 5500Å using Stoehr et al. (2008)'s DER SNR 7 algorithm. In Figure 5, we show examples of the best fit synthetic spectra with SIR-derived parameters plotted with spectra obtained with the three different spectrographs.\n\nWe also compared our results to those of Alonso-Santiago et al. (2021) for the 11 A stars our samples have in common. The results are shown in Figure 6 for T eff , log g, and v e sin i. The agreement is very good for T eff and v e sin i (top and bottom panels), but we found larger disagreements for log g (middle panel). This is unsurprising, as uncertainties on log g derived from spectroscopy are known to be of order 0.15-0.3 dex for A stars (Smalley 2005), and one should therefore expect significant differences when comparing log g values derived using different techniques. For consistency, we used the values we obtained using SIR for the derivation of the individual chemical abundances in Section 5.",

Large black sunspots ( Figure 2) can be as cool as 3300 K, equivalent to an M4 star, but with a vertical magnetic field of more than 0.3 T. There are a series of Kitt Peak atlases for sunspots that cover 470-1233 cm À1 [39], 1970-8640 cm À1 [50], 1925-3480 cm À1 [51], 4000-8640 cm À1 [52], 8900-15 050 cm À1 [53], and 15 000-23 000 cm À1 [54]. Paper copies are available from L. Wallace (wallace@noao.edu) and electronic copies from ftp://nsokp.nso.edu/pub/atlas/. All of the molecules seen in the photosphere intensify in the spectra of sunspots, with the exception of C 2 , which fades and is not obvious. The weak MgH B 02 AE þ -X 2 AE þ [31,55] transition makes its appearance in the near infrared, along with the A 1 Å-X 1 AE þ transition of AlH [56] near 425 nm and the B 2 AE þ -X 2 AE þ and A 2 Å-X 2 AE þ transitions of CaH in the red [57]. The MgH lines can be used to determine 24 Mg : 25 Mg : 26 Mg isotopic abundance ratios [55]. The lines of several electronic transitions of TiO [60] become extremely dense in the visible with the -bands (A 3 È-X 3 D) [58] and -bands (b 1 Å-a 1 D) [59] in the red and near infrared. The Sun and sunspots are remarkable sources for spectroscopy at 3000-6000 K, and the two TiO papers by Ram et al. [58,59] nicely demonstrate how laboratory and solar data ( Figure 3) can be combined to give improved spectroscopic constants.",

Whether we derive the ground state from the union of two unexcited H atoms or from the splitting up of the nucleus of a helium atom we conclude that the ground state of H 2 has the con figuration ls21E, where Is2 (or Is Is) means that both electrons have principal quantum number 1 and azimuthal or analogous quantum number l, denoted by s, = 0 , £ denotes that the total component A = 2X of L = resultant l along the internuclear axis is 0 and the prefix 1 that the state is a singlet state. Both in absorption and emission we have transitions from and to this state with each of the states B ( = 2 JS) and C the final state of the present bands. In 2 X S the rotational levels are all present and they are single levels. This is, therefore, a x2 state. In contrast to the ground state its lowest rotational level is a strong level, the next weak and so on. This means that -Xx -f-l2 -X2, the suffixes referring to the individual atoms of the molecule, is now an odd number (X is the component of l along the internuclear axis). This is necessary to satisfy the rule that the complete proper function of the molecule must be antisymmetric in both the qjectrons and the protons. The B or 2 hS level is the lowest which goes down to the ground level; so that its excited electron will have principal quantum number 2, a fact which is confirmed by the value of the effective quantum number (1-959). Thus -Xx + l2 -cannot  \n\n\n494",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe hydrogen molecule has been the benchmark species of molecular spectroscopy since the first analysis of its dipoleallowed absorption spectrum, now over a century ago. 1 Over decades, further detailed experiments on the electronic spectrum were performed, 2−4 while also the measurements of forbidden vibrational transitions were explored. 5 Alongside, and stimulated by experimental observations, the quantum theory of the ground state of the smallest neutral molecule was developed with major contributions from James and Coolidge, 6 Kołos and Wolniewicz, 7 and Wolniewicz. 8 The excited states and the strong effects of nonadiabatic interactions were investigated by Dressler and co-workers. 9 The theoretical program of refined calculations of the ground state structure was further extended by Pachucki and co-workers including effects of nonadiabatic, relativistic, and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) effects, 10,11 which has now produced an online program (H2SPECTRE 12 ) to compute level energies for all rovibrational states of the hydrogen isotopomers. 13 Spectroscopic studies of molecular hydrogen have included the behavior at long internuclear separation. Characteristic for the level structure of H 2 is the occurrence of double-well potential energy curves for excited states, induced by strong nonadiabatic interactions in this light molecule. In the manifold of g-symmetry the lowest of these is the EF 1 Σ g + state, for which the outer well was investigated, 14,15 followed by the GK 1 Σ g + and HH̅ 1 Σ g + states. 16,17 Similarly double-well states of 1 Π u symmetry 18,19 and of 1 Σ u + symmetry were investigated. 20,21 These studies on long-range effects in the hydrogen molecule were extended to higher energies, leading to observation of exotic phenomena as ion-pair or heavy Rydberg states, 22 quasi-bound states, 23 and shape resonances 24 in the molecular ion.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nImportance of the exponentially varying Morse potential [1] in context of vibrationrotation states of diatomic molecules has been realized in an enormous amount of work ever since its inception about 85 years ago. The celebrated empirical potential has witnessed many important applications in various branches, such as molecular physics, solidstate physics, chemical physics, etc [2,3]. This potential has been studied also in several other contexts. For example, its generalized and photon-added coherent states are discussed [4,5]; series solution for D-dimensional Schrödinger equation with More potential presented [6]; controllability with a compact group SU(2) put forth [7]; a series expansion solution of position-dependent mass is given [8]; a proper quantization rule where the energy spectra is determined only from its ground-state energy has been proposed [9]; also its momentum representation by hypergeometric function is suggested [10]. It is well known that, exact analytical results are available only for ℓ = 0 states, while the rotational Morse oscillator states must be approximated. Thus over the years, a large number of attractive efficient methodologies have been developed for better understanding of this model potential employing a multitude of approximations.",

On the one hand, it is a very valuable ingredient since it constitutes a reliable reference and calibration tool to test the accuracy of our numerical approach. On the other hand, it brings out an alternative three-parameter model based on a generalized Morse potential that has a definite advantage over the standard two-parameter model. If we consider the case = 0 in equation (2.1), then the S-wave Schrödinger equation for the generalized Morse potential reads as follows,\n−h 2 2m d 2 dr 2 + D e e −2α( r r e −1) − 2β e −α( r r e −1) − E χ = 0, (3.1)\nwhere the potential strength D e > 0, the parameters α and r e are positive and β is a deformation parameter of the classical Morse potential. This equation has an exact analytic solution for the bound state energy spectrum. Its derivation goes as follows. If we let\nx = r/r e , E 0 =h 2 /mr 2 e , A = 2D e e α /E 0 , ε = 2E/E 0 , then equation (3.1) becomes d 2 dx 2 − A[e α e −2αx − 2β e −αx ] + ε χ = 0. (3.2)\nNow, for a real parameter ξ , let y = ξ e −αx ∈ [0, 1], then (3.2) becomes\ny 2 d 2 dy 2 + y d dy − A α 2 e α ξ 2 y 2 − 2 β ξ y + ε α 2 χ = 0. (3.3)",

THE GPS METHOD FOR MORSE POTENTIAL\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the GPS method employed to solve the radial eigenvalue problem with Morse potential. As it has been described before [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37], here we provide only the essential steps; details could be found in the references above.\n\nThe desired radial Schrödinger equation can be written in the following operator form,\nH(r) ψ(r) = E ψ(r),(1)\nwhere the Hamiltonian operator includes usual kinetic and potential energy operators,\nH(r) = −h 2 2µ d 2 dr 2 + v(r), with v(r) = ℓ(ℓ + 1)h 2 2µr 2 + D e e −2αx − 2e −αx .(2)\nHere ℓ denotes the usual angular momentum quantum number identifying rotational states.\n\nLast term in Eq. (2) represents the Morse potential. Potential strength D e > 0, x = (r − r e )/r e , and α, r e are two positive parameters.\n\nA large number of numerical schemes for solution of above radial Schrödinger equation employ finite-difference discretization. These often require a significant number of spatial grid points chiefly because of their uniform distributional nature. In the GPS method, however, a nonuniform optimal spatial discretization could be achieved efficiently as detailed below, maintaining similar kind of good accuracy at both small and large r regions. Therefore it requires much lesser grid points to reach convergence, compared to many other methods in the literature. One can have a denser mesh at smaller r while a coarser mesh at large r regions. A primary feature of this scheme is that a function f (x) in the interval x ∈ [−1, 1]",

Bound statesSolving the eigenvalue problem requires an efficient method for computing matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we relax the restriction of a diagonal matrix representation for the Hamiltonian. Instead, we split our original Hamiltonian into two parts as H = H 0 + V where H 0 is the part of the Hamiltonian that could be treated analytically while the remaining part, V, is to be handled numerically. In dealing with the matrix representation of H 0 , we do not require it to be diagonal but only that it is Hermitian and tridiagonal. That is, the matrix elements of the reference wave operator should take the following form φ n |H 0 − E|φ m = (a n − z)δ n,m + b n δ n,m−1 + b n−1 δ n,m+1 , (1.1) where z and the coefficients {a n , b n } ∞ n=0 are real and, in general, functions of the energy, angular momentum, and potential parameters. Thus, this approach embodies the analytical power in dealing with the reference H 0 problem as well as the very accurate numerical quadrature approach [21] used in the evaluation of the potential matrix elements. In addition, we benefit from the existence of two different bases that support a tridiagonal matrix representation of the reference Hamiltonian. Each one has two parameters which will be tuned to enhance convergence, stability, and of course accuracy. For a given potential model, the choice of basis is made with an eye on these three computational characteristics.",

Quantization condition for vibrational spectrum in the WKB approximation reads:\nR2 R1 2M (U (r) − E n ) dr = v + 1 2 π .(61)\nDifferentiating this expression in µ we get:\nδE v = v + 1 2 2ρ(E v ) δµ µ ,(62)\nwhere\nρ(E v ) ≡ (∂E v /∂v) −1 ≈ (E v − E v−1 ) −1 is the level density.\nFor the harmonic part of the potential, ρ = const and the shift δE v grows linearly with v, but for vibrational states near the dissociation limit the level density ρ(E) −→ ∞ and δE v −→ 0. Consequently, maximum sensitivity ∼ 1000 cm −1 is reached at v ≈ 60, and rapidly drops for higher v. At present the group at Yale has found a conveniently close vibrational level of the upper 3 Σ u state for v = 138, but where the sensitivity is only ∼ 200 cm −1 [81].

One way to achieve this is to choose nodes and width parameters as in [7] but using a modified potential. Let us denote the classically accessible region by Ω c , the \"soft\" potential region by Ω s , and the \"hard\" potential region by Ω h . We defineṼ (x) such thatṼ (x) = V (x) for x ∈ Ω s ∩ Ω c , and such that V (x) has appropriately low values for x ∈ Ω h ∩ Ω c . We may choose, for example, the value of V (x) in a nearby minimum or in the global one. In the classically inaccessible parts of Ω h we set V (x) = ∞, i.e. we allow no nodes there. The nodes are then chosen similiarly to [7], but using Figure 1 illustratesṼ (x) for a Morse potential. In 1-D and 2-D problems this approach should not pose serious difficulty, the \"hard\" potential regions and nearby minima may be identified by inspection of the potential surface. In higher dimensions potential surface geometry is not so easy to visualize, yet simple ways may still exist for modifying the choice of nodes and width parameters.

This form of Morse potential model cannot be used to describe any molecule completely due to the absence of the spectroscopic parameters. Similarly, the parameters ℓ, β and x lack clear physical definition in the study of molecules. The authors clearly pointed out that the three-parameter empirical Morse potential or the reduced Morse potential in Eq. (2), cannot be recovered from the Morse potential in Eq. (3) by change of variable. This state thus, draw the attention of the authors. Thus, to study any molecule under the shifted Morse potential model, it becomes expedient to construct a reparametise shifted Morse potential function that its mathematical parameters match molecular parameters. It is also necessary to condition some of the potential parameters in the shifted Morse potential such that the real Morse potential model can be retrieve. Therefore, in the present study, a dissociation energy D e a constant γ are introduced. A transformation x = α(r − r e ), is also made in Eq. (3) to have From Eq. (4), the original Morse potential function can be recovered as a special case. The dissociation energy D e , the equilibrium bond separation r e and the equilibrium harmonic vibrational frequency ω e for diatomic molecules are correlated with potential energy function V (r) and defined by the following relations where c is the speed of light, µ is the reduced mass,ℓ, γ and β are connected by the following relations After some mathematical simplifications using the relations above, the parameter α for molecular system can be calculated by the formula The present work will study the radial Schrödinger equation under the modified shifted Morse potential model in Eq. (4) and recover the solution of the real Morse potential given in Eq. (1) from the solution of the Morse potential in Eq. (4). This study will also examine the vibrational energies of some molecules and compared with experimental RKR data as an application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first",

Using a traditional technique/methodology, the vibrational energy and the un-normalized radial wave functions were calculated for the modified shifted Morse potential model. The condition that fits the modified potential for molecular description were deduced together with the expression for the screening parameter. The vibrational energies of SiC, NbO, CP, PH, SiF, NH and Cs 2 molecules were computed by inserting their respective spectroscopic constants into the calculated energy equation. It was shown that the calculated results for all the molecules agreement perfectly with the experimental RKR values. The present potential performs better than Improved Morse and Morse potentials for cesium dimer. Finally, the real Morse potential model was obtained as a special case of the modified shifted potential.The solutions of wave equations under different potential models are of great interest in sciences since the study of their solutions give the conceptual understanding in quantum systems. These solutions generate valuable means to check and improve models as well as numerical techniques developed to simplify complicated systems. Over the years, certain solvable techniques like Nikiforov-Uvarov method 1 , asymptotic iteration method 2-4 , proper/exact quantization rule 5-7 , 1/N shifted expansion method 8 , supersymmetric method 9-15 factorization method 16 , formula method for bound state problems 17,18 and others, were developed to solve the wave equations with various physical potential terms. The choice of any method depends on the nature of the problem under consideration as well as the ease in handling complicated situations that may arise. For instance, some potential terms cannot be solved in the absence of the angular momentum quantum state, hence, the solution under these potential models can be obtained by employing a suitable approximation scheme. On the other hand, certain potential models even when they admit a solution for j = 0, they cannot be used to completely describe the diatomic molecules due to the absence of molecular constants like the dissociation energy, equilibrium bond separation and vibrational frequency. Therefore, some potential models that have spectroscopic constants or diatomic constants have been given much attention in the recent time. One of such potentials that possess the spectroscopic constants is the Morse potential function. The Morse potential function was proposed by Philip Morse 19 in 1929 as a three-parameter empirical potential energy function. The Morse potential is a convenient interatomic interaction model for the potential energy of a",

This basis along with the corresponding matrix manipulations are presented in the appendix.

This polynomial approximation is very good for β > ∼ 10. The Morse potential (20) corresponds to, for example, the parameters denoting the intramolecular vibration of the HCl molecule [31]. For this system the inverse temperature β = 10 corresponds to the temperature T ∼ 400 K.",

Attempts were made by Born and his assistants to discuss the stationary state energy levels of 'simple' non-trivial systems such as He, H + 2 , H 2 , H 2 O. The molecular species were tackled as problems in electronic structure, that is, as requiring the calculation of the energy levels for the electron(s) in the field of fixed nuclei as a calculation separate from the rotation-vibration of the molecule as a whole. Pauli gave a lengthy qualitative discussion of the possible Bohr orbits for the single electron moving in the field of two fixed protons in H + 2 but could not obtain the correct stationary states [32]. Nordheim investigated the forces between two hydrogen atoms as they approach each other adiabatically 6 in various orientations consistent with the quantum conditions. Before the atoms get close enough for the attractive and repulsive forces to balance out, a sudden discontinuous change in the electron orbits takes place and the electrons cease to revolve solely round their parent nuclei. Nordheim was unable to find an interatomic distance at which the energy of the combined system was less than that of the separated atoms; this led to the conclusion that the use of classical mechanics to discuss the stationary states of the molecular electrons had broken down comprehensively [33], [34]. This negative result was true of all the molecular calculations attempted within the Old Quantum Theory framework which was simply incapable of accounting for covalent bonding [35].",

In fact, by Fourier transforming the SC recurring time-dependent overlap of harmonic states, the vibrational eigenfunctions can be obtained through a decomposition on the harmonic basis and the approach is readily extendable to high dimensional molecules. A successful application of the method, though, necessitates that the eigenfunctions obtained within the harmonic approximation give already a good qualitative representation. In fact we showed that, in these cases, the most important anharmonic effects are already included with only very few terms in the harmonic basis set.In the spirit of multiple coherent semiclassical dynamics we propagated just one trajectory per anharmonic state, so that the number of classical MD propagations is not directly related to the size of the molecule but to the number of vibrational target states. Once the trajectory associated to a target state has been propagated, the semiclassical propagator is determined for all harmonic basis functions needed to describe that specific state. The number of basis functions to employ depends on the dimensionality of the system, but it can be limited by employing an appropriate cutoff.Test calculations performed on the 1D Morse oscillator have shown that the harmonic basis is very well suited to describe the true anharmonic vibrational states.\n\n\nProf. Tucker Carrington is warmly thanked for reading the manuscript and for interesting comments, and Dr. Gianluca Bertaina is thanked for insights about the Monte Carlo application.

Plyler. The combined section, called Molecular Spectroscopy, was led by David Lide. Plyler had constructed what was probably the most advanced high-resolution infrared instrument in the world at that time and had brought in several young spectroscopists including Arthur Maki, Walter Lafferty (shown in Fig. 3), and Bruce Olson. This merger led to highly productive symbiosis between the microwave and infrared laboratories. A number of molecules were investigated in both spectral regions, yielding new information on vibrationrotation interactions.  Examples include:\n\n• HCN and DCN [62,63,64,65] • FCN [66] • ClCN [67] • N 2 O [68] • HCCCN [69] • CH 3 CN [69] • DCCD [70] • OCS [71,72] • OCSe [73] The work on HCN was notable in that it was used to explain the mechanism of far infrared laser action in HCN, which had been incorrectly attributed to the CN molecule [62,63]. This work led to other measurements that shed light on other gas phase laser transitions such as CS 2 [74] and DCN and other HCN laser transitions [64,65]. The HCN laser played a significant part in the 1972 measurement of the speed of light to unprecedented accuracy, a measurement that led to a new definition of the meter as the standard of length. In 1968 Lide received the NBS Stratton Award (see Fig. 4) with the citation: \"For outstanding research and distinguished authorship in the field of microwave spectroscopy\".",

In the infrared region, the molecule has been a subject of numerous studies concerning mostly the line positions of its vibrational bands:  1 [16],  2 [17],  3 [18],  4 [19,20],  5 [21], and  6 [22]. Line positions of several overtone and combination bands were also investigated [22,23]. In contrast, there exist only few studies of the line intensities of these bands of CH 3 I. To the best of our knowledge, high-resolution studies of the line intensities exist only for the  6 and the 2 3 bands [24,25] and for some lines of the  5 and  3 + 6 bands [26]. There are low-resolution measurements of the overall band intensities of the six fundamental vibrations [27,28], and ab initio computed intensities of its fundamental bands [29].",

Richardson, F.R.S., Yarrow Research. Professor of the Royal Society. (Received July 29, 1927.) There is a definite alternation of intensity in the successive lines of a given branch of this spectrum. This is particularly evident in the Q branches, which are the strongest, the lines usually denoted by Q (1), Q (3) and Q (5) being much more intense than the intervening lines Q (2) and Q (4). For some time I have had evidence which, though in some respects incomplete, pointed to the con clusion th at in any band the mean value of the intensities of any two consecutive odd-numbered lines such as Q (1) and Q (3) was nearly equal to three times the intensity of the intervening line such as Q (2). An examination of the much more comprehensive measurements which have recently been obtained by McLennan, Grayson-Smith and Collins* seems to remove all doubt from this matter.",

Of these bands, on the basis of the presence or absence of certain low J lines, two are clearly (Ω ′ = 3/2) ← (Ω ′′ = 3/2), and two are clearly (Ω ′ = 1/2) ← (Ω ′′ = 3/2) with considerable Ω-doubling. Based on values of the rotational constants, band origin ν, and isotope shifts, we are able to assign these four bands and the remaining four less well-resolved bands to a common lower electronic state, with rotational constants in good agreement with the X1.5 state identified in Ref. 7. The upper state of these bands we assign to one of two newly identified electronic states: a state with Ω ′ = 3/2 at 14223 cm −1 , which we label [14.2]1.5, and a state with Ω ′ = 1/2 at 13833 cm −1 , which we label [13.8]\n0.5.\nOn each of the bands acquired at high resolution we perform a non-linear least squares fit to a vibrational band contour. The doubling for all Ω = 3/2 levels is unresolved. For the lower states of all eight bands and for the upper states of the bands at 13496, 13554, 14159, and 14223 cm −1 we fit using the following Hamiltonian:\nF (J) = T + BJ(J + 1).(1)\nThe bands at 13760, 13833, 14352, and 14429 cm −1 we fit to an upper state using the Hamiltonian [11], with selection rules for the P, Q, and R branches:",

Figure 4(a) shows an overview of the measured absorption coefficient of 0.11 mbar of pure CH 3 I (black) together with the simulations of the  4 band (blue) and the  3 + 4 - 3 hot band (red) obtained from PGOPHER. For the simulations, the input parameters of the ground states were taken from Refs. [40,41], while for the upper states they were taken from earlier simulations by Anttila et al. [20]. Starting from the initial simulated spectra, we first assigned the K(J)=0 lines near the band origin, then we extended the assignment up to K=12 and J=75 quantum numbers. As shown in Fig.  4, an overall very good match between the experiment and the simulations is obtained. The  4 band shows a typical structure of a perpendicular band with Q k (J) sub-bands degrading towards higher frequencies (i.e., blue shaded), indicating that the term B′ -B″ has a small positive value. Panel (b) is an enlarged portion of the spectrum around the Q 1 (J) sub-band of the  4 band. A series of weak rotational features observed between the main Q-clusters are attributed to the  3 + 4 - 3 hot band, as previously reported by Anttila et al. [20], with intensity equal to ~7.6 % of the fundamental  4 band, as predicted by the Boltzmann distribution factor.",

These are the experi mental points on the characteristic plots i/i0 vs. Y1 and on the logi/i0 vs. Yj plots respectively. The experimental points on the characteristic plots only reproduce the data to the accuracy of the observations in the range of i from i0 to about io/20. Lower values of i than this should be obtained from the log i/i0 vs. Vx plots.

In this case e~kiY will be small compared l o with e~klY for all values of V from 0 to oo . The experiments will not detect a small low energy emission because it will never contribute anything appreciable to iji0. Its maximum relative contribution is near V = 0 where the absolute error of the measurements is greatest, and this will increase the difficulty of detecting this type of emission.\n\nFor the more energetic reactions, for which c ~ 2, the log i/i0 vs. V plots will still be able to detect a small admixture with higher average energy than that of the main group, but no simple quantitative treatment, similar to the above, is possible for these electron spectra. Instead of a straight line the l°g ifio vs-V plot will give a curve, convex towards the origin (V = 0), the slope of which continuously increases as log iji0 increases. A small high energy group of electrons will make itself evident by the fact that at high enough values of V the systematic increase in the curvature will become less rapid and may even become negative.

Now there is a problem here because in Bohr theory when an electron comes in from infinity it has to radiate half its energy to enter into orbit.There was no evidence for any such radiation and the electron would have needed to have twice the energy to start with.However, there were some theorists including Sommerfeld who had an explanation that the electron could be captured if it had a velocity equal to what it was going to have in orbit.\n\nThere were other disturbing facts.The peaks were 0.01 V wide; the fields in the tube were not that accurate.In addition, scanning the entire voltage range in such small steps would take a long time.Well, Davis and Barnes explained, they didn't quite do it that way: they found by some preliminary work that they did check with the Bohr orbit velocities, so they knew where to look.Sometimes they weren't quite in the right place, so they explored around and found them.Their precision was so good they were sure they could get a better value for the Rydberg constant (known then to 1 part in 10 8 ).\n\nThen Langmuir visited Columbia.The way the experiment was done was that an assistant named Hull sat opposite to Barnes in front of a voltmeter, that had a scale that went from 1 to a thousand volts and on that scale he was reading 0.01 V.The room was dark, to see the scintillations, and there was a light on the voltmeter and on the dial of the clock that Barnes used to time his measurements.",

He assumes them to behave like hydrogen-like electrons with a total quantum number of 2, and a nuclear charge equal to (Z -4-14)g. This assumption for the L electrons is much less accurate than the corresponding assumption for the K electrons. Even so it gives moderate agreement with the observed absorption for certain elements, for wave-lengths small compared with the wave-length at the L edge. However, for moderately heavy elements, such as copper, and wave-lengths near the L edge-a case not considered by Stobbe-the values calculated on this basis differ considerably from the actual values. Data for the latter are available through recent work by Jonsson (loc. cit.) on the absorption of long wave-length X-rays. Stobbe's calculated L absorption and the observed L absorption for copper are represented in fig. 4.
