Interaction with matter X-rays interact with matter in three main ways, through photoabsorption, Compton scattering, and Rayleigh scattering. The strength of these interactions depends on the energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies.

X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal.

Shortly thereafter he developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements.

By studying these components and improving the spectrometer, Siegbahn got an almost complete understanding of the electron shell.

Approximation When an interface is not perfectly sharp, but has an average electron density profile given by , then the X-ray reflectivity can be approximated by: Here is the reflectivity, , is the X-ray wavelength (typically copper's K-alpha peak at 0.154056 nm), is the density deep within the material and is the angle of incidence. Below the critical angle (derived from Snell's law), 100% of incident radiation is reflected, . For , .

Generally, larger atoms are more likely to absorb an X-ray photon since they have greater energy differences between orbital electrons. The soft tissue in the human body is composed of smaller atoms than the calcium atoms that make up bone, so there is a contrast in the absorption of X-rays.

If the total molar amounts of reactants and products are equal, as in the first example, a change in volume does not shift the equilibrium.

In the second example, two moles of reactant $\\left(\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$ yield three moles of product ( $2 \\mathrm{NO}+\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ), and so decreasing the system volume causes the equilibrium to shift left since the reverse reaction produces less gas ( 2 mol ) than the forward reaction ( 3 mol ).

This azeotropic composition is strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and vanishes at temperatures below 303 K. Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably sodium and potassium hydroxides, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and sodium bromide. Sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol. Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most essential oils and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.",

The molar volume of pure water would thus be reported as 18 cm3 mol\u22121. However, addition of one mole of water to a large volume of pure ethanol results in an increase in volume of only 14 cm3. The reason that the increase is different is that the volume occupied by a given number of water molecules depends upon the identity of the surrounding molecules. The value 14 cm3 is said to be the partial molar volume of water in ethanol.

It also has the highest vapor pressure. Due to its smaller size, ethanol exhibits weaker dispersion forces than diethyl ether. However, ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding and, therefore, exhibits stronger overall IMFs, which means that fewer molecules escape from the liquid at any given temperature, and so ethanol has a lower vapor pressure than diethyl ether. Water is much smaller than either of the previous substances and exhibits weaker dispersion forces, but its extensive hydrogen bonding provides stronger intermolecular attractions, fewer molecules escaping the liquid, and a lower vapor pressure than for either diethyl ether or ethanol. Ethylene glycol has two -OH groups, so, like water, it exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding. It is much larger than water and thus experiences larger London forces.

The results obtained are from the calculation of temperature and / or pressure (depending on the system) and the relative deviations from the calculation of the composition of the vapor phase in relation to the experimental data.At the end, an average of \u0394T or \u0394P (difference between experimental and calculated) and an average for the relative deviations of the composition of the vapor phase (yi) is performed.

Mixing pure water with a solution less than 24% by mass causes a slight increase in total volume, whereas the mixing of two solutions above 24% causes a decrease in volume. The phenomenon of volume changes due to mixing dissimilar solutions is called \"partial molar volume\". Water and ethanol are both polar solvents. When water is added to ethanol, the smaller water molecules are attracted to the ethanol's hydroxyl group, and each molecule alters the polarity field of the other. The attraction allows closer spacing between molecules than is usually found in non-polar mixtures.",

All three Soret coefficients decay with increasing concentration, irrespective of the choice of the independent component, and show a characteristic sign change as a function of temperature and/or composition. With the exception of triethylene glycol/ethanol at high temperatures, the minority component always migrates toward the cold side. All three binaries exhibit temperature-independent fixed points of the Soret coefficient. The decay of the Soret coefficient with concentration can be related to negative excess volumes of mixing. The sign changes of the Soret coefficients of the binaries allow to draw far-reaching conclusions about the signs of the Soret coefficients of the corresponding ternary mixtures.

The temperature derivative of the refractive index, dnD/dT, shows anomalies at lower water concentrations at about 10 mol% water but no anomaly at 41 mol% water.

The overall feature of the observed gas-liquid coexistence curve is reproduced accurately without introducing phenomenological adjustable parameters. It is shown that the local aggregation of atoms produces a strong cohesive force due to a change in the local electronic states, which plays a crucial role in the gas-liquid transition.

The scaling length determines the width of the cohesion curve that in turn influences on the \"tail\" of the cohesion and parameters of the critical point. The bulk modulus of noble gases strongly depends on density and temperature in the narrow range of these parameters, unlike the majority of metals. Mercury has two crystalline structures at low temperatures and, correspondingly, at least two types of cohesive energy. Calculations of parameters of vapor-liquid phase transition with use of several equilibrium energy and separation values [12] are made. Comparison of the obtained results with experimental data [13] is shown on figure 1: star-experiment; square and circles denote our calculation using UBER with various input values of \u2206E, B, and r W SE [7,12]. One can see from figure 1, in spite of the fact that energy minimum values in various calculations are quite close, our calculation data differ strongly enough from each other. In first, it can be explained by that the isothermal bulk modulus for mercury in various crystalline states differs significantly. UBER expression is quite sensitive to scaling length and density change (the equilibrium separation). Secondly, this is still an approximate expression and only precise calculation of the cohesive energy can confirm or improve our hypothesis.\n\nThe obtained results were compared to the experimental data and data of numerical calculations.

As such configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements, which form weak bonds and thus easily melting solids. The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points. Gold has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming",

Due to the unique properties of matter at this scale, such devices offer great potential for creating novel materials and behaviors that can be leveraged to benefit mankind. This paper addresses a particular challenge involved in the design of nanostructures--their stochastic or apparently random response to external loading. This is because fundamentally the function that relates the energy of a nanostructure to the arrangement of its atoms is extremely nonconvex, with each minimum corresponding to a possible equilibrium state that may be visited as the system responds to loading. Traditional atomistic simulation techniques are not capable of systematically addressing this complexity. Instead, we construct an equilibrium map (EM) for the nanostructure, analogous to a phase diagram for bulk materials, which fully characterizes its response. Using the EM, definitive predictions can be made in limiting cases and the spectrum of responses at any desired loading rate can be obtained. The latter is important because standard atomistic methods are fundamentally limited, by computational feasibility, to simulations of loading rates that are many orders of magnitude faster than reality. In contrast, the EM-based approach makes possible the direct simulation of nanostructure experiments. We demonstrate the method's capabilities and its surprisingly complex results for the case of a nanoslab of nickel under compression.",

Nanosystems having size approaching the fundamental scale of microscopic length have fundamentally demonstrated new physical phenomena. New advances have been made in many basic and modified fields of nanophysics, including diluted cold gases, carbon nanotubes, graphene, magnetic nanostructures, composite nanoparticles, transport through coupled quantum dots, spin-dependent electron transport phenomena, optical arrays with doped nanoparticles, and electronic, molecular, and quantum information processing. The pseudo-Gaussian potential proves to be a reliable model for defects in nanostructures or a bulk material itself. It can easily model the vibrational levels of such a nanostructure based on the fact it has a finite levels of energies, as shown in different papers as [6,7], despite of harmonic oscillator with an infinite one. Moreover, change of number of levels is possible by manipulation of some parameters, and also it permits dissociation with the energy in the continuum. Heterostructures can be used for advanced electronic devices (for example, modulated field effect transistors, heterojunction bipolar transistors, and resonant tunneling devices), optical components (e.g., waveguides, mirrors) and optoelectronic devices and structures (for example, laser diodes, photodetectors). These are also crucial in many optoelectronic devices (e.g., lasers). Perhaps their most important technological aspect may be that they can be used for all these electronic, optical and optoelectronic purposes and, therefore, can allow the integration of all of them. The scattering method of investigation can be found in any area of physics even in astrophysics [8].\n\n\nPseudo-Gaussian oscillator model",

These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example the \"quantum size effect\" where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size.

However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called quantum realm. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems.

Nanoscience provides important opportunities for theory and computation to lead in the discovery process because the experimental tools often provide an incomplete picture of the structure and/or function of nanomaterials, and theory can often fill in missing features crucial to understanding what is being measured. However, there are important challenges to using theory as well, as the systems of interest are usually too large, and the time scales too long, for a purely atomistic level theory to be useful. At the same time, continuum theories that are appropriate for describing larger-scale (micrometer) phenomena are often not accurate for describing the nanoscale. Despite these challenges, there has been important progress in a number of areas, and there are exciting opportunities that we can look forward to as the capabilities of computational facilities continue to expand. Some specific applications that are discussed in this paper include: self-assembly of supramolecular structures, the thermal properties of nanoscale molecular systems (DNA melting and nanoscale water meniscus formation), the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes and diamond crystals, and the optical properties of silver and gold nanoparticles.",

Owing to the advance of recent algorithm developments and improved supercomputer powers, it is now possible to calculate such nanocrystals based on ab initio methods. In this review, we discuss the numerical algorithms (the plane-wave pseudopotential method and the real-space finite-difference method) used in conventional density-functional-theory calculations, which enable the simulations of systems up to one or two thousand atoms. We also introduce methods designed specifically for nanostructure calculations. These methods [the charge-patching method (CPM) and the linear scaling three-dimensional fragment method (LS3DF)] can be used to calculate systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms. Whereas CPM is an approximation with ab initio quality, the LS3DF method is an O(N) method with essentially the same results as the direct methods.

This transient response for nanosized systems might misguide conclusions regarding observed negative differential resistance (NDR) which is due to the collective nuclei rearrangements to more stable conformations under the presence of an applied field yielding, in many cases, resonances between conformations that can sustain during the steady-state period. This NDR yields peculiar behavior that needs to be considered to design molecular and nanoelectronic devices. In addition, the commonly sharp contrast between transient and steady responses blurs at the nanoscale. In nanosize systems, the time constants or transient response times depend on the velocity of the rearrangements of the atoms in the system or molecule.",

The models are assessed regarding their description of vapor-liquid equilibria where such information is available in the literature. In 1981, Jorgensen [9] presented a rigid ethanol model based on transferable intermolecular poten-tial functions (TIPS). TIPS consider the methyl and methylene groups as single Lennard-Jones sites, centered on the carbon nuclei and a single Lennard-Jones site centered on the oxygen nucleus accounting for the dispersion and repulsion of the hydroxyl group. Point charges are located on the hydroxyl hydrogen and the bonded oxygen nucleus. The charge located on the methylene group is chosen to achieve overall neutrality of the molecule. That model was developed to yield reasonable structural and energetic results. Subsequently, Jorgensen investigated the effect of internal rotation in the ethanol molecule about the carbon-oxygen bond [10], regarding the structure and hydrogen bonding and compared the results to X-ray data for the solid and to ab initio molecular orbital calculations.",

Yoshida, S. Baluja, A. Inaba, K. Tozaki, and Y. Koga, \"Experimental determination of third derivative of G (III): Differential pressure perturbation calorimetry (II),\" J. Solution Chem. (in press)], we experimentally determined the partial molar S-V cross fluctuation density of solute B, (SV)\u03b4(B) , in binary aqueous solutions for B = 1-propanol (1P) and glycerol (Gly). This third derivative of G provides information about the effect of solute B on the S-V cross fluctuation density, (SV)\u03b4, in aqueous solution as the concentration of B varies. Having determined (SV)\u03b4(B) by better than 1% uncertainty, we evaluated for the first time the fourth derivative quantity (SV)\u03b4(B-B) = N(\u2202(SV)\u03b4(B) \u2215\u2202n(B)) for B = 1P and Gly graphically without resorting to any fitting functions within several percent. This model-free quantity gives information about the acceleration of the effect of solute B on (SV)\u03b4. By comparing fourth derivative quantities, (SV)\u03b4(B-B) , among B = 1P, Gly, and 2-butoxyethanol obtained previously, the distinction of the effect of solute on H(2)O becomes clearer than before when only the third derivative quantities were available.",

The Gibbs free energy is one of the most important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the voltage of an electrochemical cell, and the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction. In isothermal, isobaric systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a \"dynamic\" quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process. The temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy for an ideal gas is given by the Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation, and its pressure dependence is given by or more conveniently as its chemical potential: In non-ideal systems, fugacity comes into play.",

To determine the residual chemical potential in the liquid phase with high accuracy, the Monte Carlo based gradual insertion method [31]- [33] was used.

The TraPPE-UA was extended to alcohols [4] which gives to our knowledge the most accurate existing ethanol model for vapor-liquid equilibria. It was found that this model yields vapor pressures, saturated liquid densities and heats of vaporization with mean unsigned errors of about 8, 1 and 1 %, respectively.\n\nSince polarazible molecular models are computationally very expensive, only few ethanol models of that type are available. The polaraziable intermolecular potential function (PIPF) proposed by Gao et al. [23] is based on the reparamerization of the OPLS-AA plus isotropic point polarization on each atom. That model was developed to yield better results for heat of vaporization and density. Another polarizable model is that from Gonz\u00e1lez et al. [24]. It is based on the OPLS-UA and consists of only one isotropic point polarizability on the (pseudo) oxygen atom. Delhommelle et al. [25] showed for pentane and hydrogen sulfide that polarizable models can give better predictions of mixture vapor-liquid equilibria. The molecular interaction and geometry of the resulting model is described in the following.\n\n\nNew ethanol model",

The results of these measurements were used to calculate excess molar volumes and isobaric thermal expansion coefficients, and partial molar and apparent molar volumes and excess isobaric thermal expansion coefficients were subsequently derived. The excess molar volumes were correlated as a function of the mole fraction using the Redlich-Kister equation. Temperature dependences of the Redlich-Kister coefficients are also presented. The partial molar volumes at infinite dilution of AEEA in water were determined using two different methods. In addition, the solution density was correlated using a Joubian-Acree model. Aqueous solutions of AEEA exhibit similar properties to the aqueous solutions of other alkanolamines (like monoethanolamine) used in acid gas sweetening.

The charge transport properties in organic molecules strongly depend upon factors such as intermolecular electronic couplings, electron-phonon interactions and structural defects. As a result, the measured charge-carrier mobilities can vary over several orders of magnitudes as a function of sample quality. While significant efforts have been devoted to the molecular level understanding of factors affecting the charge carrier mobilities in organic semiconductors, the design of high mobility organic materials is still driven by empirical experiments which is partly due to the lack of a unified theoretical treatment of charge transport in organic semiconductors. In ultra-pure organic single crystals, charge transport at low temperature can be described in the framework of band transport mechanisms [261]. The transfer integral and electron-phonon coupling are two key parameters that determine the charge transport mechanisms (band or hopping transport) in organic semiconductors. The transfer integral is directly related to the bandwidth, and the electron-phonon coupling can alter electronic band structures. As the temperature is lowered, the electron-phonon coupling is decreased, and correspondingly, the mobility increases. Hence, the temperature dependence of charge carrier mobility (\u00b5 \u221d T \u2212n , n typically varies between 0.5 and 3) can be used to test whether band transport occurs in organic semiconductors. Figure 12 shows the electron and hole mobilities in ultrapure naphthalene as a function of temperature. The decrease in mobilities with temperature for electron and hole clearly indicates the band-like transport. Although the majority of the experimental observations [262][263][264] indicate negative temperature dependence of mobility in the 100-300 K range, it is argued that the band and delocalized picture are inconsistent with the analysis of experimental data which reveals a mean free path of charge carriers of the same order of magnitude of the unit cell at room temperature [265]. Troisi et al. recently proposed that the charge transport mechanism in organic semiconductors at room temperature is neither band-like nor a combination of thermally activated hopping and band-like [238]. Computational investigations show that for many organic semiconductors, the fluctuation amplitudes of the transfer integral are comparable to the transfer integral itself. Under this circumstance, the translational symmetry of the electronic Hamiltonian is",

While model Hamiltonians capture the qualitative electronic spectra associated with \u03c0 electron chromophores, these Hamiltonians mistakenly focus the oscillator strength in the fewest low-energy transitions. Advanced electronic structure methods, in contrast, spread the oscillator strength over a very wide excitation energy range, including transitions to Rydberg and continuum states, consistent with experiment.

In this perspective, we discuss electroabsorption spectroscopy (EAS), as the spectral bandshape of the electroabsorption (EA) signal directly depends on the strength of the charge carrier interactions. For instance, the electroabsorption response in molecular or confined excitonic systems can be modelled perturbatively yielding the Stark effect. In contrast, most solids exhibit weaker interactions, and a perturbative approach cannot be taken in general. For solids with negligible charge carrier interactions, one resorts to the Franz-Keldysh theory of a continuum in a field, that, in the low-field limit, simplifies to the low-field FKA effect. Alternatively, when the continuum approximation breaks down, the problem of a Wannier exciton in a field has to be solved, and numerical methods emerged as the best solution. We illustrate our discussion with two examples involving lead-halide perovskites, a new, high-stake solar cell material. In the first example, we discuss the lineshape of the electroabsorption response for thin-films of lead-iodide perovskite, that sustains the photogeneration of free carriers. In the second example, we address a confined excitonic case with lead-bromide perovskite nanoparticles, and demonstrate the presence of so-called charge-transfer excitons.",

This method can characterize the crossover from band-like transport to hopping transport in molecular crystals, and the calculated charge-carrier mobilities were found to compare well with experiments on ultrapure naphthalene crystals across the whole experimental temperature range. However, Merrifield's transformation is applicable only in the small polaron regime, and the non-local electron-phonon coupling was not included in this approach. More recently, a theory based on nonperturbative evaluation of the Kubo formula for the carrier mobility [252,253] has been put forth, showing several improvements including the elimination of low temperature singularity that often appears in theories based on narrow-band approximations and the temperature dependence and anisotropy of carrier mobility. Following up the Munn-Silbey transformation method, Zhao and coworkers [228,254] devised a self-consistent routine to determine the optimal transformation coefficients. Improved results have been obtained on the temperature dependence of transport properties in an extended Holstein model incorporating both local and non-local electron-phonon coupling.\n\nDisorder models: The chemical and physical impurities found commonly in organic materials make it imperative that the description of charge transport in organic crystals must take into account the effect of disorder. As disorder tends to inhibit band-like charge transport, it can then be described by hopping mechanism with charge carrier migrating between interacting molecules. For amorphous conjugated polymer films, the disorder can be classified into diagonal and off-diagonal types with the former being induced both by electrostatic effects and a distribution of the effective conjugation length while the latter arising from the relative separation and orientation between neighboring molecules [248].",

Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is \"easy\" to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so \"large\" that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when \"moderate\" amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band.

The situation changed dramatically in the 1950s to 1960s, when the basic architectural elements of nucleic acids and proteins were discovered and when the nascent discipline of molecular biology aimed to understand the structure-function relationships in enzymology and the metabolic processes essential for life. This motivated structural biologists to attempt the targeted crystallization of enzymes, membrane proteins, tRNAs and supramolecular assemblies. However, given the multiparametric nature of the crystallization process and the difficulty in obtaining these compounds in the gram amounts required for the existing crystallization methods, it was rapidly realised that the growth of X-ray compatible crystals was a limiting factor. Thus, the current batch and dialysis methods were scaled down and vapour-diffusion and interface-diffusion methods were invented (Table 1). At the same time, new purification technologies were developed. Together, these allowed crystallization assays in the 10-50 ml range, so that projects could be started with amounts of protein in the 1-100 mg range. However, the success rate of crystallization (i.e. the number of successful trials compared with the total number of trials) was poor, and in practice increasing numbers of trials and much larger amounts of proteins were required. Furthermore, for most crystallized proteins the time between the first crystal and resolution of the three-dimensional structure was long, and could reach several years. As a result, only a few structures had been solved by 1980, corresponding to <0.1% of the presently deposited structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\n\nBetter crystallization methods and still a bottleneck",

A salient feature of the experiments was that, aside from the inclusion of the reagent mixes, only two fundamental crystallization conditions were used, 30% PEG 3350, and 50% Tacsimate at pH 7. Overall, 65 proteins (85%) were crystallized. Most significant was that 35 of the 65 (54%) crystallized only in the presence of one or more reagent mixes, but not in control samples lacking any additives. Among the most promising types of reagent mixes were those composed of polyvalent, charged groups, such as di and tri carboxylic acids, diamino compounds, molecules bearing one or more sulfonyl or phosphate groups, and a broad range of common biochemicals, coenzymes, biological effectors, and ligands.

This salient issue, and the associated problem of producing suitable protein samples for crystallization, are now at the very center of the structural genomics enterprise. Overcoming the obstacles posed by these problems promises to contribute more, in all likelihood, than advances in any other aspect of the structural genomics process. It is the fervent hope of the editor and the authors of this compendium that these papers will offer the novel ideas, strategies, and engineering applications that may point the ways to assured success.\n\nThe papers in this volume may be classified according to four broad categories, though clearly, the multidisciplinary nature of the crystallization process invites much overlap and integration. There are four papers that deal with the physical theory, physical-chemical phenomena, assumptions, and available data pertinent to understanding in a quantitative manner the crystallization process as it applies to proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. These are the papers by Chernov, Garcia-Ruiz, M\u20ac u uhlig et al., and McPherson et al., though important contributions to this area are found as well in the paper by Wilson.\n\nThere are four eminently practical papers by Bergfors dealing with crystal seeding, Hanson et al. with cryocrystallography, Wilson with light scattering, and Dale et al., who address the question of genetically engineering proteins to better crystallize. There are three papers that might be cataloged as dealing with troublesome or emerging areas of macromolecular crystallization. One of these is by Caffrey, who focuses on membrane protein crystallization, principally from lipid matrices, and another is a comprehensive and insightful review of the unique problems presented by nucleic acid crystal growth from Golden and Kundrot. A final paper in this group, by van der Woerd et al., examines the possibilities of carrying out nanoliter-scale crystallization experiments using microfluidics.",

Different biological systems, from 14 kDa to 4600 kDa, were studied by small angle X-ray scattering.

This stimulated the birth of the biocrystallogenesis field with both 'practical' and 'basic' science aims. In the early years of biochemistry, crystallization was a tool for the preparation of biological substances. Today, biocrystallogenesis aims to provide efficient methods for crystal fabrication and a means to optimize crystal quality for X-ray crystallography. The historical development of crystallization methods for structural biology occurred first in conjunction with that of biochemical and genetic methods for macromolecule production, then with the development of structure determination methodologies and, recently, with routine access to synchrotron X-ray sources. Previously, the identification of conditions that sustain crystal growth occurred mostly empirically but, in recent decades, this has moved progressively towards more rationality as a result of a deeper understanding of the physical chemistry of protein crystal growth and the use of idea-driven screening and high-throughput procedures. Protein and nucleic acid engineering procedures to facilitate crystallization, as well as crystallization methods in gelled-media or by counter-diffusion, represent recent important achievements, although the underlying concepts are old. The new nanotechnologies have brought a significant improvement in the practice of protein crystallization. Today, the increasing number of crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank could mean that crystallization is no longer a bottleneck. This is not the case, however, because structural biology projects always become more challenging and thereby require adapted methods to enable the growth of the appropriate crystals, notably macromolecular assemblages.

A few explored the inter-protein contacts in crystal lattices and compared them with the contacts occurring in oligomer interfaces. The examination of rather small sets of structures ($200 PDB entries) showed subtle differences in size and amino-acid composition within contact patches, with a tendency for smaller patches rich in polar residues and looser interactions in packing contacts (Janin & Rodier, 1995). This suggested a harmful role for surface lysine residues in proteins that are resistant to crystallization (Dasgupta et al., 1997).",

The portions of the phase diagram associated with crystallization can be divided into three regions. The solubility boundary separates the undersaturated region, where any crystals present would dissolve, from the metastable zone, where protein in solution is supersaturated and crystals are able to grow. The supersolubility boundary separates the metastable zone from the labile zone, where the level of protein supersaturation is high enough to induce the nucleation of new crystals. Thus, for a crystal to nucleate and grow, the solution needs to reach the labile zone first, after which it can continue to grow in either the metastable or the labile zone.",

Ultimately, all macromolecular structures may be classified and cataloged according to polypeptide folds. Once all, or most, of the folds which are utilized by nature are known, then this will provide predictive insight, based primarily on amino acid sequence, of the structures and functions of unknown proteins. The sequences of many proteins from a wide range of organisms are now being defined on a broad front through massive sequencing efforts, such as the human genome project, carried out in both the public and the private sectors. Extension of these genome projects to the three-dimensional structural level of the proteome is the next logical step. Indeed, this effort, under the broad rubric of structural genomics, is now well under way.\n\nAt present, and in the foreseeable future, the only technique that can yield atomic-resolution structural images of biological macromolecules is X-ray diffraction analysis as applied to single crystals. While other methods may produce important structural and dynamic data, for the purposes described above, only Xray crystallography is adequate. As its name suggests, application of X-ray crystallography is absolutely dependent on crystals of the macromolecule, and not simply crystals, but crystals of sufficient size and quality to permit collection of precise diffraction data. The quality of the final structural image is directly determined by the perfection, size, and physical properties of the crystalline specimen. Hence the crystal becomes the keystone element of the entire process and the ultimate determinant of its success.\n\nWhen crystallizing proteins for X-ray diffraction analysis, one is usually dealing with pure often exceptionally pure macromolecules, and the objective is to grow only a few large, perfect crystals. It is important to emphasize that while the number of crystals needed may be few, often the amount of protein available may be severely limited. This in turn places grave constraints on the approaches and strategies that may be used to obtain those crystals. While new methodologies such as synchrotron radiation and cryocrystallography have driven the necessary size of specimen crystals consistently downward, they have in no way alleviated the need for single crystals of high perfection.",

The apparatus was the first practical demonstration of the principles of electron microscopy.

In other words; even though an ingot of arsenic is only about 17% larger than an antimony one of the same mass, it absorbs about 59% more heat for a given temperature rise. The heat capacity ratios of the two substances closely follows the ratios of their molar volumes (the ratios of numbers of atoms in the same volume of each substance); the departure from the correlation to simple volumes, in this case, is due to lighter arsenic atoms being significantly more closely packed than antimony atoms, instead of similar size. In other words, similar-sized atoms would cause a mole of arsenic to be 63% larger than a mole of antimony, with a correspondingly lower density, allowing its volume to more closely mirror its heat capacity behavior.",

However, as a diatomic molecule is consisted of two atoms, it merely possesses a kind of stretching vibration.

Likewise, the diatomic nitrogen molecule should have an additional rotation mode, namely about the line of the two atoms; and thus have f = 6 too. In the classical view, each of these modes should store an equal share of the heat energy. However, according to quantum mechanics, the energy difference between the allowed (quantized) rotation states is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia about the corresponding axis of rotation. Because the moment of inertia of a single atom is exceedingly small, the activation temperature for its rotational modes is extremely high. The same applies to the moment of inertia of a diatomic molecule (or a linear polyatomic one) about the internuclear axis, which is why that mode of rotation is not active in general.",

However, he also developed a strong interest for theoretical investigations. In particular, he wondered how chemical affinity relates to heat in chemical reactions. His experiments on various hydrates of sulfuric acid showed that the heat released when they formed was always the same, whether the reactions proceeded directly or through intermediates (1840). Hess thus formulated a special case of the conservation of energy two years before Julius Robert von Mayer stated a more general principle, in 1842. Hess was fully aware of the importance of his own contribution. In 1842, Hess proposed the law of thermoneutrality, which states that no heat is evolved in the exchange reactions of neutral salts in aqueous solution. A full explanation would only be given 45 years later, in terms of electrolytic dissociation, by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius.",

Recent scanning tunneling microscope studies have verified the basic conclusions of simple theory 7,8 .\n\nThe above predictions assume a semi-infinitely long tube, and corresponding experimental electronic structure studies have utilized tubes several microns in length. It is very important to know how an additional confinement of the electrons, along the nanotube axis, in finite length tubes will affect the tube's electronic structure. As the tube length is diminished, there should be a transition from a 1-D structure (quantum wire) to a 0-D structure (quantum dot).\n\nCurrently, little is known about the effects of finite length on the properties of carbon nanotubes. Recently, however, Venema et al. 9 have been able to cut nanotubes into segments of a few tens of nanometers length and, using tunneling spectroscopy, obtained evidence of increased band-gaps in these short tubes. Understanding quantum size effects in carbon nanotubes, besides the basic scientific value of understanding a prototypical 1-D to 0-D transition, is essential in device applications of nanotubes. The miniaturization offered by nanotube-based devices requires that not only their diameter but also their length should be in the nanometer range. For example, micrometer-long nanotubes have been used as Coulomb islands in single electron transistors (SET) operating at liquid helium temperatures 10,11 . By using shorter tubes, the operating temperature of SETs can be raised drastically. In general, the electrical properties of nanotubes may be tailored by selecting their length.",

This is the simple molecular orbital model, which is often a good approximation for molecules. In infinite systems, this averaging treatment leads to delocalized electronic bands, an excellent description of bulk 3D sp(3) semiconductors. However, in reality electrons try to instantaneously avoid each other; their relative motion is correlated. Strong electron-electron repulsion and correlation create new collective states and cause new femtosecond kinetic processes. This is especially true in 1D and 2D systems. The quantum size effect, a single electron property, is widely known: the band gap increases with decreasing size. This Account focuses on the experimental consequences of strong correlation. We first describe \u03c0-\u03c0* excited states in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). To obtain the spectra of individual CNTs, we developed a white-light, right-angle resonant Rayleigh scattering method. Discrete exciton transitions dominate the optical absorption spectra of both semiconducting and metallic tubes. Excitons are bound neutral excited states in which the electron and hole tightly orbit each other due to their mutual Coulomb attraction. We then describe more generally the independent roles of size and dimensionality in nanoelectronic structure, using additional examples from graphene, trans-polyacetylene chains, transition metal dichalcogenides, organic/inorganic Pb iodide perovskites, quantum dots, and pentacene van der Waals crystals. In 1D and 2D chemical systems, the electronic band structure diagram can be a poor predictor of properties if explicit correlation is not considered. One- and two-dimensional systems show quantum confinement and especially strong correlation as compared with their 3D parent systems. The Coulomb interaction is enhanced because the electrons are on the surface. One- and two-dimensional systems can exhibit essentially molecular properties even though they are infinite in size. Zero-dimensional Qdots show quantum confinement and modest electron correlation. Correlation is weak in 3D bulk semiconductors. Strongly correlated electronic states can behave as if they have fractional charge and effectively separate the spin and charge of the electron. This is apparent in the \"soliton\" state of polyacetylene, the fractional charge quantum Hall state of graphene, and the Luttinger electrical conductivity of metallic CNTs.",

Our numerical simulation results are as follows. In figure 1, we present the ac conductance and the density of states (DOS) of a (10, 10) CNT with 100 principal layers as a function of the Fermi energy at the low-frequency limit.h\u03c9 is set to be 10 \u22126 eV. For dc transport, it is known that a series of steps are observable on the conductance versus Fermi energy curves for infinite-length CNTs [5,6,14]. These steps mean that at larger energies, more subbands begin to contribute to the electronic conduction. Therefore, the dc conductance increases step-by-step at the subband edges of the infinite-length nanotubes, where the peaks of the DOS appear. In the finite-length nanotubes, we are still able to identify these steps, but their profile is no longer clear. On the other hand, compared with the ac conductance of infinite-length nanotubes at the low-frequency limit [7], more peaks are observed on the conductance curves. The finding is attributed to the presence of more peaks on the DOS curves of the finite-length CNT. Thus at the low-frequency limit resonant transmission occurs. Our observation of this resonant transmission behaviour is in accordance with that indicated in the dc transport of finite-size CNTs [18]. Figure 2 shows the ac conductance components g c and g d as a function of the Fermi energy at higher frequency. The symmetric centres of the conductance curves for both  the real part (dissipative part) and imaginary part (non-dissipative part) begin to shift from zero. Careful calculation shows that the deviations are exactly half of the value of the ac frequency \u03c9 and are independent of the helicities and lengths of CNTs. These deviations are caused by the ac coupling of a CNT with the electrodes. The expression for self-energy shows that photonassisted transport causes the effective Fermi surface to shift from 0 to \u2212\u03c9/2. The symmetric centres of the conductance curves shift accordingly. In figure 3, we present the ac conductance component due to the charge current g c and that due to the displacement current g d for a 100layer (10,",

In the general DOS diagram, the van Hove singularities at high BE are \u03c3-states that originate from C(2s) atomic orbital combinations.The \u03c3-states formed from C(2p) orbitals lie at lower BE between -11 and -4 eV, while \u03c0-states extend from -5 to 0 eV. These states are important as they are responsible for the electrical properties of nanotubes. The states above the Fermi level are mainly \u03c0 * -states, while \u03c3 * -states extend above 10 eV. The inset gives an expanded view of the fine structure of the 96\u00c5 nanotube near the Fermi energy. In addition, the values of the local density of states (LDOS) near the Fermi energy for sections ranging from the tube boundary (index 1) to the middle of the tube (section 40) are plotted. To construct these LDOS plots, we summed over the density of the twelve carbon atoms contained in that section of the nanotube. Fromfigure 8it can be seen that the LDOS of the \u03c0-states near E F hardly changes along the length of the tube, indicating that these states are indeed well delocalized within this short tube.Finally, we shall compare briefly the results obtained with the different computational techniques. As shown inFigure 1, both HF and MNDO-PM3 methods give a large band-gap (9.0 and 6.5 eV, respectively) for a short 4 A nanotube, while DFT and EHMO give moderate band-gap values (2.4 and 1.8 eV, respectively). Due to the poor description of unoccupied orbital energy levels in Hartree-Fock theory, the band-gap values are overestimated by several electron volts for low band-gap polymers 27-29 . The problem is slightly less important in the MNDO-PM3 method, where the parametrization includes a treatment of correlation through the fitting with experimental data",

When there were a sufficient number of hydrogen cyanide molecules close to the nanotube, it became semiconducting. This metallic to semiconducting transformation of the nanotube was verified by analyzing its conductance and current as a function of the number of molecules of hydrogen cyanide present.

The specificity of the method is based on the observation that only deoxyribose 1-phosphate is hydrolyzed by heating at pH 7.4, while both deoxyribose 1-phosphate and ribose 1-phosphate remain unchanged when heated at pH 10. A tissue extract is heated at pH 10. The amount of deoxyribose 1-phosphate plus ribose 1-phosphate is determined from that of deoxyinosine plus inosine formed in a coupled enzymatic reaction, based on the following two-stage transformation: deoxyribose 1-phosphate (ribose 1-phosphate) + adenine in equilibrium deoxyadenosine (adenosine) + inorganic phosphate, catalyzed by adenosine phosphorylase; deoxyadenosine (adenosine) + H2O----deoxyinosine (inosine), catalyzed by adenosine deaminase. By taking advantage of its unique heat lability, deoxyribose 1-phosphate is eliminated by heating the tissue extract at pH 7.4, and ribose 1-phosphate is determined as above. The amount of deoxyribose 1-phosphate stems from the difference between the amount of deoxyinosine plus inosine measured in the tissue extract heated at pH 10 and that of inosine measured in the tissue extract heated at pH 7.4. Free deoxyribose 1-phosphate has been found in rat tissues, as well as in Bacillus cereus during stationary phase of growth.",

The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal. In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant. Glucose is a primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. In animals glucose arises from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate and glycerol, by a process known as gluconeogenesis.']",

Ribose and glucose were used to compare their reactivities and pathways of 2-acetylfuran formation. A stable isotope labeling method was used to study their reactivity. A 1:1 mixture of [(13)C(6)]glucose and unlabeled ribose (or other unlabeled sugar) was reacted with proline at 145 degrees C for 40 min. The reactivity of each sugar was revealed by the ratio of isotopomers. The reactivity of sugars in 2-acetylfuran formation decreased in the order ribose, fructose, glucose, rhamnose, and sucrose. This method simplified the reaction system and the calculation process and gave a direct comparison of reactivity as seen via mass spectrum. The difference between glucose and ribose in 2-acetylfuran formation was that glucose could form 2-acetylfuran directly from cyclization of its intact carbon skeleton, whereas ribose first underwent degradation into fragments before forming a six-carbon unit leading to 2-acetylfuran. In the presence of cysteine, ribose could not generate 2-acetylfuran at a detectable level. When ribose was reacted with glycine, formaldehyde generated from glycine combined with ribose to form 2-acetylfuran. In other amino acids, a symmetric structure of the ribose intermediate was formed, making fragmentation more complicated.",

In the absence of chemical reactions in solution, the charge on the metallic nanoparticle is constant outside this range before or after the collision. However, the double layer capacitances of both the electrode and the NP are influenced by each other, varying as the function of distance. Because the charge on the nanoparticle is constant, the outer potential of the metallic NP and hence its Fermi level varies as the capacitance changes. This effect is more pronounced for small particles (&lt;10 nm) in diluted supporting electrolyte solutions, especially if the metallic nanoparticle and the electrode have different potentials of zero charge. Nanoparticles were found to be more electrochemically active in the vicinity of the electrode. For example, the outer potential of a positively-polarized 2 nm radius NP was predicted to decrease by 35 mV or 100 mV (depending on the electrostatic model used to describe the electric double layer), when the NP moved from an electrode at 1 V (<ivs.</i its pzc) to the bulk. The force between the equilibrated NP and the electrode is always repulsive when they have the same pzc.

We show that the excess charge is accumulated at the surface of the nanoparticle within a narrow layer given by the typical screening distance of the electronic system. As a consequence, for nanoparticles in vacuum, the dipolar plasmon mode displays only a small frequency shift upon charging. We obtain a blue shift for positively charged clusters and a red shift for negatively charged clusters, consistent with the change of the electron spill-out from the nanoparticle boundaries. For negatively charged clusters, the Fermi level is eventually promoted above the vacuum level leading to the decay of the excess charge via resonant electron transfer into the continuum. We show that, depending on the charge, the process of electron loss can be very fast, on the femtosecond time scale. Our results are of great relevance to correctly interpret the optical response of the nanoparticles obtained in electrochemistry, and demonstrate that the measured shift of the plasmon resonances upon charging of nanoparticles cannot be explained without account for the surface chemistry and the dielectric environment.

The dephasing of the LSPR is extremely fast, to the extent that it cannot be accurately measured using conventional ultrafast measurements. 56 A particularly useful approach for studying LSPR dephasing is to measure the linewidths of single metal nanoparticles. 26-27, 63-68 These measurements where first done by Rayleigh light scattering experiments, 26-27, 63-64 but recently elegant single particle absorption measurements have also been applied to this problem. [65][66][67][68] The LSPR linewidth has contributions from several different processes: direct decay of the LSPR into excited electron-hole pairs \u0393 (known as Landau damping), radiation damping \u0393 (energy loss by scattering a photon), and damping due to electron-surface collisions \u0393 . 27, 56,64,67,69 The surface term is the one that is responsible for the generation of hot electrons, and will be discussed in detail below. 70 Note that G b contains contributions from inter-band as well as intra-band (\"Drude model\") transitions,\ni.e. G b = G Drude + G inter-band . 14 b\nG is usually assumed to be the same as the decay rate for electrons in the bulk metal, 56 although recent calculations have shown significant variations in \u0393 for small particles with respect to the bulk value, when the electronic spectrum becomes discrete. 71 For not too large particles, \u0393 and \u0393 are proportional to the volume V and the inverse of the effective path length for electrons in the particle 1 \u2044 , respectively. 13,56,[72][73] Thus, the total linewidth can be written as:\n\u0393 = \u0393 + \u0393 + \u0393 = \u0393 + 2\u210f + (1)",

MODEL FOR THE NANOPARTICLE\n\nWe use the spherical jellium model for the nanoparticle which provides a model system for investigating the response of the conduction electrons in small metal particles [20,21]. In this model, the positive ions of the metal cluster are replaced by a uniform sphere of positive charge and the density functional formalism within the linear response approximation is used to calculate the response of the cluster to the time dependent external potential. Two kinds of excitations are possible for a metal cluster namely, single particle excitations and plasmon excitations. In a single particle excitation, an electron is excited from an occupied level to an unoccupied level and these are the electron-hole pair excitations. Plasmon excitations are collective oscillations involving many electrons, wherein the electronic charge density oscillates as a whole against the positive background.\n\nWe denote the Hamiltonian of the nanoparticle as H 0 . The molecule is treated within a single particle model. An electron which was initially in the orbital \u03c6 g is excited to an orbital \u03c6 e . De-excitation of the molecule, in which the electron goes back to \u03c6 g may be thought of as a time dependent potential acting on the nanoparticle, given by\n\u03a6 ext (r, t) = e \u2212i\u03c9t \u03c6 * e (r \u2032 )\u03c6 g (r \u2032 ) |r \u2212r \u2032 | dr \u2032 .(1)\nIn the above, \u03c9 is the frequency of the transition corresponding to de-excitation.

In the first scenario, we realize that the effect is totally different from what happens when the degeneracy of a single electron confined in a magnetic field is not taken into account. In particular, when the degeneracy of the system is negligible, the magnetocaloric effect cools the system, while in the other case, when the degeneracy is strong, the system heats up. For the second case, we study the competition between the characteristic frequency of the potential trap and the cyclotron frequency to find the optimal region that maximizes the \u0394T of the magnetocaloric effect, and due to the strong degeneracy of this problem, the results are in coherence with those obtained for the Landau problem. Finally, we consider the case of a transition from a normal MCE to an inverse one and back to normal as a function of temperature.

However, simulating realistically sized systems while retaining the atomistic description remains computationally intractable for fully quantum mechanical approaches. Here we introduce an atomistic electrodynamics model where the traditional description of nanoparticles in terms of a macroscopic homogenous dielectric constant is replaced by an atomic representation with dielectric properties that depend on the local chemical environment. This model provides a unified description of bare and ligand-coated nanoparticles, as well as strongly interacting nanoparticle dimer systems. The non-local screening owing to an inhomogeneous ligand layer is shown to drastically modify the near-field properties. This will be important to consider in optimization of plasmonic nanostructures for near-field spectroscopy and sensing applications. ",

The most noticeable feature is that the fields are strongly enhanced just outside the nanoparticle surface. This effect is what gives rise to the field enhancements in SERS. However, the field inside the particle is also enhanced, and it is this field that causes photon absorption, see below. Note that the field enhancements are similar for the two different sizes. This is due to compensating effects from radiation damping and electron-surface scattering.

The many-body part is only (and continuously) dependent on particle size, and can be very well described in terms of the capacitance of classical spherical conductors for clusters with more the 55 atoms.

The electron-hole pairs produced by decay of the LSPR will be distributed over a range of energies in the metal's electronic bands. [57][58][59][60][61]76 For bulk metal surfaces this distribution has been measured through ultrafast photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. [77][78][79][80][81] The results from the measurements show that the electrons initially have a non-thermal distribution that rapidly relaxes to a thermal (Fermi-Dirac) distribution via electron-electron scattering processes. 77 Another physical situation is current injection from a plasmonic nanostructure to an electric contact. [88][89][90] Figure 2 shows the calculated distributions of excited carriers in optically-excited nanospheres of various radii. 70 These distributions were computed in a model that includes two electron relaxation times, one for the momentum and another for the energy (see also Fig. S1 in supporting Information). 61,70 The approach of two relaxation times allows us to describe the two key observations of the plasmonic dynamics. 61,70 (1) Plasmons exhibit fast dephasing due to the short momentum relaxation time that can be extracted from the plasmonic-peak broadening in the absorption spectra. Within the Drude model, this time is given by the parameter (Eq. S5). For gold and silver plasmons, the dephasing times are obviously short, 8 and 33 fs, respectively (Table S1). (2) The cooling of hot electrons due to photon emission is typically much slower and occurs in the sub-ps range. Such relaxation time can be taken from time-resolved experiments. 56 Figure 2 shows   The breaking of linear momentum conservation in a NP is a key mechanism that can also be interpreted in terms of the discretization (or quantitation) of the electronic states in the confined volume of a NP. This quantization involves, of course, the surfaces of the structure. In a large NP, the quantization and the surface scattering effects become equivalent, as it was shown theoretically in Refs. [57,59,61,70]. Another name for the decay of a plasmon through surface scattering, which is used sometimes in the literature, is Landau damping.",

When the temperature is low enough compared to the level spacing between the Fermi level and the first excited state level ( B < ), an equal level spacing scheme is quite a good approximation even without rigorous statistical processing since the populations of higher excited states are negligibly small and, thus, the structure of the higher 13 excited states is not important.

We address difficulties in calculating the electrostatic energy when high charging energies limit the total charge to a single quantum, entailing unequal potentials on the particles. We show that the energy at small separation h has a singular logarithmic dependence on h. We derive a general form for this energy in terms of the singular capacitance of two spheres in near contact c(h), together with nonsingular geometric features of the cluster. Using this form, we determine the energies of various clusters, finding that more compact clusters are more stable. These energies are proposed to be significant for metal-semiconductor binary nanoparticle lattices found experimentally. We sketch how these effects should dictate the relative abundances of metal nanoparticle clusters in nonpolar solvents. ",

Although diamond is known to be the preferred allotrope of carbon at high pressure, the possibility of producing under pressure high-density polymorphs of diamond, including metallic forms, has been discussed. Structural changes have already been reported in diamond under non-hydrostatic pressures around 150 GPa and large deformation. However, measurements of the properties of diamond under hydrostatic pressure have been limited to below 40 GPa. Here, we report accurate measurements of the volume and of the optical phonon frequency of diamond under hydrostatic pressure up to 140 GPa. We show that diamond is more compressible than currently expected. By combining the volume and the frequency pressure shifts, we deduce that diamond remains very stable under pressure: it is a Gruneisen solid up to at least 140 GPa, and the covalent bond is even slightly strengthened under pressure.

However, through a misunderstanding with Wurtz, Kekul\u00e9's paper appeared in print first, in May 1858, and so Kekul\u00e9 captured the priority for the discovery of the self-linking of carbon atoms. When Couper angrily confronted Wurtz, Wurtz expelled him from the laboratory.",

Somehow, Couper realised that carbon can form four bonds, thereby attaching itself with different strengths to other carbon atoms in a compound: In diamond all four bonds are connected to other carbon atoms in three-dimensions, making it so hard. In graphite only three bonds are connected to other carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, allowing layers to slide over each other, making graphite soft.",

The Interdependence between Ocean Depth and Pressure in Scuba Diving - \nPressure increases with ocean depth, and the pressure changes most rapidly as divers reach the surface. The pressure a diver experiences is the sum of all pressures above the diver (from the water and the air). Most pressure measurements are given in units of atmospheres, expressed as \"atmospheres absolute\" or ATA in the diving community: Every 33 feet of salt water represents 1 ATA of pressure in addition to 1 ATA of pressure from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body's air pockets in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these air pockets to expand, potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore undergo equalization by adding air to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air to the mask by breathing out of the nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques; the corollary is also true on ascent, divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization. Buoyancy, or the ability to control whether a diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy compensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in their BCD expands because of lower pressure according to Boyle's law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases the volume). The expanding air increases the buoyancy of the diver, and they begin to ascend. The diver must vent air from the BCD or risk an uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending, the increased pressure causes the air in the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the diver must add air to the BCD or risk an uncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean floor. The pressure also impacts how long a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver dives, the more compressed the air that is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet, the pressure is 2 ATA and the air would be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up available air twice as fast as at the surface.",

Because most of the physiology principles still used today were first formulated by Irving, it is important to the study of this field that the sequence of thought is examined as a progression of theory. The review covers the field in roughly decadal blocks and traces ideas as they were first suggested, tested, modified and in some cases, abandoned. Because diving physiology has also been extremely dependent on new technologies used in the development of diving recorders, a chronological approach fits well with advances in electronics and mechanical innovation. There are many species that dive underwater as part of their natural behavior, but it is mainly the marine mammals (seals, sea lions, and whales) that demonstrate both long duration and dives to great depth. There have been many studies on other diving species including birds, snakes, small aquatic mammals, and humans.

During ascent, the turtles actively swim at a similar stroke rate, but at a lower pitch angle of about 26\u00b0, giving a fairly low ascent rate of about 0.4 m/s, or 24 m/min.

These creatures must survive in extremely harsh conditions, such as hundreds of bars of pressure, small amounts of oxygen, very little food, no sunlight, and constant, extreme cold. Most creatures have to depend on food floating down from above. These creatures live in very demanding environments, such as the abyssal or hadal zones, which, being thousands of meters below the surface, are almost completely devoid of light. The water is between 3 and 10 degrees Celsius and has low oxygen levels. Due to the depth, the pressure is between 20 and 1,000 bar. Creatures that live hundreds or even thousands of meters deep in the ocean have adapted to the high pressure, lack of light, and other factors. Evolutionary adaptations of deep-sea creatures Lack of light The lack of light requires creatures to have special adaptations to find food, avoid predators, and find mates.",

The speed of water movement can affect dive planning and safety. Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline. Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.",

All foraging dives in these species appear to be much longer than the estimated aerobic dive limits, indicating that the whales generally return to the surface from them with an oxygen debt. It has been hypothesised that the series of shallow dives and the long periods between foraging dives are needed to recover from the oxygen debt in preparation for the next deep dive.

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low. As the size of molecule increases from methanol to butanol, dispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed:\n$\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {methanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ethanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {propanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {butanol }}$.\n\nAs temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid. At the higher temperature, more molecules have the necessary kinetic energy, $K E$, to escape from the liquid into the gas phase.",

The formula used in quantum mechanics to obtain the dipole moment of a certain configuration is identical to the formula used in classical electrostatics to obtain the dipole moment of a certain distribution of point charges and a continuous charge distribution. Thus, concerning the DMS, classical electrostatics and quantum mechanics get along very well. What about the energy, i.e. the PES?

Large complex ions tend to cause salting in: adding salt increases nonpolar solubilities in water. Molecular dynamics simulations of Smith 263 and Kalra et al. 264 indicate that salting out is because the hydrophobe is excluded from the first hydration shell of the ion. Salting in is because the hydrophobe can occupy the ion's solvation shell. And, like chaotrope/kosmotrope properties, Hofmeister effects tend to correlate with the charge densities on the ions. Figure 20 illustrates the structural basis for Hofmeister effects. 40,126 Small ions exclude hydrophobes because small ions bind water molecules quite tightly. This exclusion increases the hydrophobe concentration in the remaining volume of the solution, driving the hydrophobes to aggregate with increasing ion concentration. Large ions do not exclude hydrophobes because large ions do not bind waters so tightly. Therefore, adding large ions to solution does not drive increased hydrophobe concentration in the remaining solution volume. The black bars in Figure 20 show the hydrophobe exclusion volume of different ions, as well as the well-known observation that the smaller ions tend to have the larger exclusion volumes. 265 Figure 21 shows the PMF of two ions coming together in water. It shows how the solvation-shell waters are structured at different ion separations. When the ions are far apart, each ion's solvation shell is structured as described above for the isolated ions. When the two ions are separated by about one layer of water, the bridging waters between them will be structured by multiple interactions. Each bridging water interacts with other bridging waters through hydrogen bonding, and each bridging water interacts with each ion through its water dipole. When the two mobile ions come into contact, the ion\u2212ion electrostatics can also contribute substantially to the free energy. Extensive computer simulations using different water models show that Figure 19. Around small ions, waters become electrostatically ordered. Around large ions, waters become hydrophobically ordered. The coloring shows the probability density of water dipole positive (blue) and negative (red) charges as well as water\u2212water hydrogen bonding arms (orange). About small ions, water is highly electrostricted. the shape of the PMF depends on all these factors. The resulting free energy from the",

Elucidation of all these roles calls for atomistic simulations. However, currently available methods do not lend themselves to efficient simulation of proton transfer events, or even polarizability and flexibility. Here, we report that an explicit account of valency can provide a unified description for the polarizability, flexibility, and dissociability of water in one intuitive and efficient setting. We call this approach LEWIS, after the chemical theory that inspires the use of valence electron pairs. In this paper, we provide details of the method, the choice of the training set, and predictions for the neat ambient liquid, with emphasis on structure, dynamics, and polarization. LEWIS water provides a good description of bulk properties, and dipolar and quadrupolar responses.",

Diatomic nitrogen is bound together by a triple bond, which makes it rather inert. Yield and efficiency are low, meaning that the output must be continuously separated and extracted for the reaction to proceed at an acceptable pace. Combined with the energy needed to produce hydrogen and purified atmospheric nitrogen, ammonia production is energy-intensive, accounting for 1 to 2% of global energy consumption, 3% of global carbon emissions, and 3 to 5% of natural gas consumption.",

Small-scale production of liquid nitrogen is easily achieved using this principle. Liquid nitrogen may be produced for direct sale, or as a byproduct of manufacture of liquid oxygen used for industrial processes such as steelmaking.

At room temperature, for example, the reaction is so slow that if we prepared a mixture of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, no detectable amount of ammonia would form during our lifetime. The formation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen is an exothermic process:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}(g) \\quad \\Delta H=-92.2 \\mathrm{~kJ}\n$$\n\nThus, increasing the temperature to increase the rate lowers the yield. If we lower the temperature to shift the equilibrium to favor the formation of more ammonia, equilibrium is reached more slowly because of the large decrease of reaction rate with decreasing temperature.\n\nPart of the rate of formation lost by operating at lower temperatures can be recovered by using a catalyst. The net effect of the catalyst on the reaction is to cause equilibrium to be reached more rapidly.\n\n[^10]In the commercial production of ammonia, conditions of about $500^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 150-900 \\mathrm{~atm}$, and the presence of a catalyst are used to give the best compromise among rate, yield, and the cost of the equipment necessary to produce and contain high-pressure gases at high temperatures (Figure 17.20).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.20 Commercial production of ammonia requires heavy equipment to handle the high temperatures and pressures required. This schematic outlines the design of an ammonia plant.\n\nAmong the factors affecting chemical reaction rates discussed earlier in this chapter was the presence of a catalyst, a substance that can increase the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction.

Initially cylinders were mostly used for carbon dioxide in carbonation or dispensing of beverages. In 1895 refrigeration compression cycles were further developed to enable the liquefaction of air, most notably by Carl von Linde allowing larger quantities of oxygen production and in 1896 the discovery that large quantities of acetylene could be dissolved in acetone and rendered nonexplosive allowed the safe bottling of acetylene. A particularly important use was the development of welding and metal cutting done with oxygen and acetylene from the early 1900s. As production processes for other gases were developed many more gases came to be sold in cylinders without the need for a gas generator. Gas production technology",

Nuclei that are more strongly shielded by electrons require a higher applied field to bring them into resonance so they absorb on the right side of the NMR chart. Nuclei that are less strongly shielded need a lower applied field for resonance so they absorb on the left of the NMR chart.\n\nMost ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ chemical shifts fall within the range 0 to $10 \\delta$, which can be divided into the five regions shown in TABLE 13.2. By remembering the positions of these regions, it's often possible to tell at a glance what kinds of protons a molecule contains.\n\n\nTABLE 13.3 shows the correlation of ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ chemical shift with electronic environment in more detail. In general, protons bonded to saturated, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbons absorb at higher fields, whereas protons bonded to $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbons absorb at lower fields. Protons on carbons that are bonded to electronegative atoms, such as N, O, or halogen, also absorb at lower fields.",

The OH proton shifts and hydrogen bond distances for methanol or ethanol complexed with pyridine depend very much on the functional employed and very little on the basis set, provided it is sufficiently large to give the correct quasi-linear hydrogen bond geometry. The CH proton shifts are insensitive to both the functional and the basis set. NMR shifts for all protons in several alcohol/pyridine complexes are calculated at the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof PBE0/cc-pVTZ//PBE0/6-311\u2009+\u2009G(d,p) level in the gas phase. The results correlate with the shifts for the pyridine-complexed alcohols, determined by analysing data from the NMR titration of alcohols against pyridine. More pragmatically, computed shifts for a wider range of alcohols correlate with experimental shifts in neat pyridine. Shifts for alcohols in dimethylsulfoxide, based on the corresponding complexes in the gas phase, correlate well with the experimental values, but the overall root mean square difference is high (0.23\u2009ppm), shifts for the OH, CHOH and other CH protons being systematically overestimated, by averages of 0.42, 0.21 and 0.06\u2009ppm, respectively. If the computed shifts are corrected accordingly, a very good correlation is obtained with a gradient of 1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, an intercept of 0.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u2009ppm and a root mean square difference of 0.09\u2009ppm. This is a modest improvement on the result of applying the CHARGE programme to a slightly different set of alcohols. Some alcohol complexes with acetone and acetonitrile were investigated both in the gas phase and in a continuum of the relevant solvent.",

The conversion of the raw data to this information is called assigning the spectrum. For example, for the 1H-NMR spectrum for ethanol (CH3CH2OH), one would expect signals at each of three specific chemical shifts: one for the CH3 group, one for the CH2 group and one for the OH group. A typical CH3 group has a shift around 1 ppm, a CH2 attached to an OH has a shift of around 4 ppm and an OH has a shift anywhere from 2\u20136 ppm depending on the solvent used and the amount of hydrogen bonding. While the O atom does draw electron density away from the attached H through their mutual sigma bond, the electron lone pairs on the O bathe the H in their shielding effect. In paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy, measurements are conducted on paramagnetic samples. The paramagnetism gives rise to very diverse chemical shifts. In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the chemical shift range can span up to thousands of ppm.",

The spins of nonequivalent aromatic protons on substituted rings often couple with each other, giving rise to spin-spin splitting patterns that can identify the substitution of the ring.\n\nMuch of the difference in chemical shift between aromatic protons (6.5-8.0 $\\delta$ ) and vinylic protons (4.5-6.5 $\\delta$ ) is due to a property of aromatic rings called ring-current. When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current. Aromatic protons are deshielded by the induced magnetic field caused by delocalized $\\pi$ electrons circulating around the aromatic ring.\nNote that the aromatic ring-current produces different effects inside and outside the ring. If a ring were large enough to have both \"inside\" and \"outside\" protons, the protons on the outside would be deshielded and absorb\nat a field lower than normal but those on the inside would be shielded and absorb at a field higher than normal. This prediction has been strikingly confirmed by studies on [18]annulene, an $18-\\pi$-electron cyclic conjugated polyene that contains a H\u00fcckel number of electrons $(4 n+2=18$ when $n=4)$. The six inside protons of [18]annulene are strongly shielded by the aromatic ring-current and absorb at $-3.0 \\delta$ (that is, 3.0 ppm upfield from TMS, off the normal chart), while the 12 outside protons are strongly deshielded and absorb in the typical aromatic region at 9.3 ppm downfield from TMS.\n\n\n[18]Annulene\n\n$$\n\\text { Inside } \\mathrm{H}:-3.0 \\delta\n$$",

This changed the constant electric field assumed by Mott to a linearly decaying electric field. This semiconductor space-charge layer under the metal is known as the Schottky barrier. A similar theory was also proposed by Davydov in 1939.

We assume that density of states in both semiconductors is still given by\nEq. (1) even if d \u226b R [8].\nBelow we assume that the tunneling barrier is high enough so that all resistance is determined by hops from occupied states on the left side of the barrier to empty states on the right side.

Resistors crossing the barrier have much larger resistance and, therefore, they determine the tunneling conductance between two semiconductors. One can imagine that the bulk of both semiconductors is a superconductor and the tunneling conductance is due to parallel resistors which cross the barrier. Then it is clear that at large enough d, the number of these parallel resistors and, therefore, the tunneling current, I, is proportional to the product of number of localized states with energy from 0 < \u03b5 < eU/2 on the left side and number of empty states in the interval rom 0 > \u03b5 > \u2212eU/2.

Simultaneously, as we see from Eq. (7), critical area S c decreases with growing U and eventually approaches S. At this point we return to the conductance of a macroscopic barrier.

Generally the most significantly resistive path for the current is represented by the Schottky barriers, and so the channel itself does not contribute significantly to the conduction when the transistor is turned on.

At larger \u2126 the rate \u03bd(\u2126) sharply decreases with \u2126 because wavelength of the phonon becomes smaller than a (see, for example, Ref. [2]). Now we can identify optimal pairs which determine the contact conductance. They all have arms which are very close to r = d. Indeed, the barrier part of the arm of such a pair can not be longer than d + a 0 , while the semiconductor part of the arm can not be longer than a. Otherwise, a pair has exponentially smaller than optimal ones conductance and should be disregarded. Thus, the occupied state of an optimal pair should be in the layer with thickness a near the plane of the left semiconductor barrier junction. If area of the junction is S the volume available for the occupied pair is Sa. For a given occupied state the empty state of an optimal pair should reside in the cylinder with the height a and with the base with the shape of the disk of the radius (da 0 ) 1/2 drawn on the plane of the right barrier-semiconductor junction around the center which exactly opposes the occupied state on the left junction.

The presence of the energetic disorder makes difficult a unique determination of the EA and IE, which results in the divergent definition of the EA and IE, and hence the IBs. In case of organic semiconductors, the EA and IE are determined most frequently referring either to the onset [9,10] or the maximum [14] of the HOMO and LUMO. The effect of ambiguity becomes more significant as the metal Fermi level is approaching the indistinct edge and arrives at the fundamental limit called the Fermi level pinning, where the IB does not follows the change in the metal work function. Although often attributed to surface states [15] and metal-induced interface gap states [16,17], it has been shown that the Fermi level pinning in the organic semiconductor energy gap mainly occurs from electrostatics [10,18].

While doing so, we will neglect the existence of the vacuum level mismatch for an exclusive analysis of the effect of energetic disorder.\n\n\nExperimental determination of electronic structures\n\nThe UPS and IPES are the methods of choice to determine the electronic structure of semiconductors. Inspired by the first work on the external photoelectric effect of metals by Einstein [19] and the same of semiconductors by Condon et al [20], Apker et al not only determined the position of the valence band edge but also demonstrated that the density-of-states in the valence band can be experimentally deduced from the energy of photoelectrons [21]. These initial works on photoelectrons support the band theory for crystalline semiconductors providing a link between the existence of the band edge with the sharp cut-off of stopping potential from photo-emission measurement. In addition, experimental determination of the IB based on the Schottky-Mott rule became possible from measured semiconductor IE, EA and metal work function.\n\nFor disordered inorganic semiconductors, theoretical models on the electronic structure postulated that the lack of long-range order results in the loss of sharp band edges so that the density of states shows a tail of localized states extending into the energy gap [22,23]. Its implication on a transport model, multiple trapping-and-releasing model (MTR), results of a clear distinction between extended states above mobility edge (ME) for band-like transport and localized tail states for charge carrier trapping-and-release [24,25]. Interpretation of the energy of photoelectrons from amorphous silicon in terms of an exponential tailing of the density-of-states was proposed by Peterson et al [26]. Noting that the transport of charge carriers takes place around the ME, the band edge in the Schottky-Mott model for an ideal junction is replaced with the ME, which is experimentally determined from the onset of the UPS or IPES signals and referred to as the band edge of the same semiconductor in its crystalline phase [27,28].",

For the sake of simplicity, we adjusted the experimental curve considering only two levels (HOMO and LUMO) because the charging of the molecule will most likely involve these two levels. The best adjustment of the experimental data is obtained assuming the HOMO to be located at the equilibrium Fermi level [50]. For this calculation, a charging energy of E c =0.19 eV was used, which is comparable to values reported for C 60 molecules by Porath et al [47]. This is about one order of magnitude smaller than the calculated charging energy for an isolated molecule but a strong reduction of the charging energy is expected for molecules adsorbed onto metallic electrodes. As can be seen in Fig. 11, a good qualitative description of the experimental data can be obtained once the tunneling barrier parameters are adjusted to fit the magnitude of the current step. A prefactor is included to account for the barrier suppression at high bias [51] (See Appendix A). The phenomenological parameters (accounting for the barrier height and width respectively) used to fit the data are \u03c6 =0.47eV and d=5.3\u00c5.

One of the main limitations of such a device is strongly related to the presence of this current that makes it difficult to properly switch it off. A clear advantage of such a device is that there is no need for channel doping and expensive technological steps like ion implantation and high temperature annealings can be avoided, keeping the thermal budget low. However the band bending due to the voltage difference between drain and gate often injects enough carriers to make impossible a proper switch off of the device.

Second, only holes are injected from both electrodes (hole-only conduction). The result can be straightforwardly extended to the electron-only or bipolar conduction. For the latter instance, it is sufficient to add the electron and hole currents. Third, hole mobility is constant and independent of the hole concentration and electric field. The former is founded on the comparison of the charge carrier density-dependent mobility in diodes and transistors [36], which demonstrated that the mobility is low and less dependent on the charge carrier concentration in diodes where hole concentration is much lower than in transistors. In addition, the latter is established on the comparison of the electric field-dependence of mobility in diodes and transistors [37], which indicates that the mobility is less sensitive to the electric field in diodes.

We particularly focus our attention on the limiting case where all diffusion coefficients tend to infinity (the \"reaction-limited\" case) and particles cannot simply diffuse out of the reaction volume. (We would say that the boundaries of the volume are \"reflective\".) In this case, the position of a particle at a time t + t is a uniform random variable independent of its position at time t. To see this, note that the updated position of a particle conditioned on its previous position will be a Gaussian random variable with large variance; the boundary conditions cause this distribution to approximate a uniform distribution, and the approximation improves as the variance grows. Now, consider a reaction of the form A + B \u2192 \u2205, with rate \u03bb and reaction distance \u03c1. The symbol \u2205 denotes that we are not interested in the products of the reaction. The probability that a reaction occurs between a given pair of A and B molecules in a time period [t, t + t) is given by:\nP(reaction in [t, t + t)) = K (\u03c1, [t, t + t))\u03bb t,(49)\nwhere K (\u03c1, [t, t + t)) represents the exact proportion of the time interval [t, t + t) for which the given pairs are within a distance \u03c1 of each other. Typically, K not only is unknown, but also is itself a random variable, so that reactions in the \u03bb \u2212 \u03c1 model are doubly stochastic processes. In the limiting case where D \u2192 \u221e, K becomes a known random variable. At any given time point in [t, t + t), each molecule is uniformly distributed, so that the probability of any pair being within \u03c1 of each other is some constant c. The constant c is approximately equal to 4\u03c0\u03c1 3 3V , the proportion of the total volume occupied by a sphere of radius \u03c1; c is not exactly equal to this quantity because of boundary effects: if one particle is close to a boundary, there will be less space around it for a second particle to react in.

Chemical reaction kinetics in vivo differs significantly from the one in pipette [1]. Geometry of the living cell interior can be quite complicated and there is experimental evidence that the cell is structured in many ways, already starting at the cytoplasm level. For example, for a single cell the total amount of protein content can be as high as 17-30% by weight which results in extremely structured and crowded space. In addition, the cell interior (roughly 10\u00b5m in diameter) is further partitioned in smaller spaces such as organelles (e.g. mitochondria with 50 nm in diameter), and roughly 50% of the cell volume is filled by organelles. For typical physiological concentrations of individual proteins of 1nM one gets N prot \u223c 1nM(10\u00b5m) 3 \u223c 1000 copies of individual protein. This can result in large spatio-temporal fluctuations of protein number. Also, delivery of proteins can become an issue.\n\nThere are two ways to theoretically study such complicated reaction environment, either by performing stochastic simulations or by constructing equations of motion that describe time evolution of averaged quantities (e.g. concentration). The focus will be on the later. It will be argued that any attempt to describe intracellular chemical reactions in terms of mean field equations (that assume perfect mixing) might fail spectacularly. Intracellular dynamics is intrinsically stochastic due to low number of chemicals, exclusion effects are important and, ultimately, many scales interact at the same time with large degree of spatio-temporal organization. To develop theoretical framework that can be used to describe such situation is far from trivial. The theory of diffusion controlled reactions naturally suggests itself in this context. In the following some generic features of diffusion controlled reaction will be discussed with a particular emphasis on mathematical/physical models that are used to describe them. The validity of the truncated equation of motion approach will be critically reviewed, with a particular emphasis on its simplest form, the mean field equations/kineteics.\n\n\nDiffusion controlled reactions: mathematical model",

Second, it cannot be used to compute any physical diffusion coefficient when trajectories consists of switching episodes for example alternating between free and confined diffusion.

Two facts help us to evaluate n (i) A (t + t). Firstly, because there are huge numbers of molecules of all types in all subvolumes, a huge number of reaction events of each type will happen in the time period [t, t + t). This implies that we do not need to think about the probability that a reaction happens, but the number of times it happens, and by the law of large numbers this number will converge (in the limit of high concentrations) to its expected value. Secondly, even though a huge number of reactions will happen in [t, t + t), t is still small, so the total molecule numbers will not change significantly over that period. This means that we can use n (i) A (t) to refer to the value of n (i) A at any point in the interval [t, t + t).

In colloids this is called diffusiophoresis. Diffusiophoresis is typically defined [5][6][7][8]10] as the motion of a larger particle immersed in concentration gradients of smaller molecules, when both are in a solvent (such as water). Although often difficult to measure, there are clearly gradients inside metabolically active cells. So there must be diffusiophoresis occurring in cells, the question is: Does diffusiophoresis make a significant contribution to the transport of some species? Here, I determine that the answer to this question is probably yes for particles at least tens of nanometres or more across, but no for individual protein molecules.\n\nI start with the standard Brownian-dynamics approximation for the position of a particle, r(t) [20].

The physics of this term is that the particle is constantly being bombarded by the surrounding molecules, due to their thermal energy. This tends to move the particle around, but this motion is opposed by the friction between a moving particle and these same molecules.",

Concentration-based approach\n\nWe consider the reaction A + B \u2212\u2192 C. We assume there is one A represented by a reactive sphere diffusing in space. The frame of reference is fixed at the center of A, and B molecules diffuse freely with a diffusion coefficient given by D = D A + D B . The concentration gradient of B molecules around A is denoted by c(r, t), and it obeys\n\u2202c(r, t) \u2202t = \u2207 \u00b7 D\u2207c(r, t) . (2.1)\nThe concentration in the far-field, r = R, is assumed constant, so c(R, t) = c 0 . The reaction is modeled by a reaction boundary r = \u03c3 given by the sum of the molecules' radii. Whenever a B molecule reaches \u03c3 by diffusion, a reaction occurs immediately. We call this a purely diffusion-controlled reaction since the rate only depends on the time it takes B to diffuse into the reaction boundary. This is modeled with a purely-absorbing boundary condition c(\u03c3, t) = 0, which yields the steady state and the forward reaction rate\nc ss (r) = c 0 R R \u2212 \u03c3 1 \u2212 \u03c3 r , k S (R) = 4\u03c0D\u03c3 R R \u2212 \u03c3 (2.\n2) since k S (R) = 4\u03c0D\u03c3 2 c ss (\u03c3)/c 0 . As R \u2192 \u221e, this simply becomes c ss \u221e (r) = c 0 [1 \u2212 \u03c3/r] and k S = 4\u03c0D\u03c3, which is Smoluchowski's original result [2]. A more general approach uses a partially-absorbing boundary condition [1,22], 4\u03c0\u03c3 2 D\u2202c(r, t)/\u2202r r=\u03c3 = \u03bac(\u03c3, t), where \u03ba controls the degree of diffusion-influence in the reaction rate.

In the seminal papers [8,9], Kuramoto has shown that whether the total system size is larger than this length or not provides a condition to guarantee the use of the reactiondiffusion equation. When the system size (length) is smaller than \u2113 K , local fluctuations rapidly spread over the system. Contrastingly, if the system size is much larger than \u2113 K , distant regions fluctuate independently, and the system is described by local reaction process and diffusion, validating the use of reaction-diffusion equation.\n\nFor example, consider the reaction\nA k \u2212\u2192 X, 2X k \u2032 \u2212\u2192 B.\nIf the concentration of chemical A is set to be constant, the chemical X is produced at the constant rate k, while it decays with the reaction 2X \u2192 B at the rate k \u2032 . The average concentration of X at the steady state is X = kA/2k \u2032 , where A is the concentration of the chemical A.

We consider the case of the quasi-Fokker-Planck approximation, when the probability transition function for diffusion (PTD function) does not possess a long tail in coordinate space and can be expanded as a function of instantaneous displacements. The more complicated case of long tails in the PTD will be discussed separately. We also discuss diffusion on the basis of hydrodynamic and kinetic equations and show the validity of the phenomenological approach. A type of \"collision\" integral is introduced for the description of diffusion in a system of particles, which can transfer from a moving state to the rest state (with some waiting time distribution). The solution of the appropriate kinetic equation in the external field also confirms the phenomenological approach of the generalized master equation.",

The RDME is often interpreted as an approximation to spatially continuous models in which molecules move by Brownian motion and react by one of several mechanisms when sufficiently close. In the limit that the lattice spacing approaches zero, in two or more dimensions, the RDME has been shown to lose bimolecular reactions. The RDME is therefore not a convergent approximation to any spatially continuous model that incorporates bimolecular reactions. In this work we derive a new convergent RDME (CRDME) by finite volume discretization of a spatially continuous stochastic reaction-diffusion model popularized by Doi. We demonstrate the numerical convergence of reaction time statistics associated with the CRDME. For sufficiently large lattice spacings or slow bimolecular reaction rates, we also show that the reaction time statistics of the CRDME may be approximated by those from the RDME. The original RDME may therefore be interpreted as an approximation to the CRDME in several asymptotic limits. ",

Negative R in the vapor phase is characteristic of all the fluids I looked at except Water and Methanol.

In the vapor phase, R is uniformly negative, but in the liquid phase R changes sign and become positive below T = 3.80K. R for Argon, shown in Fig. 7c, has the commensurate R theorem not as conspicuously satisfied as it was for Hydrogen and Helium. Whether this reflects the real behavior, or shortcomings in the fitting formula in this regime is not clear. For Argon, both the liquid and the vapor R's are uniformly negative along the entire coexistence curve. The basic pattern for Argon is repeated for Krypton, Xenon, Methane (see Fig. 7d), Nitrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Hydrogen Sulfide.

Argon has a molar mass MM of 39.9 g/mole, a critical pressure P c of 4.863 MPa, a critical temperature T c of 150.687 K, a critical density of 535 kg/m 2 , and a critical specific volume V c of 1.8692 cm 3 /g.\n\nThe model will take the dimensionless reduced temperature T R and reduced specific volume V R as inputs. The temperature is easily calculated as T = T R \u00b7T c , and the volume (for one mole) is calculated as V = V R \u00b7V c \u00b7M M .

The model also gives the option of simulating a profile of faster and slower speeds; the speed profile will maintain the same RMS average speed defined in equation 20, and the average speed v avg (m/s) will be determined as\nv avg = v RMS \u00b7 8 3\u00b7\u03c0 .(24)\nIf the model calls for N Y velocity increments to be simulated, a subroutine in the Fortran code will generate a N Y \u00b71 vector-array, ranging from 0.2 to 1.8, averaging 1.0, with a standard deviation of 0.71. This vector-array will be multiplied by the average molecule velocity at the boundary v avg ; the RMS of the velocity vector-array will be equal to v RMS determined with 20.",

As expected, it is clear looking at Table 24 and 25 that while the entropy of the fluid increases, the entropy of the surrounding universe is decreasing (and vice versa); it is observed, however, that the magnitude in the change in entropy is consistently different despite the fact that identical heat transfer occurs at identical temperatures. The net change in entropy at the conclusion of this cycle ( \u03b4s 1 + \u03b4s 0 ) = \u03b4s 1 is -1.6104 J/K, suggesting a net reduction of entropy to the universe for each revolution of one mole of high-pressure argon throughout this cycle, due to the intermolecular attractive Van der Waal force [16], in violation of Clausius' Theorem [1] described in equation 3. In addition, the net entropy of the high-pressure argon working fluid \u03b4s 0 is 0 J/K as this cycle is internally reversible.\n\nOne observation is that the total entropy of the real-fluid argon, when utilizing the empirical equation 47 and the numerically obtained standard deviations for the molecule position and velocity, is consistently greater than for a mole of ideal gas argon of comparable temperature (equation 22). The intermolecular attractive forces add to the RMS velocities (typically 10% increase), and require the molecules to travel (on average) a longer spatial distance to move throughout the spherical container. In an ideal gas, the increase in entropy (equation 4) for a given quantity of heat energy input is reduced for higher entropy fluids (i.e. hotter temperatures). The same holds true for fluids of identical temperatures, but differences in entropy; the entropy of the real fluid is higher, but the increase in entropy for a given heat input is less than the decrease in entropy (defined equation 22) of the ideal-gas surrounding universe.

To achieve steady-state voltammograms, we obeyed the relation v \u226a (RTD)/(nFr 2 ) with v as the sweep rate; r as the electrode radius; D as the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species; and R, T, n, and F have their usual meanings [10]. The \"\u226a\" sign was stretched to the factor 500 assuming diffusion coefficients of the electroactive species in the ballpark of 10 \u221211 m 2 s \u22121 due to the rather high viscosity of HMIM Br of 3.99 Pa s [15]. The simulation is a somewhat intricate task, because surface reactions or changes of surface states, resp., cannot be taken into account with DigiElch \u00ae in the frame of semiinfinite two-dimensional diffusion simulation, which is mandatory for simulations of UME behaviour. Thus, the simulated CV shows the normal voltage-current characteristic of a simple one-electron transfer without adsorption or other phenomena (dashed red curve in Fig. 4a). Therefore, forward and reverse sweeps are almost congruent with the given experimental parameters. In the experiment, we observe a nonnormal voltage-current curve. Particularly, the reverse sweep deviates significantly from the forward sweep. On closer inspection, the steady-state current arrives at less negative electrode potential and is lower than in the simulation. These observations indicate the deceleration of electrode kinetics reported earlier [16]. Since we intentionally did not activate the electrode-platinum assembled as reference electrode operates without current load at any time-we observe this deceleration during the experiment. Thus, the relevant electrode kinetics has to be determined at early stages of the experiment. In the beginning of the experiment, the deceleration is not recognizable, and the fit of the major share of the forward sweep is straightforward with the following parameters: A second simulation of this CV reflecting the experimental reverse sweep was also performed with the same parameters excepting k 0 = 1.1 10 \u22127 cm s \u22121 (dashed blue curve in Fig. 4b).",

Like under 10 \u00c04 mbar O 2 pressure, exposure to the higher pressure results in the appearance of a feature at 528.3 eV in the O 1s spectrum.However, under the higher pressure conditions, the oxygen coverage increases to approximately 0.67 ML, as determined by the O/Ag ratio, coincident with the c(6 \u00c2 2) added-strand reconstruction.Inspection of Fig. 8 reveals that at 423 K the c(6 \u00c2 2) phase does not become stable until the O 2 pressure exceeds 10 \u00c02.5 bar.Thus, the correct phase is only predicted if a pressure correction of at least 10 2.5 bar is included, thereby establishing a minimum value for the pressure correction at 423 K.We can also identify a maximum error in pressure by noting that at 423 K under 10 \u00c04 mbar O 2 pressure the p(2 \u00c2 1) phase was dominant, implying a maximum error of 10 4 bar, in good agreement with the originally proposed 10 3 bar error at 423 K.",

The range of \u2206\u00b5 O (defined as \u00b5 O \u2212 1 2 E total O2 ) between the vertical dashed lines corresponds to the heat of formation of Ag 2 O, i.e., to the range in which bulk silver oxide is stable. It can be seen that for more O-rich conditions (right) the thicker oxide-like structures are favored over chemisorption on the surface. Clearly, in the limit of an infinitely thick film, the corresponding line would be very close to the vertical one at \u2206\u00b5 O = \u22120.323 eV. It can be obtained from Fig. 2 that bulk silver oxide is stable to only around 350 K at atmospheric pressure, which is less than the experimental value of 460 K. At 460 K, the bulk oxide is unstable when the pressure is lower than 10 3 atm. i.e. compared to 1 atm. as observed experimentally. This difference may be due to systematic errors of the DFT approach 25 and/or to neglect of the entropy contributions. Therefore in Fig. 2 (and Fig. 3), we generally expect that the temperature is underestimated, but the error is less than 110 K, while correspondingly, the pressure is overestimated. For the temperature values quoted below, we give an estimate of the upper limit in brackets, that is, 110 K higher than that obtained from Fig. 2. In spite of these uncertainties, we believe that the relative stability of the various systems and our general understanding and conclusions will not be affected.",

Here, we use electronic structure density functional theory calculations to show that the surface vacancy formation energy of silver changes markedly in the presence of adsorbed and dissolved oxygen. We found that adsorbed atomic oxygen can reduce the surface vacancy formation energy of the Ag(111) surface by more than 30%, whereas surface vacancy formation becomes exothermic in the presence of pure subsurface oxygen. We went on to show that the total directionality of the topologically defined bond paths can be used to understand these changes. The resulting structure-property relationship was used to predict the behavior of silver in different atmospheres. We show that the surface vacancy formation energy decreases when electronegative elements are adsorbed on the surface, but that it can increase when electropositive elements are adsorbed. ",

They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy.

Solvated electrons at low metal concentrations.\nUsing a theory of polarizable fluids, we extend a variational treatment of an excess electron to the many-electron case corresponding to finite metal concentrations in metal-ammonia solutions (MAS). We evaluate dielectric, optical, and thermodynamical properties of MAS at low metal concentrations. Our semianalytical calculations based on a mean-spherical approximation correlate well with the experimental data on the concentration and temperature dependencies of the dielectric constant and the optical absorption spectrum. The properties are found to be mainly determined by the induced dipolar interactions between localized solvated electrons, which result in the two main effects: the dispersion attractions between the electrons and a sharp increase in the static dielectric constant of the solution. The first effect creates a classical phase separation for the light alkali metal solutes (Li, Na, K) below a critical temperature. The second effect leads to a dielectric instability, i.e., polarization catastrophe, which is the onset of metallization. The locus of the calculated critical concentrations is in a good agreement with the experimental phase diagram of Na-NH(3) solutions. The proposed mechanism of the metal-nonmetal transition is quite general and may occur in systems involving self-trapped quantum quasiparticles.",

In 1808, he noted their interaction with ammonia, which, 100 years later, was attributed to solvated electrons. After 1960, pulse radiolysis of nearly any solvent produced solvated electrons, which became one of the most studied species in chemistry. In 1968, alkali metal solutions in amines and ethers were shown to contain alkali metal anions in addition to solvated electrons. The advent of crown ethers and cryptands as complexants for alkali cations greatly enhanced alkali metal solubilities. This permitted us to prepare a crystalline salt of Na(-) in 1974, followed by 30 other alkalides with Na(-), K(-), Rb(-) and Cs(-) anions. This firmly established the -1 oxidation state of alkali metals. The synthesis of alkalides led to the crystallization of electrides, with trapped electrons as the anions. Electrides have a variety of electronic and magnetic properties, depending on the geometries and connectivities of the trapping sites. In 2009, the final surprise was the experimental demonstration that alkali metals under high pressure lose their metallic character as the electrons are localized in voids between the alkali cations to become high-pressure electrides!

Alkali and alkaline earth atoms serve as electron donors in solvents that mediate outer-sphere electron transfer. We report herein ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of lithium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium in liquid ammonia at 250 K. By analyzing the electronic properties and the ionic and solvation structures and dynamics, we systematically characterize these metals as electron donors and ammonia molecules as electron acceptors. We show that the solvated metal strongly modifies the properties of its solvation shells and that the observed effect is metal-specific. Specifically, the radius and charge exhibit major impacts. The single solvated electron present in the alkali metal systems is distributed more uniformly among the solvent molecules of each metal's two solvation shells. In contrast, alkaline earth metals favor a less uniform distribution of the electron density. Alkali and alkaline earth atoms are coordinated by four and six NH3 molecules, respectively. The smaller atoms, Li and Mg, are stronger electron donors than Na and Ca. This result is surprising, as smaller atoms in a column of the periodic table have higher ionization potentials. However, it can be explained by stronger electron donor-acceptor interactions between the smaller atoms and the solvent molecules. The structure of the first solvation shell is sharpest for Mg, which has a large charge and a small radius. Solvation is weakest for Na, which has a small charge and a large radius. Weak solvation leads to rapid dynamics, as reflected in the diffusion coefficients of NH3 molecules of the first two solvation shells and the Na atom. The properties of the solvated electrons established in the present study are important for radiation chemistry, synthetic chemistry, condensed-matter charge transfer, and energy sources. ",

The principle is the same as that of other electron diffraction methods such as LEED and RHEED, but the obtainable diffraction pattern is considerably weaker than those of LEED and RHEED because the density of the target is about one thousand times smaller. Since the orientation of the target molecules relative to the electron beams is random, the internuclear distance information obtained is one-dimensional. Thus only relatively simple molecules can be completely structurally characterized by electron diffraction in the gas phase.

Distribution of hydrogen bonds\n\nThe analysis of the hydrogen bond \u0351HB\u0352 distribution among ammonia molecules is based on a calculation of the fractions P n of ammonia molecules that engage in n hydrogen bonds and the average number of hydrogen bonds that an ammonia molecule donates and accepts. 29 Following previous work on liquid ammonia, water and other hydrogen bonding liquids, 59,71,72,[122][123][124][125][126][127][128] we have adopted a geometric definition of the hydrogen bonds where two ammonia molecules are assumed to be hydrogen bonded if they satisfy the following configurational criteria with respect to N-N and N-H distances:\nR (NN) \u03fdR c (NN) , \u03518\u0352 R (NH) \u03fdR c (NH) ,\nand the values of these distance cut-offs are usually determined from the positions of the first minimum of the corresponding \u0351intermolecular\u0352 RDFs. We have used a similar procedure where the N-N RDF gives a value of R c NN \u03ed5.25 \u03515.1\u0352 \u00c5 for the N-N cut-off for HCTH407\u03e9\u0351BLYP\u0352 functionals. However, the procedure cannot be applied unambiguously to determine the N-H cut-off because no clear minimum that separates the hydrogen bonded and nonbonded H atoms is found in the N-H RDF. In the latter case, the shoulder which is assigned to hydrogen bonded H atoms merges into the broad and more intense peak corresponding to the H atoms of the first solvation shell which are not hydrogen bonded. Since this shoulder-which corresponds to the hydrogen bonded H atoms-extends up to about 2.7 \u00c5 in the experimental and BLYP RDFs we have taken this distance of 2.7 \u00c5 as the cutoff N-H distance. For HCTH/407 \u03e9 also, we have used the same cut-off of the N-H distance although the hydrogen bonded shoulder is less pronounced for this functional. Still, variation of R c NH within reasonable bounds does not change qualitatively the result of this analysis.",

This speci\ue103c change in local interactions is clearly dominated by the electrostatics and thus the potential energy of the underlying complexes in solution. To obtain inexpensive estimates of DDG we therefore use the change in potential energy (averaged over time at 300 K) of NH 2 \u00c0 solvation in pure ammonia compared to association to the metal cluster.\n\n\nSimulation details\n\nThe changes in solvation energy were assessed from molecular dynamics simulations based on molecular mechanics models. The force-\ue103elds for NH 4 + , NH 3 and NH 2 \u00c0 are adopted from our earlier work reported in ref. 8. For the mono-and di-valent metal ions we employed the Lennard-Jones model from Merz and coworkers. 9,10 The Al 3+ model could also be adopted from this group, 11 while for Ga 3+ the force-\ue103eld of Gale and coworkers was used. 12 This approach ensures formal charges for all ions, thus allowing to model complex formation/dissociation without the need of quantum mechanical calculations. The accuracy of the employed force-\ue103elds may be judged on the basis of the coordination numbers as observed from the experiment. While experimental data is still rather sparse, the coordination of alkali metal ions and of gallium ions as discussed in the results section provides a basis for such comparison.",

From these complexes the following metal-containing dications have been generated: [Mg(NH3)n](2+), [Ca(NH3)n](2+), and [Sr(NH3)n](2+), and for n in the range 4-20, kinetic energy release measurements following the evaporation of a single molecule have been undertaken using a high resolution mass spectrometer. Using finite heat bath theory, these data have been transformed into binding energies for individual ammonia molecules attached to each of the three cluster systems. In the larger complexes (n &gt; 6) the results exhibit a consistent trend, whereby the experimental binding energy data for all three metal ions are very similar, suggesting that the magnitude of the charge rather than charge density influences the strength of the interaction. From a comparison with data recorded previously for (NH3)nH(+) it is found that the 2+ charge on a metal ion has an effect on the binding energy of molecules in complexes containing up to 20 solvent molecules. Although subject to comparatively large experimental errors, the results recorded for Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) when n \u2264 6 show evidence for the formation of an inner solvation shell containing up to 6 molecules. However, Mg(2+) exhibits relatively low binding energies when n = 5 and 6, which suggests that a second shell starts to form before there are 6 ammonia molecules bound to the metal ion. This conclusion is supported by DFT calculations and it is proposed that these complexes could take the form [Mg(NH3)4(NH3)](2+) when n = 5 and either [Mg(NH3)4(NH3)2](2+) or [Mg(NH3)5(NH3)](2+) when n = 6. In each case, additional molecules are hydrogen bonded to one or more molecules in the inner solvation shell. ",

Complexes have been generated using a combination of the pick-up technique and electron impact ionization, and individual ions were monitored for evidence of metastability in the form of Coulomb fission or charge separation: [M(XH)n](2+) \u2192 [M(+)X](XH)n-m + H2X(+)(XH)m-2. Values have been assigned to a quantity ns, which is identified as the minimum number of molecules required to suppress the above reaction. These values were found to range from 3 for Sr(2+) complexed with methanol to 19 for Sn(2+) complexed with ammonia. Comparisons are made with results published previously for the same metal dications complexed with water (Chen, X.; Stace, A. J. Chem. Commun.2012, 10292), and for the most part, it is found that ions solvated with either ammonia or methanol are less stable than their water counterparts. To account for differences in stability, several criteria have been examined, and of those, the most satisfactory correlation is between ns and M(2+)-XH bond strength; the stronger the bond, the larger ns has to be in order for a complex to be stable. However, for complexes where ns is large, such as those involving Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and especially Sn(2+) and Pb(2+), it is proposed that the geometry adopted by solvent molecules also has a significant influence on proton transfer. By comparing the ease with which proton transfer occurs for the three protic solvents, water, ammonia, and methanol, it is possible to comment on metal ion acidity in nonaqueous solutions, for which condensed phase data are nonexistent; the results suggest that most of the nine metals would be stronger Lewis acids in ammonia than in water.

Typically, the hydrogen bond angle is too small by a factor of 2 and the energy of the cyclic C 2h structure with respect to the eclipsed C s global minimum is overestimated by a factor of 10 to 30. Since ammonia is an important hydrogen bonded liquid, a density functional was developed for studying this subtle system, with particular focus on its applicability for condensed phase simulations in the framework of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics. To this end, a novel GGA-type density functional, HCTH/407\u03e9, was developed, with special emphasis on the nonlinear hydrogen bond and potential energy surface of (NH 3 ) 2 . This functional yields the bent hydrogen-bonded equilibrium structure of the ammonia dimer, as well as the correct energetics of the low-lying isomers including the energy barrier to a linear hydrogen bond.",

Minimum energy structures have been obtained employing genetic algorithm-based optimization methods in conjunction with accurate pair potentials for NH3-NH3 and H2-NH3. These include both a full 5D potential and a spherically averaged reduced surface mimicking the presence of a para-H2. All the putative global minima for n \u2265 7 are characterized by H2 being adsorbed onto a rhomboidal ammonia tetramer motif formed by two double donor and two double acceptor ammonia molecules. In a few cases, the choice of specific rhombus seems to be directed by the vicinity of an ammonia ad-molecule. Diffusion Monte Carlo simulations on a subset of the species obtained highlighted important quantum effects in defining the H2 surface distribution, often resulting in populating rhomboidal sites different from the global minimum one, and showing a compelling correlation between local geometrical features and the relative stability of surface H2. Clathrate-like species have also been studied and suggested to be metastable over a broad range of conditions if formed. ",

Our results indicate for the first time that, at higher partial pressures, a product distinct from the well-known (CH3)3M:NH3 adduct grows in for both M = Al and M = Ga. Comparison of the experimental and calculated IR spectra, along with calculations of the energetics, indicates that this second product is the result of hydrogen bonding of a second NH3 molecule to the (CH3)3M:NH3 adduct and can be written as (CH3)3M:NH3...NH3. The binding energy of this hydrogen-bonded adduct is calculated to be 26.8 kcal/mol for M = Al and 18.4 kcal/mol for M = Ga and is lower in energy (more stable) relative to the 1:1 (CH3)3M:NH3 adduct by 7.2 kcal/mol for M = Al and 6.6 kcal/mol for M = Ga. In contrast, an alternative complex involving the formation of two separate M-N donor-acceptor bonds, which is written as H3N:(CH3)3M:NH3, is calculated to be lower in energy relative to (CH3)3M:NH3 by only 0.1 kcal/mol for M = Al and 0.2 kcal/mol for M = Ga and is not observed experimentally. These results show that hydrogen bonding plays an important role in the interaction of ammonia with metal organic precursors involving Al, Ga, and In, under typical metal organic chemical vapor deposition AlGaInN growth conditions.",

Within a recently developed quantum/ molecular mechanics approach this is calculated from the quantum chemical assessment of the difference in proton affinity of the molecules in the gas phase and the change in solvation free energy as estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. 8 When moving from auto-protolysis in the bulk liquid to the deprotonation of ammonia molecules within metal ion complexes, we can estimate free energy differences analogously. Thus, the pK of the bulk liquid changes to a 'local pK' according to Scheme 1.\n\nWhere M refers to a metal ion and q to the charge of [M(NH 2 ) x (NH 3 ) y ] q complexes. Note that K and pK refer to the overall reaction involving two NH 3 molecules (one donor and one acceptor) and are thus dimensionless. Upon deprotonation of [M(NH 2 ) x (NH 3 ) y ] q complexes, the NH 4 + ion is always migrated to the solution. The resulting [M(NH 2 ) x+1 (NH 3 ) y+z\u00c02 ] q complex may change its overall coordination number by associating (z > 0) or dissociating (z < 0) ammonia molecules to/from its coordination polyhedron. This depends on the speci\ue103c metal ion as discussed in the results section. Both sides of Scheme 1 refer to idealized systems, that is pure ammonia (le\ue09d side of Scheme 1) and a single metal ion M in pure ammonia (right side of Scheme 1), respectively. Note that activity coefficients used for interpreting experimental data of real solutions re\ue104ect the need to combine ammonia autoprotolyses in bulk NH 3 and next to solvated ions. Using ideal solution models, our simulations however can address the respective equilibrium constants separately.",

The latter is necessary since we can only fit to single points. As a result of the small energy differences, the frozen-geometry singlepoint energies and optimized energies differ by a significant amount. The development procedure is similar to the one employed for the HCTH/407 functional, and the set includes numerous atomization energies, proton affinities, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and dissociation energies of hydrogen-bonded dimers and transition metal complexes. 82 First, we fit to a subset of the 407 molecules in order to get close to the global minimum, then we fit to the full set. The latter subset \u0351small set\u0352 is the G2-1 set plus two hydrogenbonded systems (H 2 O) 2 and (HF) 2 , and the additional structures on the potential energy surface, making 153 systems in all \u0351the 147 of the HCTH/147 functional plus the five PES points, in addition to the NH 3 dissociation energy at the TZ2P basis\u0352. For each point on the PES, the counterpoise correction was employed. The results using the newly determined functionals as a function of the weights have been determined in both the first fit \u0351to 153 systems\u0352 and the second fit \u0351to 413 systems\u0352. Thus, we obtained new functionals with weights ranging from 0/0 \u0351which corresponds to the HCTH/407 functional\u0352 to 200/200. The first weight is the one used in the subset, while the second corresponds to the large fit. The importance of the weights in the first fit can be seen from the differences by using weight pairs of 30/80 and 80/ 80-they differ by about a factor of 2 in the energy difference between the staggered and eclipsed geometry. Hence, the minimum obtained by the second fit will of necessity be close to the global minimum obtained by the first one. When increasing these weights, we approach the reference values as expected, with the 200/200 functional rendering the closest values",

The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) shows a linear relation between the dissociation energy of noble gas-copper bonds and the amount of electronic charge transferred mainly from the noble gas to copper during complexation. Large changes in the QTAIM quadrupole moments of copper and noble gases resulting from this bonding and a comparison between NgCuX and NgNaCl systems indicate that these noble gas-copper bonds should be better interpreted as predominantly covalent. Finally, QTAIM atomic dipoles of noble gases in NgNaCl systems agree satisfactorily with atomic dipoles given by a simple model for these NgNa van der Waals bonds.",

To quantify this point, the equilibrium rotational constants of some diatomics have been considered (see Table 1). Having only one geometrical parameter, they allow for a direct correlation between the bond distance and the unique rotational constant. A couple of small polyatomic molecules (water and formaldehyde) have been selected to emphasize how the situation is considerably more complicated when there is more than one geometrical parameter ( Table 2). Table 1 collects data for seven diatomic molecules, three of them also containing third-row atoms (SiS, PN and HCl) and two of them being radical species (CN and OH). In this table, for each molecule, the equilibrium distance and the corresponding equilibrium constant are reported together with the rotational constants resulting from increasing the bond distance by 0.0001 \u00c5, 0.001 \u00c5, and 0.002 \u00c5. For the latter constants, the absolute and relative deviations from the equilibrium one are provided. Although being of limited importance to the present discussion, we note that bond distances were optimized at the CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ level, [54][55][56] with all electrons correlated (this level of theory has been chosen because of its accuracy 57 ). Inspection of the results of Table 1 confirms the fractional change pointed out in eqn (4) and, thus, an accuracy of 0.001 \u00c5 on the bond distance leads to a deviation of 0.1% on the rotational constant for bond lengths of about 2 \u00c5 such as that of SiS and of 0.2% for distances of about 1 \u00c5. This table makes also clear that for light molecules deviations of about 0.1% in the rotational constant mean, in absolute terms, deviations of hundreds or even thousands of MHz.",

Molecular Orbital Theory\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called $\\sigma$ MOs. They can be formed from $s$ orbitals or from $p$ orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from $p$ orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called $\\pi$ orbitals.\n\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund's rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic properties of molecules is in advantage of molecular orbital theory over Lewis structures and valence bond theory.",

Such a hole is often described as a pinhole and the escape of the gas is due to the pressure difference between the container and the exterior. Under these conditions, essentially all molecules which arrive at the hole continue and pass through the hole, since collisions between molecules in the region of the hole are negligible. Conversely, when the diameter is larger than the mean free path of the gas, flow obeys the Sampson flow law. In medical terminology, an effusion refers to accumulation of fluid in an anatomic space, usually without loculation. Specific examples include subdural, mastoid, pericardial and pleural effusions.

Volume and Pressure: Boyle's Law - \nIf we partially fill an airtight syringe with air, the syringe contains a specific amount of air at constant temperature, say $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. If we slowly push in the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure, and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and vice versa. Volume-pressure data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed in Figure 8.13.\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 8.13 When a gas occupies a smaller volume, it exerts a higher pressure; when it occupies a larger volume, it exerts a lower pressure (assuming the amount of gas and the temperature do not change).

At the surface a corresponding harmonic temperature oscillation, Re(\u03b4T e i\u03c9t ), with complex amplitude \u03b4T , is created. The current and temperature can be thought of as stimuli and response (but which is which can be interchanged at will), and the two are linearly related if the amplitudes, |P | and |\u03b4T |, are small enough. Hence it is convenient to introduce the complex frequency-dependent thermal impedance of the liquid\nZ liq = \u03b4T P ,(5)\nthis impedance depends on the properties of the liquid.\n\nThe terminology thermal impedance derives naturally from the close analogy between the flow of thermal heat and the flow of electricity [16].

The air flow and negative pressure of the system will depend on the particular design of each model. This experimental study analyzes the specifications and performance of the pleural drainage systems currently on the market. Thirteen models of pleural drainage systems connected to wall suction were examined. The models were classified into the following three groups: dry systems; wet systems; and single-chamber systems. We determined the ambient air flow and the negative pressure generated according to the suction level. The components of each model are also described. Under normal conditions, dry (except for the Sentinel Seal; Sherwood Medical; Tullamore, Ireland), wet, and single-chamber systems reach similar air flow rates (17 to 30, 24 to 27, and 22 to 28 L/min, respectively). With higher wall suction levels, wet systems increase the air flow (26 to 49 L/min) but the negative pressure becomes unstable because of the water loss phenomenon, dry systems increase the air flow (29 to 50 L/min) without modifying the regulator pressure, and single-chamber systems also raise the air flow (45 to 51 L/min) but increase the negative pressure. When there is an air leak, dry systems (except for the Sentinel Seal) lose less negative pressure than the other systems. The functioning of these systems can be optimized only by applying a suitable wall suction level adjusted to each case. Although the three types of systems are capable of evacuating adequate air flow rates, the negative pressure and the capacity to maintain it in the presence of an air leak are different in each system. Being fitted with valves and not water compartments makes the dry systems the safest and the ideal for use when the patient has to be moved.",

KEML studies were carried out in a large temperature range (398-567) K by using effusion orifices with 0.3, 1, and 3 mm diameters. The vapor pressures so measured revealed no kinetically hindered vaporization effects and provided second-law vaporization enthalpies at the mean experimental temperatures in close agreement with literature. By exploiting the large temperature range covered, the heat capacity change associated with vaporization was estimated, resulting in a value of -66.8 J K(-1) mol(-1), much lower than that predicted from calorimetric measurements on the liquid phase and theoretical calculations on the gas phase. The conversion of the high temperature vaporization enthalpy to 298 K was discussed and the value \u0394(l)(g)H(m)(298 K) = (128.6 \u00b1 1.3) kJ mol(-1) assessed on the basis of data from literature and present work.

KEMS measurements were carried out in the lower temperature range (393-467) K and showed that the largely prevailing ion species is BMIm(+), supporting the common view of BMImNTf2 vaporizing as individual, neutral ion pairs also under equilibrium conditions.

Most effusions will respond to transient therapeutic intervention, including the obliteration of potential space via pleurodesis. Cure, however, is rare, thus making effusions a biologically, biochemically, and clinically important topic of study. The local microenvironment that supports malignant growth, invasion, and dissemination of the solid primary tumor into the vasculature is composed of activated stroma that includes scaffolding consisting of materials that promote the tumor function, and vascular structures to provide conduits for travel and nutrient delivery. Less is understood about the tumor-cell microenvironment in malignant effusions. The fluid nature of such a microenvironment when compared with the solid primary tumor may have significant implications for disease dissemination and progression.

INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the last review that appeared in this journal some 30 years ago (1), the understanding of the funda-mental concepts of the mechanics of the pleural space has undergone a continual evolution.The previous review invoked hydrostatic equilibrium of pleural liquid as the fundamental principle.In the current review, surface forces due to the opposing elastic recoils of lung and chest wall are the primary determinants of the pressure in the intervening pleural liquid.The pleural surface pressure, defined as the force per unit pleural surface area, is equal to the pressure in the pleural liquid.The difference between the vertical gradient in pleural pressure and the hydrostatic value (1 cmH 2 O/cm height) drives a viscous flow within the pleural space.A function of the liquid in the pleural space is to lubricate the pleural surfaces.The uniform thickness of the lubricating layer is maintained by recirculation of pleural liquid driven by gravity and ventilatory and cardiogenic motions.Pleural liquid is a microvascular filtrate that is cleared by pleural lymphatics, a process similar to that in the interstitium of all body organs.\n\nThe review is divided into the following sequence.A brief summary of regional volume and pleural pressure is presented, followed by a description of the different types of pleural pressure measurements.Then pleural liquid thickness is described within the context of pleural lubrication.Circulation of pleural liquid within the pleural space is treated as part of viscous flow theory.The next section describes the formation of pleural liquid as a microvascular filtrate and its absorption via lymphatic stomata.Finally, pleural liquid protein and the factors that determine its concentration and absorption are discussed.\n\n\nA.

(180) and Agostoni et al. (14) proposed that pleural liquid, like the capillary blood, was in hydrostatic equilibrium with a vertical pressure gradient equal to 1 cmH 2 O/cm height.They proposed that hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved by absorption of pleural liquid into the blood until a balance of hydrostatic and osmotic forces between pleural liquid and the blood occurred.The absorptive pressure was calculated to be \u03ea11 cmH 2 O, lower than the surface pressure required to maintain the lung at its end-expiratory volume.The difference between pleural liquid and surface pressures was attributed to points of contact between the two pleural surfaces.This concept of the mechanics of the pleural space has been the focus of several reviews by Agostoni and co-workers (1,2,9,18).\n\nThe second concept (97,98,103) is the one that I emphasize in this review.The surface pressure acting to expand the lung, equal and opposite to the pressure expanding the chest wall, is transmitted hydraulically across the thin pleural liquid space with the surface pressure equal to the pleural liquid pressure.Thus pleural surface pressure is the major determinant of the pleural liquid pressure.The difference between the vertical gradient in pleural surface pressure and the hydrostatic value drives a viscous flow of pleural liquid downward in the pleural space.This conception of the mechanics of the pleural space requires a continuous pleural liquid space with no pleural contact.\n\n\nII.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz. On the basis of present calculations of fine and hyperfine splittings and QED terms, we find r(p) = 0.84184(67) fm, which differs by 5.0 standard deviations from the CODATA value of 0.8768(69) fm. Our result implies that either the Rydberg constant has to be shifted by -110 kHz/c (4.9 standard deviations), or the calculations of the QED effects in atomic hydrogen or muonic hydrogen atoms are insufficient.",

The current experimental upper bound on its decay rate is less than one proton decay per 3 tons of matter per year, which corresponds to a mean lifetime of more than 10(30) years. Even more sensitive searches for proton decay are now in progress. These are partially motivated by the development of a class of models that combine the presently accepted theories of electromagnetic, weak, and strong inter-actions into an elegant unified form. Some of these theories predict a proton lifetime short enough for the decays to be detectable by the proposed experiments. If the proton is unstable, a plausible explanation can be given for the apparent excess of matter over antimatter in the universe.",

In addition to the spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions, intrinsic to any atomic or molecular system, the rotational motion of molecules gives rise to new perturbations, such as \u039b-doubling, which generates closely spaced energy levels with characteristic excitation frequencies < 100 MHz [52].

Physicists and chemists, theoreticians and experimentalists, engineers and philosophers, all would find at least one good reason to be interested in these systems. We shall refer here to \"quantum nanomagnets\" as the broad family of molecules containing a core of magnetic transition-metal ions, which interact by strong superexchange and which possess magnetic anisotropy due to crystal field effects[13]. At sufficiently low temperatures (typically \u223c 10 K), i.e. much lower than the typical intramolecular exchange interaction energy, the whole molecule effectively behaves as a nanometer-sized magnet. The total ground state spin value can be rather large, S \u223c 10, and is often called \"giant spin\". The best studied examples are Mn 12 [22], Fe 8 [50] and Mn 4 [3]. The magnetic core of each molecule is stabilized by organic ligands, and the molecules are typically bound to each other by van der Waals forces to form electrically insulating crystals(Fig. 1). With just a few exceptions[49,16], the magnetic interaction between different molecules is only of dipolar origin, thus orders of magnitude weaker than the intramolecular exchange. Single-ion anisotropies, exchange interactions, point symmetry and crystal structure all contribute in a complicated way to the total magnetic anisotropy of the giant spin. The first great success of molecular magnets consisted in the demonstration of magnetic bistability and hysteresis at the molecular level [35], i.e. not arising from long-range interactions but only from local ones. Molecules possessing this sort of bistability were named \"Single Molecule Magnets\" (SMMs). One could then think",

Buridan and the philosopher Albert of Saxony (c. 1320\u20131390) adopted Abu'l-Barakat's theory that the acceleration of a falling body is a result of its increasing impetus. Influenced by Buridan, Albert developed a law of proportion regarding the relationship between the speed of an object in free fall and the time elapsed. He also theorized that mountains and valleys are caused by erosion\u2014displacing the Earth's centre of gravity. Also in that century, the Merton College developed the mean speed theorem, which was proved by Nicole Oresme (c. 1323\u20131382) and would be influential in later gravitational equations.",

They attributed the motion of objects to an impetus (akin to momentum), which varies according to velocity and mass; Buridan was influenced in this by Ibn Sina's Book of Healing. Buridan and the philosopher Albert of Saxony (c. 1320\u20131390) adopted Abu'l-Barakat's theory that the acceleration of a falling body is a result of its increasing impetus. Influenced by Buridan, Albert developed a law of proportion regarding the relationship between the speed of an object in free fall and the time elapsed. He also theorized that mountains and valleys are caused by erosion\u2014displacing the Earth's centre of gravity. Also in that century, the Merton College developed the mean speed theorem, which was proved by Nicole Oresme (c. 1323\u20131382) and would be influential in later gravitational equations.",

Spectral lines were assigned using data from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database. 35 We mark the location of all lines in the NIST database that are above a certain threshold relative intensity 35 in order to identify observed lines and note which lines are missing from the spectra. For Xe and Kr, a threshold of 500 was used, and for Ar a threshold of 20000 relative intensity was used. The Xe/Ar spectrum (Fig. 7 (a)) shows predominantly Xe I spectral lines and weak Ar I spectral lines. The lines are similar in relative signal to those observed from a xenon arc lamp, indicating that the fluorescence is likely from electron-ion recombination in xenon.

When an electron energy exceeds 8.32 eV, an inelastic collision then transfers most of the electron's kinetic energy to a xenon atom. The electron begins again to acquire energy, producing another excitation, but under proper conditions never acquires energy sufficient to ionize xenon atoms.\n\nThe excited xenon gas atom rapidly forms an excimer. An infrared transition produces a relaxed excimer, for which the characteristic excitation energy is ~7.3 eV, (175 nm) somewhat less than the first excited state of xenon at 8.32 eV.

It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space. Applications",

His earlier work on gaseous discharge and fluorescence, led to further work on the luminosity of the night sky. He was the first to differentiate between two types of light from the night sky, the aurora or \"northern lights\", and the airglow that prevents the sky ever being completely dark anywhere on earth. In 1929 he was the first to measure the intensity of the light from the night sky. This work led to his posthumous nickname \"the Airglow Rayleigh\". The importance of his unpublished data was such that the US Airforce Cambridge Research Laboratories acquired it in 1963, almost by accident, at the same time of many of his father's experimental notebooks.

Decomposition A decomposition reaction is when a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. It is thus the opposite of a synthesis reaction, and can be written as AB -> A + B One example of a decomposition reaction is the electrolysis of water to make oxygen and hydrogen gas: 2H2O -> 2H2 + O2 Single replacement In a single replacement reaction, a single uncombined element replaces another in a compound; in other words, one element trades places with another element in a compound These reactions come in the general form of: A + BC -> AC + B One example of a single displacement reaction is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water to make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas: Mg + 2H2O -> Mg(OH)2 + H2 (^)",

Reactions - \nUnder normal conditions, hydrogen is relatively inactive chemically, but when heated, it enters into many chemical reactions.\n\nTwo thirds of the world's hydrogen production is devoted to the manufacture of ammonia, which is a fertilizer and used in the manufacture of nitric acid. Large quantities of hydrogen are also important in the process of hydrogenation, discussed in the chapter on organic chemistry.\n\nIt is possible to use hydrogen as a nonpolluting fuel. The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is a very exothermic reaction, releasing 286 kJ of energy per mole of water formed. Hydrogen burns without explosion under controlled conditions. The oxygen-hydrogen torch, because of the high heat of combustion of hydrogen, can achieve temperatures up to $2800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The hot flame of this torch is useful in cutting thick sheets of many metals. Liquid hydrogen is also an important rocket fuel (Figure 18.28).\n\n\nFIGURE 18.28 Before the fleet's retirement in 2011, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were used in the three main engines of a space shuttle. Two compartments in the large tank held these liquids until the shuttle was launched. (credit: \"reynermedia\"/Flickr)\n\nAn uncombined hydrogen atom consists of a nucleus and one valence electron in the $1 s$ orbital. The $n=1$ valence shell has a capacity for two electrons, and hydrogen can rightfully occupy two locations in the periodic table. It is possible to consider hydrogen a group 1 element because hydrogen can lose an electron to form the cation, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. It is also possible to consider hydrogen to be a group 17 element because it needs only one electron to fill its valence orbital to form a hydride ion, $\\mathrm{H}^{-}$, or it can share an electron to form a single, covalent bond. In reality, hydrogen is a unique element that almost deserves its own location in the periodic table.",

This result was presented in opposition to caloric theory (1798). Humphry Davy uses electrolysis to isolate elemental potassium, sodium, calcium, strontium, barium, magnesium, and chlorine (1807\u20131810). Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac studies reactions among gases and determines that their volumes combine chemically in simple integer ratios (1809). Robert Brown studies very small particles in water under the microscope and observes Brownian motion which was later named in his honor (1827). Friedrich W\u00f6hler synthesizes the organic compound urea using inorganic reactants, disproving the application of vitalism to chemical processes (1828).

Many investigations have been made of the catalytic reaction which occurs in contact with various surfaces, and of the phenomena accompanying the production of flame or explosion in the gas. Little is known about the conditions governing the rate of the actual chemical change in the gas phase, because although flames and explosions depend very much upon these they are determined by a great many other factors as well.\n\nIn 1899 Bodenstein,* following up some work initiated by Victor Meyer, made a long series of experiments by streaming mixtures of the two gases through porcelain vessels, heated to a constant temperature, and then analysing the products. He came to the conclusion that the reaction is of the third order, following the equation d [H20 ][dt = h [H2]2 combination was very different in different vessels, he inferred that the reaction was taking place almost entirely on the surface of the vessel.\n\nBone and Wheeler,f by circulating the gases at lower temperatures for long periods, measured the rate of slow surface combination in contact with various materials, including porcelain, and found that under these conditions the reaction was of the first order.\n\nComparing these results with those of Bodenstein, the natural conclusion would be that at the lowT er temperatures the porcelain surface is relatively thickly covered with adsorbed molecules, so that pressure has a comparatively small effect on the reaction, thus giving an apparent order of unity. With increasing temperature the adsorption diminishes and ultimately becomes small enough for the chance that two molecules of hydrogen and one of oxygen should find themselves in juxtaposition on the surface to be proportional to the concentration product [H2]2 [0 2] in the gas phase.",

Based on Gay-Lussac's results, Amedeo Avogadro hypothesized that, at the same temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gas contain equal numbers of molecules (Avogadro's law). This hypothesis meant that the previously stated result 2 volumes of hydrogen + 1 volume of oxygen = 2 volume of gaseous water could also be expressed as 2 molecules of hydrogen + 1 molecule of oxygen = 2 molecule of water. It can also be expressed in another way of example, 100 mL of hydrogen combine with 50 mL of oxygen to give 100 mL of water vapour. Hydrogen(100 mL) + Oxygen(50 mL) = Water(100 mL) Thus, the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen which combine (i.e., 100mL and 50mL) bear a simple ratio of 2:1.",

The vibrational partition function is only well-defined in model systems where the vibrational motion is relatively uncoupled with the system's other degrees of freedom. Definition For a system (such as a molecule or solid) with uncoupled vibrational modes the vibrational partition function is defined by where is the absolute temperature of the system, is the Boltzmann constant, and is the energy of j'th mode when it has vibrational quantum number . For an isolated molecule of n atoms, the number of vibrational modes (i.e. values of j) is 3n \u2212 5 for linear molecules and 3n \u2212 6 for non-linear ones.

Methods for constructing the appropriate quantum mechanical Hamilton operator are briefly described before reviewing a particular branch of theoretical methods for solving the nuclear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The main focus is on wave function methods using the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) as starting point, and includes vibrational configuration interaction (VCI), vibrational M\u00f8ller-Plesset (VMP) theory, and vibrational coupled cluster (VCC) theory. The convergence of the different methods towards the full vibrational configuration interaction (FVCI) result is discussed.

Inspired by its origin in electronic structure theory, VHCI is a selected CI approach that uses a simple criterion to identify important basis states with a pre-sorted list of anharmonic force constants. Screened second-order perturbation theory and simple extrapolation techniques provide significant improvements to variational energy estimates. We benchmark VHCI on four molecules with 12-48 degrees of freedom and use anharmonic potential energy surfaces truncated at fourth and sixth orders. When compared to other methods using the same truncated potentials, VHCI produces vibrational spectra of tens or hundreds of states with sub-wavenumber accuracy at low computational cost.",

Of these bands, on the basis of the presence or absence of certain low J lines, two are clearly (\u2126 \u2032 = 3/2) \u2190 (\u2126 \u2032\u2032 = 3/2), and two are clearly (\u2126 \u2032 = 1/2) \u2190 (\u2126 \u2032\u2032 = 3/2) with considerable \u2126-doubling. Based on values of the rotational constants, band origin \u03bd, and isotope shifts, we are able to assign these four bands and the remaining four less well-resolved bands to a common lower electronic state, with rotational constants in good agreement with the X1.5 state identified in Ref. 7. The upper state of these bands we assign to one of two newly identified electronic states: a state with \u2126 \u2032 = 3/2 at 14223 cm \u22121 , which we label [14.2]1.5, and a state with \u2126 \u2032 = 1/2 at 13833 cm \u22121 , which we label [13.8]\n0.5.\nOn each of the bands acquired at high resolution we perform a non-linear least squares fit to a vibrational band contour. The doubling for all \u2126 = 3/2 levels is unresolved. For the lower states of all eight bands and for the upper states of the bands at 13496, 13554, 14159, and 14223 cm \u22121 we fit using the following Hamiltonian:\nF (J) = T + BJ(J + 1).(1)\nThe bands at 13760, 13833, 14352, and 14429 cm \u22121 we fit to an upper state using the Hamiltonian [11], with selection rules for the P, Q, and R branches:",

In the past, this equation has been used to determine vibrational polarizabilities from experimental IR data and from calculations. 10 We include our derivation here because it appears to be rather simple in comparison to previous derivations that appear in the literature. Eq. (20) follows immediately from Eq. (17.29) of Born and Huang. 11 It has also been derived by Flytzanis. 12 Probably the earliest modern discussion of vibrational polarizabilities using quantum-mechanical derivations can be found in Ref. 7,8 where applications to CHCl 3 and CHF 3 are discussed and the above formula is derived within a sum over states method within the clamped nucleus approximation. Eq. (1) and A5 of Ref. 7b lead to our Eq. (20). However, as noted in Refs 7 and 8, one of the earliest discussions dates back to 1924. 9 In addition to the interaction discussed above, there are other smaller vibrational effects that modify the polarizability of a molecule. The presence of the field modifies the spring constant matrix which changes the zeropoint energy of the molecule. Also, the occurrence of anharmonicity, both diagonal and off-diagonal, leads to further corrections. We are unaware of discussions on the role of off-diagonal anharmonicity, but discussion of the zero-point effect and diagonal anharmonicity may be found in Ref. 13. In the notation of the work of Marti and Bishop, the above term is equivalent to [\u00b5 2 ] 0,0 in their paper.",

[15] Among the different techniques in vibrational spectroscopy, infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy are the most common ones used experimentally. The spectra may in general easily be analyzed for structurally simple, small molecules but become increasingly crowded and complicated for larger compounds. Here, calculations are of great help for in-depth interpretation of spectra.",

Willard Gibbs's work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive science.

He discovered the concept of chemical potential, or the \"fuel\" that makes chemical reactions work. In 1876 he published his most famous contribution, \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\", a compilation of his work on thermodynamics and physical chemistry which laid out the concept of free energy to explain the physical basis of chemical equilibria. In these essays were the beginnings of Gibbs\u2019 theories of phases of matter: he considered each state of matter a phase, and each substance a component.

Answer: - \n$\\Delta H=-338 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \\mathrm{bar}=0.987 \\mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted \" o \" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\\left(\\Delta H^{\\circ}\\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)\n\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\\Delta H$, often \"normalized\" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

The only methods then available were fractional recrystallization and distillation, and column chromatography on silica gel, alumina, or partially activated charcoal. Few purified solvents or chemical reagents were available commercially; indeed, as subsequent work showed, most commercially available chemicals were very crude mixtures. Benzene was purified by shaking with sulfuric acid to remove thiophene, then fractionally distilled and fractionally crystallized but was still far from pure as judged from melting-point studies and from later studies with 14C-benzene when that was finally prepared. Other chemicals, especially the potential \"metabolites of benzene, namely, phenol, catechol, quinol (hydroquinone), and hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene), were rigorously purified before use by preparation of derivatives, recrystallization to constant melting points, then hydrolyzed to regenerate the original compounds, which were further recrystallized to purity. In many cases the physical constants of the highly purified metabolites and their derivatives were significantly different from those previously recorded in the literature; this was particularly true where 14C-labeled compounds had been synthesized and where constant specific radioactivity was the accepted criterion of purity. This gave rise to the view, often expressed by British and American chemists at that time, that the physical constants of aromatic compounds characterized before 1950 were probably incorrect and should be redetermined using specific radioactivity as the criterion of purity-an invitation that we firmly resisted so that we could concentrate our research efforts on the metabolism problems. Many years later, when we had adopted gas-liquid chromatography as the means of purification, with a symmetrical peak in two systems as a criterion of purity, we were amazed to receive a sample of 14Ccyclohexane from Amersham (Amersham, U.K.) that contained not only 14C_cyclo_ hexene, 14C-cyclohexadiene, and 14C-benzene, but also 36CI-chlorobenzene as impurities. This discovery led to the realization that coelution of chemically similar compounds could prejudice the use of gas chromatography in purification procedures. Initial studies at Oxford with gas chromatography in the early 1960s showed that commercially",

An alternative notation is CH3\u2212CH2\u2212OH, which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group (CH3\u2212) is attached to the carbon of a methylene group (\u2212CH2\u2013), which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group (\u2212OH). It is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether. Ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as EtOH, using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group (C2H5\u2212) with Et. Physical properties Ethanol is a volatile, colorless liquid that has a slight odor. It burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light. The physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain. Ethanol's hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding, rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight, such as propane.",

The relation between this quantity of heat and the temperature of the saturated vapour was found to be in agree ment with the empirical formula :-\nX = 109*0 + 0*24429 t -0-0001315*2,\nin which t is the temperature and X the specified quantity of heat. Unfortunately, data for the specific heat of benzene liquid are not available for the purpose of calculating the latent heat between these temperatures from Regnault's figures. I t is clear, however, from the values obtained for the specific heat at 0\u00b0 C. (Mills and MaeRae, 5 J. Phys. Chem.,' vol. 14, p. 797, 1910 ;Pickering ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 49, p. 11, 1891) and the fact that this quantity increases with rising temperature, that the equation for the latent heat, L, would become:-\nL = a -bt -2 ...,\nwhere a, b and c are all positive quantities. Thus the variation of the latent heat with temperature would be represented by a curve bending towards the temperature axis. Griffiths and Marshall (\u00a3 Phil. Mag.,' 1896) determined the latent heat of benzene at low pressures. The determinations were made over a comparatively small range of temperature, namely 30\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C., and one additional experi ment was performed at 20\u00b0 C. Over this range the latent heat was found to be satisfactorily represented by the linear relation :-L = 107*05 -0*158\u00a3.\n\nThe value at the boiling point (80*2\u00b0 C.) calculated from this formula is 94*37 calories per gram.",

Through his careful studies, he realized that the acid was not being consumed during the production of the ether, although the reaction would not proceed unless the acid was present. After reviewing Mitscherlich's findings, Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius was led to coin the term \"catalysis\" for the acceleration or enablement of a chemical reaction by a substance that itself was not consumed in the reaction. He obtained selenic acid in 1827 and showed that its salts are isomorphous with the sulphates, while a few years later he proved that the same thing is true of the manganates and the sulfates, and of the permanganates and the perchlorates.

The results suggest that benzene interacts primarily with the cation of the ionic liquid, and that liquid clathrate formation (and benzene solubility) is controlled by the strength of the cation-anion interactions, that is, the stronger the cation-anion interaction, the lower the benzene solubility. Other factors that were determined to be important in the final amount of benzene in any given liquid clathrate phase included attractive interactions between the anion and benzene (when significant), and larger steric or free volume demands of the ions, both of which lead to greater benzene solubility.

Yet it has been known since the mid-1800s that benzene is much less reactive than typical alkenes and fails to undergo typical alkene addition reactions. Cyclohexene, for instance, reacts rapidly with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and gives the addition product 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, but benzene reacts slowly with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and gives the substitution product $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{Br}$ rather than the addition product.\n\n\nWe can get a quantitative idea of benzene's stability by measuring heats of hydrogenation (Section 7.6). Cyclohexene, an isolated alkene, has $\\Delta H_{\\text {hydrog }}^{\\circ}=-118 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(-28.2 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, a conjugated diene, has $\\Delta H^{\\circ}{ }_{\\text {hydrog }}=-230 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(-55.0 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$. As noted in Section 14.1, this value for 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a bit less than twice that for cyclohexene because conjugated dienes are more stable than isolated dienes.",

Molecular hydrogen, with only two protons and two electrons, is the simplest molecule with which all aspects of a chemical bond, including electron correlation effects, can be studied. Highly precise values of its ionization and dissociation energies provide stringent tests of the precision of molecular quantum mechanics and of quantum-electrodynamics calculations in molecules. The comparison of experimental and theoretical values for these quantities enable one to quantify the contributions to a chemical bond that are neglected when making the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, i.e. adiabatic, nonadiabatic, relativistic, and radiative corrections. Ionization energies of a broad range of molecules can now be determined experimentally with high accuracy (i.e. about 0.01 cm(-1)). Calculations at similar accuracies are extremely challenging for systems containing more than two electrons. The combination of precision measurements of molecular ionization energies with highly accurateab initio calculations has the potential to provide, in future, fully reliable sets of thermochemical quantities for gas-phase reactions.",

The basis set used in this work is of double-zeta plus polarization quality with additional diffuse s- and p-type functions, denoted DZP++. These methods have been carefully calibrated (Chem. Rev. 2002, 102, 231). The geometries are fully optimized with each density functional theory (DFT) method, and discussed. Harmonic vibrational frequencies were found to be within 3.2% of available experimental values for most functionals. Three different types of the neutral-anion energy separations reported in this work are the adiabatic electron affinity (EA(ad)), the vertical electron affinity (EA(vert)), and the vertical detachment energy (VDE). The most reliable adiabatic electron affinities, obtained at the DZP++ BPW91 level of theory, are 1.45 (C6H5N), 2.29 (C6H5S), 1.57 (C6H5NH), 1.51 (C6H5PH), 0.91 (C6H5CH2), and 1.48 eV (C6H5SiH2), respectively. Compared with the experimental values, the average absolute error of the BPW91 method is 0.04 eV. The B3LYP and B3PW91 functionals also gave excellent predictions, with average absolute errors of 0.06 and 0.07 eV, respectively.",

Is the nature of stabilization in these complexes the same as in others?The attraction in halogen bonded complexes was originally assigned to electrostatic attraction between the positive \u03c3-hole and a negative electron donor, and the recent IUPAC definition of a halogen bond 1 is in accord with this view. However, we recently highlighted the important role of dispersion interaction,95,96 which is the attraction caused by the interaction of temporary electric multipole with an induced electric multipole. This is understandable in the light of the fact that in any halogen bond, two atoms with high polarizability (halogen and electron donor) are located close together (closer than the sum of their van de Waals radii). This somewhat contradicts the previously mentioned definition of a halogen bond, which states, \"The forces involved in the formation of the halogen bond are primarily electrostatic, but polarization, charge transfer, and dispersion contributions all play an important role.\" To explain this contradiction, we investigated in detail the nature of different halogen bonds, from the weakest ones with stabilization energy around a few kcal/mol to the strongest ones with stabilization energy higher than tens of kcal/mol. We deduced the nature of the halogen bond on the basis of dominant energy terms; this means that the total stabilization energy in halogen bonded complexes should be decomposed to single energy components.Several computational methods have been suggested to decompose the total stabilization energy.

The new measurement of \u03b1 removed a discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of atomic hydrogen, one of the major unsolved problems of quantum electrodynamics at time.

Molecular structures and vibrations from theoretical calculations.\nAb initio and density functional theory computations have been carried out to calculate the structures and vibrational spectra of halobismuthates and haloantimonates of formulas MX6(3-), M2X10(4-), and M2X9(3-) for M = Bi or Sb and X = I, Br, or Cl. The results have been compared to experimental crystal structures and the infrared and Raman spectra of these species as well as the (MX5(2-))n and (MX4(1-))n anions. Even though the calculations neglect the effect of which cation is present, they do a good job in verifying the observed trends in bond distances and bond stretching vibrational frequencies. External bonds across from bridging bonds are the shortest and have the highest stretching frequencies for all of the ions investigated. This supports the previously postulated \"trans effect\". Since the calculations were carried out for individual noninteracting anions, the computed results can be expected to best represent the idealized species unperturbed by the effect of the cations present. The trans effect results in shortening of the M-X bonds by 0.08-0.13 \u00c5. It also leads to frequency increases of about 20% for the M-X stretching vibrations.",

We seek to answer this question using the accepted empirical rules linking the chemical hardness to the atomic size and the polarizability; we also propose a new correlation with the C6 London dispersion coefficient. For chemical reactivity in the gas phase, it seems to make no difference whether negative, or zero, electron affinities are used for systems with metastable anions. For reactions in solution the evidence that is presently available is insufficient to establish a preference. In addressing this issue, we noted that electron affinity data from which atomic chemical hardness values are computed are out of date; an update to Pearson's classic 1988 table [Inorg.

Zewail, for the use of ultrashort pulses to observe chemical reactions at the timescales on which they occur, opening up the field of femtochemistry. Definition There is no standard definition of ultrashort pulse. Usually the attribute 'ultrashort' applies to pulses with a duration of a few tens of femtoseconds, but in a larger sense any pulse which lasts less than a few picoseconds can be considered ultrashort. The distinction between \"Ultrashort\" and \"Ultrafast\" is necessary as the speed at which the pulse propagates is a function of the index of refraction of the medium through which it travels, whereas \"Ultrashort\" refers to the temporal width of the pulse wavepacket. A common example is a chirped Gaussian pulse, a wave whose field amplitude follows a Gaussian envelope and whose instantaneous phase has a frequency sweep.",

In these studies, it was demonstrated that by applying high-voltage nanosecond pulses to cells, plasma membrane and cell organelles are permeabilized. As suggested in a recent publication, the repetition rate and polarity of nanosecond high-voltage pulses could have an important effect on the electropermeabilization process, and consequently, on the observed phenomena. Therefore, we designed a new Blumlein configuration that enables a higher repetition rate of variable duration of either bipolar or unipolar high-voltage pulses. We achieved a maximal pulse repetition rate of 1.1 MHz. However, theoretically, this rate could be even higher. We labeled endocytotic vesicles with lucifer yellow and added propidium iodide to a cell suspension for testing the cell plasma membrane integrity, so we were able to observe the permeabilization of endocytotic vesicles and the cell plasma membrane at the same time. The new design of pulse generator was built, verified, and also tested in experiments. The resulting flexibility and variability allow further in vitro experiments to determine the importance of the pulse repetition rate and pulse polarity on membrane permeabilization -- both of the cell plasma membrane as well as of cell organelle membranes.",

UWB pulses can be sent sporadically at relatively low pulse rates to support time or position modulation, but can also be sent at rates up to the inverse of the UWB pulse bandwidth.

Continuous waves could not be produced with an electric spark, but were achieved with the vacuum tube electronic oscillator, invented around 1913 by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner. After World War I, transmitters capable of producing continuous wave, the Alexanderson alternator and vacuum tube oscillators, became widely available.

Applications Electrical and electronics In electronics, duty cycle is the percentage of the ratio of pulse duration, or pulse width (PW) to the total period (T) of the waveform. It is generally used to represent time duration of a pulse when it is high (1). In digital electronics, signals are used in rectangular waveform which are represented by logic 1 and logic 0. Logic 1 stands for presence of an electric pulse and 0 for absence of an electric pulse. For example, a signal (10101010) has 50% duty cycle, because the pulse remains high for 1/2 of the period or low for 1/2 of the period. Similarly, for pulse (10001000) the duty cycle will be 25% because the pulse remains high only for 1/4 of the period and remains low for 3/4 of the period. Electrical motors typically use less than a 100% duty cycle. For example, if a motor runs for one out of 100 seconds, or 1/100 of the time, then, its duty cycle is 1/100, or 1 percent.",

While uniphasic nanosecond pulse generators are widely available, the recent discovery that biological effects can be uniquely modulated by reversing the polarity of nanosecond duration pulses calls for the development of a multimodal pulse generator. This paper describes a method to generate nanosecond multiphasic pulses for biomedical use, and specifically demonstrates its ability to cancel or enhance cell swelling and blebbing. The generator consists of a series of the fundamental module, which includes a capacitor and a MOSFET switch. A positive or a negative phase pulse module can be produced based on how the switch is connected. Stacking the modules in series can increase the voltage up to 5\u00a0kV. Multiple stacks in parallel can create multiphase outputs. As each stack is independently controlled and charged, multiphasic pulses can be created to produce flexible and versatile pulse waveforms. The circuit topology can be used for high-frequency uniphasic or biphasic nanosecond burst pulse production, creating numerous opportunities for the generator in electroporation applications, tissue ablation, wound healing, and nonthermal plasma generation.",

Will the current principles governing the groups and periods of the Periodic Table still be valid for the heaviest elements and what defines the place an element occupies in the Periodic System? These intricate questions are the topic of current research in nuclear chemistry. Fig.  1 shows a modern Periodic Table. The nuclide 244 Pu, with a radioactive half-life of 81.2 million years could still be present on earth as a primordial element or be of cosmic origin due to explosive stellar nucleosynthesis, for example, from a nearby supernova that occurred after the formation of our solar system. Indeed, a concen-tration of about 2500 atoms 244 Pu per gram of Bastnaesite, a mineral highly enriched in rare earth elements, was reported nearly 40 years ago. [2] However, a recent search for 244 Pu in Bastnaesite from same mine using accelerator mass spectrometry remained negative with a detection limit of less than 550 atoms per gram. [3] Thus, all known elements heavier than Pu are man-made. The last element that can be produced in weighable quantities is fermium with atomic number 100. It can be produced by breeding in high-flux nuclear reactors and quantities of few nanograms have been isolated and supplied for chemical experiments, i.e. for laser spectroscopic measurements of the atomic level structure. [4] All elements heavier than fermium have so far been produced only at accelerators in heavy ion fusion reactions. Up to element lawrencium (Z = 103), the identification of a new element and the assignment of the atomic number were made based on chemical properties. The position at which a newly discovered radioactive species was eluted from a cation-exchange column in \u03b1-hydroxyisobutyrate solution was indicative of its ionic radius and thus its position within the group of actinides.

ForbesTo which of these two views does Mr. Forbes mean to hold, that of a rapidly and constantly increasing density from pressure, or that in which, limiting the condensing effect of pressure, he seeks to explain the density of the earth by a nucleus of heavy metallic compounds ? The latter is seemingly an after-thought of the critic, suggested by some notion of the principle involved in the augmentation by pressure of the fusing point of bodies which expand in melting. As was shown by James Thomson, the effect of pressure upon ice (and naturally upon such metals and metallic alloys as, like it, contract in melting) would be to reduce its melting point, a fact which has been experimentally established for ice. Reasoning from the same principle, Sir Wm. Thomson deduced the conclusion that a reverse effect should result from pressure for all such solids as expand in melting; that is to say, that their points of fusion would be raised, a conclusion verified by the experiments of Bunsen, and by those of Fairbairn and Hopkins. From some apparent irregularities in these results, and from the fact that certain of the substances submitted to experiment were bodies of the carbon series, which Mr. Forbes calls \"organic,\" he argues against the conclusions which depend upon a well-defined physical law. In the case of the fusible alloys tried by Mr. Hopkins, it is to be remarked that most of these bodies, like ice, expand in cooling, and consequently should not have their melting points raised by pressure. For the memoirs of James and William Thomson, see Trans. Royal Soc Edin., xvL part 5, and L. E. D. Philos. Mag., [3] xxxyii. 135. A simple and popular exposition of the principle, and of Mr. Hopkin's argument therefrom, for the solidity of the globe, will be found in the fourth of Tyndal's lectures on Heat as a Mode of Motion. See, also, Sorby's Bakerian lecture for 1863, cited farther on. Mr. Forbes must consider that just so far as he admits the condensing power of the pressure of the superincumbent mass, he increases the difficulty of maintaining that rocky mass in a liquid, state.",

In this case the classical mass action laws and the definitions of chemical equilibrium and partition coefficient are no longer valid. The question arose whether one single atom actually displays chemical properties and how typical these properties are compared to bulk properties and how they can be measured. It can be shown that partition coefficients can be defined for single atoms, if one replaces concentrations by probabilities to find a single atom in a given state, i.e. in the gas phase or adsorbed to a surface in gas-phase chemistry, or in the aqueous phase vs. the organic phase in a liquid-liquid extraction step. [6] As will be discussed later, it is indeed possible to perform chemical experiments with only one single atom or molecule at a time and to quantitatively measure thermochemical properties, distribution coefficients, and so on. Such experiments need to be designed in such a manner that the atom under investigation has the possibility to probe its state repeatedly, such as in chromatography experiments.",

This prompted many researchers to search for them in nature from 1976 to 1983. A group led by Tom Cahill, a professor at the University of California at Davis, claimed in 1976 that they had detected alpha particles and X-rays with the right energies to cause the damage observed, supporting the presence of these elements. In particular, the presence of long-lived (on the order of 109 years) unbiquadium and unbihexium nuclei, along with their decay products, at an abundance of 10\u221211 relative to their possible congeners uranium and plutonium, was conjectured.

To alleviate this difficulty, we have studied meteorite samples with the ultrasensitive magnetic field modulated microwave spectroscopy (MFMMS) technique [J. G. Ram\u00edrez, A. C.

This explains why this structure cannot be reproduced in the laboratory. The crystalline patterns become visible when the meteorites are cut, polished, and acid-etched, because taenite is more resistant to the acid. The dimension of kamacite lamellae ranges from coarsest to finest (upon their size) as the nickel content increases. This classification is called structural classification. Use Since nickel-iron crystals grow to lengths of some centimeters only when the solid metal cools down at an exceptionally slow rate (over several million years), the presence of these patterns is strongly suggestive of extraterrestrial origin of the material, and can be used to indicate if a piece of iron may come from a meteorite.

As the case of the nuclear shell model demonstrated, it might be interesting to have a look at the answers that theoretical chemists give to predict the chemical properties of superheavy elements. Traditionally, the chemical properties of an unknown element and its compounds were predicted by exploiting the fundamental relationships of the physicochemical data of the elements and their compounds within the groups and the periods of the Periodic Table. However, with the increasing nuclear charges in heavy elements, the innermost electrons become more tightly bound and are thus moving with velocities which are a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore they obey the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics. Due to relativistic rearrangements, which are predicted for the electronic structure of the heaviest elements, quite unexpected chemical properties are to be expected. These so-called relativistic effects are already severely influencing the chemical properties of lighter elements such as gold. The yellow color and the rather inert chemical behavior can be attributed to relativistic effects and explained by fully relativistic quantum chemical calculations. [17] Early predictions of the chemical properties of superheavy elements were rather spectacular. One of the articles was entitled 'Are elements 112, 114, and 118 relatively inert gases?'. [18] Nowadays, with the use of powerful supercomputers the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations is increasing rapidly. Latest calculations come to the conclusion that element 112 (Cn) is not completely inert as expected for a noble gas, but should form a chemical bond with Au, which, however, is weaker than that of the lighter homolog Hg. [19] Also, element 114 might be relatively inert but should interact stronger with an Au surface than Cn. [19] Element 118 is predicted to be the first element in the row of noble gases with an electron affinity. [20] Due to the considerable experimental difficulties in experimentally studying the chemical properties of superheavy elements, the gap between experimental observables and theoretical predictions is still large.",

Advanced and very sensitive techniques allow the chemical properties of these elusive elements to be probed. Often, less than ten short-lived atoms, chemically separated one-atom-at-a-time, provide crucial information on basic chemical properties. These results place the architecture of the far-end of the Periodic Table on the test bench and probe the increasingly strong relativistic effects that influence the chemical properties there.

However, all available chemical and physical evidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the next electron is not added to the $3 d$ level but is, instead, added to the $4 s$ level (Figure 3.29). As discussed previously, the $3 d$ orbital with no radial nodes is higher in energy because it is less penetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the $4 s$, which has three radial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s ${ }^{1}$. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valence shell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the $4 S$ subshell and calcium has an electron configuration of $[\\mathrm{Ar}] 4 s^{2}$.

Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (\"to build up\"). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 3.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 3.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 3.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order. For example, after filling the $3 p$ block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be $4 \\mathrm{~s}(\\mathrm{~K}, \\mathrm{Ca})$, followed by the $3 d$ orbitals.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.26 This diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state electron configurations.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.27 This partial periodic table shows electron configurations for the valence subshells of atoms. By \"building up\" from hydrogen, this table can be used to determine the electron configuration for atoms of most elements in the periodic table.

The melting of ice under high pressures is thought to contribute to the movement of glaciers.

These experiments compress water from ambient conditions to pressures as high as about 14 GPa and temperatures of up to several hundreds of Kelvin. Water may freeze into ice VII during this process. Although there are several studies on the thermodynamic properties of ice VII, an accurate and analytic free energy model from which all other properties may be derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner has not been previously determined. We have developed such a free energy model for ice VII that is calibrated with pressure-volume-temperature measurements and melt curve data. Furthermore, we show that liquid water in the pressure and temperature range of interest is well-represented by a simple Mie-Gr\u00fcneisen equation of state. Our liquid water and ice VII equations of state are validated by comparing to sound speed and Hugoniot data. Although they are targeted towards ramp and multiple-shock compression experiments, we demonstrate that our equations of state also behave reasonably well at pressures and temperatures that lie somewhat beyond those found in the experiments.",

The melting point is sensitive to extremely large changes in pressure, but generally this sensitivity is orders of magnitude less than that for the boiling point, because the solid-liquid transition represents only a small change in volume. If, as observed in most cases, a substance is more dense in the solid than in the liquid state, the melting point will increase with increases in pressure. Otherwise the reverse behavior occurs. Notably, this is the case of water, as illustrated graphically to the right, but also of Si, Ge, Ga, Bi. With extremely large changes in pressure, substantial changes to the melting point are observed. For example, the melting point of silicon at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) is 1415 \u00b0C, but at pressures in excess of 10 GPa it decreases to 1000 \u00b0C.",

First, ice floats on water because ice has lower density due to its open hydrogen-bonded tetrahedral structures. A second anomaly is that water has a temperature of maximum density (TMD, of approximately 4\u00b0C) in its liquid range, whereas other materials are maximally dense in their solid states. Upon going from its melting point at 0\u00b0C to its TMD at 4\u00b0C, liquid water gets denser because heating melts some low-density, cage-structure waters into higher density van der Waals contact structures. This is also reflected in a third anomaly: just above 0\u00b0C, water has a negative thermal expansion coefficient, indicating its increasing density with temperature. Then, heating beyond the TMD, liquid water expands like other materials do because heating loosens the intermolecular bonding.\n\nThere are practical consequences of water's density anomalies. One is shown in Figure 9. Whereas simpler materials freeze from the bottom up, lakes filled with water freeze from the top down, since ice is less dense than liquid water.",

After all, melting points are determined easily under laboratory conditions for many substances by simply heating the solid at constant pressure until it melts. Although liquids can be supercooled, solid cannot be superheated as first stated by Bridgmann [64]: 'It is impossible to superheat a crystalline phase with respect to the liquid.' For this reason there is in principle no risk in determining melting points by simply heating the solid until it melts. However, in computer simulations the situation is somewhat different. If conventional NpT simulations are performed for ice I h then it does not melt at T m but at a somewhat higher temperature [65][66][67][68]. It is worth mentioning that superheating has also been recently found experimentally [69,70] for ice I h but only on a short time scale (about 200 ps). The difference between the results of NpT simulations and those found in experiments (summarized in the Bridgman's statement) is striking. However, there is a fundamental difference between experiments and NpT simulations of bulk solids. Whereas in experiments the ice (or a solid in general) must have a surface (or rather an interface at which it is in contact with another phase; vapour or liquid), this interface is missing in conventional NpT simulations of bulk solids. When no interface is present ice must melt via bulk melting [71].",

Although almost all water ice on Earth is the familiar crystalline ice Ih, amorphous ice dominates in the depths of interstellar medium, making this likely the most common structure for H2O in the universe at large.

In particular it can be set to zero to identify characteristic times that diverge in this limit. We find that the eigenvalues (the inverse relaxation times) either tend to zero as T \u2032 approaches zero (there are four such eigenvalues with eigenvectors corresponding to the 4 local minima) or they tend to integer values of 1, 2 or 3. The other eigenvalues correspond to downhill motion in the free energy landscape and are determined by the its local topology.

Hence, the ESQPT critical energy splits the spectrum into one phase where the equilibrium expectation values of physical observables crucially depend on this constant of motion and another phase where the energy is the only relevant thermodynamic magnitude. The trademark feature of this operator is that it has two different eigenvalues \u00b11, and, therefore, it acts as a discrete symmetry in the first of these two phases. This scenario is observed in systems with and without an additional discrete symmetry; in the first case, C[over ^] explains the change from degenerate doublets to nondegenerate eigenlevels upon crossing the critical line.

It applies to systems composed of many particles, however, we are seeing that one can formulate laws of thermodynamics when only a small number of particles are interacting with a heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we find that for processes which are approximately cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a different form compared to the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but an entire family of constraints. We find a family of free energies which generalize the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law relates to one of these, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. We find three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are relevant for small systems, and also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics are unified in this framework, with the first law defining the class of operations, the zeroth law emerging as an equivalence relation between thermal states, and the remaining laws being monotonicity of our generalized free energies.

Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available energy states that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between \"new\" and \"old\" degrees. This mathematical result is part of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics is simple only for systems which are near or in a physical equilibrium state. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing the systems' behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of maximum entropy production. It states that nonequilibrium systems behave in such a way as to maximize their entropy production. See also",

The carbon species were subsequently cooled and ionized resulting in the formation of clusters. Clusters ranged in molecular masses, but Kroto and Smalley found predominance in a C60 cluster that could be enhanced further by allowing the plasma to react longer. They also discovered that the C60 molecule formed a cage-like structure, a regular truncated icosahedron.

Moving just one hydrogen to the inside is predicted to decrease the energy by 53 kilocalories (kcal) per mole. Putting additional hydrogens on the inside further lowers the predicted energy (depending on the steric relations between them). The miniimum energy isomer is predicted to have ten hydrogens inside with C(1) symmetry and to have an energy 400 kcal/mol less than that of the all-outside isomer.

The DOS of a spherical top has a dependence on the square root of the frequency 33 , which agrees well with the trend of VDOS at near zero frequency for FCC C 60 at 300 K. Therefore the large VDOS at near zero frequency in C 60 shall be attributed to the rotational motion of buckyballs. While in PCBM, the VDOS for buckyballs is nearly zero below 1 meV (see Fig. 3(b)) suggesting that the rotational motions are fully suppressed by the alkyl chains.\n\nCompared with the VDOS of FCC C 60 , above 10 meV, the peaks in the partial VDOS of the buckyballs in PCBM are shifted or new peaks are created because of the changes in intra-molecular bonding with the addition of alkyl chains. However, the VDOS of the buckyball in the low frequency regime, dominated by the inter-molecular interaction, have been modified significantly by the alkyl chains in PCBM, as depicted in Fig. 3(b). The VDOS of C and H atoms in alkyl chains of PCMB is also shown in Fig. 3(b). below 5 meV, the VDOS of C and H atoms in alkyl chain is small compared to that of the buckyballs in PCBM. This significant mismatch of VDOS between buckyballs and alkyl chains can cause intense scattering of low frequency phonons. As low frequency inter-molecular phonons may dominate the thermal transport in fullerene, the scattering by alkyl chains can lead to significant decrease of thermal conductivity.",

We use an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation lasting hundreds of nanoseconds to determine the behavior of a single molecule of C60 in a periodic box of water, and compare this to methane. A C60 molecule does not induce drying at the surface; however, unlike a hard sphere methane, a hard sphere C60 solute does. This is due to a larger number of attractive Lennard-Jones interactions between the carbon atom centers in C60 and the surrounding waters. In these simulations, water is not uniformly arranged but rather adopts a range of orientations in the first hydration shell despite the spherical symmetry of both solutes. There is a clear effect of solute size on the orientation of the first hydration shell waters. There is a large increase in hydrogen-bonding contacts between waters in the C60 first hydration shell. There is also a disruption of hydrogen bonds between waters in the first and second hydration shells. Water molecules in the first hydration shell preferentially create triangular structures that minimize the net water dipole near the surface near both the methane and C60 surface, reducing the total energy of the system. Additionally, in the first and second hydration shells, the water dipoles are ordered to a distance of 8 A from the solute surface.

An allotrope of carbon, fullerene\u2014and a particular molecule of that allotrope C60 (buckminsterfullerene or buckyball) has been named after him. The Buckminsterfullerene molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller's geodesic dome. The 1996 Nobel prize in chemistry was given to Kroto, Curl, and Smalley for their discovery of the fullerene. He is quoted in the lyric of \"The Tower of Babble\" in the musical Godspell: \"Man is a complex of patterns and processes.\"",

There exist several isomers, lying close in structure and energy, with total energy difference within approximately 30 meV. We present detailed analysis of their electronic structure and geometry. Calculated radial breathing mode frequency turns out to be 474 cm(-1), which can be a characteristic of B(80) in Raman spectroscopy. Since the B(80) structure is made of interwoven double-ring clusters, we also investigate double-rings with various diameters. We present their structure and HOMO-LUMO dependence on the diameter, and find out that the gap alternates for different sizes and closes its value for infinite double-ring.",

Fig. 3  (X = F, Cl, Br) lack a clear region of C-X stretching modes like C 64 H 4 . It may be because H atom is much lighter than C atom, the C-H stretching modes could be separated from other modes caused by C atoms, and the corresponding peaks are located at a very high frequency region. By contrast, F, Cl and Br atoms are heavier than C atom, the motion of F, Cl and Br atoms must be coupled with C atoms strongly, resulting in that the IR and Raman spectra of C 64 Cl 4 could not be parted into two regions. This may also cause other spectral differences between C 64 H 4 and C 64 Cl 4 .",

Solution Fullerenes are sparingly soluble in aromatic solvents and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 have a deep purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue light transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.",
