Once a suitable crystal is grown, the packing and atomic connectivity of the constituent molecules can be studied by X-ray diffraction. However, the discovery of experimental conditions for successful crystal growth is often challenging. We have developed a nanoscale crystallization technique for organic-soluble small molecules by using highthroughput liquid-handling robotics to undertake multiple crystallization experiments simultaneously with minimal sample requirements and high success rates. We showcase our methodology through the crystallization of a diverse set of small molecules, including ''uncrystallizables,'' combined with structural analysis by X-ray diffraction. We anticipate that this rapid and reliable method for small-molecule crystallization will have far-reaching impact, facilitating academic and industrial research in the molecular sciences.",

The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements.

Remember that the total length of the biofilm can be expressed by l tot = N l * . Therefore, this means that most of the biofilm start spending more time in darkness and the effect of respiration becomes predominant. We want to evaluate the optimal light intensity when the RAB is permanently exposed to light. That is, the value that will maximize the mean growth rate at steady state. In Fig. 5 growth rate at steady state at different levels of the biofilm are shown. It can be observed that the light intensity that provided the maximum mean growth rate is I = 288µmol.m −1 s −1 . Note that this value correspond to approximately the same value as the one for the averaged light. We conclude by saying that in order to increase the productivity the RAB needs to receive in average a light intensity close to I = 288µmol.m −1 s −1 .",

The dipole moment H is defined by the spatial distribution of the centers of negative oxygen and positive hydrogen charges, H = H (r 1 + r 2 ). The absolute value of dipole moment H is H = 2 H OH cos( 1 2 ) = 5.6281 D. The dipole moment O of an oxygen atom emerges owing to the polarization of the electron shell of an oxygen anion by the electric fields of hydrogens in the water molecule. According to the results of work [12], it equals\nO = − H (︂ r 1 3 1 [1 − ( 1 )] + r 2 3 2 [1 − ( 2 )] )︂ .\nIt is easy to calculate that O = −3.7752 D. Therefore, the magnitude of the dipole moment is = H + O = 1.8528 D. This value completely agrees with the absolute value of dipole moment of an isolated water molecule.\n\n\nInfluence of a neighbor molecule on the dipole moment of a water molecule\n\nThe modification of the dipole moment under the influence of a neighbor molecule is one of the simplest manifestations of many-particle effects in the system. To estimate the influence of the second molecule, let us calculate the ratio (12) O / O between the dipole moment of an oxygen atom calculated in the pair approximation to the dipole moment of an isolated molecule. The dependence of the ratio (12) O / O on the distance between the oxygen atoms of two neighbor molecules is exhibited in Fig. 6.\n\n\nConclusions",

There is also both positive and negative excess electron density in the interstitial cavities between the water molecules of the first and the second solvation shells. The gyration ellipsoid for these p-like orbitals is 0.18 nm x 0.22 nm x 0.33 nm making them nearly twice the size of the gyration ellipsoid for the HOMO, so the 'p-like' states extend further out of the cavity than the 's-like' ground state. This readily accounts for the experimental observation that s-p excitation of the electron causes relocalization, albeit with a low probability.[63] The complex orbital structure of the p-like orbitals may also be important for understanding the mechanism for rapid, nonadiabatic IC involving these orbitals (Sec. 3.1). Indeed, the orbital momentum carried by the polarized cavity should be rapidly lost via small-amplitude motions (librations?) of the water molecules.PlaceFigures 3 and 4here.",

The column density corresponding to the H 2 O line is N(H 2 O) = 9.25×10 14 cm −2 . In Fig. 2, we have shown the ALMA individual detection of H 2 O at ν = 183.310 GHz with transition J = 3(1,3)-2(2,2). The observation was done on 20th Sept 2020 with ALMA 12m single dish (TP) aperture. In this spectrum, both vertical and horizontal polarizations are fully averaged. The continuum value of the absorption spectrum is 0.0097 Jy/Beam. The water is most probably created due to the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in July 1994 near 44 • S (Lellouch et al. 1995;Nol et al. 1995;Moreno et al. 2003). The area of H 2 O absorption spectra is -0.068±0.001 Jy/Beam GHz with FWHM = 0.134±0.003 GHz. The illumination factor of Jupiter, during the observation, is 8.58% which means 91.42% of the mapped planet was in dayside at the time of observation.\n\nEarlier space mission, using Juno microwave radiometer, also detected abundance of water in the equatorial zone of Jupiter .

Table VII contains the results of porfional absorption calculations for the red alga Porphyra naladum. At X675 m~ the major absorption is that of chlorophyll a (see below). At X620 m/, approximately one-third of the absorp-tion is by chlorophyll and two-thirds by phycocyanin. At X560 mt~ a large fraction (ca. 84 per cent) is absorbed by phycocyanin and phycoerythrin, the latter absorbing 67 per cent. The precision of these values is considered to be rather low largely because of the substitution of blue-green algal chlorophyll protein for that of a red alga.

The standard molar heat capacity at constant volume (C θ V ), standard state entropy (S θ ), as well as the absolute enthalpy (H θ ) and Gibbs free energy (G θ ), were obtained directly from the calculations (Gaussian's output file). Moreover, the isodesmic reaction illustrated in Eq. (1) has been designed to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (Δ f H θ ) and standard Gibbs energy of formation (Δ f G θ ) of the molecules because no relevant experimental data is available. A similar isodesmic reaction was used to calculate the Δ f H θ and Δ f G θ of C 8 H 18 , and obtained results consistent with the corresponding experimental data (Pollack et al., 2005). Therefore, comparatively accurate thermodynamic estimates are expected for C 10 -SCCPs. The standard enthalpy change of the reaction (Δ r H θ ) is equal to the sum of the standard enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of reactants, while the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation (Δ f H θ ) of the products minus that of the reactants also yields Δ r H θ . Thus, we can get Δ f H θ of C 10 -SCCPs from Eq. (2). The calculation of the Δ f G θ values of C 10 -SCCPs can also be accomplished in the same way from Eq. (3).",

The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements. We test this model by using Eq. (2) to predict the pressure shift given the bulk modulus B.

As the case of the nuclear shell model demonstrated, it might be interesting to have a look at the answers that theoretical chemists give to predict the chemical properties of superheavy elements. Traditionally, the chemical properties of an unknown element and its compounds were predicted by exploiting the fundamental relationships of the physicochemical data of the elements and their compounds within the groups and the periods of the Periodic Table. However, with the increasing nuclear charges in heavy elements, the innermost electrons become more tightly bound and are thus moving with velocities which are a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore they obey the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics. Due to relativistic rearrangements, which are predicted for the electronic structure of the heaviest elements, quite unexpected chemical properties are to be expected. These so-called relativistic effects are already severely influencing the chemical properties of lighter elements such as gold. The yellow color and the rather inert chemical behavior can be attributed to relativistic effects and explained by fully relativistic quantum chemical calculations. [17] Early predictions of the chemical properties of superheavy elements were rather spectacular. One of the articles was entitled 'Are elements 112, 114, and 118 relatively inert gases?'. [18] Nowadays, with the use of powerful supercomputers the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations is increasing rapidly. Latest calculations come to the conclusion that element 112 (Cn) is not completely inert as expected for a noble gas, but should form a chemical bond with Au, which, however, is weaker than that of the lighter homolog Hg. [19] Also, element 114 might be relatively inert but should interact stronger with an Au surface than Cn. [19] Element 118 is predicted to be the first element in the row of noble gases with an electron affinity. [20] Due to the considerable experimental difficulties in experimentally studying the chemical properties of superheavy elements, the gap between experimental observables and theoretical predictions is still large.",
