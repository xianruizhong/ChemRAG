Some of these, such as the Lorentz and polarisation corrections, have been well characterised analytically since the 1920's. More problematic has been computing corrections for absorption effects. X-rays are attenuated as they pass through a medium according to Beer's Law:\nI o = I i e −µt ,(2)\nwhere I o is the observed X-ray intensity, I i is the incident intensity, µ is the absorption coefficient (computed from the elemental composition [2]) and t is the path length through the sample.

Therefore, XAS spectrum is divided into two parts: the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)-typically within 30 eV of the main absorption edge, and the extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS). XAS spectra are sensitive to the formal oxidation state, coordination chemistry, and the distances, coordination number, and species of the atoms surrounding the selected element. K-and Llevel X-ray emission spectra, reflecting the energy distribution of photons emitted by the atoms, can be divided into α and β regions. α lines are characterized by high transition yields but provide little direct chemical information. On the other hand, β lines associated with satellites are being sensitive to chemical environment of the atom, but are much weaker in intensity. For example, two ranges may be recognized around X-ray emission spectrum of Kβ line: Kβ mainline consisting of metal 3p to metal 1s transitions and the valence-to-core (V2C Kβ 2, 5 ) region comprised of transitions from valence, ligand-localized orbitals to the metal 1s. Both have been shown to contain valuable chemical information-the Kβ mainline is sensitive to the metal spin state as well as the metal-ligand covalence [22] while the V2C region contains information about ligand identity, electronic structure, and metal-ligand bond length [23].",

This reflected intensity profile from a stack of crystal planes will have peaks whenever the path length is an integer number of wavelengths, n, the first when n = 0 which corresponds to F 000 at 2 = 0. The second peak occurs when n = 1 and occurs at 2 = 2 B1 which corresponds to the first-order Bragg condition in conventional theory. There will also be further peaks at n = 2, 3 etc., which are harmonics from path lengths of 2, 3 etc. and do not reveal additional lengths in the structure (Fig. 6a), i.e. this is the profile from a single set of periodic planes calculated using equation (16) in Appendix B3. The mid-positions between the peaks give a reasonable range that can be associated with each F hkl . It is reasonable to assume that the intensity contributions from the overlapping amplitudes at these mid-points will have little influence on the required F hkl values. Fig. 6(a) corresponds to a very simple structure. By adding more planes of atoms with the same periodicity and combining their amplitudes the resulting intensity is changed dramatically (Fig. 6b) [equation (17) in Appendix B3]. By building the diffraction pattern in this way the electron density around the atoms can be included rather easily by adding thin layers representing the profile of the electron-density distribution. Thermal vibrations can be included in the same way to observe the change in the profile and the suppression of the maxima. For example, by taking a Si h111i orientated wafer and calculating the intensity along the truncation rod along 111 we obtain an intensity profile as in Fig. 7(a). This assumes the atomic planes have no thickness. If now the atoms have a spherical distribution of electrons, the lateral average of the electron density will be symmetrical either side of the planes and, by taking a thin layer of low electron density equidistant on both sides of each plane, the intensity profile is modified (Fig. 7b). This example gives intensity at the 222 reflection that is 'systematically absent' in",

Assuming that X-rays enter along the z-axis, k 0 = (0, 0, k 0 ), a pair of momentum transfer vectors corresponding to two points on the opposite sides of the detector are given by q = (q x , q y , q z ) and q = (−q x , −q y , q z ).

It applies to the x and y components in Eq. (12), but not the z-component. However, if the overall electron density is symmetric with regards to the z-axis, the net Fourier transform along the z-axis must be real-valued (in practice this occurs by collecting symmetry-related pairs in the sum in Eq.(12)with identical x and y components and complex conjugate z components). In that situation the Fourier transform of the z-component does not invalidate Friedel's law for the overall expression and we obtain F * (q ) = F(q), which in turn implies |F(q )| 2 = |F(q)| 2 as required for centrosymmetry. It is worth noting that Friedel's law always applies to the x and y components (since the electron density is real), and that the de-",

All the amplitudes will be coherently related which makes the inverse problem of estimating the structure from the diffraction pattern a difficult challenge. Also, any unforeseen microstructure features may confuse the interpretation. The dominating features in a diffraction pattern are the strong peaks that Bragg (1913) associated with specular (mirror) reflections from crystal planes. This explanation assumes that all the atoms aligned in these planes concentrate their amplitudes at one position and can be simply interpreted, or that the amplitude diminishes from the peak due to size effects (James, 1962;Authier, 2001) etc., which is the shape transform.\n\nSoon after Bragg published his explanation, Darwin (1914) recognized that the scattering from a set of parallel planes introduces re-scattering from the underside of planes above. This led to the diminution of the incident beam and explained the width of the profile. Ewald (1916Ewald ( , 1917 and Laue (1931) took this further and introduced the polarizability of the electron density by the incoming electromagnetic wave by considering the crystal as a series of dipoles (Ewald) and a distributed electron density (Laue). These two works form the basis of the interaction of the incident wave and the crystal. The electric field vector component parallel to the surface must be continuous which defines the location (2) of the scattered intensity for a given incident angle (James, 1962;Fewster, 2015 etc.). This gives the profile shape and its direction, e.g. crystal truncation rods.",

The differences in intensity between different rotational states are an order of magnitude in specific directions of scattering (i.e. towards particular positions on the detector). In contrast, the changes due to different vibrational states are modest, about 1% or less. This is a consequence of the fact that low-lying vibrational states are considered, implying small and local nuclear displacements around equilibrium positions and hence no net change in molecular geometry. A technical point is that the integration over the multidimensional vibrational wavefunction is time-consuming, and given the small nuclear displacements considered in the harmonic approximation one could, in the future, examine the possibility of interpolating the electronic wavefunction coefficients. Electronic states also affect the scattering 42,54,55 , with effects comparable to those of rotations in the presence of significant orientation or alignment. However, in most situations electronic excitation leads to changes in the nuclear geometry 56,57 , since the potential energy surfaces associated with different electronic states are rarely parallel. This leads to very strong changes in the scattering, associated with the change in molecular geometry. An interesting point is that the greater the redistribution of electrons during vertical excitation of the molecule, and hence stronger signature of the electronic state, the greater is the likely effect on the nuclear motion, which itself bears an even stronger signature. Overall, it is apparent that disentangling different contributions, especially the vibrational and the electronic, to the scattering is not trivial.",

In the independent atom model (IAM) 32 the electron density is approximated by a sum of spherical single-atom densities, which yield the form factor as a sum of atomic form factors pre-fixed by a phase factor that depends on the relative positions of the atomic nuclei. The convenience of IAM stems from the fact that the atomic form factors have been calculated and tabulated for all future use 33 , but the drawback is that distortions in the electron distribution, for instance due to molecular bonding or electronic excitations, are not included. This situation can to some extent be alleviated by the use of generalized form factors fitted to the distorted charge distributions for the bonded atoms 33,35,36 , for instance to describe hydrogen atoms in organic molecular crystals. An interesting point is that the electron density observed in a gas-phase experiment corresponds to the total molecular wavefunction and hence the structure factorĨ n (q) in Eqs. (3) and (6).

The ratio of two liquid ingredients, the so called reactants or educts, plays an important role in determining the end product and its yield. The reactants must be weighed and accordingly mixed with the conventional batch mode. If the reaction is done in a microreactor or in several parallel working micro-reactors, units for allotting the educts in appropriate quantities are required.\n\nIn this report we present a novel micro-reactor that allows the constant monitoring of the chemical reaction via Raman spectroscopy. Such monitoring enables an appropriate feedback on the steering parameters for the PC controlled micro-pumps for the appropriate educt flow rate of both liquids to get optimised ratios of ingredients at an optimised total flow rate. The micro-reactors are the core pieces of the design and are easily removable and can therefore be changed at any time to adapt the requirements of the chemical reaction. One type of reactor consists of a stainless steel base containing small scale milled channels covered with anodically bonded Pyrex glass. Another type of reactor has a base of anisotropically etched silicon, and is also covered with anodically bonded Pyrex glass. The glass window allows visual observation of the initial phase interface of the two educts in the reaction channels by optical microscopy and does not affect, in contrast to infrared spectroscopy, the Raman spectroscopic signal for detection of the reaction kinetics.\n\nOn the basis of a test reaction, we present non-invasive and spatially highly resolved in-situ reaction analysis using Raman spectroscopy measured along the reaction channel at different locations.\n\n\nIntroduction",

The processing environment is likely to drastically change; this is because of significant reductions in surface area/volume ratios that imposes limitations on heat transfer rate, sensitivity to mixing, and different time of addition and removal of products. 306 Figure 20 summarizes the typical time ranges of characteristic mixing, heat transfer, and liquid space time (reactor volume divided per volumetric flow rate) for different reactors used in academia and industry (shake flask, flow reactors, microreactors, stirred-tank reactors). During the transition to the large-scale reactors, mixing and heat transfer become several orders of magnitude slower. While this imposes little or no consequences for slow reactions, which can be scaledup in a relatively straightforward manner, 303 for fast reactions the extended time necessary to mix phases in a large-reactor results in limited chemical availability of each reactant leading to suboptimal outputs.",

The main assumption when using a physical model is that the reaction kinetics follow the law of mass action; this states that the rate of an elementary reaction is directly proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. 91 Written simply, this relates the order of a chemical species within an elementary step to the number of molecules reacting within that step. For the reaction shown in eq 2 (where x 1−3 are chemical species and α/β/γ are their stoichiometric coefficients), based on the law of mass action, the reaction rate can be described by eq 3 and therefore eq 4.

When amplification occurs at variable domains and times, such a phenomenon is referred to as space/time stochastic. As an example of a space/ time deterministic phenomenon, amplification occurs at a certain domain in a solution, on the vessel surface, or even in a homogeneous solution, and examples are described in Section 6.\n\nAmplifications of chemical reactions derived from subtle perturbations and fluctuations are described in the following sections. Thermal hysteresis in Section 2 involves the product deterministic and time/space deterministic phenomena. The stochastic chiral symmetry breaking described in Section 3 involves the product stochastic and space/time deterministic phenomena. The deterministic chiral symmetry breaking described in Section 3 and the shortcut in reaction in Section 4 involve the product deterministic and space/time deterministic phenomena. Homogeneous−heterogeneous transition described in the Section 6 involves the space/time stochastic phenomena.\n\nIn this article, chemical reactions are defined for both covalent and noncovalent bond cleavage and formation with structural changes of molecules. The approach is reasonable because both are described by the same principles of thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, and transition-state theory. In addition, biological systems employ a diversity of chemical reactions involving the cleavage and formation of noncovalent bonds, including those between proteins and those between proteins  \n\n\nACS Omega\n\nPerspective and small molecules. The reaction energies for both processes can be comparable, as previously described for the dissociation of the homo-double-helix of a sulfonamide helicene oligomer: ΔH = +267 kJ/mol, ΔS = +0.75 kJ/mol, which are comparable to those of the dissociation of methyl iodide: ΔH = +237 kJ/ mol, ΔS = +0.12 kJ/mol. 43 Therefore, it may not be unreasonable to treat the cleavage and formation of covalent and noncovalent bonds as chemical reactions.\n\n\nCHEMICAL SYSTEMS INVOLVING TWO",

XVIII: Excess molar enthalpies for the (1-alkanol + cyclohexylamine) systems at 298.15 K and modellingOver the last years, we have conducted a systematic research on mixtures containing amines, and, particularly on 1-alkanol + amine systems.This class of solutions is very interesting since they show rather different behaviours.For example, mixtures with linear or primary amines are characterized by strong negative deviations from the Raoult's law as it is demonstrated by their large and negative excess molar Gibbs energies ( E m G ) [5][6][7][8][9][10] and enthalpies, ( E m H ), [11-18].Thus, for the methanol + 1-butylamine mixture at 348.15 K and equimolar composition, E m G = -799 J.mol -1 [6] and for methanol + 1-hexylamine system at 298.15 K and x1 = 0.5, E m H = -3200 J•mol -1 [11].These results reveal the existence of strong interactions between unlike molecules [11,12,18], which are even stronger than those between 1-alkanol molecules, and that lead to the formation of complexes as solid-liquid phase diagrams reveal [19,20].In contrast, 1-alcohol + aniline mixtures show positive deviations from the Raoult's law as it can be seen from the following results for the ethanol system at 298.15 K and equimolar composition: E m G = 515 J•mol -1 [21] and E m H = 360 J•mol -1 [22].Up to now, we have provided volumetric [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30], calorimetric [31][32][33], phase equilibria [10,34], viscosimetric [27][28][29] and permittivity [27][28][29][30][35][36][37] data for binary mixtures formed by 1-alkanol and any of the following amines: linear primary or secondary amines, N,N,N-triethylamine, cyclohexylamine, aniline, benzylamine, quinoline or 1-H-pyrrole.We have also developed detailed theoretical investigations on this type of systems [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44] by means of different",

The critical density, temperature, and pressure are predicted as r c =5.82 g cm -3 , T c = 1774 K, and P c = 1.97 kbar, which agree well with the corresponding experimental values [1], r c (exp) = 5.8 g cm -3 , T c (exp) = 1751 K, and P c (exp) = 1.67 kbar. A large difference between the coexistence curves with and without V mb clearly demonstrates the significance of the many-body interaction. It has been shown [2,3] that the optimized HS diameter is virtually constant, s » 5.6a B , along the coexistence curve.  Table 1 lists the values of the pressure for selected combinations of mass densities and temperatures.

The scaling length determines the width of the cohesion curve that in turn influences on the \"tail\" of the cohesion and parameters of the critical point. The bulk modulus of noble gases strongly depends on density and temperature in the narrow range of these parameters, unlike the majority of metals. Mercury has two crystalline structures at low temperatures and, correspondingly, at least two types of cohesive energy. Calculations of parameters of vapor-liquid phase transition with use of several equilibrium energy and separation values [12] are made. Comparison of the obtained results with experimental data [13] is shown on figure 1: star-experiment; square and circles denote our calculation using UBER with various input values of ∆E, B, and r W SE [7,12]. One can see from figure 1, in spite of the fact that energy minimum values in various calculations are quite close, our calculation data differ strongly enough from each other. In first, it can be explained by that the isothermal bulk modulus for mercury in various crystalline states differs significantly. UBER expression is quite sensitive to scaling length and density change (the equilibrium separation). Secondly, this is still an approximate expression and only precise calculation of the cohesive energy can confirm or improve our hypothesis.\n\nThe obtained results were compared to the experimental data and data of numerical calculations. The unexpectedly quite good agreement with experiment can serve as direct confirmation of the ideas stated in [1] about relation of solid-state parameters with properties of the \"supercritical fluid\" and critical point parameters.\n\nTable 1 .\n1Parameters of rare gases (Ar, Kr, Xe, Ne) for critical parameters calculation and correspondence values of obtained critical parameters. ∆E, eV B, GPa r W SE ,Å l,Å ρ cr , g/cm 3 T cr , K P cr , GPa RefAr",

[5][6][7][8] Under these extreme conditions water molecules pyrolytically cleave to Hc and OHc. [9][10][11] Separate studies report OHc radicals, generated via photolysis of nitrate or methyl nitrite, can react with atomic mercury in both gaseous 12 and aqueous 13 phases as inferred indirectly from kinetic data with the possible formation of HgOHc and/or Hg(OH) 2 suggested. Direct spectroscopic or other evidence for Hg(OH) 2 is sparse; an infra-red spectrum of Hg(OH) 2 deposited on solid neon and argon at 5 K has been reported 14 and is thought might play a role in the transport of inorganic mercury through lipid bilayer membranes. 15,16 Metallic mercury at room temperature is immiscible with water. However, within tens of seconds of exposure to ultrasound sonication, a grey 'cloud' of particles is seen emanating from the mercury-water interface into the aqueous phase. [17][18][19][20] The particles in the resulting mercury emulsion sediment within hours but do not re-merge with the bulk metallic mercury. Herein, we investigate the redox behaviour of the insonated mercury-water system, so as to generate OHc via acoustic cavitation, and the possibility of Hg(OH) 2 formation. In particular electrochemical methods evidence Hg(OH) 2 in the solution phase which gives a voltammetric signature distinct from Hg 2+ or Hg 2 2+ .\n\n\nExperimental\n\n\nChemicals",

It is clear that such a weak attractive force cannot account for the observed G-L critical temperature, T c = 0.151 eV, of fluid mercury. When many Hg atoms aggregate to form a cluster, however, the strength of each bond is enhanced and the bond length decreases, due to the configuration mixing between the ground and excited (6s6p) electronic states [5][6][7]. Consequently, the potential energy function 1 ( ,,) N V rr L of an N-atom system cannot be written simply in terms of the diatomic potential V dimer (r), but an additional contribution arises from the many-body potential m b1 ( ,,) N V rr L ; that is, \n\nwhere r i denotes the positional vector of the ith atom. Figure 1 illustrates the values of V mb (z, r nn )/N computed for various configurations of clusters and bulk crystalline solids, each characterized by the coordination number z and the nearest-neighbor distance r nn . We find that the many-body interaction is attractive (V mb < 0); its magnitude is enhanced significantly due to a large 6s-6p mixing as the number of nearest-neighbor atoms increases. Although a crude linear interpolation has been adopted in the regime 4.3 £ z £ 8, we note that a similar abrupt change in the cohesive energy has been detected in Hg N clusters for 30 < N < 100 [8].\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\nMany-body potential per atom plotted as a function of z and r nn .

In the fluid variational theory, only the correlation functions for the reference hard-sphere (HS) fluid are needed to perform the statistical averages [2,3]. For given atomic number density n and temperature T, the Helmholtz free energy f per atom in units of k B T may thus be formulated as [2,3] ()  (2) Here, h º pns 3 /6 is the packing fraction with s denoting the HS diameter, f HS (h) refers to the free energy of the HS fluid in the Carnahan-Stirling approximation, g HS (r) represents the radial-distribution function of the HS fluid [10], and f 6 (h) is the soft-sphere correction. Within the excluded-volume approximation, p HS (z) may take on the form [2,3] p HS (z)={12!/[z!(12-z)!]}h z (1-h) 12-z ; the radius r max of the first-coordination shell has been set as r max = 1.176s by imposing a constraint that the maximum value of z should be 12. The average coordination number is then given as z =12h. The distribution function H HS (r nn ) has been evaluated with the aid of the conditional pair-distribution function for the HS fluids [11].

First, elemental mercury itself, by its own chemical properties, should be close to other noble metals, whose solubility is 2 orders of magnitude lower, demonstrates duality of behaviour and causes a relatively high the ability to oxidize. Secondly, as we see (Fig. 1), it is in the high-temperature region, when Hg(0) begins to absolutely prevail over the oxidized forms and the lg m -1/T dependence becomes an extremely simple linear function. and the solubility of mercury near room temperature does not give this dependence, that is, the concentration is too high compared with a linear law, which is associated with the appearance of already analytically significant quantities of oxidized forms of mercury, compared to Hg(0). So, using our data on the solubility of Hg(0) in a reducing environment [10] and tabulated data on vapor pressure over liquid mercury, it is easy to calculate the Henry's constant (Fig. 2), as standard fugacity [11].",

The theory incorporates ab initio diatomic potential energy curves and an additional many-body potential describing the associative interaction of an atom with its neighbouring atoms forming a local temporary cluster. The experimental gas-liquid coexistence curves are accurately reproduced without introducing empirical adjustable parameters. The gas-liquid transition is dominated by the many-body interaction, which becomes strongly attractive as the average coordination number increases and the local electronic states change from nonmetallic to metallic.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFluid metals undergo metal-nonmetal (M-NM) and gas-liquid (G-L) transitions when expanded at high temperatures and pressures [1]. The phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of mercury, a representative fluid metal, have been accurately measured through intensive experimental studies during these 40 years (for a review, see [1]), whereas first-principles microscopic theories accounting for those phase transitions have not been established yet. In this paper, we present an equation of state for expanded fluid mercury that can predict the G-L coexistence curve accurately on the basis of the quantum-mechanical interatomic interactions [2,3]. We shall thereby show that the G-L transition is controlled essentially by the attractive many-body interaction associated with temporary cluster formation in the fluid.\n\n\nTheory\n\n\nMany-body interaction",

This solution, is to be poured, when cool, into two measured ounces of alcohol, in a glass basin, and gently warmed, it soon begins to effervesce and evolve ethereal vapors, and if the action is too violent, it must be quelled by cooling the vessel, or by the addition of a little cold alcohol. During this action, a yellow-grey precipitate falls, which is to be immediately separated, by decantation and filtration, washed with small quantities of distilled water, and carefully dried at a heat, not exceeding 100?. The above quantity of mercury, yields about 120 grains of the powder when the operation has been most successful. If the product, is mixed with metallic mercury, it may be purified by solution in boiling water from which it is deposited in silky, acicular crystals.\" \"This compound, when heated to about 300?, explodes, with a bright flame; it also detonates by friction, by the electric spark, and by contact of concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids; the gases evolved by its explosion, are carbonic acid, nitrogen, and the vapors of mercury.

COMPUTATIONAL METHOD\n\nThe melting temperature calculations presented here will be based on the Lindemann melting criterion 11 . This model, based on the harmonic approximation, predicts that melting will occur when the root mean square displacement reaches a certain value (generaly about 1/8th) of the mean interatomic distance. Numerically,\nT m = Cv 2/3 Θ 2 D(2)\nAlthough reasonable at first sight, this model has several defects. The assumption of harmonical forces discards the bond breakage occurring in melting, and it does not take into account the liquid phase. On the contrary, both the liquid and solid phases are related to the melting temperature and its evolution with pressure via the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Nevertheless, given the success various forms of the criterion have had (see e.g. 10 ), it is certainly interesting to test it in sodium and its characteristic melting curve.\n\nIt is not very wise to take the meaning of the constant in equation 2 very seriously, so the Lindemann criterion will be used here as a single-parameter model. Being interested in using the least possible external knowledge, the free constant C can be calculated from a single point. Then, working out the evolution of T m requires the knowledge of T m (0 GPa) and the evolution of Θ D . Another approach, more useful to compare equation 2 with experiment, would be a least squares fitting of C to the experiment. However, the authors are more interested in using the least amount of parametres than in checking how good the fit of equation 2 is.",

One, the average wavelength of the phonon vibration at the Debye temperature corresponds to the length of the unit cell. Two, the phonon vibration at the melting temperature is in self-resonance with the lattice vibration of the surface atomic/molecular layer. Three, the phonon wavelength ratio of the Debye and the melting temperature does not be affected by the pressure. Four the pressure reduces the anharmonic part of the vibration. The relevant equations are derived and tested against the experiments of sodium with positive result.\n\nAlkali metals have a simple structure and exhibit nearly free electron behavior at low pressure; however, the behavior of these metals become quite complex at high pressure [1][2][3][4][5][6] . The same behavior pattern is true for melting. At low pressure the reported melting curves of In order to describe this unusual behavior of the melting curve of alkali metals Kechin 13 proposed to add a dumping function to the Simon equation as:\n( ) ( ) p D p F T m = .(2)\nwhere F(p) is the Simon equation for the rising part and D(p) is a dumping function. The equation is then:\n( ) 0 p m p c b 0 m 0 m e a p p 1 T T − −       − + = .(3)\nwhere a, b, and c are constants characteristics of the substance. The equation reproduces the melting curves of halides but the good fitting requires adjusting three parameters which are -2 -characteristics of the substance. Ab initio molecular dynamics calculations have also been used successfully to reproduce the trend of the curve 14 and the melting curve 15 . The standard ab initio approach ex. 16, 17 is complicated and expensive. In order to overcome the complexities, simple criterions are suggested here to define the pressure effect on the melting temperature. Using these criterions the relevant equations are derived and tested against the experimental melting curve of sodium.",

These melting temperatures have been measured in the course of a wide variety of synthetic and physico-chemical studies, and represent data gathered over a 67 year time period. The value reported most often in the literature and in reviews is 505 K, which is also that reported in the early work of Kendall et al. (32) and Fischer et al. (13). The fact that many recent investigations (ostensibly using carefully-prepared, pure materials) report values considerably less than this is a bit disturbing and is not easily explained. A critical evaluation of these data leads us to recommend a value of 507 K as shown in Table 4. Table 4. The recent differential scanning calorimetric data of Gardner and Preston (45) suggests that the previously reported values may be high. Their data, and further calculations, lead us to recommend a value of AftjSjonH°m(298.15 K) = 13.2 kJ-mol.

Duration of the Experiment.-A refinement in measuring the time of an experi ment was introduced. The vapour-pressure tube was filled to a pressure of about 50 mm. with argon, freed from the last traces of reactive gas by bubbling slowly through hot sodium. The time when the discharge leapt the alternative spark gap was taken as the start of an experiment, and at the finish argon was let in to stop effusion. In this way the error in time measurement was reduced to a very small amount even for short runs.\n\nThe results are given in Table III. The coefficient of log T in Ladenburg and Minkowski's equation (4) was obtained by assuming the atomic heat of the liquid to be constant at 7 • 3 over the whole range. The measurements of Griffith show that the atomic heat, like that of mercury, decreases with rise of temperature. The coefficient of log T in equation 3 was found by taking the mean atomic heat over the range from the melting point to the boiling point (39, 40), according to an extrapolation of Griffith's results.",

This high density clearly indicates a higher abundance of at least one heavy phase, of which metallic iron is by far the most plausible candidate given its high abundance in the bulk solar composition. Thus, it has long been recognized that Mercury must have a metallic iron-rich core that makes up a larger mass fraction than the cores of the other terrestrial planets (Siegfried and Solomon, 1974). The existence of a (partially molten) Fe-rich core was also suggested by the Mariner 10 discovery that Mercury has an internal magnetic field (Chapter 5), though an active dynamo was not required to explain the limited magnetic field data returned by that spacecraft.\n\nDespite the implied high ratio of iron to silicate in the bulk composition, ground-based observations of Mercury have long suggested relatively low amounts of FeO in surface silicates.\n\nFor example, near-infrared spectral absorption features associated with FeO in the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene are commonly seen in lunar and asteroidal reflectance spectra but are weak or absent in Mercury spectra. Pre-MESSENGER spectral measurements (summarized in Chapter 8) generally indicated that surface silicates contained no more than ~3-5 wt% FeO, and possibly much less. Comparison of mercurian spectra with lunar spectra led some researchers to conclude that Mercury's surface may be rich in anorthositic rocks (dominated by the plagioclase mineral anorthite, CaAl2Si2O8) like the lunar highlands and thus might have high Al and low Fe contents (McCord and Adams, 1972;Blewett et al., 1997).",

First of all, it can be observed that individual electrons diffuse more rapidly for systems with larger overall density.This is nothing else but the well-known trap-filling effect 17,43 and a simple numerical demonstration of the fact that diffusion coefficients are Fermi level dependent in thes kind of systems.In Fig. 2 the diffusivities are plotted versus overall electron density in a log-log graph.It is observed that the RWNS simulation results fit very well to eqn (18).Thus, slopes of 1.88 and 3.47 are obtained for T 0 = 900 (see Fig. 2) and 1400 K (not shown), respectively.According to (18) these should be 2 and 3.67.Note that in real units, D 0 B a 2 L /t 0 and, for a L = 2 nm (N t = 1.25 Â 10 20 cm À3 ) and t 0 = 5 Â 10 À13 s, D 0 = 8 Â 10 À2 cm 2 /s.\n\n\nDiffusion coefficients vs. Fermi level",

Nanosystems having size approaching the fundamental scale of microscopic length have fundamentally demonstrated new physical phenomena. New advances have been made in many basic and modified fields of nanophysics, including diluted cold gases, carbon nanotubes, graphene, magnetic nanostructures, composite nanoparticles, transport through coupled quantum dots, spin-dependent electron transport phenomena, optical arrays with doped nanoparticles, and electronic, molecular, and quantum information processing. The pseudo-Gaussian potential proves to be a reliable model for defects in nanostructures or a bulk material itself. It can easily model the vibrational levels of such a nanostructure based on the fact it has a finite levels of energies, as shown in different papers as [6,7], despite of harmonic oscillator with an infinite one. Moreover, change of number of levels is possible by manipulation of some parameters, and also it permits dissociation with the energy in the continuum. Heterostructures can be used for advanced electronic devices (for example, modulated field effect transistors, heterojunction bipolar transistors, and resonant tunneling devices), optical components (e.g., waveguides, mirrors) and optoelectronic devices and structures (for example, laser diodes, photodetectors). These are also crucial in many optoelectronic devices (e.g., lasers). Perhaps their most important technological aspect may be that they can be used for all these electronic, optical and optoelectronic purposes and, therefore, can allow the integration of all of them. The scattering method of investigation can be found in any area of physics even in astrophysics [8].\n\n\nPseudo-Gaussian oscillator model",

It is important to note that both the quantum and classical mechanics treatments for electron-surface interactions give the same size scaling. 67,[72][73][74] Figure 1(a) shows example spectra of single gold nanorods recorded by Rayleigh scattering measurements. 63 The two panels show spectra from samples with different average widths (8 and 14 nm), and the three spectra in each panel are three different particles. The lengths of the nanorods were adjusted so that the two samples had the same aspect ratio. [63][64] The spectra are broader for the narrower rods, which is due to increased electron-surface scattering. Analysis of this data yields estimates for and A. 63 The nanorods in these experiments were coated in surfactant, which means at Γ has contributions from the adsorbed molecules as well as the metal surface (see below). Measurements for different sized particles show that the LSPR lifetime is ≤10 fs, and that radiation damping dominates over the non-radiative processes for nanoparticles with diameters larger than 20 nm. 56,67 This is shown in Figure 1(b), where a plot of Γ Γ ⁄ is presented in for Ag and Au nanospheres in water. In this figure Γ Γ ⁄ was calculated through σ σ ⁄ where the extinction cross-section σ is the sum of the absorption and scattering cross-sections (σ = σ + σ ), and the cross-sections are evaluated at the peak of the plasmon resonance.",

The models are assessed regarding their description of vapor-liquid equilibria where such information is available in the literature. In 1981, Jorgensen [9] presented a rigid ethanol model based on transferable intermolecular poten-tial functions (TIPS). TIPS consider the methyl and methylene groups as single Lennard-Jones sites, centered on the carbon nuclei and a single Lennard-Jones site centered on the oxygen nucleus accounting for the dispersion and repulsion of the hydroxyl group. Point charges are located on the hydroxyl hydrogen and the bonded oxygen nucleus. The charge located on the methylene group is chosen to achieve overall neutrality of the molecule. That model was developed to yield reasonable structural and energetic results. Subsequently, Jorgensen investigated the effect of internal rotation in the ethanol molecule about the carbon-oxygen bond [10], regarding the structure and hydrogen bonding and compared the results to X-ray data for the solid and to ab initio molecular orbital calculations.",

The TraPPE-UA was extended to alcohols [4] which gives to our knowledge the most accurate existing ethanol model for vapor-liquid equilibria. It was found that this model yields vapor pressures, saturated liquid densities and heats of vaporization with mean unsigned errors of about 8, 1 and 1 %, respectively.\n\nSince polarazible molecular models are computationally very expensive, only few ethanol models of that type are available. The polaraziable intermolecular potential function (PIPF) proposed by Gao et al. [23] is based on the reparamerization of the OPLS-AA plus isotropic point polarization on each atom. That model was developed to yield better results for heat of vaporization and density. Another polarizable model is that from González et al. [24]. It is based on the OPLS-UA and consists of only one isotropic point polarizability on the (pseudo) oxygen atom. Delhommelle et al. [25] showed for pentane and hydrogen sulfide that polarizable models can give better predictions of mixture vapor-liquid equilibria. The molecular interaction and geometry of the resulting model is described in the following.\n\n\nNew ethanol model",

The results of these measurements were used to calculate excess molar volumes and isobaric thermal expansion coefficients, and partial molar and apparent molar volumes and excess isobaric thermal expansion coefficients were subsequently derived. The excess molar volumes were correlated as a function of the mole fraction using the Redlich-Kister equation. Temperature dependences of the Redlich-Kister coefficients are also presented. The partial molar volumes at infinite dilution of AEEA in water were determined using two different methods. In addition, the solution density was correlated using a Joubian-Acree model. Aqueous solutions of AEEA exhibit similar properties to the aqueous solutions of other alkanolamines (like monoethanolamine) used in acid gas sweetening.

The charge transport properties in organic molecules strongly depend upon factors such as intermolecular electronic couplings, electron-phonon interactions and structural defects. As a result, the measured charge-carrier mobilities can vary over several orders of magnitudes as a function of sample quality. While significant efforts have been devoted to the molecular level understanding of factors affecting the charge carrier mobilities in organic semiconductors, the design of high mobility organic materials is still driven by empirical experiments which is partly due to the lack of a unified theoretical treatment of charge transport in organic semiconductors. In ultra-pure organic single crystals, charge transport at low temperature can be described in the framework of band transport mechanisms [261]. The transfer integral and electron-phonon coupling are two key parameters that determine the charge transport mechanisms (band or hopping transport) in organic semiconductors. The transfer integral is directly related to the bandwidth, and the electron-phonon coupling can alter electronic band structures. As the temperature is lowered, the electron-phonon coupling is decreased, and correspondingly, the mobility increases. Hence, the temperature dependence of charge carrier mobility (µ ∝ T −n , n typically varies between 0.5 and 3) can be used to test whether band transport occurs in organic semiconductors. Figure 12 shows the electron and hole mobilities in ultrapure naphthalene as a function of temperature. The decrease in mobilities with temperature for electron and hole clearly indicates the band-like transport. Although the majority of the experimental observations [262][263][264] indicate negative temperature dependence of mobility in the 100-300 K range, it is argued that the band and delocalized picture are inconsistent with the analysis of experimental data which reveals a mean free path of charge carriers of the same order of magnitude of the unit cell at room temperature [265]. Troisi et al. recently proposed that the charge transport mechanism in organic semiconductors at room temperature is neither band-like nor a combination of thermally activated hopping and band-like [238]. Computational investigations show that for many organic semiconductors, the fluctuation amplitudes of the transfer integral are comparable to the transfer integral itself. Under this circumstance, the translational symmetry of the electronic Hamiltonian is",

Expanding the exponential factors in Equation (9) and evaluating the integral analytically leads to the Bixon-Jortner formula for the charge transfer rate [258]. In the high temperature limit, Equation (9) recovers the Marcus formula (Equation (8)). Although the FGR incorporates the nuclear tunneling effect, it is still based on a perturbative approximation. The generalized nonadiabatic transition state theory (GNTST) [259] based on the Zhu-Nakamura nonadiabatic transition probability [260] provides a powerful tool to evaluate the charge transfer rates from weak to strong coupling. Simulation results show that the GNTST-calculated hole mobility of oligothiophenes single crystal is three times as large as that from the semiclassical Marcus theory, which can be attributed to the quantum nuclear tunneling and nonperturbative effects [259].",

This method can characterize the crossover from band-like transport to hopping transport in molecular crystals, and the calculated charge-carrier mobilities were found to compare well with experiments on ultrapure naphthalene crystals across the whole experimental temperature range. However, Merrifield's transformation is applicable only in the small polaron regime, and the non-local electron-phonon coupling was not included in this approach. More recently, a theory based on nonperturbative evaluation of the Kubo formula for the carrier mobility [252,253] has been put forth, showing several improvements including the elimination of low temperature singularity that often appears in theories based on narrow-band approximations and the temperature dependence and anisotropy of carrier mobility. Following up the Munn-Silbey transformation method, Zhao and coworkers [228,254] devised a self-consistent routine to determine the optimal transformation coefficients. Improved results have been obtained on the temperature dependence of transport properties in an extended Holstein model incorporating both local and non-local electron-phonon coupling.\n\nDisorder models: The chemical and physical impurities found commonly in organic materials make it imperative that the description of charge transport in organic crystals must take into account the effect of disorder. As disorder tends to inhibit band-like charge transport, it can then be described by hopping mechanism with charge carrier migrating between interacting molecules. For amorphous conjugated polymer films, the disorder can be classified into diagonal and off-diagonal types with the former being induced both by electrostatic effects and a distribution of the effective conjugation length while the latter arising from the relative separation and orientation between neighboring molecules [248].",

Transmittance and reflectance measurements can be used to calculate the absorption coefficient, a = − 7 8 9:; < / , as a function of wavelength. From the absorption spectrum, the low-frequency cutoff is typically fit to estimate the band gap using the Tauc relation (aℎ ) 9/C , where = 1/2 is assumed for allowed direct transitions and = 2 is assumed for allowed indirect transitions. Such fits are often ambiguous depending on the selected energy range, which is not standardized and depends on the discretion of the researcher. Band-to-band transitions typically occur in semiconductors for absorption coefficients of approximately 10 4 cm -1 , so the cutoff is usually drawn around this value as an alternative method to estimate the optical absorption threshold without asserting the band gap. Thus, it can be very difficult to conclusively determine from Tauc plots whether a material has a direct or indirect band gap, and to accurately estimate indirect band gap for which the optical transition probability is usually low. In addition, researchers should be aware that transmittance and reflectance are thickness dependent measurements, leading to different accessible dynamic ranges of absorption coefficient measurements. It is important to keep this in mind when interpreting Tauc-derived experimental band gaps and comparing reported values for samples with very different thicknesses.",

When 12 01 σ σ > , the sample presents a decrease in the effective absorption as the excited state is populated (SA). On the other hand, if 12 01 σ σ < , the sample becomes more opaque, characterizing a RSA process. The occurrence of SA or RSA depends on the contribution of different electronic states, excitation wavelength and pulse width. For the Q-band region (660 nm for instance), the model gives a 12 σ of approximately zero, which leads to a SA that follows the absorption band, due to the population accumulated in the first excited state. Right below the Q-band (600 nm), SA does not follow the linear absorption. At 600 nm, for example, the theoretical fitting was obtained with 12 σ = 0.5x10 -18 cm 2 , which is smaller than 01 σ (SA). Around 530 nm, RSA was observed with 12 σ = 10x10 -18 cm 2 , which is about four times higher than 01 σ . A similar behavior in six distinct wavelengths was observed by Unnikrishnan et al. (Unnikrishnan et al., 2002), even though they used much longer pulses (nanoseconds). Furthermore, due to the ultrashort pulses regime employed here, no triplet state is being populated and only the singlet state contributes to the observed RSA.

It is thus highly desirable to develop a comprehensive theory of charge transport in organic crystals in the presence of static disorder. Disorder tends to trigger localization in highly ordered materials, and charge transport can be described through the hopping process whereby charges transfer from donor to acceptor. The well-known Marcus [239] expression for semi-classical electron-transfer rates is usually used to predict the charge hopping rates in organic semiconductors [240,241]. Although the Marcus theory greatly aids the understanding of the structure-function relationship in organic molecular crystals, it treats nuclear motion classically and assumes weak electronic coupling between donor and acceptor states. In organic semiconductors, environmental phonons include both intramolecular and intermolecular vibration modes, which often posses high frequency characteristics. Thus, more general theories beyond the semiclassical treatment for the environment need to be developed in order to correctly describe the quantum mechanical aspects of the charge transfer process [242]. Furthermore, when the electronic coupling between donor and acceptor states is strong, the Marcus theory always predicts the rates to increase with the square of electronic coupling due to its perturbation approximation, in stark contradiction with the adiabatic suppression effect with diminishing rates when the electronic coupling is large enough [243]. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the Marcus theory, several approaches beyond the perturbative and semiclassical approximation have been developed [244][245][246][247]. We next proceed to outline the main characteristics of the two models for explaining the charge transport mechanisms in organic semiconductors, i.e., the polaron and disorder models [248]:",

The ΔG IT becomes negative under light illumination; this drives the flow of the electrons from the CB to VB via the interfacial transfer (IT) that simultaneously induces a photocatalytic effect, as shown in Figure 2. It means that the ΔG IT is the thermodynamic driving force of photocatalysis, and the G of the excited state of a semiconductor is the thermodynamic potential of photocatalysis. Therefore, it can be known that, although organic oxidations are downhill in thermodynamics, their occurrence in a photocatalytic way is not spontaneously allowed but needs a thermodynamic potential; this is different from thermocatalysis. Under an equilibrium state, ΔG IT becomes 0 according to the mass action law. The IT of electrons thus cannot happen in this case, as is photocatalysis. Therefore, heat cannot drive a reaction to happen in a photocatalytic way no matter how high the temperature is. The large difference between heat and light in their energy is not the intrinsic reason to distinguish their roles in photocatalysis, so the number of charge carriers do not determine the thermodynamics of photocatalysis. The attribution of dark catalysis to the heat-induced charge carriers is incorrect. 24 Then, could heat affect the role of light in thermodynamics?

A quasiparticle named the 1D Holstein polaron was introduced to account for exciton-phonon dynamics in molecular crystals. Although this theory has been widely used to qualitatively interpret experimental data, including temperature dependent band narrowing effect as well as the crossover from bandlike to hopping transport with increasing temperature, it is based on a perturbation theory and thus limited to the case of very narrow electronic bands and local (diagonal) exciton-phonon coupling. Theories based solely on the original Holstein model cannot fully describe the transport mechanisms in organic molecules, and more general models are needed to consider both local and nonlocal (off-diagonal) exciton phonon coupling. An attempt towards this direction was made by Munn and Silbey [226,227] to describe electronic coupling as well as local and nonlocal electron-phonon interactions of arbitrary strength over a wide range of temperatures. The nonlocal coupling was found to increase polaron binding energy and influence its bandwidth. In contrast to the local coupling which always narrows the bandwidth, the nonlocal coupling can introduce new minima and broadening to the band shape depending on the specific microscopic parameters [228][229][230][231][232][233][234]. Furthermore, the nonlocal coupling increases scattering and leads to a reduction of the band-like contribution to the charge transport. Based on the Holstein-Peierls-type Hamiltonian, Bobbert and coworkers presented a microscopic charge transport theory [235,236], which can reproduce the experimental electron and hole transport properties in naphthalene using microscopic parameters obtained from ab-initio calculations. However, this model only considers the coupling of electron to the optical modes and neglects the contribution of intramolecular modes. Recently, mixed quantum-classical (quantum for electrons and classical for vibration) non-adiabatic dynamics has been proposed by Hultell and Stafstrom [237] as well as Troisi and Orlandi [238] to investigate the intricate band-like and hopping charge transport mechanisms in organic semiconductors. With the vibrational modes treated classically, this theory remains valid only for the cases in which the thermal energy is larger than the average phonon frequency. It becomes clear that a complete understanding of charge transport in organic",

First, electron/hole pairs are photo-generated when the semiconductor is illuminated by light with an energy equal or greater than the material's bandgap, which leads to excitation of electrons from the valence (VB) to the conduction band (CB). While recombination of electron/hole pairs can occur in the bulk, a fraction of the generated electrons and holes migrate, in a second step, towards the surfaces of the catalyst, where they can, in a final step, initiate reduction and oxidation reactions respectively. However, these reactions can be driven by the photo-generated electrons and holes only if the reduction and oxidation potentials of the targeted reaction lie within the CB and VB of the material, respectively. According to the relative position of the VB and CB and the redox potential of specific reactions, it is possible to identify different types of catalysts: i) strongly oxidative semiconductors with sufficiently positive VB potentials to produce OH radicals such as SnO 2 , BiVO 4 , TiO 2 , WO 3 (see left side of Fig. 1), that are promising candidates for the photo-degradation of organic pollutants; ii) strongly reductive catalysts with CB position more negative than the hydrogen evolution and CO 2 reduction potentials, such as Cu 2 O, Bi 2 Se 3 , SiC, and Si (see right side of Fig. 1), which are promising semiconductors for solar-fuel production under visible light; and iii) materials with VB/CB potential more positive/negative than the H 2 /O 2 evolution potentials that are suitable to catalyze the overall water splitting reaction (see pink shaded area in Fig. 1) 3 .",

The Under an applied field, a bound exciton can dissociate into a free electron and a hole in the first continuum band, which may contribute, for example, to photoconductivity [26]. The exciton field dissociation rate determines the bound exciton lifetime and results in the broadening of the E 11 absorption peak. At high fields, we can determine the bound exciton dissociation rate by fitting the E 11 absorption from the Bethe-Salpeter equation solution to the Fano lineshape. The results of the fits are shown in Fig. 4 by the black squares. When the broadening becomes less than 1 meV, this procedure can no longer be used. For smaller fields, we determine the lifetime by calculating the tunneling probability of the bound exciton into the free electron-hole continuum, from the leaking of the exciton wavefunction away from the central region. The exciton wavefunctions for different fields are shown in Fig. 5. We calculate the tunneling probability from the wavefunction weight at an electron-hole separation larger than 50 nm [27]. To convert the tunneling probability into the decay rate, we need to know the \"attempt\" frequency for tunneling. From the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, an averaged momentum of the bound exciton is p = 2π /λ, where λ is the exciton size. According to the virial theorem, the exciton binding energy E b is proportional to the kinetic energy E k ≈ pv/2, where v is an averaged velocity. In 3D case, E b = E k , and, therefore, one would expect, in the case of nanotubes, an attempt frequency v/(2λ) to scale with E b /(2π ).",

We define as the exciton dissociation field F c the field at which the first Franz-Keldysh peak coincides with the E 11 exciton energy. At the same time, the \"transparent\" region between the first two oscillatory peaks broadens and the first absorption minimum moves towards higher energies above the zero-field bandgap edge ∆ 11 . Above the second E 22 exciton (not shown in Fig. 1a), the second band-to-band absorption above the second bandgap ∆ 22 also shows Franz-Keldysh modulations. However, the absorption coefficient does not go to zero at energies below ∆ 22 , because the first band contributes to the total absorption in that region. The spectral weight growth of the band-to-band absorption with the electric field is due to the bound exciton wavefunction mixing with the first band-to-band continuum, which leads to spectral weight transfer from the excitonic peak to the latter. As a result, the overall oscillator strength of the first band-to-band absorption grows as much as 400% before the excitonic peak starts to overlap with the tail of the first Franz-Keldysh oscillatory peak. This corresponds to the field strength of about 1/3 of the critical field F c required for the full exciton dissociation. Upon exciton dissociation the oscillator strength is being transferred to the band-to-band absorption, which is increased from its zero-field value by 10-20 times. The field dependence of the Sommerfeld factor, defined here as the fraction of the band-to-band oscillator strength, is shown in Fig. 2 and it can be well fitted by  κs, κ b , and α in Eq. 2, 3, 4.

In bulk 3D semiconductors the binding energy is small and most of the theoretical and experimental focus has been on the field induced absorption in the region below the bandgap and on the quantum confined Stark effect in 2D structures [13].

The results of the exciton diffusion length deduced from fluorescence and from photocurrent were compared. The latter appeared to depend on the choice of electrode, but it was found that consistent results could be obtained by the use of alkaline electrode solutions. The resulting exciton diffusion length was in the region of 30 nm and was consistent with values obtained from fluorescence studies. The exact value depended on the method of preparation of the crystal and the orientation measured. Higher (but unreliable) values were obtained for nonalkaline electrode solutions, which was attributed to charge generation not only occurring at the surface (as assumed in the exciton diffusion model) but also at deeper centers such as oxygen molecules and hydrogen ions penetrating from the (acidic) electrode solution into a thin layer of the crystal next to the electrode. Photocurrent studies were applied to study the effect of introducing dopants on exciton diffusion and to study other materials, obtaining a diffusion length of 29 nm for tetracene and 10 nm for β-perylene.\n\nGhosh and Feng 105 also derived diffusion equations and used photocurrent excitation spectra to study exciton diffusion. In their case, they studied a solar cell consisting of a layer of merocyanine in between aluminum and silver contacts. The main differences from the earlier work are the materials studied, the contacts used, and the fact that the built-in potential of the contacts rather than an applied external field was used to extract charge. Using the spectrum from 440 nm to longer wavelengths, an exciton diffusion length of 6 nm was deduced. The same approach was used by Bulovic and Forrest 106 to study excitons in 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA). Two distinct excitonic features with different diffusion lengths were reported. One was assigned to a selftrapped charge transfer state with a diffusion length of 225 ± 15 nm; the other was a triplet with a diffusion length of 88 ± 6 nm.",

The situation changed dramatically in the 1950s to 1960s, when the basic architectural elements of nucleic acids and proteins were discovered and when the nascent discipline of molecular biology aimed to understand the structure-function relationships in enzymology and the metabolic processes essential for life. This motivated structural biologists to attempt the targeted crystallization of enzymes, membrane proteins, tRNAs and supramolecular assemblies. However, given the multiparametric nature of the crystallization process and the difficulty in obtaining these compounds in the gram amounts required for the existing crystallization methods, it was rapidly realised that the growth of X-ray compatible crystals was a limiting factor. Thus, the current batch and dialysis methods were scaled down and vapour-diffusion and interface-diffusion methods were invented (Table 1). At the same time, new purification technologies were developed. Together, these allowed crystallization assays in the 10-50 ml range, so that projects could be started with amounts of protein in the 1-100 mg range. However, the success rate of crystallization (i.e. the number of successful trials compared with the total number of trials) was poor, and in practice increasing numbers of trials and much larger amounts of proteins were required. Furthermore, for most crystallized proteins the time between the first crystal and resolution of the three-dimensional structure was long, and could reach several years. As a result, only a few structures had been solved by 1980, corresponding to <0.1% of the presently deposited structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\n\nBetter crystallization methods and still a bottleneck",

Overcoming the obstacles posed by these problems promises to contribute more, in all likelihood, than advances in any other aspect of the structural genomics process. It is the fervent hope of the editor and the authors of this compendium that these papers will offer the novel ideas, strategies, and engineering applications that may point the ways to assured success.\n\nThe papers in this volume may be classified according to four broad categories, though clearly, the multidisciplinary nature of the crystallization process invites much overlap and integration. There are four papers that deal with the physical theory, physical-chemical phenomena, assumptions, and available data pertinent to understanding in a quantitative manner the crystallization process as it applies to proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. These are the papers by Chernov, Garcia-Ruiz, M€ u uhlig et al., and McPherson et al., though important contributions to this area are found as well in the paper by Wilson.\n\nThere are four eminently practical papers by Bergfors dealing with crystal seeding, Hanson et al. with cryocrystallography, Wilson with light scattering, and Dale et al., who address the question of genetically engineering proteins to better crystallize. There are three papers that might be cataloged as dealing with troublesome or emerging areas of macromolecular crystallization. One of these is by Caffrey, who focuses on membrane protein crystallization, principally from lipid matrices, and another is a comprehensive and insightful review of the unique problems presented by nucleic acid crystal growth from Golden and Kundrot.

In these crystals, components of the reagent mixes were almost entirely responsible for creating and maintaining the lattice. Intermolecular interactions involving dGMP with RNase A and mellitic acid with bovine trypsin were extensive and dominant. Although interactions were principally hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions were also important, as in the RNase A structure.

The experiments encompassed 18,240 individual crystallization trials, using sitting drops, deployed manually.\n\n\nResults\n\nThe success of the experiments were measured according to two fairly rigorous criteria, a statistical analysis of the number of macromolecules crystallized as a function of reagent cocktail, and the ability of certain cocktails to cause the crystallization of a protein when all others, or most others failed.We termed the latter feature a measure of the cocktail's ''silver bullet'' potential for a specific protein or virus.The statistical analysis revealed a number of interesting clues, which suggested those types of compounds that might be most generally useful.Of particular significance was the finding that the use of reagent cocktails more than doubled the number of proteins that could be crystallized under the two basic conditions utilized, when compared with those two conditions free of any small molecules.",

Ultimately, all macromolecular structures may be classified and cataloged according to polypeptide folds. Once all, or most, of the folds which are utilized by nature are known, then this will provide predictive insight, based primarily on amino acid sequence, of the structures and functions of unknown proteins. The sequences of many proteins from a wide range of organisms are now being defined on a broad front through massive sequencing efforts, such as the human genome project, carried out in both the public and the private sectors. Extension of these genome projects to the three-dimensional structural level of the proteome is the next logical step. Indeed, this effort, under the broad rubric of structural genomics, is now well under way.\n\nAt present, and in the foreseeable future, the only technique that can yield atomic-resolution structural images of biological macromolecules is X-ray diffraction analysis as applied to single crystals. While other methods may produce important structural and dynamic data, for the purposes described above, only Xray crystallography is adequate. As its name suggests, application of X-ray crystallography is absolutely dependent on crystals of the macromolecule, and not simply crystals, but crystals of sufficient size and quality to permit collection of precise diffraction data. The quality of the final structural image is directly determined by the perfection, size, and physical properties of the crystalline specimen. Hence the crystal becomes the keystone element of the entire process and the ultimate determinant of its success.\n\nWhen crystallizing proteins for X-ray diffraction analysis, one is usually dealing with pure often exceptionally pure macromolecules, and the objective is to grow only a few large, perfect crystals. It is important to emphasize that while the number of crystals needed may be few, often the amount of protein available may be severely limited. This in turn places grave constraints on the approaches and strategies that may be used to obtain those crystals. While new methodologies such as synchrotron radiation and cryocrystallography have driven the necessary size of specimen crystals consistently downward, they have in no way alleviated the need for single crystals of high perfection.",

Protein crystals had been observed as early as 1840 but a key breakthrough for structural biology was made in 1934 when Bernal and Crowfoot photographed clear X-ray diffraction patterns using crystals of the digestive enzyme pepsin that, critically, had been maintained in a humid environment by sealing them in fine glass capillary tubes rather than allowing them to dry out. For the first time, protein crystals were observed to diffract X-ray beams through large angles, which meant that ultimately it should be possible to work out the protein structure at atomic resolution. This was as much a conceptual advance as a technological one. It helped to demolish colloidal theories that envisioned proteins as loose heterogeneous aggregates because the order within the diffraction pattern inferred that the pepsin molecule had a clearly defined conformation (Bernal and Crowfoot 1934). In other words, there was a structure for crystallographers to go after.\n\nfigure 1 Protein crystallography: (a) detail of the X-ray diffraction pattern from a protein crystal, (b) an electron density map, with accompanying atomic model of a protein molecule.

While GMP300 bound in the purine-binding site reflects the accepted binding of a nucleotide phosphate, the GMP200 most certainly does not. The fact that it is a nucleotide is essentially irrelevant. The important features are its ability to bind to the protein by improper insertion of the guanine ring into the pyrimidine pocket, the ability of the guanosine base to hydrogen bond to the 5 0 phosphate of the GMP300 and the ability of its 5 0 phosphate to make good hydrogen-bonding interactions with a 3 1 symmetry-related RNase A molecule.\n\n\nHen egg lysozyme\n\nThree experiments involving lysozyme illustrate how small molecules can assist in the establishment of crystal lattices. The tetragonal form of hen egg lysozyme is readily obtained from NaCl solutions of 0.6-1.6 M, but not from PEG solutions. In experiment I-4, tetragonal lysozyme crystals were grown from PEG in the presence of a reagent mix containing six components. Of these, one in particular, p-aminobenzoic acid, was readily identified in difference Fourier maps. The p-aminobenzoic acid, as shown in Fig. 3, is bound at the leading edge of the known binding cleft of one lysozyme molecule, but also makes extensive contacts with a second protein molecule in the lattice. The amino-acid residues involved are Gly22, Ser24 and Thr118 of one molecule and Arg114 of another. Some hydrogen bonds are through water molecules to the proteins, but the intermolecular nature of the p-aminobenzoic acid binding is evident.",

While the latter is thought to be linear and branched assemblies, polymers of a sort, the liquid phase is characterized by high protein density, which approaches that of the solid state, by promiscuous, non-specific intermolecular interactions, by molecular mobility within clusters of molecules, and a frequently transient existence.\n\nBiomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses, are lyophilic (liquid loving) colloids. In concentrated salt solutions, due to screening by ions, long-range electrostatic repulsion is diminished and the macromolecule's behavior is dominated by short-range attractions. As a consequence, phase diagrams with ''hidden'' gasliquid phase boundaries, for example, have been delineated for g-crystallins [1], and for lysozyme [2,3]. This may be pertinent to crystallization, because theoretically, and experimentally it has been shown that the nucleation rate of a crystalline phase occurs more readily in the vicinity of a gasliquid critical point.\n\nA phenomenon that we have frequently recorded using atomic force microscopy (AFM) was the appearance of large multilayer stacks of growth steps, and small microcrystals on the surfaces of growing STMV, canavalin, lysozyme, catalase and thaumatin crystals [4][5][6][7][8][9]. Examples of these are seen in Fig. 2. Multilayer stacks are not crystalline in solution, but appear to arise from volume elements of liquid protein phase that sediment upon and adhere to growing crystal surfaces. Once in contact with a substrate crystal, the liquid phase transforms into crystalline, multilayer stacks of growth steps as directed by the underlying lattice. The multilayer stacks form by ordering of the liquid phase from bottom to top, layer after layer [10,11].\n\nAn important question however, continues to be the role of the liquid phase in the initial formation of crystal nuclei in solution in the absence of a preexisting solid, crystalline phase. Nucleation of two-dimensional islands and multilayer stacks on crystalline surfaces does, after all, occur by similar processes and according to the same principles, as does three-dimensional nucleation in solution.",

These tend to call into question, we believe, some ideas currently under consideration.\n\n(1) Broide et al. [1] demonstrated that a liquid phase of g globulin, produced by lowering temperature at high protein concentration, was stable. It gave rise, over a long period of time, to neither crystals nor precipitate. (2) In the examples of Fig. 1  All of these observations seem somewhat inconsistent with the idea that the liquid protein phase mediates or promotes nucleation; growth yes, but no evidence for nucleation. There is, however, an additional observation which is: (5) Crystals are seen to nucleate on the surfaces of the liquid phase droplets, oils, or PEG protein rich droplets, and they always grow outward into the exterior (low concentration) protein containing medium, not inward into the (high concentration) protein rich phase.\n\nThe important point here is that crystals nucleate on the surface of the liquid protein phase, at the interface between the liquid protein and exterior medium. This suggests that perhaps the most important feature of the liquid protein phase is not its high internal protein concentration or its molecular fluidity. Its salient quality, as far as nucleation is concerned, may lie in the structure and physical properties of the interface it forms with other materials or fluids. Indeed, there are numerous examples in the literature of both conventional and macromolecular crystals, where surfaces or interfaces of various sorts provide crucial sites for nucleus formation. The phase boundaries discussed here may be yet another example.\n\nIt is easy to see with the unaided eye that 1% Jeffamine 2000 or PEG 4000 alone produces an emulsion of, presumably, polymer rich droplets suspended in a 50% saturated solution of ammonium sulfate or other salts. Ray showed that protein concentrates in these droplets. It may well be, however, that it is the surface of this ''quasi'' liquid protein phase that is responsible for the nucleation.",

The unit cell was previously unreported (space group P3 1 21, unit-cell parameters a = b = 138.39, c = 150.94 Å ) and the structure therefore had to be solved by molecular replacement and refined prior to calculation of difference Fourier maps. Cycles of manual rebuilding and refinement were required as the model was developed. A complete description of the structure determination and analysis will be presented elsewhere, but features of the structure particularly relevant to the questions at hand are appropriate here.\n\nThe asymmetric unit consists of eight independent molecules of bovine trypsin, which form a multihelical arrangement about the crystallographic threefold screw axis of the unit cell. Every trypsin molecule has a distinctive tightly bound benzamidine molecule in the S1 pocket of the active site (Ascenzi et al., 1984). The disposition of the benzamidine and its interaction with the active-site residues is exactly as observed previously in other crystal forms of the inhibited enzyme. The benzamidines are entirely associated with individual protein molecules and make no intermolecular contacts. The same is seen for the benzamidine molecules that occupy the active sites of the porcine trypsin structures described below.\n\nThe trypsin superstructure is maintained almost entirely by mellitic acid molecules, as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), which are disposed at the contact points between trypsin molecules. These were readily identified by their distinctive electrondensity masses, which appeared eight independent times in the asymmetric unit. As seen in Fig. 6(b), each mellitic acid is heavily engaged in hydrogen bonds with two trypsin molecules. Two carboxylate groups on one side of the ring interact with one trypsin molecule, while two carboxylate groups on the other side of the ring interact with a neighbor. Two opposing carboxylate groups of each mellitic acid are not utilized in the intermolecular interactions and form hydrogen bonds with water.",

Thus, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding how to crystallize proteins in the laboratory [1]. In the last decade, colloid scientists have contributed significantly to this enterprise [2]. By treating globular proteins in a coarse-grained manner, it turns out that certain regularities, such as the existence of an optimal 'crystallization window', can be rationalised [3]. Initially, the simplest possible model was used -complex protein molecules were reduced to perfect hard spheres with isotropic, short-range inter-particle attraction. Subsequently, more realistic models begin to appear. For example, the 'stickiness' can occur in patches (either regular [4] or random [5]). On the other hand, the study of proteins can give new insights into problems in colloid science, such as the existence of finite, equilibrium clusters in charged, attractive particle systems [6]. Thus, the intellectual traffic between the study of protein solutions and colloidal suspensions has proved fruitful for both sides.",

Compared to these more celebrated examples, in vivo protein crystallization has been relatively neglected: we know of only one attempt to provide a general survey (see the last chapter in [1]). One of the reasons for this relative neglect is that in vivo protein crystallization is perceived to be an atypical behaviour, and for good reason: protein aggregation and crystallization would normally be expected to be deleterious to the cell. Indeed, the difficulty of crystallizing proteins in vitro may reflect precisely the 'negative selection' that has occurred in vivo over evolutionary time scales against easily crystallizable variants [9].\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a review of in vivo protein crystallization from the perspective of colloid science. Unlike other articles in this journal, many of the references will necessarily not be 'current' in the chronological sense -some of the first examples of in vivo protein crystals go back nearly a century or more. However, we hope that the topic is of significant current interest. Understanding in vivo protein crystallization, and perhaps how cells have evolved to avoid it in the main, may be an area that is ripe for contributions from colloid scientists. We organise the examples reviewed according to the putative biological functions of the protein crystals in vivo.\n\nIn the concluding discussion we seek to draw together some elements of commonality between different kinds of in vivo protein crystals, between in vivo and in vitro protein crystallization, as well as point to some of the interesting differences.\n\n\nProtein storage\n\nPerhaps the most 'obvious' use for protein crystals in vivo is for storage, either temporarily, with a view to future utilization or excretion, or as a mean of permanent sequestration. This section gathers examples of this kind.\n\n\nSeeds",

Once the sequence of the macromolecule to be studied has been identified and characterized by bioinformatics analyses, the sequence corresponding to the gene of the macromolecule is cloned in an expression vector and produced classically in a bacterial organism (typically Escherichia coli). The macromolecule is then extracted from the bacterial cells and purified using chromatographic techniques. The prerequisite for the next step is to obtain a concentrated 2 (of the order of tens of grams per liter) and highly pure sample (greater than 98%) of the macromolecule.\n\nThe next bottleneck is based on physical chemistry, specifically crystallization which addresses concepts such as solubility of molecules and their transition from soluble state to a solid crystalline ordered state [8]. This step, built on statistical screenings plays with the variation of parameters such as temperature, pH, concentrations of biological macromolecules, as well as nature and concentration of crystallizing agents and various additives [9]. Obtaining a single homogeneous crystal, that result to high quality diffraction data, represents a crucial step in the process of determining a macromolecular structure. In order to increase the success rate, crystallization robots are used today to screen more than several thousands of parameters. The size (from tens to hundreds of microns) and the morphology of the crystals are highly variable (Figure 4) and are not necessarily related to their diffracting power and quality. \n\n\nThe diffraction data",

Difference Fourier maps showed two prominent features. The first was a chain of density partly filling and emerging from the active-site cleft of one molecule and terminating at the surface of a second. This was very near the position of the p-aminobenzoic acid in the experiment above. It appeared to be involved in intermolecular interactions. The chain of density, however, did not have a shape that correlated well with any one of the components of the reagent mix. We concluded that multiple components of the 'cocktail' are likely to bind within the active-site cleft, but that they are largely disordered and hence unrecognizable in electron-density maps.\n\nThe other major feature in the same difference Fourier map is a single ring-shaped mass of density with three protrusions separated by about 120 around the ring; this fitted well with trimesic acid. The density, with a trimesic acid molecule superimposed, along with associated protein model is shown in Fig. 4. The trimesic acid molecule is tightly sandwiched at the interface of three lysozyme molecules and is in contact with residues Asn27 and Ser24 of one protein molecule, Arg114 and Lys33 of a second molecule and Arg73 of a third.

Not all these sequences exhibit archetypical protein like behavior-folding rapidly and reproducibly under physiological conditions to their native state structures. 6 This is typically described in terms of two phases, the unfolded and folded, separated by a first-order transition, with the implicit meaning described above. Interestingly, protein structures are frequently tolerant to changes in amino acid sequence with mutations often causing only modest local changes in structure. 7 Remarkably, the total number of distinct protein native state folds is limited and only of the order of a few thousand. 8 This follows from the fact that native state folds are made of building blocks of tightly curled helices and strands assembled into almost planar sheet-like motifs. The number of distinct topologies in which these motifs can be assembled is limited. 9,10 The existence of these secondary motifs follows from two independent considerations: scaffolding provided by hydrogen bonds 11,12 ; and the steric requirement to avoid atomic overlaps. 13 Flory 1 wrote in 1969, Synthetic analogs of globular proteins are unknown. The capability of adopting a dense globular configuration stabilized by self-interactions and of transforming reversibly to the random coil is characteristics peculiar to the chain molecules of globular proteins alone. We note however that modern chemistry has made the engineering of synthetic analogs of globular proteins possible. The model proposed here provides a route for creating synthetic analogs of globular proteins and provides a bridge between polymer science and biomolecular science.\n\nWe begin with a standard classic homopolymer model. The linear chain comprises N main chain spheres of diameter σ in a railway train topology with, for simplicity, the distances between the centers of successive monomers set to be exactly b. To avoid spurious symmetries, we allow for the overlap of adjoining spheres (σ ≥ b). Symmetry plays a key role in determining the phases of matter. For example, sensitive liquid crystal phases 14 form when a collection of spheres is replaced by a collection of anisotropic objects such as pencils or ellipsoids.

However, the determination of the function of these proteins has been slowed by the difficulty of determining their crystal structure by standard X-ray crystallography. A major problem is that it is difficult to grow good quality protein crystals. Experiments have clearly shown that this crystallization depends sensitively on the physical factors of the initial solution of proteins. An important observation was made by George and Wilson [2], who showed that x-ray quality globular protein crystals only result when the second virial coefficient, B 2 , of the osmotic pressure of the protein in solution lies within a narrow range. This corresponds to a rather narrow temperature window. For large positive B 2 , crystallization does not occur on observable time scales, whereas for large negative B 2 , amorphous precipitation occurs. Rosenbaum, Zamora and Zukoski then showed [3] that crystallization of globular proteins could be explained as arising from attractive interactions whose range is small compared with the molecule's diameter (corresponding to the narrow window of B 2 ). In this case the gas-fluid coexistence curve is in a metastable region below the liquidus-solidus coexistence lines, terminating in a metastable critical point.\n\nWhen a system undergoes a phase transition the change in the Gibbs free energy ∆G consists of two terms -an enthalpy change ∆H and and an entropy change ∆S, with ∆G = ∆H − T ∆S. The change in the Gibbs free energy must be negative in order for the transition to occur. The enthalpy change is negative because in the separated state the more dense phase has a larger number of contacts and therefore its contact energy is lower. However, the dense state has a lower entropy and its entropy change is also negative. These two terms compete and at low temperatures the free energy change due to particles going from the dilute phase to the dense phase is negative and phase separation occurs.\n\nHowever, above some temperature the entropy loss exceeds the enthalpy loss, so that the change in the Gibbs free energy is positive and phase separation does not occur.",

Beyond the transforming impact that three-dimensional structure has had on fundamental research in biochemistry and biology, macromolecular structure has proven to be of formidable value in biotechnology as well. Here it has provided the essential knowledge required to apply the strategy of structure-based drug design to the creation and discovery of novel drugs and pharmaceutical products. It serves as the basis for powerful approaches now being utilized in small, emerging biotechnology companies as well as major pharmaceutical enterprises to identify lead compounds to treat a host of human ailments, veterinary problems, and crop diseases in agriculture.\n\nOf equal importance to biotechnology, but which also requires knowledge of three-dimensional structure, is the genetic engineering of proteins. Although recombinant DNA techniques provide the essential synthetic role that permits modification of the proteins, structure determination supplies the analytical function.

At Vo < 10 kV there is a sharp increase in Type I signal (Joy, 1984). In addition R at 1 kV is only about 2% of that at 20 kV and so the area of sample from which Type I1 secondaries are produced is substantially smaller. As the backscatter coefficient diminishes only slightly with voltage, the number of Type I1 electrons may still be significant (Niedrig, 1978;Reimer, 1979, Fig. 8;Kotera et al., 1981). There have been few attempts to produce high resolution SEM images using beam energies near 1 kV because of the electron-optical constraints mentioned in the Introduction and discussed in the next section, so it is still not certain that, on the finest scale, LVSEM has any clear advantage. On the other hand, results at somewhat lower resolution show a clear increase in the contrast of small details (Fig. 3) and so there is reason to expect that the same will hold if LVSEMs with smaller probes can be made. \n\n\nSpecimen charging in the LVSEM",

To simplify the situation, we can replace E in Eq.(2) by a mean energy loss, given approximately [31] by E m ~ 6.75Z where Z is the atomic number of the scattering atom. For a uranium atom and E 0 = 200 keV, E m ~ 620 eV and Eq.(2) then gives L(E m ) ~ 0.15 nm. In the present context however, this value may be an overestimate because the number of secondaries eventually created as the result a primary energy loss E is more closely related to the stopping power E(dσ/dE).

However, in contrast to neutrons, these lighter, charged particles can be deflected in electric and magnetic fields and so it has proved possible to configure electromagnets to act as lenses that can focus electron beams. Combinations of such lenses to create microscopes raised direct imaging in biology to a new level of resolving power in the 1940s and 1950s (Masters 2009). Modern transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), the type of instrument most commonly used to examine biological samples, accelerate electrons through voltages of 200 kV or more, which gives them a wavelength of around 2 pm, or 0.02 Å, far smaller than the 1.4 Å diameter of a carbon atom. In theory, this should provide images of spectacular resolution. In reality the technique falls far short, though from the beginning it easily out-performed light microscopy by producing images of cell interiors with features as fine as 200 Å (20 nm) (Masters 2009).\n\nThe loss of resolving power is due in part to the imperfections of electromagnetic lenses -the best ones are comparable to 'using a the bottom of a Coca Cola bottle as a magnifying glass' (Williams and Carter 2009). But it also arises as a result of the damage inflicted on biological samples by the beam, which means that the illuminating doses of electrons have to be kept to a INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS, Vol. 40 No. 3, September 2015 minimum, a constraint that makes for noisy, low-contrast images (Masters 2009). Electron micrographs are grainy and monochrome and, to the untutored eye, somewhat reminiscent of the images beamed back to Earth from planetary probes before the advent of high-resolution digital photography (Figure 3a). There is also another price to pay for the resolution gains of EM: because of the strong interaction of electrons with matter, electron microscopes require high vacuums to prevent scattering of the beam by air molecules, an environment not well suited to the study of living systems. Only samples that are dried or preserved by cryo-cooling can be examined.",

It was found that the image contrast of biological objects could be improved by the combined effects of spherical aberration and image defocus, moving the image plane away from exact focus. 63 The basis for the contrast enhancement is that spherical aberration combined with defocus induces a phase shift between scattered and unscattered electrons.

By limiting the total variation reduction subject to the similarity between the input and output images, contrast due to the signal, such as molecule edges, is preserved. The total variation solution is formulated as a co-minimization problem as shown in the following equation:\nu = min u [D(u, g) + lV(u)] ,(2)\nwhere u is the denoised image, g is the noisy image, λ is a weight parameter, D is a difference function, and V is a total variation function. The weight parameter determines the preference for more strongly reducing pixel variation or preserving the original image.

Several modifications have been proposed with adjustments to D, V, or the minimization method. But in all cases, the essence captured in equation (2) remains, where the total variation in the denoised image is reduced subject to fidelity to the original image. The Chambolle method uses a projection algorithm based on a dual formulation and is solved with gradient decent, while the Bregman method uses an operator splitting method (Duran et al., 2013). More details can be found in their respective papers (Chambolle, 2004;Osher et al., 2005). Gaussian downsampling can be applied before denoising to resample the image to a proper sampling frequency where, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem (Jerri, 1977), the pixel edge length should be 2.3-3 times smaller than the point-to-point resolution of the microscope. Prior to resampling the image to a larger pixel size, a Gaussian filter is applied with an appropriate kernel size to eliminate image frequencies higher than the Nyquist cutoff frequency of the resampled image. The effects of downsampling can be seen by comparing the third and fourth image columns in Figure 3. The results may appear to be insignificant upon visual inspection, but this is often an important first step. All denoising algorithms are applied to both the original and downsampled datasets for comparison.\n\nOpen-source code and a standalone application to apply Chambolle denoising to TEM images and video frames are available at https://github.com/JStuckner/smart_preprocess.\n\n\nResults and Discussion",

They were first listed for the SEM by Oatleyet al. (1965, pp. 215-217). They can be lumped into four areas: (1) low source brightness, (2) increased effect of chromatic aberration, (3) increased susceptibility to stray fields, (4) interactions between the beam and the signal ,-ollection field. Though these problems and their solutions sometimes interact, they will be treated separately below.\n\nBrightness of thermionic sources at low voltage It was early recognized that source brightness was the practical limit on the performance of an SEM with a heated tungsten source (Broers, 1974(Broers, , 1982. In principle, the effect of spherical or chromatic aberration on spot size can be minimized by reducing the acceptance angle of the final lens, a, until the lens becomes diffraction limited. However, in instruments with conventional tungsten sources, the image becomes too noisy for convenient use long before 01 is reduced to the diffraction limit.\n\nThe brightness ( p) of a thermionic electron source is limited by the Langmuir Equation (Langmuir, 1937) for small a.\n\nwhere jc, = current density at the source surface in amps/cm2, T= source temperature in K, and Vo = beam voltage in volts.\n\nFrom equation (1) it follows that low Vo operation will produce reduced brightness, but in practice the brightness actually obtained is even lower than we might expect from (1) because this equation is only valid in the absence of space charge near the cathode surface. Such space charge shields the cathode from the accelerating field and further reduces p. Though a given gun geometry may be virtually free of space charge effects near its highest operating voltage (20-30 kV) (Broers, 1974;Oatley, 1975), the fields present at the filament surface are proportionately less at 1 kV and the gun brightness will be limited by space charge unless the geometry is changed.",

Electron Sources. The standard electron source is a tungsten filament heated to 2000À3000°C. At this temperature, the electron energy is greater than the work function of tungsten. The thermally emitted electrons are accelerated by an electric field between the anode and filament. Another common electron source is a LaB 6 crystal, which produces electrons from a smaller effective area of the crystal vertex whose emitting surface is at a lower temperature because of a lower work function. This beam has higher coherence and current density. At present, the most advanced electron source, used in high performance microscopes, is the field emission gun (FEG). 59 The FEG beam is still smaller in diameter, more coherent, and ∼500Â brighter, with a very small spread of energies. 59 This is achieved by using single  crystal tungsten sharpened to give a tip radius ∼10À25 nm, as compared to 5À10 μm for LaB 6 crystals. The tip is coated with ZrO 2 , which lowers the work function for electrons. Thermally emitted electrons are extracted from the crystal tip by a strong potential gradient at the emitter surface (field emission), and then accelerated through voltages of 100À300 kV.",

F À1 {sin γ} defines the shape of the image of a point in the object plane formed by the microscope optics, the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope. Therefore, the real image is distorted, because the ideal object image is convoluted with the PSF, and is not directly related to the density distribution in the original object. To restore the image, so that it corresponds to the projected electron potential of the sample, the image must be corrected for the effect of contrast modulation by sin γ, the microscope phase contrast transfer function (CTF). The CTF, modified by an envelope decay, and the PSF of a microscope are related by Fourier transformation. For weak phase objects, deconvolution with the PSF of the microscope is necessary for complete restoration of image data. The procedure of eliminating the effects of the CTF is called CTF correction.\n\n3.4.1. Determination of the CTF. For a given microscope setup, the voltage and spherical aberration are constant, but the defocus varies from image to image because of variations in lens settings, sample height, and thickness. There are two main approaches for determination and correction of the CTF. In the first one, the images are CTF-corrected before structural analysis. In the second approach, structural analysis is done separately on each micrograph, and determination and correction of the CTF are performed on the structures obtained.

Second, interestingly, this technique cannot work when the underlying object is a 2D image (rather than 3D, as in cryo-EM). In this case, the Fourier transform of the tomographic projection (which is a 1D function in that case) is a line that goes through the origin of the 2D Fourier space of the underlying object. Therefore, the single common point of any two projections taken from different angles is the origin, and, thus, there is no way to find the relative angle between them.

For phase objects, the sine term of eq 10 has the major influence. It describes an additional phase shift due to spherical aberration and changes in the image contrast depending on defocus. The major effect of the CTF on images of weak phase objects arises from oscillations of the sin γ term that reverse the phases of alternate Thon rings in the Fourier transform of the image 64 ( Figure 9). For thin cryo specimens, the amplitude contrast for 120 keV electrons has been estimated at 7%, whereas for negatively stained samples the amplitude contrast can rise to 25%. 53 For 300 keV cryo images, it drops to ∼4%. 65\n\n\nPhase Plates and Energy Filters\n\nThe very small phase shifts induced by biological samples in the scattered electrons result in poor image contrast. In phase contrast light microscopy, the imaging of phase objects is enabled by the use of a quarter-wave phase plate, 66 which produces visible contrast by shifting the phase of the scattered light relative to that of the transmitted beam by 90°, leading to constructive interference ( Figure 10a,b 67 ). An equivalent solution for electron microscopy was pioneered by Boersch. 68 An early attempt to create a device to change the phase of the central beam relative to the scattered rays was done by Unwin, who devised a simple electrostatic phase plate that was inserted into the optical system. 69 He used a thin poorly conducting cylinder (a spider's thread) over a circular aperture inserted in the back focal plane of the objective lens (where the electron diffraction pattern is formed). This cylinder partly obstructed the central beam and became charged when illuminated by the electron beam, thus creating an electrostatic phase plate. The first experiments with negatively stained samples clearly demonstrated increased contrast.",

The interaction between a molecular sample and the laser beams takes place between the first two plates of the lens stack (commonly known as the repeller and extractor electrodes). A recent upgrade to this setup -necessitated by the VUV experiments described in Section V -has involved coating the inner surfaces of these electrodes with a thin layer of a conductive material based on carbon nanotube arrays. This material is almost completely optically dark in the UV/VUV region and dramatically reduces background scattered light signals (which scale with 1/l 4 and so becomes increasingly problematic when moving to shorter wavelengths). Photoelectrons generated during sample ionization are guided along a short flight tube before hitting the imaging detector, where positional information is then recorded by an externally mounted CCD camera. By carefully tuning the ratio of voltages applied to the repeller and extractor, velocity map imaging (VMI) conditions may be realized, 30 eliminating any spatial ionization volume effects and enhancing image resolution.",

Multiple scattering of electrons within thick specimens obscures the relation between object and image. There are several factors that affect the appearance and contrast of an EM image including lens aberrations, limited incident beam coherence, quantum noise because of the discrete nature of electrons (shot noise), radiation stability of the sample, instabilities in the microscope, and environment, for example, vibrations, stray electromagnetic fields, temperature changes, and imperfect mechanical stability of the EM column. Instabilities and limited coherence of the electron beam cause falloff of the signal transfer by the microscope for fine image details, leading to blurring of small features. In simple terms, a sharp dot will not be imaged as a dot but as a blur. The link between the original dot and its image is described by the point spread function (PSF) of the imaging device, in our case of the electron microscope. The PSF is a function that describes the imperfections of the imaging system in real space. However, a convenient way to describe the influence of these factors on the image is to use Fourier (diffraction) space:\nFfΨ obs ð r B Þg ¼ FfΨ sam ð r B Þg 3 CTFð R BÞ 3 EðR BÞ ð 7Þ\nwhere F{Ψ obs } is the Fourier transform of the observed image; R B is spatial frequency (Fourier space coordinate); F{Ψ sam } is the Fourier transform of the specimen; CTF(R B ) is the contrast transfer function of the microscope; and E(R B ) is an envelope function. E(R B ) describes the influence of various instabilities and specimen decay under the beam. 62 The envelope decay can be partly compensated by weighting, for example, with small angle scattering curves (see section 8.3). The optical distortions are usually approximated as a product of functions attributed to individual damping factors (e.g., lens current instability). The link to the PSF is given by the following equation:\nFfPSFð r B Þg ¼ CTFð R BÞ 3 Eð R BÞ ð 8Þ",

This will be followed by a description of both the instrumentation problems associated with operating the SEM at high resolution with VO z 1 kV and the strategies that have been developed or proposed to overcome these problems. A prototype instrument designed to produce a 1-2 nm beam at 1 kV will be described.

The average relative deviations between the theoretical predictive values and the NIST data ranging from the temperatures of 300 to 6000 K are 0.053, 0.95, and 0.070%, respectively, for the entropy, enthalpy, and reduced Gibbs free energy of CO 2 . The present predictive expressions exhibit satisfactorily accuracies and simple and straightforward characteristics and are away from the requirements of plenty of experimental spectroscopy data. The methodology developed in our work opens up a new pathway serving as constructions of accurate and efficient analytical expressions of thermodynamic properties for other triatomic substances such as water and hydrogen sulfide. It is expected that the present predictive models could aid the design and optimization of CCS processes. Figure 2 shows that CO 2 is a centrosymmetric linear molecule and possesses symmetric stretching, antisymmetric stretching, and bending vibration modes. However, as a diatomic molecule is consisted of two atoms, it merely possesses a kind of stretching vibration. Hence, addressing vibrations of the CO 2 molecule is much more difficult than treating the vibration of the diatomic molecule such as the nitrogen molecule. Here, we treat the internal symmetric stretching vibration of the CO 2 molecule in terms of the improved Tietz oscillator 61 \n\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHODS",

Callendar, F.R.S.-\nThe energy of a gram molecule of an ideal gas can be calculated from the kinetic theory. From this, by the application of the Maxwell-Boltzmann hypothesis, the molecular specific heats at constant volume, Se, of ideal mon atomic and diatomic gases are deduced to be 3R /2 and 5R /2 respectively at all temperatures. R is the gas constant per gram molecule = 1-985 gm. cal./° C. The corresponding molecular specific heats at constant pressure, Sp, can be obtained by the addition of R.In the case of real gases, which obey some form of characteristic equation other than P . Y = R . T, it can be shown from thermodynamical considera tions that the value of depends upon the pressure, but as the term involving the pressure also includes the temperature, is not independent of the tempera ture but it increases in value as the temperature is reduced. Assuming the characteristic equation proposed by Callendar*, v -b -RT -c (where b is the co-volume, c is the coaggregation volume which is a function of the temperature of the form c = c0(T0/T)w , n being dependent on the nature of the gas), it is easy to show from the relation and, by combining this with the corresponding values of Sw can be obtained.The constant of integration Sp° in the above expression is the limiting value of Sp at zero pressure and at a temperature T, but thermodynamical con siderations alone give no information of the way in which Sp° itself depends upon the temperature. hat oo , n(n-\\-\\ .",

If this is to be achieved, one must have knowledge of the capacity factor for thermal energy that determines temperature and refers only to energy possessed by the gas. As noted above, C V , the molar heat capacity determined under conditions of constant volume, meets this requirement and, for an ideal gas, would not depend on the magnitudes of the state properties at which it is determined. This being the case, the total energy for one mol of such a gas would be given by C V T and finite changes in total energy on a per mol basis by C V ∆T, C V being a constant. Since reversible processes do not expend free energy, C V ∆T for any reversible adiabatic compression or expansion would be equivalent to the change in characteristic free energy as well as to the change in total energy. Thus, if the quality of thermal energy were judged on the basis of the predicted changes in the characteristic free energy of an ideal gas, it would appear to be equivalent to that of nonthermal actual energy. However, as outlined below, a proper assessment of the quality of thermal energy in terms of changes in the properties of a gas can be achieved only by means of the Carnot cycle.\n\n\nThe Carnot Cycle.",

This performance needs experimental data on the O−CO bond energy, O−C equilibrium bond length, and stretching and bending vibrational frequencies in the CO 2 molecule. We consult the experimental data given by Itikawa, 60 and list the required molecular constant values for the ground electronic state of CO 2 : D e = 5.451 eV, r eCO = 1.160 Å, ω es = 1388 cm −1 , ω ea = 2349 cm −1 , and ω eb = 667.4 cm −1 . Taking q = − 10 and employing the experimental data of the five molecular constants D e , r eCO , ω es , ω ea , and ω eb , the predictive values of molar entropy, enthalpy, and reduced Gibbs free energy for CO 2 are produced in terms of eqs 13−15 from 298 up to 6000 K. The predictive results are depicted in Figure 1, in which the green solid lines represent the theoretically predictive results and the blue solid circles refer to the NIST data. 58 From Figure 1, we observe that the predictive values show excellent agreement with the NIST data in the entire temperature range. The average relative deviations of the predictive data from the NIST data in a wide range of temperatures from 300 up to 6000 K for the entropy, enthalpy, and reduced Gibbs free energy are 0.053, 0.95, and 0.070%, respectively. These results indicate that our three predictive models are of very high accuracy to predict the entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy for CO 2 . In our calculations, the reduced molar Gibbs free energy, G r = − (G − H 298. 15 )/T, of CO 2 from the NIST database 58 is 213.8 J·mol −1 · K −1 at 298 K. The molar Gibbs free energy calculated by the aid of eq 20 is −22,901.65 J·mol −1 at 298 K. On the basis of these two values, we obtain the value of 40,810.75 J·mol −1",

If entropy is to be a universal capacity factor, it must be capable of serving as the capacity factor for free energy that is subject to loss by both these means. In the case of convection, the intensive and extensive components of the energy are pressure and volume and the extensive component can be readily expressed in terms of entropy. Thus, for an isothermal (reversible) compression of an ideal gas, the increase in free energy of concentration on a per mol basis can be represented either by −RT ln(V 2 /V 1 ) or by −T∆S, ∆S being equivalent to R ln(V 2 /V 1 ), a negative quantity in the case of compression, indicating a decrease in the entropy of the gas. Of course the reason why the entropy of the gas would decrease in this case is that the thermal energy on which the entropy is based would be located in the surroundings rather than in the gas. Entropy is universalized by using this volume-dependent entropy in a Carnot cycle to define an entropy in terms of the thermal energy possessed by the gas, in which case the free energy that is subject to loss would have temperature and heat capacity as its intensive and extensive components. Since both C V and C P would be constants, any changes in this 'derivative' entropy must necessarily be expressed in terms of changes in the temperature and thermal energy of the gas.",

For enthalpy of vaporization, the present model and the model by Ketko and Potoff also yield comparable results. Note that the parameters for the electrostatic interactions of the model by Ketko and Potoff were adjusted to experimental VLE data as well. It can be summarized that the model by Ketko and Potoff [61] and the present dimethyl ether model are of similar quality and outperform the transferable model by Stubbs et al. [60]. While Ketko and Potoff adjusted four LJ parameters and the point charge magnitudes for their electrostatic interactions, following the proposed modeling strategy an optimization of only two Lennard-Jones parameters was sufficient to reach the same quality. For sulfur dioxide, a molecular model was published by Sokolić et al. [62, 63] which was optimized to total energy and pressure in the liquid state. It was recently reviewed by Ribeiro [64]. Alternatively, the commercial force field COMPASS [65] reports parameters for sulfur dioxide.For the present molecular model, the intermolecular interactions of sulfur parameterized according to the results of QM calculation. The four parameters of the LJ sites, i.e. σ S , ε S , σ O , and ε O , were adjusted to experimental VLE data. All parameters of the molecular model are given inTable 1.307",

However, because complete conversion of a given amount of thermal energy into a nonthermal actual energy would require a decrease in the temperature of the given amount to absolute zero, the potential availability of the work potential of thermal energy is quite limited and that of ambient thermal energy at ordinary ambient temperatures is practically nil.\n\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS OF GASES\n\nThe fundamental aspects of thermodynamics are based largely on energy changes associated with changes in the state properties pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas in accordance with the ideal gas equation: PV = nRT. In consequence, the nature of free energy and its relationship to entropy are best seen by examining the predictions of the laws of thermodynamics in respect to compression and expansion of a gas of this kind. Such will be done here by considering an ideal gas confined within a rigid cylinder of the sort shown in Figure 1. The walls of the cylinder are assumed to be permeable to thermal energy and in contact with a thermal reservoir that is sufficiently large and conductive to validate the assumption that its temperature remains constant despite transmissions of thermal energy between it and the gas. The gas is assumed to be confined to the cylinder and separated from a vacuum by a massless and frictionless piston by which it can be compressed and allowed to expand.\n\nIt is important to note that, since ideal gases and solutes in ideal solution are virtually identical in respect to mechanical thermodynamic properties at normal ambient temperatures and pressures [1], the Figure 1 system is also relevant to the thermodynamics of dissolved substances. Thus, although the kinetics would be much different, the same thermodynamic relationships would apply if (i) the gas of Figure 1 were a solute in ideal solution, (ii) the vacuum were replaced by the pure solvent, and (iii) the piston were selectively permeable to the solvent. If such were the case, the concentration and osmotic pressure of the gas as a solute would correspond to the concentration and pressure of the gas as a gas, and the thermodynamic relationships would be largely independent of the pressure on the solvent within the normal atmospheric range of pressure.",

While all computational techniques used predict these oscillations, the actual values of the band-gap vary strongly with the technique used. Computed DOS spectra and local density of states distributions show that the transition from a 0-D to a 1-D-like spectrum takes place already in very short 5-10 nm tubes. The binding energy of the carbon atoms increases with increasing tube length in a similar manner. The behavior of finite graphene sheets is also investigated. In the carbon nanotube models, the C-C and C-H bond length were fixed at the values observed in bulk graphite 23 which are 1.42 and 1.09Å, respectively. All calculations were performed at fixed geometries without optimization of the atomic structures. The elementary unit used, called here a section, is defined as a single circular plane of carbon atoms that are packed along the length of the nanotube (note: the distance between two consecutive sections in the nanotube is 1.22Å).

Recent scanning tunneling microscope studies have verified the basic conclusions of simple theory 7,8 .\n\nThe above predictions assume a semi-infinitely long tube, and corresponding experimental electronic structure studies have utilized tubes several microns in length. It is very important to know how an additional confinement of the electrons, along the nanotube axis, in finite length tubes will affect the tube's electronic structure. As the tube length is diminished, there should be a transition from a 1-D structure (quantum wire) to a 0-D structure (quantum dot).\n\nCurrently, little is known about the effects of finite length on the properties of carbon nanotubes. Recently, however, Venema et al. 9 have been able to cut nanotubes into segments of a few tens of nanometers length and, using tunneling spectroscopy, obtained evidence of increased band-gaps in these short tubes. Understanding quantum size effects in carbon nanotubes, besides the basic scientific value of understanding a prototypical 1-D to 0-D transition, is essential in device applications of nanotubes. The miniaturization offered by nanotube-based devices requires that not only their diameter but also their length should be in the nanometer range. For example, micrometer-long nanotubes have been used as Coulomb islands in single electron transistors (SET) operating at liquid helium temperatures 10,11 . By using shorter tubes, the operating temperature of SETs can be raised drastically. In general, the electrical properties of nanotubes may be tailored by selecting their length.",

In order to analyze the nature of the energy bands, we performed a series of projections to obtain the local density of states (LDOS), where each molecular orbital was weighted by the contribution obtained from a Mulliken analysis of specific carbon atoms. The general expression used to generate the DOS plots is :\nDOS(ǫ) = N i=1 [ n i ω( π 2 ) 1/2 · exp( −2(ǫ − ǫ i ) 2 ω 2 )] + [ 2n i ω π(ω 2 + 4(ǫ − ǫ i ) 2 ) ]\nwhere ω is the resolution, n i is the population of the level i and (ǫ -ǫ i ) is the energy difference between the energy ǫ and the eigenvalue ǫ i .\n\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTo evaluate the influence of finite length on the electronic properties of the nanotubes, we calculated the electronic structure of different length segments of a (6,6) nanotube. As Figure 1 shows, all computational techniques used predict that, unlike the infinite tube that is metallic, very short (< 100Å) nanotubes have an energy band-gap (E g ).",

In figure 1, we present the ac conductance and the density of states (DOS) of a (10, 10) CNT with 100 principal layers as a function of the Fermi energy at the low-frequency limit.hω is set to be 10 −6 eV. For dc transport, it is known that a series of steps are observable on the conductance versus Fermi energy curves for infinite-length CNTs [5,6,14]. These steps mean that at larger energies, more subbands begin to contribute to the electronic conduction. Therefore, the dc conductance increases step-by-step at the subband edges of the infinite-length nanotubes, where the peaks of the DOS appear. In the finite-length nanotubes, we are still able to identify these steps, but their profile is no longer clear. On the other hand, compared with the ac conductance of infinite-length nanotubes at the low-frequency limit [7], more peaks are observed on the conductance curves. The finding is attributed to the presence of more peaks on the DOS curves of the finite-length CNT. Thus at the low-frequency limit resonant transmission occurs. Our observation of this resonant transmission behaviour is in accordance with that indicated in the dc transport of finite-size CNTs [18]. Figure 2 shows the ac conductance components g c and g d as a function of the Fermi energy at higher frequency. The symmetric centres of the conductance curves for both  the real part (dissipative part) and imaginary part (non-dissipative part) begin to shift from zero. Careful calculation shows that the deviations are exactly half of the value of the ac frequency ω and are independent of the helicities and lengths of CNTs. These deviations are caused by the ac coupling of a CNT with the electrodes. The expression for self-energy shows that photonassisted transport causes the effective Fermi surface to shift from 0 to −ω/2. The symmetric centres of the conductance curves shift accordingly. In figure 3, we present the ac conductance component due to the charge current g c and that due to the displacement current g d for a 100layer (10,",

In the general DOS diagram, the van Hove singularities at high BE are σ-states that originate from C(2s) atomic orbital combinations.The σ-states formed from C(2p) orbitals lie at lower BE between -11 and -4 eV, while π-states extend from -5 to 0 eV. These states are important as they are responsible for the electrical properties of nanotubes. The states above the Fermi level are mainly π * -states, while σ * -states extend above 10 eV. The inset gives an expanded view of the fine structure of the 96Å nanotube near the Fermi energy. In addition, the values of the local density of states (LDOS) near the Fermi energy for sections ranging from the tube boundary (index 1) to the middle of the tube (section 40) are plotted. To construct these LDOS plots, we summed over the density of the twelve carbon atoms contained in that section of the nanotube. Fromfigure 8it can be seen that the LDOS of the π-states near E F hardly changes along the length of the tube, indicating that these states are indeed well delocalized within this short tube.Finally, we shall compare briefly the results obtained with the different computational techniques. As shown inFigure 1, both HF and MNDO-PM3 methods give a large band-gap (9.0 and 6.5 eV, respectively) for a short 4 A nanotube, while DFT and EHMO give moderate band-gap values (2.4 and 1.8 eV, respectively). Due to the poor description of unoccupied orbital energy levels in Hartree-Fock theory, the band-gap values are overestimated by several electron volts for low band-gap polymers 27-29 . The problem is slightly less important in the MNDO-PM3 method, where the parametrization includes a treatment of correlation through the fitting with experimental data",

Not only will it be time-consuming but also quite inaccurate to invert such large dimensional matrices. Here in this work we employ the recursive Green's function technique [8,9] to build them up. With this approach, the dimension of the matrices to be inverted is determined by the helicity of the CNT but not the length. That is, it will only involve 20-dimensional matrix inversion for a (10,10) CNT. Besides, in the recursive approach only a few elements need to be calculated, while in the direct matrix inverting approach every element of the CNT's Green's functions must be calculated. Hence this recursive approach will obviously relax the memory requirements and enhance the computational speed, thus making the calculation for CNTs with various helicities and lengths feasible. From our numerical results, we find that the simulated ac conductance differs significantly from that of an infinite-length CNT. There are many peaks on the ac conductance versus the Fermi energy curves due to the resonant transmission, while the conductance quantization is still observable on the curves. We also show that the finite length leads to an oscillation in the conductance as a function of the ac frequency, and compare our simulation results with the latest experimental reports on this topic. We further investigate the relations between this oscillation behaviour and the CNTs' lengths, helicities and defects. Our results can be used to describe the general features of the ac conductance in finite-length low-dimensional systems.",

As seen from Fig. 2, an absolute value of △χ or (T )/χ or (T ) at all magnetic fields applied to the pristine sample increases with decreasing temperature that has been predicted for IE in the systems characterized by electron-electron repulsion [3,4]. Hence, at B = 5.5 T a transfer from two-dimensional IE correction to three-dimensional one takes place. At lower magnetic field the interaction length L I (T ) = (hD/k B T ) 1/2 is much less than the magnetic length l B = (hc/2eB) 1/2 , which in turn becomes dominant at high field. An estimation of the characteristic lengths gave respectively the value of L I (4.2K) = 130Å (taking into account that the diffusion constant D = 1 cm 2 /s [18]) and the value of l B = 100Å at B = 5.5 T.\n\nTaking into account experimentally apparent crossover (Fig. 2) from twodimensional (equation 2) to three-dimensional (equation 3) of temperature dependence of △χ or (T )/χ or (T ) we concluded that effective diameter of nanotubes was in an interval between 100Å and 130Å. Partitioning of the contributions χ or (T ) and △χ or (T )/χ or (T ) can be carried out in a result of changing of extrinsic carriers by the chemical modification of the prestine sample. In this case the χ or (T ) should be changed [11] and the △χ or (T )/χ or (T ) remain the invariable [3,4].",

The diameter distribution obtained in ref. [13] is at variance with that obtained here, apparently because the statistical weight of individual tube types varies if the JDOS -as in a previous study [13] -or Voigt profiles are used to fit experimental spectra. The probability distribution of the chiral vector map resulting from the above assignment and fit shows a slight preference for armchair tubes. Next, we will attempt a quantitative discussion of observed transition energies by comparison with energies predicted by a refined version [26,13] of the original TB band-structure model [27,28]. The TB calculations used here explicitly include the crucial diameter and chirality dependence of the TB hopping integral γ 0 without which any such comparison would be useless. The refined TB-model leads to more pronounced oscillations of band-gaps with tube diameter than predicted by the earlier zone folding schemes because the latter used to neglect mutual realignment of p z orbitals on the curved graphene sheet. However, the magnitude of γ ∞ 0 , the TB hopping integral for the uncurved graphene sheet, is frequently used as a free parameter and there is no general agreement on the appropriate value that should be used for optical excitations. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of individual SWNTs yields γ ∞ 0 values between 2.45 eV and 2.7 eV [29,30], while an analysis of optical experiments suggest that values between 2.65 eV and 3.0 eV are more appropriate (see, for example, refs.

The current displays a clear variation between maximum (dashed curves) and minimum values (solid curves) for negative bias voltage. Peaks in the differential conductance dI/dV (Fig. 2B) appear at the voltage positions of current steps in the I(V ) curves. The height of the dI/dV peaks varies periodically with position x along the tube axis, as shown in Fig. 2C. The period of these oscillations in the differential conductance is about 0.4 nm, which clearly differs from the lattice constant of 0.25 nm. The periodic variation of dI/dV versus x canas discussed below in detail -be attributed to the electronic wave functions in the nanotube. The wave functions of several adjacent energy levels can be displayed simultaneously by plotting the differential conductance dI/dV as a function of the voltage and the position x along the tube (Fig. 3A). Wave patterns can be observed for 4 different energy levels appearing at bias voltages 0.11 V, 0.04 V, 0.00 V and −0.05 V [15.]. At each level a horizontal row of about 7 maxima is resolved in dI/dV as a function of position x along the tube (see Fig. 3B for the 1D spatial profile of the wave functions belonging to these states). The experimental quantity dI/dV is a measure for the squared amplitude of the quantized electron wave function |ψ(E, x)| 2 [16.]. The curves in Fig. 3B are fitted with a function of the form dI/dV = Asin 2 (2πx/λ + φ) + B, which represents a simple trial function for |ψ(E, x)| 2 . The separation of about 0.4 nm between peaks in dI/dV corresponds to half the wavelength λ, because dI/dV measures the square of the wave function. The wavelengths obtained from the fitting procedure vary from 0.66 to 0.76 nm (Fig. 3B). Other measurements on the same tube reproduced values for λ in the range of 0.65 − 0.8 nm.

Before acid treatment the deviations from the theory were small but after treatment the deviations with the Hagedorn-Jensen method became quite large as will be seen from Table IV. It was for this reason that the hypoiodite oxidation was employed in the majority of cases for the samples after hydrolysis.\n\n\nOptical Rotation\n\nThe rotations were measured on the 76\" samples (previously cooled in ice) by warming them rapidly to room temperature and reading them in a 2 dm. tube with sodium D light.\n\nIn the experiment,s conducted at room temperature samples were placed in 5 Sobotka, H., and Reiner, M., Biochem. J., 24, 394 (1930). 6 Cellobiose standards were also made but this sugar was not used for glucoside experiments.\n\nThe data are given, however, for possible future reference.",

We wish to emphasize, however, that in the case of pentosides, the trityl reaction cannot be regarded as very rigid evidence of structure (as was first demonstrated by Hackett and Hudson') and indeed, it appears probable that the crude \"trityl\" derivative of uridine described by Brederecks is a mixture of a mono-and a disubstituted nucleoside.\n\nFor this reason we continued our work, even after Bredereck's publication dealing with the problem of uridine, and have succeeded in isolating monotrityluridine in pure crystalline form. The uridine acetate was obtained as a pale yellow, flaky, glass-like solid. Yield 15 gm. It was insoluble in cold or hot petroleum ether, ether, or toluene, but soluble in the following solvents in the cold: chloroform, glacial acetic acid, pyridine, acetone, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, and water.",

In experiments conducted at pH values below 9, samples were sealed under argon in quartz tubes (3 mm ID, 4 mm OD). At timed intervals, samples were cooled and diluted 50-fold with D 2 O to which pyrazine had been added as an internal integration standard. Proton NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cold probe. The decomposition of sucrose, trehalose, and glucose was monitored by following the disappearance of the anomeric proton resonances at ∼4.2 ppm, while the decomposition of fructose was followed by monitoring the disappearance of a multiplet 7 at 3.5 ppm. In potassium phosphate (0.1 M, pH 8.1) or potassium carbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 10.3), the decomposition of each of these molecules followed simple first order kinetics to at least 95% completion under all conditions examined.\n\nFor sucrose, trehalose, glucose, and fructose, the rates of decomposition observed at various temperatures yielded linear Arrhenius plots ( Figure 1) with a least-squares regression coefficient of r 2 g 0.97 and n g 7. But decomposition of the reducing disaccharides lactose, cellobiose, and maltose yielded Arrhenius plots that were concave upward, consistent with the availability of alternate routes for decomposition, including aldol cleavage and oxidation (Supporting Information).",

After it was dry, the paper was cut in small sections and extracted with water. Eluates were analyzed for pentose by the Bial reaction.\n\nIn the range of RF, 0.13 to 0.19, which corresponds to the RF of n-arabinose, apparent pentose was found, amounting to less than 2 per cent of the pentose applied. The ribulose was entirely within the range of RF, 0.23 to 0.33.\n\nThe spectra in the FeC&-orcinol reaction of rihnloso and n-arabinose are given in Fig. 1. The spectra were determined after a heating time of 40 minutes, and with reagent concentrations recommended by Miller et al. (11). It can be seen that, in the preparation of ribulose used here, the 540 rnp peak is slightly greater than that of 670 mp. The height of the latter peak given by the product of the ribulose reaction was only 37 per cent of that given by the same amount, of n-arabinose.\n\nSolutions of ribulose were stored in the frozen state. In the course of 5 months, a slow increase in the n-arabinose content of one such frozen solution was noted, from about 1 to 2 per cent D-arabinose to about 5 per cent n-arabinose, producing a significant increase in the 670 rnp peak. Indeed, when this peak is observed to exceed the 540 rnp peak, a significant D-arabinose impurity has appeared in the preparation. products at phenolphthalein end-points. The transformation of ribulose-&phosphate was even more rapid at pH 9.8.\n\nThe spectra of ribulose products showed slower changes of the same character.\n\nThe greater stability of the free sugar is presumably a function of its existence as a furanose, whereas the phosphate must exist as a straight chain compound.",

A, then, is the percentage of unreacted sugar at the particular moment, B -A is the corresponding percentage of sugar present as furanoside, and 100 -B is the percentage of sugar present as pyranoside. Actually, however, the hydrolysis of the furanoside is probably not invari-ably quantitative nor is the hydrolysis of the pyranoside always negligible.\n\nA corrected value for B may be calculated by using the formula, B, = l~O~w-~', which is derived on the assumption that P, the percentage hydrolysis of the pyranoside, is constant throughout the experiment, or in other words, that the amount of such hydrolysis in any sample is proportional only to the amount of pyranoside present in that sample. In actual fact P was determined by hydrolyzing samples which had reached optical equilibrium and hence probable equilibrium of a! and p forms of the pyranoside.\n\nThe proportion of CY to p does not, however, remain constant during the experiment so that even the corrected values B, are still generally too large. However, this error is at least in part compensated by the incomplete hydrolysis of the furanoside mentioned above. It must be emphasized that the values obtained from the hydrolysis data are a satisfactory first approximation, permitting the determination of the time of maximum juranoside formation, and illustrating the diferences in the rates of formation of jurcznosides and pyranosides as a junction of the conjiguration of the sugar.\n\nIn connection with the corrections which were used in the work, it may be mentioned that small deviations from the accepted values were found for the reducing power of our samples of sugars, particularly after they had been subjected to treatment with acid under conditions used for glucoside hydrolysis.\n\nFor this reason the reducing value was determined for each sugar, both before and after acid treatment, and the factors thus obtained were used in making the calculations.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\nMaterials",

In the paper of Fischler and Lindner ((34) p. 246), however, it is stated that dihydroxyacetone (oxantin) is much mare sensitive to this reaction mixture.\n\n\"Es werden also relativ grosse Mengen von Dioxyaceton unter unserer Versuchsordnung in kurzer Zeit so weitgehend vergndert, dass eine Osazonbildung nicht mehr eintritt.\"\n\n' 'Wiihrend es leicht gelingt das Dioxyacetonosazon aus dem reinen Oxantin 'H&h& darzustellen, gelingt dies nicht mehr, wenn man Oxantin such nur sehr kurze Zeit in der von uns angewendetenweise aus alkalischem Medium destilliert.\"\n\nThe same results were obtained with a crude preparation of glyceraldehyde. If these trioses are so very sensitive to alkali how could they be detected in such a mixture which had been boiled for an hour?

Glycolic acid is expected to be generated through a Cannizzaro reaction of glycolaldehyde with formaldehyde (or other small aldehydes, Figure 5A). Lactic acid is likely generated as a result of a benzillic rearrangement of pyruvaldehyde that was generated through the dehydration and tautomerization of glyceraldehyde ( Figure 5B).

It is generally known that furanosides are formed with greater velocity than the corresponding pyranosides and methods of preparation have been based on this difference. Moreover, although it is well known that the configuration of the sugar affects the rates of glucoside formation, no comparative information of a quantitative nature has been hitherto available.Studies have now been made on several monoses as regards their furanoside and pyranoside formation under comparable conditions.The data are presented inTable Iand in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 is a set of graphs showing the changes in the proportions of free sugar and of furanoside and pyranoside.It will be noted that for each sugar investigated, the amount of furanoside rises to a maximum and then gradually decreases. Particular interest arises from the fact that this maximum production is not always clearly indicated by the curves(Fig. 2)of optical rotation (for example, mannose, fructose, arabinose, xylose) and yet it is at this point that the experiment should be interrupted in order to obtain the maximum yield of furanoside.In the cases of ribose and xylose, in which we were particularly interested, the proportion of furanoside approaches 100 per cent so that modification of the present experimental conditions was unnecessary, However, in the case of other sugars, it is possible that the proportion of furanoside could be appreciably increased by changes in temperature, or in 699 by guest on March 24, 2020 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from",

When these sugars are distilled with acid, there is a marked difference between the colour changes shown on adding the phloroglucide from those given with pure arabinose, or pure furfural. In the latter cases, the solution is first yellow and then turns green. With the hexoses, the solution changes from yellow to a claret red and then finally to green. With mixtures of pure arabinose and hexoses the claret colour is always observed. [Note added Oct. 16, 1914. Since this paper was written, Cunningham and Doree in a communication to the Biochemical Journal, 1914, vm. 438, dated July 13, have dealt with several of the points raised above somewhat more fully than we have done; they give qualitative evidence that hydroxymethylfurfural is actually formed when hexoses are distilled with hydrochloric acid under the Krober-Tollens conditions.] 2 Compare Gunther, O6U.

Dioxymethylene is the polymer of formaldehyde (paraformaldehyde). Butlerov isolated it from the formaldehyde polymer hexamethylene tetramine, by treatment with ammonia. Formaldehyde was conclusively identified with a molecular formula CH 2 O in 1869, by August Wilhelm von Hofmann [2,3].\n\nButlerov also discovered the formose reaction (also known as the Butlerov reaction) in 1861 [4]. In the original experiment he heated a solution of dioxymethylene mixed with quicklime (Ca(OH) 2 ). The solution turned color and smelled sweet and of burnt sugar, so he tasted the solution and noticed it was sweet like sugar. Since its inception, the formose reaction has been synonymous with sugar production. Oskar Loew, who in the late 1880s improved the formose reaction, gave the \"classic\" form of the reaction and proposed that \"formose\" could be sorbose, an isomer of fructose (lävulose in the old German literature) [5]. Fischer and Baer discovered the polymerization of glyceraldehyde and/or dihydroxyacetone to yield sorbose and fructose, advancing our modern understanding during the early 1900s [6]. It is with a rich history in mind that many scientists see the formose reaction as the best candidate for the prebiotic synthesis of sugars.\n\n\nA Plausible Place for the Formose Reaction\n\nA plausible setting for the formose reaction may have existed in the Hadean epoch, 4.5-4.0 billion years ago (Ga) [7].

This conception arose first through the results obtained from a wide variety of purely chemical experiments with the hexose sugars (l-5).\n\nMore recently this view has found some substantiation through the isolation of one of these intermediate products during biological carbohydrate catabolism. Thus methylglyoxal has been obtained from various biochemical react.ions of the sugar molecule in both plants and animals (6)(7)(8). In this complicated succession of reactions and products the precursor of methylglyoxal and lactic acid is commonly assumed to be one of the trioses, glyceraldehyde or dihydroxyacetone.\n\nIn a quantitiative chemical study of the disintegration of the hexose molecule, either in vivo or in vitro, the following compounds, formed in the early stages of this action, must be considered: aldo-and ketohexoses, glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, the condensation products of these latter two, methylglyoxal, the condensation products of methylglyoxal, lactic acid, and probably also acetol and pyruvic acid. Since a thorough knowledge of these compounds and their mode of reaction under various conditions is essential for an understanding of the chemistry of carbohydrate metabolism, it would be highly desirable to have methods by means of which these compounds could be determined quantitatively in the presence of each other. Purely chemical methods have as yet not led to the desired goal, because of the great similarity of these compounds, the ease with which they are converted into each other, and their relatively high reactivity. This paper deals with some of the properties and reactions of the substances mentioned which may find application to the larger problem of carbohydrate transformations.",

Whenever either chromatogram showed the presence of more than one substance, the labeled aldose was recrystallized and then rechromatographed.

As size increases more incoming photons are scattered and radiation damping becomes more important. Note that Γ makes a stronger relative contribution to the damping for Ag compared to Au. This is due to the interband transitions of Au, which increase absorption in the region of the plasmon resonance. contributions from electron-surface scattering, [63][64] with an electron-surface scattering parameter of A = 0.7 (which is appropriate for Ag 67 ). The most noticeable feature is that the fields are strongly enhanced just outside the nanoparticle surface. This effect is what gives rise to the field enhancements in SERS. However, the field inside the particle is also enhanced, and it is this field that causes photon absorption, see below. Note that the field enhancements are similar for the two different sizes. This is due to compensating effects from radiation damping and electron-surface scattering. For the large particles electron-surface scattering is not important, but the LSPR is broadened by radiation damping which reduces the field enhancement. For the small particles the reverse is true -radiation damping is not important but the particles suffer electron-surface scattering.",

The electron-hole pairs produced by decay of the LSPR will be distributed over a range of energies in the metal's electronic bands. [57][58][59][60][61]76 For bulk metal surfaces this distribution has been measured through ultrafast photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. [77][78][79][80][81] The results from the measurements show that the electrons initially have a non-thermal distribution that rapidly relaxes to a thermal (Fermi-Dirac) distribution via electron-electron scattering processes. 77 Another physical situation is current injection from a plasmonic nanostructure to an electric contact. [88][89][90] Figure 2 shows the calculated distributions of excited carriers in optically-excited nanospheres of various radii. 70 These distributions were computed in a model that includes two electron relaxation times, one for the momentum and another for the energy (see also Fig. S1 in supporting Information). 61,70 The approach of two relaxation times allows us to describe the two key observations of the plasmonic dynamics. 61,70 (1) Plasmons exhibit fast dephasing due to the short momentum relaxation time that can be extracted from the plasmonic-peak broadening in the absorption spectra. Within the Drude model, this time is given by the parameter (Eq. S5). For gold and silver plasmons, the dephasing times are obviously short, 8 and 33 fs, respectively (Table S1). (2) The cooling of hot electrons due to photon emission is typically much slower and occurs in the sub-ps range. Such relaxation time can be taken from time-resolved experiments. 56 Figure 2 shows   The breaking of linear momentum conservation in a NP is a key mechanism that can also be interpreted in terms of the discretization (or quantitation) of the electronic states in the confined volume of a NP. This quantization involves, of course, the surfaces of the structure. In a large NP, the quantization and the surface scattering effects become equivalent, as it was shown theoretically in Refs. [57,59,61,70]. Another name for the decay of a plasmon through surface scattering, which is used sometimes in the literature, is Landau damping.",

Thus, in calculating physically observable quantities, the variation should be treated statistically. 1,9,26 We also would like to point out that, in our study, we could reproduce the experimental data without such statistical processing. When the temperature is low enough compared to the level spacing between the Fermi level and the first excited state level ( B < ), an equal level spacing scheme is quite a good approximation even without rigorous statistical processing since the populations of higher excited states are negligibly small and, thus, the structure of the higher 13 excited states is not important.

This value agrees with the morphology of the samples. We further recall that the local field at the 1 H nuclei sites in AgNP is induced by the magnetic moments in the AgNP. Since the capping material is diamagnetic in nature, its net moment under an external magnetic field is anti-aligned to the electronic moments in the silver core. It results in a diminished effective magnetic field at the proton sites and thus, less fluctuations of the field.\n\nThis gives a rationale for the negative value of in Eq.

In many cases ε(ω) is just the bulk dielectric function of the material even though effects of quantization due to size (quantum size effect -QSE) have recently been included. 12,26,28 For spheres of size in the nanometer scale, this is done by considering a system of free and independent electrons confined by an infinite potential barrier at the surface, then solving the Schrödinger equation and computing the dielectric function using the dipole approximation for the matrix elements. This approach thus concentrates on the discrete nature of the electronic states within the nanoparticle but does not take into account the effects of electron-electron interaction which are known to be important in the bulk and at the surface of the typical metals. In particular, the average potential a metal electron feels is not infinitely abrupt at the surface but rather it is a smooth function of the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the surface, which allows the metallic wave functions to leak out of the metal. 29 This is com-monly known as the spill-out effect and, being a genuine surface property, strongly influences the LSPRs, both in energy and in width, of common metals not only for planar surfaces [29][30][31] but also in nanosystems. 16,[32][33][34] A second surface mechanism, namely diffuse surface scattering, which affects LSPRs in any geometry originates from the existence of imperfections or roughness at a microscopic scale on the surface. Diffuse surface scattering causes, on average, omnidirectional reflection of electrons which arrive at a very rough surface from the bulk. This mechanism when applied to LSPRs contributes mainly to energy broadening since coherence between single scattering events is lost.",

These approaches are particularly useful for materials with shallow d-states, such as gold or copper. [22][23][24][25] However, a complete description of hotcarrier generation that captures both nanoparticle size effects and d-bands is still missing.\n\nIn this paper, we do not attempt to develop such a complete theory of hot-carrier generation. Instead, we use a simplified description of the nanoparticle electronic structure to explore the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle material, size and environment. In particular, we carry out calculations for spherical nanoparticles with diameters up to 40 nm and investigate six different plasmonic metals: the simple-metals sodium (Na), potassium (K) and aluminium (Al) and the transition-metals gold (Au), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu). For some systems, such as simple-metal nanoparticles or transition-metal nanoparticles in an environment with a large dielectric constant, we expect that our simplified electronic structure model gives accurate results. For transition-metal nanoparticles in an environment with weak screening, our calculations are less accurate because of the lack of d-states in the model, but should provide a useful lower bound on hot-carrier generation rates.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: we first explain in detail our computational approach for calculating hot-carrier generation rates emphasizing the importance of an accurate description of carrier lifetimes. We then present our results for the optical and hot-carrier properties of metallic nanoparticles, discuss consequences for hot-carrier induced solar water splitting and offer conclusions.\n\n\nResult and discussion",

[10][11][12][13] As can be surmised from the rarity of the experimental evidence of the electron-number parity effect, their experimental verification 4 remains challenging. It is known that the large spin-orbit coupling, non-uniformities in size, nonuniform energy level spacing, etc. can make the electron-number parity effect indistinct. 14,15 Moreover, a non-uniform distribution of energy level spacing renders the calculation of thermodynamic quantities impractical in many cases. It was not until the mid-1990s that the above-mentioned theoretical predictions were confirmed by measuring the static thermodynamic properties of Pd clusters with a very uniform structure -the number of atoms in the core being the same in all clusters. 16 However, in typical metal nanoparticles, this uniformity is not guaranteed and both types of parity can coexist. The inevitably occurring parity mixing in real nanoparticles disrupts the separation between even-and odd-parity in the static thermodynamic measurements.",

Thanks to the covalent nature of the chemical bond and the ideal tetrahedral coordination, the diamond lattice shows extraordinary hardness, density (3.514 g/cm 3 ), incompressibility and rigidity (designated as ten on the Mohs scale). It is one of the best conductors of heat, with heat conductivity up to five times higher than copper.

As seen in Table I, the PBE cohesive energies are significantly larger than the DMC energies in both graphene and diamond, indicating that the DFT calculations based on the PBE exchangecorrelation potential tend to overestimate the carbon binding as in LDA calculations. The DMC cohesive energy of graphite is found to be slightly larger than that of diamond, which is consistent with the fact that graphite is energetically the most stable carbon structure. The ZPE-corrected DMC cohesive energies of both graphite and diamond are in excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental values [43]. For the cohesive energy difference between graphite and diamond, the DMC result of ∼27 meV/atom is basically identical to the experimentally-reported value. This, largely due to the error cancellations, is fortuitous given that there are remaining systematic errors in our QMC calculations, e.g., fixed-node errors and higher-order finite-size corrections. More comprehensive calculations beyond the SJ orbitals for larger supercells are called for to resolve the energy differences within 10 meV. Nevertheless, the results support the use of the QMC methods to compute accurate relative energetics of different carbon allotropes.",

As may be seen from these data, the reaction of the interaction of the C(N 12 ) compound under consideration with molecular oxygen, on the one hand, is strongly exothermic, since the D r H 0 298 values for it are negative, and they themselves are very signicant in modulus ($2000 kJ) within the framework of each of the calculation methods we used. On the other hand, the value of D r S 0 298 is positive for it, and in accordance with the well-known Gibbs -Helmholtz eqn (3)\nD r G 0 (T) ¼ D r H 0 298 À TD r S 0 298(3)\nthe D r G 0 (T) value for it will be negative at any temperature, which in turn means that the process described by eqn (1) is irreversible. In this regard, it is interesting to note that a similar situation takes place for reaction (2) (Table 4), which, in principle, can be used to obtain an allotropic modication of carbon a diamond in the framework of the isobaric process. And since the reaction (2) indicated in the article proceeds in the gas phase [in any case, the initial substance in it is C(N 12 ) (gas)], then we can assume with sufficient condence that the energy barrier to the activation of this reaction will not be too big and it will not be kinetically inhibited, which means that it can be realized within a reasonable time.",

The unit cell parameters are a = b = c = 3.56672 Å, α = β = γ = 90 [21]. Graphite on the other hand crystallizes in the hexagonal lattice with P 63/mmc (194) space group and unit cell parameters a = b = 2.464 Å, c = 6.711 Å [22]. In diamond, each C-atom is linked to four equidistant (1.5 Å) neighbours and extends throughout the whole crystal while in graphite, the layers are separated by a distance of 3.4 Å, with C-C bond lengths of 1.4 Å. This are in agreement with literature values [1]. Results from the topological parameters reveal that, the atoms in 3 are held by strong C-C covalent bonds. This is confirmed by the high electron density, ρ b (r) (1.623 e/Å 3 ) and negative laplacian, ∇ 2 ρ b (r) (-16.53 e/Å 5 ) values. Conversely, 4 possesses two types of bonding viz; covalent bonding between the C-atoms in the same plane and weak Van der Waals interaction between the graphene sheets (C-atoms of different layers). These results are also confirmed by the electron density and laplacian values. The C-C covalent bonds have high electron density, ρ b (r) (2.004 e/Å 3 ) and negative laplacian, ∇ 2 ρ b (r) (-25.2 e/Å 5 ) values. The van der Waals interactions between the graphene layers are shown by the low values of the electron density, ρ b (r) (0.037 e/Å 3 ) and positive laplacian, ∇ 2 ρ b (r) (0.376 e/Å 5 ). Changes in the interactions can also be accounted for by the C-C distances. Furthermore, the ellipticity, ε, indicates the degree of deviation from sigma symmetry. This is confirmed by the spherically symmetric C-C single bonds in 3 (ε = 0.00) and the non-symmetric delocalisation in 4 (ε = 0.16), with",

It is also a key parameter for phase transition simulations, where its magnitude affects the difficulty of a phase transition. In this work, the cohesive energy per atom, Ec, is calculated by the following equation:\nEc = (E − nEatom)/n,(1)\nwhere E is the total energy of crystalline phase carbon, Eatom is the energy of a single carbon atom in vacuum, and n is the number of carbon atoms in the crystalline phase. The cohesive energy per atom calculated by Eq. (1) for all potentials listed in Table I is summarized in Fig. 2(a). The experimentally measured cohesive energy of graphite and diamond is −7.374 and −7.346 eV, respectively, 66 and for most of the carbon allotropes tested here, the cohesive energy calculated using the CBOPs is around −7.4 eV. ReaxFF C2013 predicts, however, cohesive energies of around −5.0 eV due to the high single atom energy of Eatom = −2.06 eV, which is much larger than that of DFT. Compared to the CBOPs, the cohesive energies obtained using GAP-20 are much closer to the DFT results, giving it a high accuracy of about 95%.",

This corresponds to the presence of 5-membered rings in the samples. The angular distribution function correspondingly shows a bimodal distribution, with the largest peak centered around 120 • (hexagonal motifs) and a second smaller peak centered around 108 • (pentagonal motifs). A small tail also appears for angles larger than 120 • (heptagons and beyond). The calculated XRD patterns show the expected trends with density and offer a direct route for comparison with experiment.\n\nThe pore-size analysis reveals bell-shaped distributions whose center and width shift towards larger values as the density decreases. Typical nanopore diameters increase from 5Å at 1.7 g/cm 3 up to 27Å at 0.5 g/cm 3 . Interestingly, small nanopores are very rare in the lowdensity NP carbon samples. This is indicative of homogeneous nanopore size distributions for a sample of a given density.\n\nFinally, our analysis of elasticity showed that the samples behave mostly isotropically from a mechanical perspective, with the degree of elastic isotropy slowly decreasing with density. The elastic moduli of the material increase monotonically with density, and the Young's modulus increases more rapidly than bulk or shear moduli. The elastic response of these NP carbons increased by roughly an order of magnitude from 0.5 g/cm 3 to 1.7 g/cm 3 , with the elastic constants of the latter still more than an order of magnitude smaller than those of diamond.\n\nWe hope that the detailed insight into the atomic structure of NP carbon materials provided in this work will inspire and guide future experimental efforts, especially for energystorage applications. We also expect that the library of atomic structures provided to the research community will serve as a starting point for future computational studies on the elec-tronic, structural and mechanical properties of NP carbon.",

RESULTS\n\nUsing the experimental values for the carbon-carbon bond length (1.421Å for graphene or graphite [39] and 1.545Å for diamond [40]), we first performed the DFT-PBE calculations on graphene and diamond to compute their cohesive energies, which is defined by E coh = (N atom E atom − E tot )/N atom with N atom , E atom and E tot being the number of carbon atoms per unit cell, the total energy of a carbon atom in a vacuum, and the total energy of graphene (or diamond) per unit cell, respectively. With the 12 x 12 x 1 (12 x 12 x 12) k-point sampling, the PBE-PP cohesive energy was found to be 7.906 eV/atom (7.778 eV/atom) for graphene (diamond). This value for graphene is consistent with the cohesive energy of 7.972 eV/atom computed with the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) and is also comparable to the previouslyreported DFT cohesive energies of 7.9 eV/atom [41] and 7.73 eV/atom [42]. This tells us that the valence-core partitioning of the energy-consistent BFD pseudo-potential used here is accurate in describing the cohesion of carbon atoms.\n\nWe then carried out the QMC calculations on graphene and diamond. Various sizes of supercells, up to the 6 x 6 x 1 (72 carbon atoms) supercell for graphene and the 4 x diamond supercells with respect to the inverse of the number of electrons per supercell. From the simple-linear-regression fits the ground-state energies in the thermodynamic limit were estimated to be -155.018(8) eV/atom for graphene and -155.057(1) eV/atom for diamond.",

[47] realized the 30-year dream of many scientists in which diamond can be transformed from graphite.Under the title \"Man-made diamonds\" in Nature [47], Bundy and his coworkers successfully reported the synthesis of diamond using a high-temperature and highpressure process.However, the synthesis of diamond by the detonation of explosives with a negative oxygen balance in a steel container under vacuum condition was reported in the 1980s [48,49].There are also some related literatures in recent reports shown two mentioned methods [50][51][52][53][54][55].Explosive detonation is still widely used; however, the process of the detonator explosion is extremely fast and very complex.Moreover, there are some disadvantages observed in detonation method.In fact, the fraction of surface to bulk atom and oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen content in the nanodiamond resulting from after-purification process are difficult to remove.",

Two structures of this crystal are represented in Figure 1: each unit cell corresponds to a cube with red lines on its borders. Each cube has 8 cell-corners, 6 faces and 12 borders. The atoms are represented by spheres which belong to one or several unit cells: each corneratom belongs by 1/8 in a unit cell, an atom on a border line belongs to 1/4 of a unit cell, a face-centered atom belongs to 1/2 of a unit cell and one atom inside one cell belongs to it.

[17]The deeper the ocean, the more interesting the exploration potential -yet the more difficult the exploration becomes.Even a deep-sea veteran like the manned research submarine Alvin, now in operation for over 50 years due to continuous upgrades, remains among only a handful of submarines capable of operating below 4000 meters. [18]istorically, onshore and large-scale luminous phenomena have been relatively easy to observe.Recently bioluminescence at a scale of about 400 km made by dinoflagellates has even been observed from space (Figure 5).Yet scientific records of marine bioluminescence were in the past surprisingly scant.The first scientific description of this phenomenon dates back to 1705, [22] although it has undoubtedly captured human imagination for much longer.Literary works such as Jules Verne's \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" (1870) and visual portrayals in films like Disney's \"Moana\" have brought the mystical luminescence of the sea into popular culture.",

(1981) and assuming the solar spectrum at the Earth's surface for cloudless skies (Gates, 1980), one can calculate that the organic material in the seasurface skin layer augments the absorption of energy in this layer by about 13.3% (9.1% attributed to 290-400 nm UV absorption, 4.2% attributed to 400-700 nm visible absorption) over that of pure water, which absorbs predominantly in the infrared (Michaelian, 2010a).Under cloudy skies, or atmospheres of high water vapor content (the probable condition on prebiotic Earth), infrared light is blocked and the effect of organic material is much more important, increasing the energy absorption in the sea-surface skin layer by a remarkable 400% (200% UV, 200% visible) (Michaelian, 2010a).",

[17]These include:\n\nDefense against predators: This usually involves the expulsion of a luminous mucus, which often remains stuck to the attacker.Small ostracods (Vargula hilgendorfii) glow brightly when touched.Brittle stars (Plutonaster bifrons), for example, can also eject a glowing arm to distract the attacker.Deep-sea squids (Octopoteuthis deletron) emit a luminous bioluminescent cloud in place of an ink cloud.\n\nCounter illumination: Even though it seems absolutely dark to us in the deep sea, there is a brightness gradient that is perceptible to many animals.Fish that swim higher up thus cast a shadow that can be located by predators swimming below them.Some fish like Parapriacanthus ransonneti therefore produce a weak bioluminescent light on the ventral side that dissipates the shadow.\n\nAttracting prey: Deep-water anglerfish (Ceratioidei) lives at depths between 1000 m and 4000 m.Like their shallow-water counterparts, they are lurking hunters, using a moving fishing rod along with attached bait (esca) to attract potential prey.In most cases, however, the esca is not self-luminous, but generates the light within a symbiosis involving bioluminescent bacteria.",

Externally, the major and minor nasal grooves direct some flow away from the incurrent nostril, thereby limiting the overall flow rate through the olfactory organ. Internally, the apical gap between the dorsal and ventral lamellar arrays allows a significant amount of fluid to bypass the sensory channels, providing an internal mechanism for limiting the flow rate of fluid between the lamellae. Specifically, at the average and maximum swimming speeds, approximately 46% and 55% of the incoming flow passes through the sensory channels, respectively, while the remaining flow bypasses the olfactory lamellae via the apical gap (see Internal Hydrodynamics). Thus, as the shark swims faster, a larger percentage of the fluid entering the olfactory chamber flows through the sensory channels, where chemical detection occurs. Even so, at the maximum swimming speed nearly half of the internal flow bypasses the sensory channels. Such external and internal flow regulation mechanisms that limit flow through the sensory channels likely function to protect the delicate lamellae and olfactory sensory epithelium, as previously suggested [3,12].",

This general flow path is consistent with the observations made by Abel et al. [3]. Figure 13 illustrates additional flow patterns in the minor nasal groove. Surface-limited streamlines in a plane perpendicular to the minor nasal groove reveal that fluid flowing into the incurrent nostril (indicated by the white dotted line in Figure 13) flows over the minor nasal groove, which adds swirl to the medially-directed flow within the groove. Also note that the flow speed in the minor nasal groove (,0.9 m/s) is relatively high compared to the freestream velocity (1.55 m/s), indicating that there is a significant amount of medially-directed flow in the minor nasal groove. For comparison, flow rates in the major and minor nasal grooves were calculated at both swimming speeds, and are summarized in Table 3. At the average swimming speed, the flow rate in the minor nasal groove is 0.32 mL/s, compared with 1.3 mL/s in the major nasal groove. Likewise, at the maximum swimming speed, the flow rate in the minor nasal groove is 0.54 mL/s, compared with 2.3 mL/s in the major nasal groove. Thus, at both swimming speeds the flow rate in the major nasal groove is approximately four times larger than that in the minor nasal groove. Further, given that the olfactory flow rate (the flow rate through the incurrent nostril) at the average and maximum swimming speed is 4.5 mL/s and 8.0 mL/s, respectively, in each case the minor nasal groove redirects approximately 7% of the oncoming flow away from the incurrent nostril.",

The short-term precision of the instrument, as measured from ~100 repeat measurements, was typically 0.05 to 0.1 mN m 1 . Before each measurement, the sample vessel (∼30 mL) was washed with ethanol, then submerged in a 4 % HCl acid bath before being rinsed with Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ, Elga) and dried. Before measurements, the sample was left for at least 5 mins to equilibrate. The platinum ring was cleaned with ultrapure water and burned using a butane flame before each measurement. The enrichment factor EFπ is the ratio of the surface pressure (π = γ0 -γ) of the SML over the SSW, where γ0 is the surface tension of artificial seawater determined at the same conditions as the sample (here 74.88 mN/m at 20°C).The surface pressure reflects the concentration of the total surfactants in the sample and is useful in comparisons between studies, provided γ0 is accurately determined each time. EFπ thus expresses the enrichment of surfactants in the SML compared to those the SSW.\n\n\nBroadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS) for gas-phase molecular iodine:",

Figure 15B illustrates these flow paths, where the dashed black line indicates the apical gap route (which was shown in Figure 14), and the dashed white lines illustrate the flow paths through the sensory channels, which are lined with olfactory sensory epithelium. Functionally, the apical gap route is a partial bypass that limits the flow rate of fluid through the sensory channels, which may serve to protect the delicate lamellae and sensory epithelium [12]. Quantitatively, the present CFD results reveal that, at the average swimming speed, approximately 46% of the water entering the olfactory chamber flows through the sensory channels; at the maximum swimming speed, approximately 55% of the incoming water flows through the sensory channels. The remaining fluid is bypassed from the incurrent channel to the excurrent channel via the apical gap. In Figure 15B, flow through the sensory channels is visualized by surface-limited streamlines and contours of the vertical component of the wall shear stress, which reveals that there is flow over the entire surface of the upper and lower lamellae.

(1970) and Jin et al. (2004).They find that organic material in ocean water reduces the albedo at all incident angles and wavelengths and that this effect increases significantly towards the shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet.\n\n\nAbiogenic synthesis of the molecules of life",

Several eyeless animals have been shown to possess this ability. Probably the most intensive studies were done on Ciona and Mya by Hecht (6,15).\n\nThe mechanism of integration of light might conceivably be of advantage to an anemone in a dark environment, ~ causing orientation of the body and tentacles towards steady but weak sources of bioluminescence, thus perhaps increasing the chances of catching microplanktonic luminescent animals for food. Flashes of bioluminescence, presumably from single cells, are often observed in the experimental aquarium, and appear to the human eye many times brighter than illuminations eliciting anemone responses in say, 5 seconds. The ability to integrate radiant energy over the entire body surface might have great potential survival value to other animals as well in the unlighted depths of the oceans where translucency or transparency among organisms is common. Clearly the phenomenon needs to be studied further, not only with regard to Metridium is dredged from depths of 300 to 400 meters in Puget Sound (D.

In the case of the human eye the source of the variability arises from the uncertainty of quantum capture at dim threshold intensities. For Liraulus, however, I-Iartline et al. (17) were unable to distinguish between quantal uncertainty and the possibility of variation in nerve thresholds known to occur.",

He operated in two modesfirst, by examining the specific gravity at different temperatures, by means of the weighing bottle; and, second, by observing the apparent changes of volume in a thermometric-like vessel. From these experiments, he inferred, that sea-water does not expand when cooled from 40° to its proper freezing point, as fresh-water does. In spite of these experiments of MARCET, the opinion derived from BLAG-DEN continued to prevail.\n\nThe Annalen der Physick und Chemie of Poggendorf, for the year 1828, contains a dissertation by Mr G. A. ERMAN junior, entitled \" Observations on the Expansion of Salt-water by a temperature between + 8° and-3 # R. =r:50° and 25£° Fahr. From his experiments he came to the same conclusion which MARCET had adopted.\n\nHaving taught the doctrine of BLAGDEN for half a century, I felt unwilling to relinquish it upon the authority of the experiments of MARCET or ERMAN, to the latter of which my attention had been called last summer by the allusion made to them by Mr LYELL, in the last edition of his Geology, and therefore determined to investigate the fact by experiments upon artificial solutions, and the natural one presented in sea-water.\n\nI shall preface the detail of my own experiments by a more particular account of those of BLAGDEN and ERMAN than the short allusion already made to them.",

A similar albeit less prominent effect can also be accomplished through a change of water temperature. The warmer the water gets, the more the gas volume increases, and vice versa. Since digestive gases accumulate inside a teleost's stomach and intestines as long as food is broken down, an ascent by the teleost causes the volume of intestinal gas to increase, which can reach a level where pressure reduction is paramount and excessive gases are released into the surrounding water. This is especially important should the teleost then plan to level out [3]. Although the anal opening seems to be the logical body opening for releasing digestive gases, the oral cavity can also be used.\n\nThe production of digestive gases has primarily been studied among teleosts, but it can be assumed that these observations also hold true for sharks where biochemical digestion occurs in a similar fashion [4]. Nevertheless, the lack of studies on the production of digestive gases among sharks is rather surprising, considering the amount of studies done on digestion itself [5][6][7]. There is only one published reference suggesting that digestive gases might be common in sharks. This study was performed on sandtiger sharks, Carcharias taurus, who retain some of these gases for buoyancy purposes [8,9]. This gas retention allows them to hover without any actual forward motion. Sandtiger sharks are also able to actively increase the gas content within their stomachs by ascending to the surface and gulping air before descending to their preferred depth. Due to the increased hydrostatic pressure when diving, gulping air sometimes means that a sandtiger likely may overinflate at the surface to then properly compensate at the chosen depth. among teleosts [3] to hover without actual forward motion. Sandtiger sharks are also able to actively increase the gas content within their stomachs by ascending to the surface and gulping air before descending to their preferred depth. Due to the increased hydrostatic pressure when diving, gulping air sometimes means that a sandtiger likely may overinflate at the surface to then properly compensate at the chosen depth. Gulping air is already a well-established phenomenon among teleosts [3].",

Solar UV block and dark treatments received additional films; UV was blocked with UV-absorbing polyethylene film, while dark plastic was placed over the top of dark treatments (see [28] for spectral properties of these treatments). UV-A and UV-B were measured regularly with a dosimeter (Grobel RM21). During the duration of the experiments, mean (6SD) UV-A irradiance at solar noon was 6.1 (0.5) W m 22 and UV-B irradiance was 0.3 (0.04) W m 22 .

This idea however is not consistent with the data presented here. The conductivity of seawater is nearly 4 times that for a 0.9% physiologic saline solution that is isotonic to extracellular fluid of living organisms. Also the sodium ion concentration of seawater (460 mM) is 70 times its concentration in cell cytoplasm (5-10 mM). Further, the calcium concentration of seawater (1.4 mM) is 14,000 times greater than for intracellular fluid (0.1 µM). Physiologic mM calcium in extracellular fluid can bind to membrane phospholipid phosphate groups, negatively charged at alkaline pH, to decrease/regulate the fluidity of the lipid bilayer [7,8]. But mM calcium inside cells is lethal, binds to negatively charged phospholipid moieties that predominate the inner half of the cell membrane, and generally denatures intracellular macromolecules. Amino acids and macromolecules can be formed from inanimate matter in the laboratory, but living cells, requiring very large ion concentration gradients across membrane surfaces, are electrolytically complex. As held by Isaac Newton, the mechanism by which a living organism first originated, which cannot be determined afterward with scientific experimentation, only the Lord knows. Resistance of a liquid salt solution decreases with increase in temperature. Transfer of electrons can occur as long as the catalytic sodium ions are at an optimum distance of separation in a polar medium. Since water is 55 Molar and a 0.9% saline solution at 0.15 Molar exhibits substantial conductivity, the average distance of separation between sodium ions in this conducting solution may be estimated (approximately 95 nanometers). Since conductance C (=1/ resistance R) relates to conductivity (=1/resistivity ρ) as 1/R=A/(Lρ), and L=5 cm in this system with 1/ρ =κ=14.5 mS/cm and an observed conductance of 1/R=1/49.2 × 10 6 =2.0 × 10 -8 ohm -1 , the electron flow area region between electrode tips may",

As shown in Figure 16, the largest pressure gradient occurs near the incurrent nostril. The pressure is then fairly uniform in the center of the olfactory chamber before it gradually increases near the medial end, where the flow reverses direction. Figure 17 shows the average pressure in the incurrent and excurrent channels along the   length of the olfactory chamber at the maximum swimming speed. Most importantly, this plot illustrates the pressure difference between the incurrent and excurrent channels, which is the mechanism that drives flow through the sensory channels. Accordingly, the relatively large pressure difference at location A (compared to locations B-E) indicates that the sensory channels in this region see larger flow rates than those near the medial end of the chamber, where the pressure difference is comparatively smaller.\n\nTo quantify the flow distribution within the olfactory chamber, the flow rate along the incurrent channel was calculated at various locations, shown in Figure 18 for both swimming speeds. The dip at location E for the average swimming speed is due to the larger recirculation region observed in Figure 14. As shown, at both swimming speeds the flow rate decreases dramatically along the length of the incurrent channel as fluid passes into the excurrent channel via either the apical gap or the sensory channels. Consequently, the flow rates within the sensory channels also decrease medially along the olfactory chamber. That is, the medial lamellae receive much less fluid and experience lower flow speeds than those near the incurrent nostril.  \n\n\nDiscussion",

But, given the premise on the nature of the odorant molecules and their macromolecular counterparts, this argument doesn't make sense; actually it is a non sequitur. That the molecules in question must be in contact with the receptors is true of both olfaction and gustation. Volatile terpenoids, however, are among the odorants recognized by ORs on land. How can we accept, then, the idea that both those ligands and the related ligand-receptor complexes lose their sensorial specificity just by moving to the sea? This is unacceptable, unless one changes the name of the receptors when they operate underwater.

Because the absolute enthalpy and absolute entropy reference states are different for each model, the differences in enthalpy and entropy from a selected reference state are calculated and compared. This reference state is taken at P = 101.325 kPa, T 0 = 25 o C and S A,0 = 0.035 kg s /kg. Figure 1 shows the changes in specific enthalpy calculated for seawater, aqueous sodium chloride solution and the sodium chloride ideal mixture model [5] as it varies with the salinity. At the reference salinity (S A,0 = 0.035 kg s /kg), the enthalpy is zero for all three models. There are large differences between the enthalpy of seawater and the aqueous sodium chloride solution. This is due to a large difference in the heats of solution between the seawater and sodium chloride, averaging up to a factor of ten according to Tribus and Evans [22]. It is important to emphasize that the accurate estimation of the seawater specific enthalpy obtained by using the ideal mixture model [5] is coincidental, as the enthalpy should be close to aqueous sodium chloride solution rather than seawater. \n\n\nFig. 1 The specific enthalpy as a function of salinity\n\nOn the other hand, the specific entropy calculated for the three models is shown in Figure 2.

The shark was milling at a depth of about 20m and was observed for several minutes during which time it did not make any attempt to ascend. When the shark finally did swim upwards towards the surface, it did so quickly and in a vertical manner. It took no more than a few seconds for the shark to reach the same level as the videographer who was filming from close to the surface. As soon as the shark levelled out, immediate gas release through its right gill slits occurred (Figure 1). The release happened rapidly on reaching its new depth and took less than one second. The shark was estimated to be around 2m in length, a size that enabled it to easily access all its common food sources which primarily consist of fish [18]. The water temperature at the time of video recording was 27 ᵒC. The second observation involved a tiger shark, Galeocerdo Cuvier, releasing gases through its cloaca (Figure 2). The shark was videotaped off the Coast of Beqa Island, part of the Fiji archipelago, and was cruising for about 15minutes in constant visual range at the same depth as the videographer of about 18m. The shark did not change its speed or body position while releasing the bubbles through its cloaca. The length of the animal was estimated to be around 4m, which is also well within its range for consumption of all the foods commonly associated with this species [18]. The water temperature was 25 ᵒC. The videos were respectively taken with a Sony HC-9 video camera in Sea Tool housing, at 1080i high definition and a frame rate of 30fps, and a Go Pro 4 with the same frame rate and definition.

The spectrometer's light source was a high intensity light emitting diode (Dragon 1 Powerstar, Intelligent LED Solutions, peak wavelength = 530 nm) mounted on a temperature-stabilised, peltier-cooled heat sink. Light from the LED was coupled into a fibre optic cable abutted up against the emitter's surface and re-collimated at the far end of the fibre by a microscope objective lens. Two turning mirrors directed the light beam into the optical cavity formed by two highly reflective mirrors (Layertec GmbH). The total length of the cavity was 83 cm; however 11 cm sections inside each mirror mount were purged with synthetic air to prevent contamination of the mirror surfaces. Thus the sample was confined to the central 61 cm portion of the cavity, and the absorption measured inside the cavity was therefore corrected for the cavity's length factor (LF = 1.36  0.06). LF was determined from a total of n = 14 replicate measurements using two different methods: measuring the O4 absorption bands in synthetic air and measuring the Rayleigh scattering due to argon in samples supplied into the central portion of the cavity. The reflectivity of the cavity mirrors, R(), was characterised versus wavelength by measuring BBCEAS spectra of NO2 samples prior to this work; the reflectivity was re-measured at the start of each experiment by flowing pure oxygen through the cavity and recording and fitting the O4 bands. The peak reflectivity of the cavity mirrors was 99.9927% at 548 nm, giving a maximum effective S4 absorption path of 11 km. The reflectivity at the extremes of the wavelength range used here (519.8 to 571.3 nm) was still sufficient to achieve a path length of 5 km.",

Large complex ions tend to cause salting in: adding salt increases nonpolar solubilities in water. Molecular dynamics simulations of Smith 263 and Kalra et al. 264 indicate that salting out is because the hydrophobe is excluded from the first hydration shell of the ion. Salting in is because the hydrophobe can occupy the ion's solvation shell. And, like chaotrope/kosmotrope properties, Hofmeister effects tend to correlate with the charge densities on the ions. Figure 20 illustrates the structural basis for Hofmeister effects. 40,126 Small ions exclude hydrophobes because small ions bind water molecules quite tightly. This exclusion increases the hydrophobe concentration in the remaining volume of the solution, driving the hydrophobes to aggregate with increasing ion concentration. Large ions do not exclude hydrophobes because large ions do not bind waters so tightly. Therefore, adding large ions to solution does not drive increased hydrophobe concentration in the remaining solution volume. The black bars in Figure 20 show the hydrophobe exclusion volume of different ions, as well as the well-known observation that the smaller ions tend to have the larger exclusion volumes. 265 Figure 21 shows the PMF of two ions coming together in water. It shows how the solvation-shell waters are structured at different ion separations. When the ions are far apart, each ion's solvation shell is structured as described above for the isolated ions. When the two ions are separated by about one layer of water, the bridging waters between them will be structured by multiple interactions. Each bridging water interacts with other bridging waters through hydrogen bonding, and each bridging water interacts with each ion through its water dipole. When the two mobile ions come into contact, the ion−ion electrostatics can also contribute substantially to the free energy. Extensive computer simulations using different water models show that Figure 19. Around small ions, waters become electrostatically ordered. Around large ions, waters become hydrophobically ordered. The coloring shows the probability density of water dipole positive (blue) and negative (red) charges as well as water−water hydrogen bonding arms (orange). About small ions, water is highly electrostricted. the shape of the PMF depends on all these factors. The resulting free energy from the",

                    "contents": "How Water’s Properties Are Encoded in Its Molecular Structure and EnergiesMuch of what is known about water's structure−property relationship comes from bulk measurements, such as the enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities of pure water in its various phases; changes in those thermal quantities upon melting or boiling, or changes due to dissolving solutes; changes due to applied pressure; changes of electrical properties in applied electric fields; and measured surface tensions, for example. However, to learn how material properties are encoded within molecular structures requires more than just experiments. It also requires models, theories, and simulations. Without modeling, we cannot interpret observable properties in terms of water's molecular structure, energetics, and population distributions.\n\nMaking the structure−property connection requires knowing the driving forces. Because no single type of model currently gives a full picture, we look here through the lenses of different models and theories. Water has been modeled variously: as a simple continuous medium for fast calculations of solvation or dielectric properties; or as simplified statistical mechanical sphere-like particles with hydrogen bonding arms; or by using fixed-charge or polarizable atomically detailed models in computer simulations; or at the (computationally expensive) quantum mechanical level for insights into the nature of electronic structure and the bonding of the atoms (see Figure 3). Each of these approaches has its own target problems and its own research communities.\n\nThere are several classic reviews on the properties of water and water modeling. 29−33 Guillot summarized computer simulations of semiempirical models. 34 Ben-Naim has reviewed different types of models of water and solvation, including its anomalous properties. 35,36 A website Water Structure and Science gives an extensive collection of physical, chemical, and biological properties of water, from experiments, simulations, and theory. 37 Recently, a thematic issue on WaterThe Most Anomalous Liquid was published in Chemical Reviews (2016, 116 (13)) with in-depth reviews of various methodologies. And, Sun and Sun recently reviewed the role of hydrogen-bond cooperativity in water's anomalous properties. 38 The present review goes beyondbut is is similar in spirit torefs 39 and 40.\n\nThis review describes structure−function principles; here is a brief overview. 34,40 1.

The effect of the thermochemical concentration and temperature on the average reaction obtained for a period of 15,000 s is illustrated in Figure 7. Unlike the initial reaction rate, there is a linear relation between the average reaction rate and the concentration; as the concentration was increased, the reaction rate increased. The impact of temperature on the average reaction rate was more than that for the concentration where a polynomial of second order was obtained for curve fitting. However, the impact after 70°C was much less.

In the first method, the time that the reaction produced a certain gas volume (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mL) was recorded at various temperatures (343, 348, 353, 358, and 363 K) with the presence of 4 M of each reactant. Then, plotting of ln t versus 1/T gives linear relation for the examined produced volumes of nitrogen gas ( Figure 12). From the average slope of the six lines, a calculated apparent Arrhenius activation energy of 90.55 KJ/mol was obtained.\n\nIn the second method, the apparent Arrhenius activation energy was determined from the linear relation between the reaction constant, ln K, and 1/T, as given by the Arrhenius equation.\n\nThe reaction constants calculated from initial rates and kinetic reaction orders (Table 1) were used to determine the apparent Arrhenius activation energy. Figure 13 shows a linear relationship between the ln K and 1/T. The calculated activation energy based on the slope obtained was found to be 90.353 KJ/mol, which is comparable to that obtained from plotting ln t versus 1/T (92.54 KJ/mol). The average activation energy based on the two methods is 91.44 KJ/ mol. The activation energy obtained by Qian et al. is lower (51.28 KJ/mol) than the one obtained in this study due to the catalyst (authigenic acid) used in their study.

The average slope of the four lines is equal to (1 − n), as given in eq 12, where n is the order of reactants. The calculated reactant order is 2.346, comparable to that obtained from the initial reaction rate result (2.45).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe kinetics of the reaction between NH 4 Cl and NaNO 2 activated thermally was studied, and the rate of the reaction was monitored by measuring the volume of nitrogen gas evolved as a function of time. The effect of the reactant concentration and temperature was investigated.\n\n• Nitrogen gas production and associated buildup pressure were found to increase as the NaNO 2 and NH 4 Cl concentration and temperature were increased. • The reactivity of the nitrogen/heat generating system is strongly influenced by pH values and reaction temperature. • The water salinity had negligible impact on the reactivity of the nitrogen/heat generating system.   • The excess concentration of NH 4 Cl with respect to the NaNO 2 concentration tended to have a higher reaction rate compared with the same excess concentration of NaNO 2 with respect to the NH 4 Cl concentration. • The kinetic order of NH 4 Cl was higher than that of NaNO 2 , as revealed from evolved gas results and supported by generated pressure data. \n\nFigure 1 .\n1Methodology used to determine the (a) initial reaction rate and (b) average reaction rate.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2Water displacement setup.\n\nFigure 3 .\n3Closed system setup.\n\nFigure 4 .\n4Effect of the concentration on (a) evolved nitrogen gas and (b) generated pressure.\n\nFigure 5 .\n5Effect of temperature on (a) evolved nitrogen gas and (b) generated pressure.\n\nFigure 6 .\n6Effect on initial reaction rate: (a) concentration and (b) temperature.\n\nFigure 7 .\n7Effect on average reaction rate: (a) concentration and (b) temperature.\n\nFigure 8 .\n8Pressure generated and reaction rate of 4 M NaNO 2 + 4 M NH 4 Cl at 90°C as a function of time.",

Alternatively, novel ammonia synthesis routes based on electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, plasma-catalytic, and chemical looping processes have the potential to produce ammonia using renewable energy sources or overcome the limitations of the conventional route. Unlike conventional catalytic processes, chemical looping ammonia synthesis (CLAS) processes use nitrogen and hydrogen (or its precursors) in consecutive steps to form ammonia through a solid intermediate. A summary of known CLAS processes and their reaction conditions, feeds, and carrier materials are shown in Table 1. Among the routes using hydrogen and nitrogen as feeds, alkali/alkaline earth metal imide systems have been shown to successfully undergo multiple cycles of nitrogenation and hydrogenation to form ammonia. 22,23 Few transition metal nitrides have been shown to undergo multiple cycles, 24 and some have yet to show clear evidence of this. 25 Ammonia can also be produced by reacting the nitrogen-carrying materials with water. The oxides produced from the hydrolysis reaction are reduced via hydrogen, 26 carbon, 27 methane, 28 electricity, 29 or light. 30 This route can allow the steam reforming plant and ammonia synthesis unit to be replaced while achieving similar exergy efficiencies 31 to the conventional process. 6 However, forming ammonia in this manner requires separation of ammonia− water mixtures, which requires at least twice the power consumption for separation 32 compared to the conventional process. 3 The focus of this paper will be confined to the alkali/ alkaline earth metal imide synthesis route., e.g., reactions R2a and R2b. When paired with transition metal catalysts, alkali and alkaline earth metal hydrides have been shown to overcome rate limitations as a result of scaling relations between the adsorption energy and activation energy of nitrogen 10 and act as nitrogen carriers when employed in a chemical looping scheme. 22 Ball-milling hydrides with transition metal catalysts (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Pd, and Cr) promote an otherwise inactive catalyst with the conventional 10,11 and chemical looping 22,33,34,38 routes. In some cases, the transition metal can also act as a nitrogen carrier (see Table 1). When nickel and barium hydride mixtures are supported on alumina, the ammonia synthesis rate at 300°C and 1 bar",

In the earlier experiments up to 457 °C, the gas-bulb/case system was immersed, as needed, in liquid baths; in an ice/water bath to provide the reference state, in a water/potassiumchromate bath to provide uniform temperatures between 0 and 140 °C, or in a bath containing a eutectic mixture of lithium, sodium and potassium nitrates to provide uniform temperatures between 140 and 457 °C. As noted in section 6, use of the molten salt bath above 457 °C, while providing quite uniform temperatures in the volume containing the gas bulb, nevertheless offered its own problems; not only did the hot molten salts attack the sheaths of the PRTs, but the solution also migrated out of the bath reservoir, occasionally damaging the electrical circuits.\n\nA less homogeneous thermal environment was provided for the most recent experiments by an argon-filled furnace [28]. A schematic drawing of the high-temperature furnace is shown in figure 13. Although capable of providing gas-bulb temperatures as high as 1000 °C, some eight heaters required careful manual adjustment if the operator wished to eliminate very noticeable temperature gradients in the gas bulb. The furnace response time was an hour or more, depending upon its temperature; however, its thermal stability was quite high, permitting ample time for measurements after adjustment. As before, an ice bath was used to provide the reference state near 0 °C for the gas bulb.\n\n\nGas Bulb Assembly",

The initial reaction rates were determined from the slope of the tangent to the reaction curve and passing by the origin, while the average reaction rates were determined from the slope for the line going from origin to the time point of interest. Figure 2 shows the water displacement setup used to measure evolved nitrogen gas due to the reaction of ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite. The closed system used to monitor generated pressure due to evolved nitrogen gas from the thermochemical reaction is shown in Figure 3. It consists of a VINCI Educational PVT cell  for phase behavior analysis connected to analog and digital pressure gauges. An oil bath was used to maintain the transparent PVT chamber temperature as required. The pressure generated by the reaction was monitored as a function time by a nearby PC.\n\n\nExperimental Setups.\n\nThe pH measurements were conducted using an Accumet AR-15 pH meter utilizing a microprobe, glass body singlejunction Ag/AgCl reference with an auto temperature compensation.\n\n\nExperimental Design.\n\nThe experimental work conducted in this study involved the use of open and closed systems, as given in Table 1.

Improvements in ammonia catalysts over the last century have sought to decrease energy consumption and economic cost of the process. Initial formulations based on iron catalysts synthesized ammonia at 300 bar and 350−500°C, which incurred high compression duties and costs. 3 Iron catalysts have retained their commercial success and progressed from promoted magnetite (K 2 O−Fe 3 O 4 ) to wustite (K 2 O−Fe 1−x O) based catalysts, which synthesize ammonia at 120−150 bar and 350−500°C. Catalyst formulations based on ruthenium have also been commercialized and can synthesize ammonia at 90 bar and 325−450°C. Although the equilibrium conversion is favored by high pressures and low temperatures (reaction R1), high temperatures are required to be kinetically active. Therefore, succeeding catalyst formulations have aimed to achieve increased rates of reaction at lower temperatures and pressures. The Sabatier principle suggests that interactions between the catalyst and reactant should be neither too strong nor too weak. A quantitative approach to this principle has demonstrated that the ammonia synthesis rates of transition metal catalysts are limited by a linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energy and activation energy of nitrogen. 4 In addition, effects such as hydrogen inhibition and oxygen poisoning are also important. 5,6 Therefore, interactions with all three species need to be considered in the design of an active ammonia catalyst. Novel materials and reaction routes have been explored to overcome these rate limitations. Materials such as electrides, 7−9 hydrides, 10−15 nitrides, 16−19 and oxides 20,21 have shown to improve synthesis rates under milder conditions by acting as co-catalysts or promoters for the transition metal",

Furthermore, GC-MS analysis showed that the internal gas derived from the H 2 O was almost exclusively hydrogen (14.75 mmol), without molecular oxygen, which is a dangerous detonating gas.\n\nInterestingly, ethyl ether and other hydrocarbons can also be used as feedstock to generate hydrogen in situ. Once such a mechanochemical procedure has been developed, the authors have successfully implemented this protocol for the reduction/ hydrogenation of multiple bonds, nitro groups, ketones, halides, and azide residues (Scheme 21). The formation of a black powder follows generating hydrogen from water using SUS304 balls and a vessel.\n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis on the most superficial part (sputtering time of 0 min) [133] of the fresh SUS304 powder suggests that Cr 0 is the reducing species responsible for hydrogen generation from water (Scheme 22). At the same time, the most abundant iron metal induces regeneration of the Cr 0 species by single-electron transfer. The abundance ratio of Fe 0 relatively decreased, while the Ni 0 metal has no change in percentage composition. Finally, Ni 0 can act as a catalyst for subsequent hydrogenation reactions.

UAM utilises ultrasonic metal welding as the bonding technique for the metal foil materials used to construct the final component. Ultrasonic metal welding utilises an oscillating metal tool (known as a horn or sonotrode) to apply pressure to the foil layer/previously consolidated layers to be bonded, whilst simultaneously oscillating the material. To work continuously, the sonotrode is cylindrical and rolls over the material's surface, bonding the whole area. When the pressure and oscillation is applied, the oxides on the materials surface break-up. The continued pressure and oscillation then cause the asperities of the material to collapse 36 . The intimate contact with the locally induced heat and pressure then leads to a solid-state bond occurring at the material interface; it may also be aided through changes in surface energy aiding in adhesion 48 . The nature of the bonding mechanism overcomes many of the issues associated with variable melt temperatures and high temperature after effects noted in other additive manufacturing techniques. This allows the direct bonding (i.e., without surface modification, fillers or adhesives) of multiple dissimilar material layers into a single consolidated structure.",

The catalyst used in the ammonia synthesis loop is arguably one of the most important aspects of the whole process.

This determines the operational pressure to achieve sufficient conversion, and consequently the required compression, as well as the cooling requirement for condensation. Also, the catalyst lifetime is an important factor in determining the run time of the process before a new catalyst is required, which is determined by the catalyst resistance to chemical parameters such as poisons and physical parameters in the process such as a high temperature. 11,12 The most widely used catalyst for ammonia synthesis is a multiple promoted iron-catalyst, containing a mix of Al 2 O 3 , MgO and SiO 2 for mechanical strength and as structural promoters, as well as some electronic promoters such as CaO and K 2 O. 28 Iron-based catalysts typically have a typical lifetime of at least 10 years.

The kinetics of this reaction when activated with acids or acid precursors were the subject of extensive research by several researchers. The activation of such a highly spontaneous/ vigorous reaction by heat is considered a promising reaction control. In this work, a kinetic study was carried out for the reaction of sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride salt activated by heat at 1−5 M and temperatures of 50− 90°C. The study was carried out in both closed and open systems, with the monitoring of gas evolution and generated pressure. The study showed a relatively higher order for ammonium chloride than sodium nitrite. The excess amount of ammonium chloride, a weak acid, enhanced the reaction as it could be catalyzed by both heat and acid. The obtained kinetics of the nitrogen generating reaction is given as dc/dt = −7.66 × 10 11 C o 2.45 e (−91.44 kJ/mol)/RT . The reaction kinetics in this study differs from what is reported in the literature regarding the order of NH 4 Cl, which was reported to be higher than that of NaNO 2 under examined conditions. This study has practical significance for controlling the reactivity of the NH 4 Cl/NaNO 2 nitrogen/heat generating system and calculating/optimizing nitrogen generation for a specific field application.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe most commonly used thermochemicals in the oil industry are ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite where their reaction is given below: 1",

This time, the entire reactor is closer to its thermal plateau and we keep the SEI values almost constant at a level of 0.15 ± 0.03 kWh/m 3 (n). At this level, we add very little energy to the POX of the NG; instead, we \"electrify\" it. The results of this series of tests inform us that it is preferable to convert a NG when the O 2 /HC ratio reaches a value near 0.65. At this level, we obtain very good results of total conversion of carbon and oxygen, we approximate (1.94) the desired H 2 /CO ratio of 2.0, we produce 2.6 m 3 of syngas per 1 m 3 of HC feed, all that at the very low energy expense (SER) of 0.11 kWh per 1 m 3 (n) of syngas. These results are also readily apparent from the selectivities of the carbon conversion. Curiously, these selectivities evolve rather towards the desired product than towards the parasitic CO 2 . Another surprising point is that, by increasing the O 2 /HC ratio, we produce more H 2 and the selectivity of water vapour formation decreases.   Table 8 summarises seven tests of POX of a NG with oxygen and added water vapour. The question was: Can we convert a NG with less oxygen by replacing it with steam, while maintaining a relatively low energy price (SER) for syngas with a composition similar to the H 2 /CO ratio = 2? The target NG was heavier: 91.6% CH 4 , 6.2% C 2 H 6 , 1.7% C 3 H 8 and 0.5% C 4 H 10 . It was mixed with pure oxygen and steam in variable proportions. Only a light preheating (115-150°C) was used. For a constant pressure of 0.15 MPa, the flow rate of the mixture (1.7 to 2.0 m 3 (n)/h) and the electric supply settings were kept almost constant.

Until now much attention has been paid in minimizing hydrogen outgassing from the chamber material. However, procedures and processing deserves further scrutiny than hitherto given so far. For reducing the gas load, high sensitivity helium leak detection techniques with sensitivities better than 1× 10 -12 Torr l/sec need to be used. Effects that are induced by vacuum instrumentation need to be reduced in order to obtain accurate pressure measurements. This presentation will discuss: clean assembly procedures, metal sponges for cryosorption pumping of hydrogen to extreme high vacuum, low cost surface diffusion barriers for reducing the hydrogen gas load, cascade pumping, sensitive helium leak detection techniques and the use of modified extractor and residual gas analyzers. Further, alternative back up pumping systems based on active NEG's [3] for turbo molecular pumps will be presented.\nUltimate Pressure Limitations. D G Bills, J. Vac. Sci.

In steam reforming, CH 4 reacts with steam to reform CH 4 into a mixture of CO, CO 2 , and H 2 , as given below:\n\nThe synthesis reactions are highly endothermic and thus limited by chemical equilibrium; heat is supplied to the reformer tubes (in a vertical, parallel arrangement), by combustion of natural gas inside a firebox. The product gases leave the reformer unit at 855 oC and 2MPa. In industrial practice, heat is recovered from this gas stream by a series of heat exchange operations.\n\nAs noted above, only 2 of the 3 reactions above are independent; the H 2 :CO ratio for the overall product gas is between 2-2.5. The kinetic studies on a commercial Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 or a ceramic support indicate that it is the reforming of CH 4 to CO and the water gas shift reaction that take place under industrial conditions. The dry reforming reaction can also be postulated to occur in the overall series of reactions, as follows [13]:\n\nAs discussed above, steam reforming of natural gas is a mature process technology, and discussed extensively in several recent reviews [6,7,[9][10][11][12].\n\nSteam reforming is catalyzed by Group VIII transition metals, including Ru, Rh, Ir, and Ni. While extensive experimental and theoretical studies (DFT calculations, scaling relationships, and microkinetic models) show that Ru and Rh are the most active transition group metals for steam reforming, Ni-based catalysts are almost exclusively used in the chemical industry due to high price of Ru and Rh metals.

[99] This was done for purely academic reasons in order to be able to efficiently mimic a conventionally heated autoclave experiment. [80] Notably, microwave irradiation will induce a flow of electrons in the semiconducting SiC ceramic that heats the material very efficiently through resistance (ohmic) heating mechanisms. Owing to its extremely high thermal conductivity and effusivity (a measure for the ability   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52 to exchange thermal energy with its surroundings) the heat flow through the wall of the SiC reaction vessel is exceptionally fast in both directions. The contents of the reaction vessel are therefore also heated very rapidly, regardless of their microwave absorptivity. [80,99] It occurred to one of my PhD students, David Obermayer, that ohmic heating of the SiC reaction vessel should, as an alternative to microwave irradiation, be much easier to achieve by simply applying surface electrodes on the material. A first prototype of a resistance-heated SiC autoclave of this nature featuring online temperature and pressure monitoring/control, magnetic stirring, and being capable of operating at temperatures of up to 250 8C and pressures up to 24 bar was assembled during 2012/2013. [100] It became apparent rather quickly that this device was, in principle, able to mimic what could be achieved with state-of-the-art single-mode microwave technology as several control experiments demonstrated.

The capital costs are thus more sensitive to ammonia yields and would be a more useful criteria for benchmarking material properties. In comparison to the ref case whose yield is 26%, an equivalent capital cost is achieved at ammonia yields of >26% with the CL case, and this value will therefore be used to benchmark the required gas−solid reaction thermodynamics. Figure 7 represent ΔH solid°a nd ΔS solid°r equired to achieve a greater than 26% ammonia yield at a given temperature and 150 bar. Materials with ΔH solid°a nd ΔS solid°v alues situated below the lines drawn in Figure 7 have potentially greater ammonia yields than the conventional reaction. The chosen temperatures are based on the simulation of the CL case if circulating fluidized beds are considered (T = 350°C), if fixed beds are considered (T = 450°C), and if a milder temperature is feasible (T = 250°C). Only the LiH/Li 2 NH pair satisfies these conditions, whereas other pairings do not meet these criteria. The present estimates for LiH/Li 2 NH give a yield of 62% at 350°C and 150 bar or an equal yield to ref case at 50 bar. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis, the power consumption and capital costs may be reduced 14 and 21%, respectively. The exact values of these properties under relevant conditions would need to be determined experimentally to affirm these results.\n\n\nMaterial Property Benchmark. The plotted lines in",

Increasing activity of the following oxides towards HCN hydrolysis is reported to be:\nSiO 2 << Al 2 O 3 < ZrO 2 < TiO 2\n\nHCl Removal\n\nAlthough water wash cleaning unit and AGR will ensure a partial removal of HCl, the gas purity will probably not be sufficient to protect FT catalyst if no additional Cl guard bed is put after the AGR section. Chloride guard beds are typically configured as single-bed. They are non-regenerative units, which provide a service life from six months to several years [97]. These traps are sized based upon adsorbent chloride capacity, process stream and desired life cycle. Typically, adsorbent chloride capacities in gas phase applications vary from 10 to 30 mass%. For the trapping of HCl on adsorbents, two types of adsorption mechanisms exist as shown by reactions below: either physisorption or both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms (Tab. 4).\n\nActivated aluminas and molecular sieves were commonly used in the past for chloride removal through physisorption. In general, adsorbents based solely on physical adsorption do not generally perform well for the chloride trap application because their chloride loading capacities are too low (5 to 10 mass%). In consequence, promoters like alkaline and alkaline earth metal oxides have been added to improve their capacities.",

In the data, the turbulence of gas flow occurs due to the difference in gas pressure from the cylinder to the valve with the gas pressure from the valve to the flow meter.\n\nFrom the results of measurements of airflow and gas flow shows a difference in both the flow pattern and the value of the flow rate that can be seen from the graph of measurement of air and gas flow. Factors that cause these differences are the effects of large and small air and gas pressure at the time of measurement. The greater the air and gas pressure, the greater the amount of flow (flow rate) that comes out with each change in the valve angle.",

Chem. 2022, 87, 5866−5881 Read Online ACCESS Metrics & More Article Recommendations * sı Supporting Information 5866\nThe reaction of NH-indazoles with formaldehyde in aqueous hydrochloric acid has been experimentally studied by solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and crystallography. The mechanism of the formation of N 1 -CH 2 OH derivatives was determined. For the first time, 2-substituted derivatives have been characterized by multinuclear NMR. Theoretically, calculations with gauge-invariant atomic orbitals (GIAOs) at the Becke three-parameter (exchange) Lee−Yang− Parr B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level have provided a sound basis for the experimental observations. The first X-ray structures of four (1H-indazol-1-yl)methanol derivatives are reported.\n\n■ INTRODUCTION",

If the barrier is thin, d ≪ R, the distribution of electrons in the ground state and, therefore, the Coulomb gap of the density of states is not affected by the barrier. We assume that density of states in both semiconductors is still given by\nEq. (1) even if d ≫ R [8].\nBelow we assume that the tunneling barrier is high enough so that all resistance is determined by hops from occupied states on the left side of the barrier to empty states on the right side. In other words, if we introduce the Miller-Abrahams resistance network [2] connecting all the localized states inside each semiconductor and between them we immediately get an enormous difference between these two types of resistors. Resistors crossing the barrier have much larger resistance and, therefore, they determine the tunneling conductance between two semiconductors. One can imagine that the bulk of both semiconductors is a superconductor and the tunneling conductance is due to parallel resistors which cross the barrier. Then it is clear that at large enough d, the number of these parallel resistors and, therefore, the tunneling current, I, is proportional to the product of number of localized states with energy from 0 < ε < eU/2 on the left side and number of empty states in the interval rom 0 > ε > −eU/2. Each of these numbers is proportional to U 3 , so that the tunneling current is equal\nI = A(U )(eU ) 6 .(3)\nwhere coefficient A(U ) depends on U through the phonon energy and is specified below. We show below that at a finite barrier thickness d the current-voltage characteristic is more complicated than Eq.

With growing U new pairs with smaller δr become available and the exponentially small factor, exp(−2δr/a), grows. Eventually it reaches unity when δr becomes as small as a. Simultaneously, as we see from Eq. (7), critical area S c decreases with growing U and eventually approaches S. At this point we return to the conductance of a macroscopic barrier. This means that while S c ≪ S the tunneling conductance grows exponentially with voltage U simulating an the joint density of states and the one-electron density of states g ( ε) exponentially growing with energy. This phenomenon is, of course, different from a direct measurement of the Coulomb gap. Thus, while for the uniform barrier the Coulomb gap can be revealed at large enough d, the point contact does not directly reveal the Coulomb gap.

The primary non-ideal factor is the existence of the vacuum level mismatch ∆ VL , which can significantly modify the IB [8,11]. Figure 1(b) shows the formation of the vacuum level mismatch. The positive (negative) dipole moment vector μ D created by the interface dipole shifts the vacuum level upward (downward), and consequently increases (decreases) the IB for electrons and decreases (increases) the IB for holes by the amount ∆ VL . The interface dipole is often found to be zero either by deliberate passivation with inert buffer layers [9] or by contamination through exposure to atmosphere and/or solvent. However, in general, microscopic charge carrier rearrangements manifested by a variety of chemical and physical process can lead to a non-negligible interface dipole [11][12][13].",

Using this function one can easily calculate the tunneling current I. Indeed all pairs crossing tunneling barrier can contribute to I. They all work in parallel because as we said above the current reaches their ends almost without resistance. Let us write the rate of phonon assisted tunneling hops across the barrier with emission of a phonon with energy Ω as ν(Ω) = ν 0 (Ω) exp(−2d/a 0 ). At low enough Ω only acoustic phonons are involved. For emission acoustic phonons via deformational potential interaction ν 0 (Ω) ∝ Ω, when Ω <hs/a, where s is the sound velocity. At larger Ω the rate ν(Ω) sharply decreases with Ω because wavelength of the phonon becomes smaller than a (see, for example, Ref. [2]). Now we can identify optimal pairs which determine the contact conductance. They all have arms which are very close to r = d. Indeed, the barrier part of the arm of such a pair can not be longer than d + a 0 , while the semiconductor part of the arm can not be longer than a. Otherwise, a pair has exponentially smaller than optimal ones conductance and should be disregarded. Thus, the occupied state of an optimal pair should be in the layer with thickness a near the plane of the left semiconductor barrier junction. If area of the junction is S the volume available for the occupied pair is Sa. For a given occupied state the empty state of an optimal pair should reside in the cylinder with the height a and with the base with the shape of the disk of the radius (da 0 ) 1/2 drawn on the plane of the right barrier-semiconductor junction around the center which exactly opposes the occupied state on the left junction. The transfer energy, Ω, should be in the interval 0 < Ω < eU . Otherwise, the pair does not consist of occupied and empty states and does not contribute to the tunneling current. Thus, total number of optimal pairs is N = F (eU, d)eU Sa 2 a 0 d. For the tunneling current N eν we arrive at Eq. (4) where A(U ) = Bκ 6 e −11 (Sa 2 a 0 d)ν 0 (eU )",

The energetic disorder illustrated in figure 1(b) originates from the absence of long-range order in the position and direction to a various degree, which requires specific models for the description of the electronic structures discussed in more detail in section 2.3. The presence of the energetic disorder makes difficult a unique determination of the EA and IE, which results in the divergent definition of the EA and IE, and hence the IBs. In case of organic semiconductors, the EA and IE are determined most frequently referring either to the onset [9,10] or the maximum [14] of the HOMO and LUMO. The effect of ambiguity becomes more significant as the metal Fermi level is approaching the indistinct edge and arrives at the fundamental limit called the Fermi level pinning, where the IB does not follows the change in the metal work function. Although often attributed to surface states [15] and metal-induced interface gap states [16,17], it has been shown that the Fermi level pinning in the organic semiconductor energy gap mainly occurs from electrostatics [10,18]. Thus, recalling the considerable effect of the electronic structure on the charge carrier concentration at the junction, a complete understanding of the effect of the energetic disorder on the injection barrier is gaining in importance.",

While doing so, we will neglect the existence of the vacuum level mismatch for an exclusive analysis of the effect of energetic disorder.\n\n\nExperimental determination of electronic structures\n\nThe UPS and IPES are the methods of choice to determine the electronic structure of semiconductors. Inspired by the first work on the external photoelectric effect of metals by Einstein [19] and the same of semiconductors by Condon et al [20], Apker et al not only determined the position of the valence band edge but also demonstrated that the density-of-states in the valence band can be experimentally deduced from the energy of photoelectrons [21]. These initial works on photoelectrons support the band theory for crystalline semiconductors providing a link between the existence of the band edge with the sharp cut-off of stopping potential from photo-emission measurement. In addition, experimental determination of the IB based on the Schottky-Mott rule became possible from measured semiconductor IE, EA and metal work function.\n\nFor disordered inorganic semiconductors, theoretical models on the electronic structure postulated that the lack of long-range order results in the loss of sharp band edges so that the density of states shows a tail of localized states extending into the energy gap [22,23]. Its implication on a transport model, multiple trapping-and-releasing model (MTR), results of a clear distinction between extended states above mobility edge (ME) for band-like transport and localized tail states for charge carrier trapping-and-release [24,25]. Interpretation of the energy of photoelectrons from amorphous silicon in terms of an exponential tailing of the density-of-states was proposed by Peterson et al [26]. Noting that the transport of charge carriers takes place around the ME, the band edge in the Schottky-Mott model for an ideal junction is replaced with the ME, which is experimentally determined from the onset of the UPS or IPES signals and referred to as the band edge of the same semiconductor in its crystalline phase [27,28].",

The same effect leads to the enhancement of the phononless high frequency conductivity [3]. Both phenomena are determined by rare, isolated from each other pairs of states. When comparing Eq. (4) with formulas for the high frequency conductivity one can easily find straightforward analogies if eU and d of this paper are replaced byhω and by the arm, r ω , of pairs which absorb radiation quantā hω.\n\nOur theory is applicable only to a barrier which height and thickness are uniform along a large area, S, of the contact which has many optimal pairs. If area of the barrier, S, is so small that in average there is less than one optimal pair, the situation becomes mesoscopic. This happens at S ∼ S c , where S c = κ −6 e 12 (eU ) −1 (eU + e 2 /κd) −5 a −2 (a 0 d) −1 . (7) At S ≪ S c the tunneling conductance is determined by the best pair which can be found in this area of the barrier. Such a pair is longer than d by a random length δr. Therefore, tunneling conductance of a barrier with S ≪ S c has an additional small factor exp(−2δr/a). Of course, in such conditions the conductance of the tunneling contact strongly fluctuates from a sample to sample. This is why we call this case mesoscopic.",

For the sake of simplicity, we adjusted the experimental curve considering only two levels (HOMO and LUMO) because the charging of the molecule will most likely involve these two levels. The best adjustment of the experimental data is obtained assuming the HOMO to be located at the equilibrium Fermi level [50]. For this calculation, a charging energy of E c =0.19 eV was used, which is comparable to values reported for C 60 molecules by Porath et al [47]. This is about one order of magnitude smaller than the calculated charging energy for an isolated molecule but a strong reduction of the charging energy is expected for molecules adsorbed onto metallic electrodes. As can be seen in Fig. 11, a good qualitative description of the experimental data can be obtained once the tunneling barrier parameters are adjusted to fit the magnitude of the current step. A prefactor is included to account for the barrier suppression at high bias [51] (See Appendix A). The phenomenological parameters (accounting for the barrier height and width respectively) used to fit the data are φ =0.47eV and d=5.3Å. This approximation is a very crude way to account for the contact barriers at both ends of the molecule. However, though the value for the barrier width is large, the orders of magnitude for φ and d are not irrealistic.",

First, there is no thermally generated free charge carriers inside the organic semiconductor so that it is fully depleted and behaves like a pure dielectric. Second, only holes are injected from both electrodes (hole-only conduction). The result can be straightforwardly extended to the electron-only or bipolar conduction. For the latter instance, it is sufficient to add the electron and hole currents. Third, hole mobility is constant and independent of the hole concentration and electric field. The former is founded on the comparison of the charge carrier density-dependent mobility in diodes and transistors [36], which demonstrated that the mobility is low and less dependent on the charge carrier concentration in diodes where hole concentration is much lower than in transistors. In addition, the latter is established on the comparison of the electric field-dependence of mobility in diodes and transistors [37], which indicates that the mobility is less sensitive to the electric field in diodes. In section 5, the third assumption will be analysed in more detail by comparing the results from analytical and numerical modelling.

For negative bias, transport is blocked up to a critical bias −V * ; the energy scale |eV * | is roughly related to the situation where the H-level at a site j and the L-level at site j + 1 become nearly resonant (additionally, at least the first site of the H-strand should move above the left chemical potential in order to have a current flow).\n\nOnce this happens, an exponential current onset can occur. We have used two different modeling strategies based on two possible different microscopic transport mechanisms: hopping transport (HT) and coherent tunneling (CT). HT seems to be reasonable, since it is expected that the active device region displays some degree of static and dynamic disorder which may suppress coherent tunneling pathways over long distances. We have used a reduced density matrix approach 22  ages can be qualitatively described within both transport regimes. Notice, however, the different number of sites needed in both regimes to account for the experimental curves, This is related to the fact that tunneling processes can still be efficient for short lengths, so that almost no zero-current gap is obtained. Only with increasing length tunneling transport is blocked at low bias. . For s = p (sites on different strands), one obtains ε s j+1 −ε p j = ∆ H−L −κ +eV /N; from here it is obvious that for V > 0 the temperature dependence is mainly determined by the gap ∆ H−L k B T (large slope). For negative bias, ∆ H−L can be partially compensated by the term −κ − e|V |/N and thus the temperature dependence may be weakened.\n\n\n13\n\nA more accurate quantitative analysis requires a systematic experimental study of the temperature dependence, taking also the influence of the transport layers into account.",

The calculated I-V curves are shown in the main text, see Fig. 4. The theoretical curves were scaled by an arbitrary factor, since the experiments measure current densities and in our approach only currents are calculated.

At the barrier thickness smaller than average distance between impurities no Coulomb gap feature can be found. This happens because such tunneling is sensitive to very rare shortest pairs of occupied and empty states localized at opposite sides of the barrier, whose density of states in this limit has no Coulomb gap. Small area tunneling contacts are also discussed. It is shown that the tunneling conductance of a point-like contact exponentially grows with the applied voltage. This dependence does not permit a direct measurement of the Coulomb gap.",

Enhanced conduction is expected when the latter matches either the HOMO (when the tip is positively biased) or the LUMO (when the tip is negatively biased) energies. However, because the HOMO and the LUMO states are usually coupled differently to the metals (for example, in the aromatic thiols the HOMO is a sulfurbased orbital that couples strongly to the metal while the HOMO is a ring-based orbital that couples weakly to it), this implies strong asymmetry, about zero voltage, in the current-voltage dependence, i.e. rectification.

Thus, for organic semiconductors with structural and energetic disorder, the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) was proposed considering a unique electronic structure of organic semiconductors. It establishes that all states are localized and randomly distributed where thermally-assisted tunnelling and trapping (also known as hopping) occurs simultaneously [2]. However, the model focuses on the transport mechanisms, and the role of charge carrier injection has been overlooked in its application to device modelling.\n\nA key parameter governing charge carrier injection is the injection barrier (IB). In the historical point of view, the concept of the IB was firstly provided by Schottky and Mott, as the difference in metal work function and the ionization energy (electron affinity) for holes (electrons), developed for, establishing on the band theory, an ideal metal/semiconductor junction without interaction of any type [3,4].\n\nThe theoretical developments on the IB of the metal/ organic semiconductor (M/O) junctions have dealt with the issues arisen against the Schottky-Mott rule. For example, the existence of an interface dipole was one of the most widely studied issues, which induces the vacuum level mismatch at the junction correspondingly modifying the IB [5]. In addition, the attempts to eliminate the IB by selecting a metal with its work function close to the semiconductor ionization energy (IE) or electron affinity (EA) and their fundamental limit have also been of interest for M/O junctions [6].\n\nThrough systematic investigations on these phenomena, it has been shown that the vacuum level mismatch can be incorporated into the effective work function of metal [5]. However, there is still a lack of a physically-based definition of the IB which fully considers the unique features of the GDOS due to divergent definitions of the IE and EA. A fundamental question on how must the IE and EA be determined for organic semiconductors considering the GDOS with indistinct edges has not been clearly answered. Moreover, the consequence of these divergent definitions on device modelling has not been elaborated sufficiently.",

The ESQC technique ignores both the electronelectron and electron-phonon interactions and neglects charging effects.

This provides support to the hypothesis that the step like features in the I-V curve indeed originate in the discreteness of the molecular levels. However a quantitative fit of the data has not been achieved. This may be explained as follows. First, the effect of the applied bias on the relative position of the resonances in the T (E) spectrum is neglected, since we consider that the bias effect is to shift T (E) as a whole. Although the electric fields involved in the experiments are always lower than 1 × 10 9 V/m, the position of the levels is expected to be modified [52]. Preliminary calculation using the DFT formalism have shown that the HOMO-LUMO gap of the bisthiol-bisthiophene molecule is indeed reduced under an electric field [53], and this effect is expected to take place also with T3. Another effect of the field is to modify the coupling between the molecule and the electrodes. This should show up in the T (E, V ) spectrum as a modification of the width of the peaks and consequently in the I(V) as a modification of the height of the steps.\n\nSecond, in the calculation, the molecule is assumed to be in the vacuum. In reality, given the experimental conditions, the molecule can be assumed to be surrounded by Argon and probably a few solvent molecules. We have not taken this environment into account in our calculations. Smoothing of the theoretical I-Vs of both models is ex-pected due to this polarizable surrounding.",

We particularly focus our attention on the limiting case where all diffusion coefficients tend to infinity (the \"reaction-limited\" case) and particles cannot simply diffuse out of the reaction volume. (We would say that the boundaries of the volume are \"reflective\".) In this case, the position of a particle at a time t + t is a uniform random variable independent of its position at time t. To see this, note that the updated position of a particle conditioned on its previous position will be a Gaussian random variable with large variance; the boundary conditions cause this distribution to approximate a uniform distribution, and the approximation improves as the variance grows. Now, consider a reaction of the form A + B → ∅, with rate λ and reaction distance ρ. The symbol ∅ denotes that we are not interested in the products of the reaction. The probability that a reaction occurs between a given pair of A and B molecules in a time period [t, t + t) is given by:\nP(reaction in [t, t + t)) = K (ρ, [t, t + t))λ t,(49)\nwhere K (ρ, [t, t + t)) represents the exact proportion of the time interval [t, t + t) for which the given pairs are within a distance ρ of each other. Typically, K not only is unknown, but also is itself a random variable, so that reactions in the λ − ρ model are doubly stochastic processes. In the limiting case where D → ∞, K becomes a known random variable. At any given time point in [t, t + t), each molecule is uniformly distributed, so that the probability of any pair being within ρ of each other is some constant c. The constant c is approximately equal to 4πρ 3 3V , the proportion of the total volume occupied by a sphere of radius ρ; c is not exactly equal to this quantity because of boundary effects: if one particle is close to a boundary, there will be less space around it for a second particle to react in. However, these kinds of effects are typically numerically very small, and the approximation is usually excellent.",

Chemical reaction kinetics in vivo differs significantly from the one in pipette [1]. Geometry of the living cell interior can be quite complicated and there is experimental evidence that the cell is structured in many ways, already starting at the cytoplasm level. For example, for a single cell the total amount of protein content can be as high as 17-30% by weight which results in extremely structured and crowded space. In addition, the cell interior (roughly 10µm in diameter) is further partitioned in smaller spaces such as organelles (e.g. mitochondria with 50 nm in diameter), and roughly 50% of the cell volume is filled by organelles. For typical physiological concentrations of individual proteins of 1nM one gets N prot ∼ 1nM(10µm) 3 ∼ 1000 copies of individual protein. This can result in large spatio-temporal fluctuations of protein number. Also, delivery of proteins can become an issue.\n\nThere are two ways to theoretically study such complicated reaction environment, either by performing stochastic simulations or by constructing equations of motion that describe time evolution of averaged quantities (e.g. concentration). The focus will be on the later. It will be argued that any attempt to describe intracellular chemical reactions in terms of mean field equations (that assume perfect mixing) might fail spectacularly. Intracellular dynamics is intrinsically stochastic due to low number of chemicals, exclusion effects are important and, ultimately, many scales interact at the same time with large degree of spatio-temporal organization. To develop theoretical framework that can be used to describe such situation is far from trivial. The theory of diffusion controlled reactions naturally suggests itself in this context. In the following some generic features of diffusion controlled reaction will be discussed with a particular emphasis on mathematical/physical models that are used to describe them. The validity of the truncated equation of motion approach will be critically reviewed, with a particular emphasis on its simplest form, the mean field equations/kineteics.\n\n\nDiffusion controlled reactions: mathematical model",

The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) generalises the CME, in an approximate way, to include diffusion. Space is partitioned into small volume elements (\"voxels\") of equal volume, each considered to be well-mixed (although globally the space is not well-mixed). In each voxel, chemical reactions occur and diffusion of chemicals occurs as a hopping of particles between neighbouring voxels. The RDME is the Markovian description of this lattice-based reaction-diffusion system. Unlike the CME, the RDME currently has no rigorous microscopic physical basis, but can be justified intuitively, and has been shown to be accurate under certain conditions [3][4][5][6].\n\nThe RDME and the CME describe the same systems, but the RDME claims greater accuracy in the sense that it contains all the information of the CME while incorporating local spatial effects which are beyond its scope. Since we know the CME to be valid if diffusion rates are fast [1], a useful test of the validity of the RDME is that it should converge to the CME in the limit of infinite diffusion rates. This convergence seems intuitively likely: if diffusion rates are fast then particles hop between voxels much more frequently than they react, and so the well-mixedness assumption of the CME should be recovered.",

Panel (a) shows a situation when L a and reactants have space to move and do not disturb each other. Such situation is often modeled by assuming that the size of the reaction volume L is infinite. Also it is assumed that products of the reaction P do not exert influence on the reactants leading to a simplification that reactants annihilate without further trace leading to A + B → / 0 (or A + A → / 0). These approximations are very good when L a. Panel (c) shows an opposite situation when a ∼ L (and still a < L). In such a case reactants do not have space to move and one needs to consider exclusion effects. Panel (c) shows intermediate case.

Two facts help us to evaluate n (i) A (t + t). Firstly, because there are huge numbers of molecules of all types in all subvolumes, a huge number of reaction events of each type will happen in the time period [t, t + t). This implies that we do not need to think about the probability that a reaction happens, but the number of times it happens, and by the law of large numbers this number will converge (in the limit of high concentrations) to its expected value. Secondly, even though a huge number of reactions will happen in [t, t + t), t is still small, so the total molecule numbers will not change significantly over that period. This means that we can use n (i) A (t) to refer to the value of n (i) A at any point in the interval [t, t + t). Following this argument, for system (2) in a volume V with length L divided linearly into M subvolumes, thinking about the rates of the processes which can increase or decrease n (i) A , we find that we can write:\nn (i) A (t + t) = n (i) A (t) − k 1 M V n (i) A (t)n (i) B (t) t + k 2 n (i) C (t) t + D A M 2 L 2 n (i−1) A (t) − 2n (i) A (t) + n (i+1) A (t) t.(35)\nNote that we have used the volume scaling k 1 M V for the bimolecular reaction.

In colloids this is called diffusiophoresis. Diffusiophoresis is typically defined [5][6][7][8]10] as the motion of a larger particle immersed in concentration gradients of smaller molecules, when both are in a solvent (such as water). Although often difficult to measure, there are clearly gradients inside metabolically active cells. So there must be diffusiophoresis occurring in cells, the question is: Does diffusiophoresis make a significant contribution to the transport of some species? Here, I determine that the answer to this question is probably yes for particles at least tens of nanometres or more across, but no for individual protein molecules.\n\nI start with the standard Brownian-dynamics approximation for the position of a particle, r(t) [20]. With this approximation, we can write the change in position over the time interval t to t + δt, as [20],\nr(t + δt) = r(t) + 2D (c) P δt 1/2 ρ + [v adv + U] δt + D (c) P kT f δt(1)\nThis equation includes four possible transport mechanisms for the particle. The second term on the right-hand side is the conventional thermal diffusion term. There D (c) P is the diffusion constant for thermal diffusion in the cytoplasm, and ρ is a vector of random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution of mean zero, and standard deviation one. The physics of this term is that the particle is constantly being bombarded by the surrounding molecules, due to their thermal energy. This tends to move the particle around, but this motion is opposed by the friction between a moving particle and these same molecules.",

The frame of reference is fixed at the center of A, and B molecules diffuse freely with a diffusion coefficient given by D = D A + D B . The concentration gradient of B molecules around A is denoted by c(r, t), and it obeys\n∂c(r, t) ∂t = ∇ · D∇c(r, t) .

Whenever a B molecule reaches σ by diffusion, a reaction occurs immediately. We call this a purely diffusion-controlled reaction since the rate only depends on the time it takes B to diffuse into the reaction boundary. This is modeled with a purely-absorbing boundary condition c(σ, t) = 0, which yields the steady state and the forward reaction rate\nc ss (r) = c 0 R R − σ 1 − σ r , k S (R) = 4πDσ R R − σ (2.\n2) since k S (R) = 4πDσ 2 c ss (σ)/c 0 . As R → ∞, this simply becomes c ss ∞ (r) = c 0 [1 − σ/r] and k S = 4πDσ, which is Smoluchowski's original result [2]. A more general approach uses a partially-absorbing boundary condition [1,22], 4πσ 2 D∂c(r, t)/∂r r=σ = κc(σ, t), where κ controls the degree of diffusion-influence in the reaction rate. In this case, the steady state and reaction rate as R → ∞ are\nc ss (r) = c 0 1 − κσ k S + κ 1 r , k f = κk S κ + k S .

Contrastingly, if the system size is much larger than ℓ K , distant regions fluctuate independently, and the system is described by local reaction process and diffusion, validating the use of reaction-diffusion equation.\n\nFor example, consider the reaction\nA k −→ X, 2X k ′ −→ B.\nIf the concentration of chemical A is set to be constant, the chemical X is produced at the constant rate k, while it decays with the reaction 2X → B at the rate k ′ . The average concentration of X at the steady state is X = kA/2k ′ , where A is the concentration of the chemical A. Thus the average lifetime of X at the steady state is estimated to be τ = 1/(2k ′ X ) = 1/ √ 2kk ′ A. If X molecules diffuse at the diffusion constant D in one-dimensional space, the typical length over which an X molecule diffuses in its lifetime is estimated to be\nℓ K = √ 2Dτ ,(1)\nwhich gives the Kuramoto length.\n\nIn these works, it is assumed that the average distance between molecules is much smaller than ℓ K , and there is a large number of molecules within the region of the length ℓ K . Thus the concentration of the chemical X can be regarded as a continuous variable. Hence the continuum description is valid. However, if the average distance between molecules is comparable to or larger than ℓ K , local discreteness of molecules may not be negligible.",

Such non-classical distributions with non-exponential behavior are generally the signature of anomalous diffusion and the mean squared displacement then follows a power law in the time variable: r 2 ∼ t γ with 0 < γ = 1 (while γ = 1 for regular diffusion). Depending on whether γ < 1 or γ > 1, one talks about sub-diffusion when the particles are e.g. delayed in their diffusive motion by the presence of obstacles or because of the structural complexity of the medium or because of molecular interactions, and super-diffusion when their motion is e.g. enhanced by concentration effects or by an external field.\n\nFundamental constraints in constructing a theory of anomalous diffusion are then needed to reproduce a mean-squared displacement that exhibits power-law behavior as a function of time and the fundamental demand for the existence of self-similar solutions, i.e. such that all moments scale similarly, r 2n ∼ t nγ .

The diffusion coefficient is essentially a measure of the rate at which a randomly diffusing particle moves around the reaction volume. A particle with a very high diffusion coefficient could have diffused all over the volume in a short time t, whereas a particle with a small diffusion coefficient may only have covered a small region of space. (The average distance covered by a diffusing molecule before it reacts is known as the Kuramoto length, see Ref. Grima and Schnell 2008.) It follows that the principle of mass action could plausibly apply if particles have very high diffusion coefficients, so that any pair could potentially collide in a short time t. This idea can actually be proved from a microscopic point of view (and we will demonstrate this later), but only if we assume all particles have infinite (or practically infinite) diffusion coefficients. (Of course, the concept of an \"infinite diffusion coefficient\" is physically impossible, and we will address this point shortly.) Doubting the principle of mass action is then essentially equivalent to believing that the diffusion coefficients might not be high enough for the reaction volume to be well mixed, and this is a sensible belief as far as cell biology is concerned (Wojcieszyn et al. 1982). Clearly, an alternative approach is needed: in particular, we want a model which can tell us how many pairs of particles are \"close together\" at any given time.\n\nThe simplest way to go about this is to subdivide the entire reaction volume into small subvolumes, with the implication that we will consider molecules in the same subvolume to be \"close together\", while molecules in different subvolumes are not. Suppose we have chosen to divide our volume into M subvolumes, which for simplicity we assume are equally sized; then, the probability of a reaction involving A and B in subvolume i will be proportional to n\n(i) A n (i) B , where n (i)\nX denotes the number of molecules of species X in subvolume i.

In any inhomogeneous solution, there are concentration gradients, and particles move either up or down these gradients due to a mechanism called diffusiophoresis. I estimate that inside metabolically active cells, the dynamics of particles can be strongly accelerated by diffusiophoresis, provided that they are at least tens of nanometres across. The dynamics of smaller objects, such as single proteins are largely unaffected.\n\nThe cytoplasm of cells is far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and far from uniform [1][2][3][4]. Here, I consider the effect of concentration gradients on the motion of large particles in the cytoplasm. Large means tens of nanometres and above, so an example would be a large protein assembly. In the cytoplasm, particles and molecules are not diffusing alone in a dilute solution, but are moving in a concentrated, active and non-uniform mixture of proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites such as ATP, small ions such as potassium, etc. A schematic of a particle in the cytoplasm, is shown in Fig. 1.",

LMA is strictly valid when the rate k 0 is a concentration independent constant. For example, LMA works well for dilute solutions, where this \"rate law\" was originally developed. However, its range of applicability did not stay confined within just the purview of dilute solutions. Its simplicity and the ubiquity of association reactions have led to its application in disparate problems [16] with varying amount of success. However, it is unclear whether some of the assumptions underlying LMA are still valid for these systems. For example, most cell-signaling reactions occur on two dimensional cell membranes, where, often, the intrinsic reaction rates are higher or comparable to the diffusive encounter rate, such that the reaction kinetics depends crucially on the diffusive transport of the molecules. In particular, the peculiarities of diffusion in two dimension (2D), including nonzero probability of encounter between all particles [17,18], can result in concentration dependent diffusive encounter rates, which, in turn, results in a concentration dependent k 0 , which invalidates the application of LMA in such situations [19,20]. Furthermore, a fundamental assumption of LMA is that the molecules are essentially point particles that interact with each other only when they collide with each other [21]. In reality, most molecules interact with each other through finite, albeit short-ranged, interactions, which may also influence the diffusion-limited reaction rates. In fact, in such situations also, the diffusion limited reaction rate, κ, may become concentration dependent [14,19,22] and violate the assumptions of LMA.",

VARIOUS EXTENSIONS\n\nThe basic description of diffusion-controlled reactions via Eqs.(5,8) has been generalized in different ways.Most efforts were dedicated to extensions of the diffusion equation ( 5) that describes the simplest diffusive motion of reactants, the so-called Brownian motion.For instance, the Fokker-Planck equation allows one to incorporate the effects of external potentials (e.g., an electric field acting on a charged particle), anisotropy, and space-and/or timedependence of the diffusion coefficient [55][56][57][58].Fractional space and time derivatives can further include nonlocal displacements and memory effects in continuous-time random walks [59][60][61][62].Diffusing diffusivity and switching diffusivity models were proposed to describe the diffusive transport in dynamically heterogeneous media or in the presence of buffer molecules that may reversibly bind the reactant and thus randomly change its diffusion coefficient [63][64][65][66].The addition of a linear term proportional to [A] to the right-hand side of the diffusion equation ( 5) can account for first-order disintegration mechanisms such as photo-bleaching, bulk relaxation, radioactive decay, or a finite lifetime of the reactant [67][68][69], as well as the effect of diffusion-sensitizing magnetic field gradient encoding in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging [70].Moreover, the diffusion equation with nonlinear terms in [A] can describe reaction waves and many out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions involving \"activators\" and \"inhibitors\" (e.g., Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction), paving a way to the theory of pattern formations initiated by A. Turing [1,71].",

Argon was chosen because it is a simple monatomic molecule, commonly used in industry, and its critical properties are not at excessively low temperatures (ex. Helium). Argon has a molar mass MM of 39.9 g/mole, a critical pressure P c of 4.863 MPa, a critical temperature T c of 150.687 K, a critical density of 535 kg/m 2 , and a critical specific volume V c of 1.8692 cm 3 /g.\n\nThe model will take the dimensionless reduced temperature T R and reduced specific volume V R as inputs. The temperature is easily calculated as T = T R ·T c , and the volume (for one mole) is calculated as V = V R ·V c ·M M . From the known volume of the sphere, the radius and surface area are easily calculated as\nR sphere = ( 3 π·4 ·V sphere ) 1 3 ,(23)A sphere = 4·π·R 2 sphere ,\nThe model has the option of simulating the particle at a constant speed for a given temperature, if so the speed is constantly the v RMS speed for the given temperature defined in equation 20. The model also gives the option of simulating a profile of faster and slower speeds; the speed profile will maintain the same RMS average speed defined in equation 20, and the average speed v avg (m/s) will be determined as\nv avg = v RMS · 8 3·π .(24)\nIf the model calls for N Y velocity increments to be simulated, a subroutine in the Fortran code will generate a N Y ·1 vector-array, ranging from 0.2 to 1.8, averaging 1.0, with a standard deviation of 0.71. This vector-array will be multiplied by the average molecule velocity at the boundary v avg ; the RMS of the velocity vector-array will be equal to v RMS determined with 20.",

As expected, it is clear looking at Table 24 and 25 that while the entropy of the fluid increases, the entropy of the surrounding universe is decreasing (and vice versa); it is observed, however, that the magnitude in the change in entropy is consistently different despite the fact that identical heat transfer occurs at identical temperatures. The net change in entropy at the conclusion of this cycle ( δs 1 + δs 0 ) = δs 1 is -1.6104 J/K, suggesting a net reduction of entropy to the universe for each revolution of one mole of high-pressure argon throughout this cycle, due to the intermolecular attractive Van der Waal force [16], in violation of Clausius' Theorem [1] described in equation 3. In addition, the net entropy of the high-pressure argon working fluid δs 0 is 0 J/K as this cycle is internally reversible.\n\nOne observation is that the total entropy of the real-fluid argon, when utilizing the empirical equation 47 and the numerically obtained standard deviations for the molecule position and velocity, is consistently greater than for a mole of ideal gas argon of comparable temperature (equation 22). The intermolecular attractive forces add to the RMS velocities (typically 10% increase), and require the molecules to travel (on average) a longer spatial distance to move throughout the spherical container. In an ideal gas, the increase in entropy (equation 4) for a given quantity of heat energy input is reduced for higher entropy fluids (i.e. hotter temperatures). The same holds true for fluids of identical temperatures, but differences in entropy; the entropy of the real fluid is higher, but the increase in entropy for a given heat input is less than the decrease in entropy (defined equation 22) of the ideal-gas surrounding universe.

The reason for this is that the overall change in pressure of the real fluid includes the pressure reduced from the attractive force, as well as the change in time for the molecule to travel across the spherical volume. An increasing force will inherently accelerate the molecule towards the center, and decelerate it towards the other side, reducing the travel time, and thus increasing the pressure.

One striking and influential result obtained in this way is the degree to which liquid argon's velocity autocorrelation function exhibits non-monotonic behavior. See Figure 3a. (Hard spheres have much smaller negative-velocity correlations. The more interesting result for hard spheres is the long-time power-law decay of positive velocity correlations (20) manifesting a coupling between collective hydrodynamic modes and the velocity of the tagged particle.) With Rahman's simulations, we had for the first time precise \"experimental\" results for correlation functions of a realistic liquid where the microscopic interactions and laws of motion were completely determined. This lack of ambiguity is the ultimate challenge to theorists -no arbitrary fitting parameters allowed! Asked at the GRC about the cost of his calculations, Rahman demurred by saying it was trivial in comparison to one hour's expense in the ongoing Vietnam War. Nowadays, after decades of exponential decrease in cost per computing cycle (Moore's law), computing cost is not generally a relevant variable.\n\nComputer simulation became a new form of experimentation, with omnipotent and omniscient experimenters.\n\nVerlet seized upon Rahman's work, significantly improving its algorithmic efficiencies by introducing the Verlet integrator and the Verlet neighbor list (17). He was thereby able to significantly extend what could then be accomplished with the approach. Results he presented at the 1967 GRC (e.g., Figure 3b) concluded with the demonstration that \"most of [liquid argon] structure ... at high density is due to the geometrical effects produced by the existence of strong [interparticle repulsions] and that freezing transition of the model hard-sphere gas is related to the actual liquid-solid transition.\"\n\n\nWCA Theory",

Figure 1 displays the result of a simulation of two designs: (1) even spacing allocation from x min to x max and (2) our proposed optimal design. We simulate under the response model where θ 0 = θ = 0.5 (i.e. as if the experimenter's a priori guess was the correct value). We will see that our proposed design here is very robust if the θ 0 guess was not correct in Section 3.4. In order to perform this simulation, we need guesses of two nuisance parameters, the true intercept β 0 and the true standard error of the residuals, σ (see Equation 3). We record an estimate of σ ≈ 3.2 × 10 −10 from the trial run and β 0 = 3.9 × 10 −9 . Note that once again, this initial run would not be performed. Thus, in order to gauge efficiency of the allocation we propose vis-a-vis others, one can guess β 0 and σ to be sets of reasonable previous values.",

In contrast, in traditional \"molecular beam sources\", the gas mean free path λ ≈ 1/(σ collision ·n gas ) is kept larger than the diameter of the gas chambers' exit aperture into the vacuum. Thus, gas molecules passing through the exit diaphragm will not undergo any subsequent collisions in the vacuum space and form a free molecular beam, in accordance with Stern's 1919 interpretation of Martin Knudsen's earlier published theory of gas flows in vacuum. 11 With this molecular beam functionality in mind, it is immediately obvious that an evaporating liquid water surface will be a free vacuum surface, accessible without any collisions in the emerging vapor gas phase, provided that the lateral extension D λ of the liquid surface area is smaller than the equilibrium vapor mean free path λ Hd 2 O . This constraint yields the criterion for a maximum liquid water surface extension of D λ ≤ λ Hd 2 O ≈ 10 μm, the mean free path at a vapor pressure of 6.1 mbar at the freezing point of pure water. 1,2 The small target area and associated small scattering signals did not appear prohibitively small from the point of view of gas phase scattering experiments.",

A process of this kind is admissible from the physical standpoint and was first conceived by Plank [6,Sect. 236] (see also [1, p. 41] and [3, p. 729]). Being adiabatic and reversible, the process will not produce any entropy change. It will not produce any change in the temperature of the gases either, since the latter are ideal and the process does not bring about any volume change.

To achieve steady-state voltammograms, we obeyed the relation v ≪ (RTD)/(nFr 2 ) with v as the sweep rate; r as the electrode radius; D as the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species; and R, T, n, and F have their usual meanings [10]. The \"≪\" sign was stretched to the factor 500 assuming diffusion coefficients of the electroactive species in the ballpark of 10 −11 m 2 s −1 due to the rather high viscosity of HMIM Br of 3.99 Pa s [15]. The simulation is a somewhat intricate task, because surface reactions or changes of surface states, resp., cannot be taken into account with DigiElch ® in the frame of semiinfinite two-dimensional diffusion simulation, which is mandatory for simulations of UME behaviour. Thus, the simulated CV shows the normal voltage-current characteristic of a simple one-electron transfer without adsorption or other phenomena (dashed red curve in Fig. 4a). Therefore, forward and reverse sweeps are almost congruent with the given experimental parameters. In the experiment, we observe a nonnormal voltage-current curve. Particularly, the reverse sweep deviates significantly from the forward sweep. On closer inspection, the steady-state current arrives at less negative electrode potential and is lower than in the simulation. These observations indicate the deceleration of electrode kinetics reported earlier [16]. Since we intentionally did not activate the electrode-platinum assembled as reference electrode operates without current load at any time-we observe this deceleration during the experiment. Thus, the relevant electrode kinetics has to be determined at early stages of the experiment. In the beginning of the experiment, the deceleration is not recognizable, and the fit of the major share of the forward sweep is straightforward with the following parameters: A second simulation of this CV reflecting the experimental reverse sweep was also performed with the same parameters excepting k 0 = 1.1 10 −7 cm s −1 (dashed blue curve in Fig. 4b).",

Like under 10 À4 mbar O 2 pressure, exposure to the higher pressure results in the appearance of a feature at 528.3 eV in the O 1s spectrum.However, under the higher pressure conditions, the oxygen coverage increases to approximately 0.67 ML, as determined by the O/Ag ratio, coincident with the c(6 Â 2) added-strand reconstruction.Inspection of Fig. 8 reveals that at 423 K the c(6 Â 2) phase does not become stable until the O 2 pressure exceeds 10 À2.5 bar.Thus, the correct phase is only predicted if a pressure correction of at least 10 2.5 bar is included, thereby establishing a minimum value for the pressure correction at 423 K.We can also identify a maximum error in pressure by noting that at 423 K under 10 À4 mbar O 2 pressure the p(2 Â 1) phase was dominant, implying a maximum error of 10 4 bar, in good agreement with the originally proposed 10 3 bar error at 423 K.",

The range of ∆µ O (defined as µ O − 1 2 E total O2 ) between the vertical dashed lines corresponds to the heat of formation of Ag 2 O, i.e., to the range in which bulk silver oxide is stable. It can be seen that for more O-rich conditions (right) the thicker oxide-like structures are favored over chemisorption on the surface. Clearly, in the limit of an infinitely thick film, the corresponding line would be very close to the vertical one at ∆µ O = −0.323 eV. It can be obtained from Fig. 2 that bulk silver oxide is stable to only around 350 K at atmospheric pressure, which is less than the experimental value of 460 K. At 460 K, the bulk oxide is unstable when the pressure is lower than 10 3 atm. i.e. compared to 1 atm. as observed experimentally. This difference may be due to systematic errors of the DFT approach 25 and/or to neglect of the entropy contributions. Therefore in Fig. 2 (and Fig. 3), we generally expect that the temperature is underestimated, but the error is less than 110 K, while correspondingly, the pressure is overestimated. For the temperature values quoted below, we give an estimate of the upper limit in brackets, that is, 110 K higher than that obtained from Fig. 2.

The Ag(111) substrate was prepared by cycles of Ar + ion sputtering (600 eV) and thermal annealing at 720 K. Mn(TpFPC) was sublimated at ultra-high vacuum conditions (base pressure <10 −9 mbar) from a quartz crucible at 500 K onto the substrate kept at room temperature and subsequently annealed at 360 K for 10 minutes. After precooling to 100 K, the samples were in-situ transferred into the STM chamber. STM experiments were performed at 5 K and a base pressure of <10 −10 mbar employing electrochemically etched tungsten tips that were thermally deoxidized by flash-annealing to above 1070 K. STM images were analyzed using the program WSxM. [4] The dI/dV signal was obtained with lockin technique adding a sinusoidal modulation (V=20 mV and ν=757 Hz) to the dc bias. Total-energy density functional calculations (DFT) have been performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package [5] including the projector-augmented wave method [6] for describing electron-ion interactions and the generalized gradient approximation (PW91 functional) [7] for modeling electron-electron exchange-correlation interactions. STM simulations were obtained via the Tersoff-Hamann model. [8] The STM measurements at the solid-liquid interface were performed at the HOPG-1-phenyloctane interface using a homebuilt liquid-STM.

Recall from the introduction that both electrophilic oxygen 10,11,21,22 and the bulk oxide [39][40][41] have been postulated to play an important role in ethylene epoxidation.But because these species may not appear on the equilibrium phase diagram, to identify candidate structures we must turn to the calculation of the spectroscopic properties of different Ag-O species.\n\nFocusing first on structures that were enumerated in the development of the phase diagram shown in Fig. 10, we see that we must consider species that may be present at locally higher concentrations of oxygen.At lower oxygen chemical potentials, only low coverages of chemisorbed atomic oxygen are predicted to be stable.At higher oxygen chemical potentials the thin oxide-like surfaces are the most stable surface structures.To form such an oxide-like layer, subsurface oxygen must be present.While Fig. 10 shows that subsurface oxygen is thermodynamically unfavorable under the experimental conditions, it may still appear as a transient species during the formation of a thin oxide-like layer.As previously noted, subsurface oxygen is widely believed to give rise to the feature at 530 eV in the O 1s spectrum. 24While we have already shown that this statement is not true for oxygen beneath the Ag(110) surface, oxygen below an Ag (111) surface may give rise to higher O 1s binding energies due to the different types of holes present, as discussed in the next section.\n\n\nSubsurface atomic oxygen",

Dissolving an oxygen atom in this more open grain boundary is exothermic by 0.31 eV relative to 1/2 gas phase O 2 , as compared to the 0.02 eV found for 1/16 ML in the octahedral holes under the pristine Ag (111) surface.Furthermore, increasing the oxygen concentration in the S5 grain boundary to 1/4 ML only reduces the adsorption energy by 0.02 eV per oxygen atom.This finding suggests that oxygen will preferentially dissolve in high S silver grain boundaries, when present, as opposed to the subsurface, and could help explain the high concentrations of dissolved oxygen found in thermal desorption experiments. 125owever, the formation energy of the higher S grain boundaries is large.",

[2] Interestingly at lower temperatures,b elow T C = 210 K, the point of the Mott-type metal-insulator transition (MIT) is obscured by ap ronounced liquid-liquid phase separation. [2] This illustrates that the localized and delocalized electron states do not readily co-exist, which is dramatically manifested by the fact that the more concentrated metallic solution floats above the dilute electrolytic phase for T < T c . [2,4] Above 8MPM the solutions do not exhibit phase separation, appearing golden up to the concentration limit of 20 MPM, [5] thee xpanded metal Li(NH 3 ) 4 . [6,7] Thec oncentration and temperature dependence of this liquid-liquid phase separation has been mapped through multi-element NMR spectroscopy. [8] Along with metal concentration, chemical tunability of the electronic properties of these systems can be achieved by varying the amine.L ithium will also dissolve in MeNH 2 to yield as ystem whereby solvated electrons transition to am etallic state. [3,[9][10][11][12] TheM IT in Li-MeNH 2 occurs at 15 MPM, an otably higher concentration than in Li-NH 3 . No liquid-liquid phase separation has been detected across the full concentration range of Li-MeNH 2 ,a nd the solution remains ad eep blue,a lbeit with am etallic luster. The conductivity of liquid Li(MeNH 2 ) 4 is 400 W À1 cm À1 (compared to 15 000 W À1 cm",

The concentration dependence of the static magnetic susceptibilities (4) in various M-MX solutions indicates that diamag netic spin paired centers are formed so that an equilibrium between Fcenters and aggregated centers must be considered. This is also indi cated by the concentration and temperature dependence of the optical spectra. Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption of Nax (NaBr)^_x in the range 0.005 £ x £ 0.042 at constant temperature (10); the total absorption has been deconvoluted into two bands, an F-band at 1.42 eV and a dimer band at 2 eV. At low concentrations these two bands are clearly sepa rated in the original extinction curves (10). With increasing tempera ture at constant x, the intensity of the dimer band decreases in propor tion to the increase of the F-band, indicating a dissociation equilib rium dimer J F-center. From the optical energy of 2 eV of the dimer band, it is not likely that this excitation can be assigned to such dia magnetic species as M~ or M 2; for the former, typical absorption ener gies of 1.5 to 1.8 eV have been found in different polar solvents (11).",

One way to lose excitation energy is by emitting a photon of 589.0 nm, a phenomenon known as atomic emission. A photon of 330.3 nm can also be absorbed by sodium. This is the difference of energy between 3s and a 4p orbital (3.6eV), but one photon of 400 nm cannot be absorbed because there are not two orbitals in a sodium atom with the same difference of energy. The return of electron from 4p orbital to ground state can also occur in two steps: first to 4s and then to 3s by emitting two photons with energies correspondent to the two transitions in a phenomenon known as atomic fluorescence. The sodium atom can also receive enough energy to remove an electron, turning into sodium ion (Na + ), known as ionization. In this case, a change occurs in orbitals of different energy levels, so that the ion has a new set of transition being able to absorb or emit photons of wavelengths differently from metallic sodium. Each chemical element has a unique electronic structure that differentiates from others. This implies in a possible and unique set of transitions, a set of characteristic absorption/emission lines that can be used for identification. Although the set of transitions is unique for each element, there may be a coincidence of spectrum in some lines of two or more elements, which means that different atoms can absorb or emit photons of same wavelength. Even though the theoretical basis was established in the beginning of the twentieth century, only in the early 1950s an Australian physicist, Sir Alan Walsh, proposed the phenomenon",

[1] Molecular dinitrogen complexes are of vivid interesti nn itrogen fixation and reduction since 1966, when the first iridium dinitrogen complex was published, shortly after the first transition metal dinitrogen complexes [Ru(NH 3 ) 5 N 2 ]X 2 with X = Br À ,I À and BF 4 À werer eported in 1965. [2] The activation and weakening of the strong triple bond in the N 2 molecule is facilitated by p-back-bonding from orthogonal d xz and d yz or even po rbitals into the antibonding p*-orbitals of the N 2 ligand. [1a, 2c, 3] This effect is readily observable spectroscopically by ar ed-shift of the NÀNs tretching mode compared to free dinitrogen in the IR spectra.A ll binary PGM dinitrogen complexes,e xcept those of iridium, werei nvestigated experimentally using matrix isolationt echniques, where metal atoms are generatedb yt hermale vaporation or laser ablation forR u, [4] Rh, [5] Pd, [6] Re, [7] Os, [4] and Pt. [6b, 8] By these methods homoleptic dinitrogen complexes M(N 2 ) n can be prepared, which allow the investigation of metal-nitrogen bondingi nteractions independent of the influence of other li-gands and thus give important insighti nto the bonding properties and mechanisms of dinitrogen activation.",

The complexes btph-acNac and btph-NacNac were sufficiently soluble for 13 C{ 1 H} NMR analysis, whereas for the rest high-resolution ESI mass spectrometry was used as an additional tool to ascertain the compound identity. NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECA-500 or ECA-600 spectrometer at room temperature. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded with a CHI 602E potentiostat interfaced to a nitrogen glovebox via wire feedthroughs. Samples were dissolved in MeCN with 0.1 M tetrabutyl hexafluorophosphate as the electrolyte. A 3 mm diameter glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a silver wire pseudoreference electrode were used. Potentials were referenced to an internal standard of ferrocene. Prior to collecting the CV of each complex, a blank scan on just the solvent and the electrolyte was conducted to ensure there was no appreciable background current. In a typical experiment, a clean baseline was observed in the potential range from +0.9 to −3.1 V versus Fc + /Fc, with all of the observed CV features (Figure 3) falling well within this range. Samples for UV−vis absorption and room-temperature photoluminescence measurements were prepared in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and contained in quartz cuvettes with threaded screw-cap enclosures. Samples for photoluminescence measurements at 77 K were prepared in a custom quartz EPR tube with a high-vacuum Teflon valve and immersed in liquid nitrogen using a finger dewar. UV−vis absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent Carey 8454 UV−vis spectrophotometer, and steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a Horiba FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer. Photoluminescence quantum yields were determined relative to a standard of tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) in toluene, which has a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.11. 43 Photoluminescence lifetimes were recorded on a Horiba DeltaFlex Lifetime System using 430 nm pulsed diode excitation.",

In this limit, the energy level of the lone pair (i.e. the HOMO of the nonstoichiometric system) corresponds to a donor impurity level in the HOMO/LUMO gap of the stoichiometric system, slightly below the bottom of the empty-state band. As the concentration increases, the impurity level broadens to a band, which eventually merges into the emptystate band of the stoichiometric system, thus turning the electrolyte into a metal. If the states near the Fermi energy stay localized by disorder, this transition would be delayed until the Fermi energy crosses the mobility edge. In either case, we believe that our conclusions hold in the electrolyte regime. The value of the concentration appro-priate to our model system, x ≈ 0.06, is below the critical value x c ≈ 0.1, at which an insulator-to-metal transition is expected to occur, resulting from experimental [24] and numerical [25,26] evidence.

                    "contents": "Reaching the potential of electron diffractionIt is helpful to consider the primary distinctions between X-ray and electron diffraction for structure determination, as the difference in scattering between the two sources dictates the crystal sizes needed (Figure 1).These experiments generate data from the interactions of electrons or X-rays with the sample, causing cohesive diffraction and constructive interference due to the ordered array of molecules that form crystals (Figure 2).In X-ray methods, X-ray photons scatter off the electron clouds around individual atoms.Since the X-ray photons are uncharged and mass-less, this interaction is quite weak.Therefore, larger, macroscopic crystals are typically required to generate a sufficient signal.In electron diffraction, by contrast, the nonzero mass and negative charge of the interrogating electrons allow much stronger interactions with the sample.The electron scattering is dictated by the electrostatic potential, which combines contributions from the electron charge density and the nuclear charge density, such that the strong Coulombic interactions enable diffraction from much smaller-volume crystals.The short mean-free path of electrons, in comparison to X-rays, allows diffraction data to be collected from crystals that are thousands of times smaller than those needed for X-ray diffraction data.Electrons accelerated within common electron microscopes have more interactions than X-rays when traveling equal distances within crystals, resulting in more diffraction and higher signals from small crystals.On the other hand, an electron traveling through a larger crystal may interact multiple times, resulting in noise or total signal loss from that electron.Indeed, these multiple scattering events were considered one of the primary obstacles to the utility of MicroED methods.The extent of this \"dynamical diffraction\" derives directly from the density, thickness, and intrinsic ordering of the crystal, as well as from the energy of the impinging electron and the angle of orientation of the crystal to the electron beam.In addition to enabling the measurement of full reflections more accurately, continuous rotation methods also assist with the latter feature. 13,14While higher energies for the electrons reduce the likelihood of scattering in general, crystal size remains a fundamental influence on dynamical diffraction.Therefore, it is critical to have high-quality small crystals suitable for MicroED experiments.",

The non-negligible difference between the two diffraction signals stems from the greater contrast (variation) in the electron diffraction signal, which ultimately can be traced to the additional contributions from the nuclei. The difference is very small in the small angle scattering, but increases at intermediate angles and remains fairly significant to 11 Å À1 , corresponding to comparatively high resolution. The difference also appears to increase over time, an issue that we will address below. We proceed to demonstrate that a large part of the difference between the electron and X-ray scattering signal stems from the greater sensitivity of electron scattering to nuclear motion. In ethylene, at longer times the most distinct motion is associated with the hydrogen atoms, while the carbon-carbon dynamics is strongly dispersed. Using ''computational alchemy\" we set all distances associated with the H-atoms to large values (>1000 Å), thus quenching the contribution of the H-atoms to the structural interference term (I mol ), while leaving their contribution to the atomic scattering (I at ) unaffected. We examine the effect of this modification, by plotting DdS The results are shown in Fig. 4. The main differences between the ''modified\" and the ''normal\" diffraction appear in the interval 2 < q < 8 Å À1 for both electrons (Fig. 4a) and X-rays (Fig. 4b). It is clear from the two contour plots, both plotted using the same color axis, that the effect of the H-atoms on the diffraction pattern is far greater for electron diffraction. Looking at the electron diffraction in Fig. 4a there is also a comparative increase in the difference signal over time, which is largely absent in the X-ray diffraction in Fig. 4b. This leads to the conclusion that the increased difference between electron and X-ray diffraction observed at long times in Fig. 3c can be ascribed to diffraction from the small amplitude motion of the H-atoms, emphasising the sensitivity of electron diffraction to nuclear dynamics.\n\n\nConclusions",

All the amplitudes will be coherently related which makes the inverse problem of estimating the structure from the diffraction pattern a difficult challenge. Also, any unforeseen microstructure features may confuse the interpretation. The dominating features in a diffraction pattern are the strong peaks that Bragg (1913) associated with specular (mirror) reflections from crystal planes. This explanation assumes that all the atoms aligned in these planes concentrate their amplitudes at one position and can be simply interpreted, or that the amplitude diminishes from the peak due to size effects (James, 1962;Authier, 2001) etc., which is the shape transform.\n\nSoon after Bragg published his explanation, Darwin (1914) recognized that the scattering from a set of parallel planes introduces re-scattering from the underside of planes above. This led to the diminution of the incident beam and explained the width of the profile. Ewald (1916Ewald ( , 1917 and Laue (1931) took this further and introduced the polarizability of the electron density by the incoming electromagnetic wave by considering the crystal as a series of dipoles (Ewald) and a distributed electron density (Laue). These two works form the basis of the interaction of the incident wave and the crystal. The electric field vector component parallel to the surface must be continuous which defines the location (2) of the scattered intensity for a given incident angle (James, 1962;Fewster, 2015 etc.). This gives the profile shape and its direction, e.g. crystal truncation rods.",

We therefore outline our procedure before applying it to experimental results. The resulting curve can be called the interference signal and an analogous parameter is used in conventional electron diffraction [1]. In principle, the interference signal can be calculated by subtracting either theoretical simulations or the backscattered electron distributions from atoms with similar ionisation potentials that were measured under the same experimental conditions. Here, and for the first time, we calculate the interference signal from LIED by subtracting an empirically determined background (ρ B ) from the logarithm of ρ E , ρ = log 10 (ρ E ) -log 10 (ρ B ) = log 10 (ρ E /ρ B ).\n\nWe test our empirical background fitting procedure on independent atom model based simulations that were calculated following procedures that have been outlined previously [11,23].",

                    "contents": "Attomicroscopy: from femtosecond to attosecond electron microscopyUltrafast Electron Diffraction\n\nSince the discovery of X-rays in 1895, diffraction techniques permitted the resolution of threedimensional (3D) structures of different type of systems, from simple structures such as diatomic molecules (NaCl) to more complex systems such as DNA, proteins, and viruses [30,31]. Later, the discovery of electron in 1897 paved the way for the establishment of electron diffraction, which allows the determination of gas-phase structure, surface structural analysis, and structural determination of biological systems [31]. Electron diffraction has remarkable advantages over the X-ray diffraction technique due to the electron nature, which we will explain at the end of this section. Although the electron and/or X-ray diffraction are powerful techniques for resolving the static spatial arrangements of atoms, the knowledge of structural dynamics remains necessary for revealing the mechanism of atomic motion. Therefore, introducing the time domain in these techniques was necessary.\n\nThe earliest efforts on introducing time resolution into electron diffraction were made for short time domains (milli-to-micro second time scale) [20]. Rood & Milledge [32] conducted studies on the radical dynamics in the gas phase by electron diffraction on the sub-millisecond time scale. Then, Bartell & Dibble [33] studied the phase change in clusters that are produced in supersonic jets, with a time-offlight resolution of 1 µs. Later, Ewbank et al. [34,35] enhanced the temporal resolution to subnanoseconds by combining an intense-laser-initiated electron source with a linear diode array detector. In 1982, Mourou & Williamson [36] introduced the methodology of the modified Bradley-Sibbett streak camera to record the diffraction from thin aluminum films in the transmission mode with 100 ps pulses.",

Accounting for the actual electron density of the target is known to result in differences in the elastic scattering, something which may potentially be exploited to distinguish different electronic states [42,43]. Polarisation of the electron density, for instance around hydrogen atoms, is known to require corrections beyond the IAM model [44,45,42], and the additional scattering from the nuclei afforded by electrons is useful in those situations. It would be interesting to see UED data for the ultrafast dynamics of H 2 or D 2 in the gas-phase [46], or perhaps for tunneling in photoexcited dimer-molecules [47]. Looking further into the future, one may envision the detection of electronic structure using X-ray or electron scattering [48,49,42,50].  4.

[29].Finally, Fig. 7c displays the reconstructed 2D electron density of the particle, and represents a first convincing proof of principle of 2D structure determination based on the cross-correlation method.The upcoming challenge is to execute the experiment in 3D, which is accompanied by practical and computational complications.Extension to particles in solution will require a sufficient number of scattered photons within the rotational correlation time of the particles.It is thus evident to consider the FEL as the X-ray radiation source.\n\n\nOutlook",

This, however, implies averaging over many molecules whereby diverse and important conformational details remain indistinct. Besides this drawback, these methods can only be applied to a small subset of biological molecules that either readily crystallize to be used in X-ray studies or are small enough for NMR investigations [1]. A third approach for imaging molecules is cryo-electron microscopy. In the case of biological molecules the resolution is limited by radiation damage caused by the high electron energy in transmission electron microscopes. With a critical dose of (5-25 e -/Å 2 ) [2] an individual molecule is destroyed long before a decent quality image has been acquired. The radiation damage problem is countered by averaging over several thousand noisy images to end up with a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio of the averaged molecule structure [3]. The aligning and averaging routines inherent to cryo-electron microscopy limit its application range to symmetric and particularly rigid objects, like specific classes of viruses for example. In X-ray experiments, radiation damage is even more severe. Out of one million photons interacting with a biological molecule, only one is scattered elastically and carries structural information to the detector while all the other photons cause damage, be it by ionisation or other inelastic processes.\n\nDespite all limitations of the three conventional structural biology tools discussed above, one needs to express respect for the vast amount of data that has been generated over the past decades, reflected by the impressive volume of the current protein database [4].\n\nNevertheless, prospective structural biology definitely asks for methods and tools that do away with averaging over an ensemble of molecules but enable structural biology on a truly single molecule level. To obtain atomic resolution information about the structure of any individual biological molecule, entirely new concepts and technologies are needed. One approach of this kind is associated with the emerging X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) projects. They appeared initially as the novel technology to gain information from just one single biomolecule at the atomic scale by recording its X-ray diffraction pattern within just 10 fs before the molecule is decomposed by radiation damage [5].",

                    "contents": "Reaching the potential of electron diffractionIt is helpful to consider the primary distinctions between X-ray and electron diffraction for structure determination, as the difference in scattering between the two sources dictates the crystal sizes needed (Figure 1).These experiments generate data from the interactions of electrons or X-rays with the sample, causing cohesive diffraction and constructive interference due to the ordered array of molecules that form crystals (Figure 2).In X-ray methods, X-ray photons scatter off the electron clouds around individual atoms.Since the X-ray photons are uncharged and mass-less, this interaction is quite weak.Therefore, larger, macroscopic crystals are typically required to generate a sufficient signal.In electron diffraction, by contrast, the nonzero mass and negative charge of the interrogating electrons allow much stronger interactions with the sample.The electron scattering is dictated by the electrostatic potential, which combines contributions from the electron charge density and the nuclear charge density, such that the strong Coulombic interactions enable diffraction from much smaller-volume crystals.The short mean-free path of electrons, in comparison to X-rays, allows diffraction data to be collected from crystals that are thousands of times smaller than those needed for X-ray diffraction data.Electrons accelerated within common electron microscopes have more interactions than X-rays when traveling equal distances within crystals, resulting in more diffraction and higher signals from small crystals.On the other hand, an electron traveling through a larger crystal may interact multiple times, resulting in noise or total signal loss from that electron.Indeed, these multiple scattering events were considered one of the primary obstacles to the utility of MicroED methods.The extent of this \"dynamical diffraction\" derives directly from the density, thickness, and intrinsic ordering of the crystal, as well as from the energy of the impinging electron and the angle of orientation of the crystal to the electron beam.In addition to enabling the measurement of full reflections more accurately, continuous rotation methods also assist with the latter feature. 13,14While higher energies for the electrons reduce the likelihood of scattering in general, crystal size remains a fundamental influence on dynamical diffraction.Therefore, it is critical to have high-quality small crystals suitable for MicroED experiments.",

The non-negligible difference between the two diffraction signals stems from the greater contrast (variation) in the electron diffraction signal, which ultimately can be traced to the additional contributions from the nuclei. The difference is very small in the small angle scattering, but increases at intermediate angles and remains fairly significant to 11 Å À1 , corresponding to comparatively high resolution. The difference also appears to increase over time, an issue that we will address below. We proceed to demonstrate that a large part of the difference between the electron and X-ray scattering signal stems from the greater sensitivity of electron scattering to nuclear motion. In ethylene, at longer times the most distinct motion is associated with the hydrogen atoms, while the carbon-carbon dynamics is strongly dispersed. Using ''computational alchemy\" we set all distances associated with the H-atoms to large values (>1000 Å), thus quenching the contribution of the H-atoms to the structural interference term (I mol ), while leaving their contribution to the atomic scattering (I at ) unaffected. We examine the effect of this modification, by plotting DdS The results are shown in Fig. 4. The main differences between the ''modified\" and the ''normal\" diffraction appear in the interval 2 < q < 8 Å À1 for both electrons (Fig. 4a) and X-rays (Fig. 4b). It is clear from the two contour plots, both plotted using the same color axis, that the effect of the H-atoms on the diffraction pattern is far greater for electron diffraction. Looking at the electron diffraction in Fig. 4a there is also a comparative increase in the difference signal over time, which is largely absent in the X-ray diffraction in Fig. 4b. This leads to the conclusion that the increased difference between electron and X-ray diffraction observed at long times in Fig. 3c can be ascribed to diffraction from the small amplitude motion of the H-atoms, emphasising the sensitivity of electron diffraction to nuclear dynamics.\n\n\nConclusions",

                    "contents": "Estimating the structure factors in X-ray diffractionThe most complete description of diffraction should include all the scattered amplitudes from all the atoms at all detection positions, including atomic vibrations and re-scattering. All the amplitudes will be coherently related which makes the inverse problem of estimating the structure from the diffraction pattern a difficult challenge. Also, any unforeseen microstructure features may confuse the interpretation. The dominating features in a diffraction pattern are the strong peaks that Bragg (1913) associated with specular (mirror) reflections from crystal planes. This explanation assumes that all the atoms aligned in these planes concentrate their amplitudes at one position and can be simply interpreted, or that the amplitude diminishes from the peak due to size effects (James, 1962;Authier, 2001) etc., which is the shape transform.\n\nSoon after Bragg published his explanation, Darwin (1914) recognized that the scattering from a set of parallel planes introduces re-scattering from the underside of planes above. This led to the diminution of the incident beam and explained the width of the profile. Ewald (1916Ewald ( , 1917 and Laue (1931) took this further and introduced the polarizability of the electron density by the incoming electromagnetic wave by considering the crystal as a series of dipoles (Ewald) and a distributed electron density (Laue). These two works form the basis of the interaction of the incident wave and the crystal. The electric field vector component parallel to the surface must be continuous which defines the location (2) of the scattered intensity for a given incident angle (James, 1962;Fewster, 2015 etc.). This gives the profile shape and its direction, e.g. crystal truncation rods.",

We therefore outline our procedure before applying it to experimental results. The resulting curve can be called the interference signal and an analogous parameter is used in conventional electron diffraction [1]. In principle, the interference signal can be calculated by subtracting either theoretical simulations or the backscattered electron distributions from atoms with similar ionisation potentials that were measured under the same experimental conditions. Here, and for the first time, we calculate the interference signal from LIED by subtracting an empirically determined background (ρ B ) from the logarithm of ρ E , ρ = log 10 (ρ E ) -log 10 (ρ B ) = log 10 (ρ E /ρ B ).\n\nWe test our empirical background fitting procedure on independent atom model based simulations that were calculated following procedures that have been outlined previously [11,23].",

                    "contents": "Attomicroscopy: from femtosecond to attosecond electron microscopyUltrafast Electron Diffraction\n\nSince the discovery of X-rays in 1895, diffraction techniques permitted the resolution of threedimensional (3D) structures of different type of systems, from simple structures such as diatomic molecules (NaCl) to more complex systems such as DNA, proteins, and viruses [30,31]. Later, the discovery of electron in 1897 paved the way for the establishment of electron diffraction, which allows the determination of gas-phase structure, surface structural analysis, and structural determination of biological systems [31]. Electron diffraction has remarkable advantages over the X-ray diffraction technique due to the electron nature, which we will explain at the end of this section. Although the electron and/or X-ray diffraction are powerful techniques for resolving the static spatial arrangements of atoms, the knowledge of structural dynamics remains necessary for revealing the mechanism of atomic motion. Therefore, introducing the time domain in these techniques was necessary.\n\nThe earliest efforts on introducing time resolution into electron diffraction were made for short time domains (milli-to-micro second time scale) [20]. Rood & Milledge [32] conducted studies on the radical dynamics in the gas phase by electron diffraction on the sub-millisecond time scale. Then, Bartell & Dibble [33] studied the phase change in clusters that are produced in supersonic jets, with a time-offlight resolution of 1 µs. Later, Ewbank et al. [34,35] enhanced the temporal resolution to subnanoseconds by combining an intense-laser-initiated electron source with a linear diode array detector. In 1982, Mourou & Williamson [36] introduced the methodology of the modified Bradley-Sibbett streak camera to record the diffraction from thin aluminum films in the transmission mode with 100 ps pulses.",

Accounting for the actual electron density of the target is known to result in differences in the elastic scattering, something which may potentially be exploited to distinguish different electronic states [42,43]. Polarisation of the electron density, for instance around hydrogen atoms, is known to require corrections beyond the IAM model [44,45,42], and the additional scattering from the nuclei afforded by electrons is useful in those situations. It would be interesting to see UED data for the ultrafast dynamics of H 2 or D 2 in the gas-phase [46], or perhaps for tunneling in photoexcited dimer-molecules [47]. Looking further into the future, one may envision the detection of electronic structure using X-ray or electron scattering [48,49,42,50].  4.

[29].Finally, Fig. 7c displays the reconstructed 2D electron density of the particle, and represents a first convincing proof of principle of 2D structure determination based on the cross-correlation method.The upcoming challenge is to execute the experiment in 3D, which is accompanied by practical and computational complications.Extension to particles in solution will require a sufficient number of scattered photons within the rotational correlation time of the particles.It is thus evident to consider the FEL as the X-ray radiation source.\n\n\nOutlook",

This, however, implies averaging over many molecules whereby diverse and important conformational details remain indistinct. Besides this drawback, these methods can only be applied to a small subset of biological molecules that either readily crystallize to be used in X-ray studies or are small enough for NMR investigations [1]. A third approach for imaging molecules is cryo-electron microscopy. In the case of biological molecules the resolution is limited by radiation damage caused by the high electron energy in transmission electron microscopes. With a critical dose of (5-25 e -/Å 2 ) [2] an individual molecule is destroyed long before a decent quality image has been acquired. The radiation damage problem is countered by averaging over several thousand noisy images to end up with a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio of the averaged molecule structure [3]. The aligning and averaging routines inherent to cryo-electron microscopy limit its application range to symmetric and particularly rigid objects, like specific classes of viruses for example. In X-ray experiments, radiation damage is even more severe. Out of one million photons interacting with a biological molecule, only one is scattered elastically and carries structural information to the detector while all the other photons cause damage, be it by ionisation or other inelastic processes.\n\nDespite all limitations of the three conventional structural biology tools discussed above, one needs to express respect for the vast amount of data that has been generated over the past decades, reflected by the impressive volume of the current protein database [4].\n\nNevertheless, prospective structural biology definitely asks for methods and tools that do away with averaging over an ensemble of molecules but enable structural biology on a truly single molecule level. To obtain atomic resolution information about the structure of any individual biological molecule, entirely new concepts and technologies are needed. One approach of this kind is associated with the emerging X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) projects. They appeared initially as the novel technology to gain information from just one single biomolecule at the atomic scale by recording its X-ray diffraction pattern within just 10 fs before the molecule is decomposed by radiation damage [5].",

Contrary to earlier conceptions ͑as presented in many standard textbooks on that subject͒ the spatial arrangement of nitrogen atoms showed that no extended hydrogen bonded network exists in liquid ammonia. Nevertheless, some degree of hydrogen bonding was inferred from the temperature dependence of the N-H and H-H radial distribution functions. However, the hydrogen bond interaction in liquid ammonia proved to be much weaker than that in water and no clear hydrogen bond peak was observed in either N-H or H-H correlations, unlike the case of water.",

Distribution of hydrogen bonds\n\nThe analysis of the hydrogen bond ͑HB͒ distribution among ammonia molecules is based on a calculation of the fractions P n of ammonia molecules that engage in n hydrogen bonds and the average number of hydrogen bonds that an ammonia molecule donates and accepts. 29 Following previous work on liquid ammonia, water and other hydrogen bonding liquids, 59,71,72,[122][123][124][125][126][127][128] we have adopted a geometric definition of the hydrogen bonds where two ammonia molecules are assumed to be hydrogen bonded if they satisfy the following configurational criteria with respect to N-N and N-H distances:\nR (NN) ϽR c (NN) , ͑8͒ R (NH) ϽR c (NH) ,\nand the values of these distance cut-offs are usually determined from the positions of the first minimum of the corresponding ͑intermolecular͒ RDFs. We have used a similar procedure where the N-N RDF gives a value of R c NN ϭ5.25 ͑5.1͒ Å for the N-N cut-off for HCTH407ϩ͑BLYP͒ functionals. However, the procedure cannot be applied unambiguously to determine the N-H cut-off because no clear minimum that separates the hydrogen bonded and nonbonded H atoms is found in the N-H RDF. In the latter case, the shoulder which is assigned to hydrogen bonded H atoms merges into the broad and more intense peak corresponding to the H atoms of the first solvation shell which are not hydrogen bonded. Since this shoulder-which corresponds to the hydrogen bonded H atoms-extends up to about 2.7 Å in the experimental and BLYP RDFs we have taken this distance of 2.7 Å as the cutoff N-H distance. For HCTH/407 ϩ also, we have used the same cut-off of the N-H distance although the hydrogen bonded shoulder is less pronounced for this functional. Still, variation of R c NH within reasonable bounds does not change qualitatively the result of this analysis.",

This specic change in local interactions is clearly dominated by the electrostatics and thus the potential energy of the underlying complexes in solution. To obtain inexpensive estimates of DDG we therefore use the change in potential energy (averaged over time at 300 K) of NH 2 À solvation in pure ammonia compared to association to the metal cluster.\n\n\nSimulation details\n\nThe changes in solvation energy were assessed from molecular dynamics simulations based on molecular mechanics models. The force-elds for NH 4 + , NH 3 and NH 2 À are adopted from our earlier work reported in ref. 8. For the mono-and di-valent metal ions we employed the Lennard-Jones model from Merz and coworkers. 9,10 The Al 3+ model could also be adopted from this group, 11 while for Ga 3+ the force-eld of Gale and coworkers was used. 12 This approach ensures formal charges for all ions, thus allowing to model complex formation/dissociation without the need of quantum mechanical calculations. The accuracy of the employed force-elds may be judged on the basis of the coordination numbers as observed from the experiment. While experimental data is still rather sparse, the coordination of alkali metal ions and of gallium ions as discussed in the results section provides a basis for such comparison.",

Typically, the hydrogen bond angle is too small by a factor of 2 and the energy of the cyclic C 2h structure with respect to the eclipsed C s global minimum is overestimated by a factor of 10 to 30. Since ammonia is an important hydrogen bonded liquid, a density functional was developed for studying this subtle system, with particular focus on its applicability for condensed phase simulations in the framework of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics. To this end, a novel GGA-type density functional, HCTH/407ϩ, was developed, with special emphasis on the nonlinear hydrogen bond and potential energy surface of (NH 3 ) 2 . This functional yields the bent hydrogen-bonded equilibrium structure of the ammonia dimer, as well as the correct energetics of the low-lying isomers including the energy barrier to a linear hydrogen bond.",

Within a recently developed quantum/ molecular mechanics approach this is calculated from the quantum chemical assessment of the difference in proton affinity of the molecules in the gas phase and the change in solvation free energy as estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. 8 When moving from auto-protolysis in the bulk liquid to the deprotonation of ammonia molecules within metal ion complexes, we can estimate free energy differences analogously. Thus, the pK of the bulk liquid changes to a 'local pK' according to Scheme 1.\n\nWhere M refers to a metal ion and q to the charge of [M(NH 2 ) x (NH 3 ) y ] q complexes. Note that K and pK refer to the overall reaction involving two NH 3 molecules (one donor and one acceptor) and are thus dimensionless. Upon deprotonation of [M(NH 2 ) x (NH 3 ) y ] q complexes, the NH 4 + ion is always migrated to the solution. The resulting [M(NH 2 ) x+1 (NH 3 ) y+zÀ2 ] q complex may change its overall coordination number by associating (z > 0) or dissociating (z < 0) ammonia molecules to/from its coordination polyhedron. This depends on the specic metal ion as discussed in the results section. Both sides of Scheme 1 refer to idealized systems, that is pure ammonia (le side of Scheme 1) and a single metal ion M in pure ammonia (right side of Scheme 1), respectively. Note that activity coefficients used for interpreting experimental data of real solutions reect the need to combine ammonia autoprotolyses in bulk NH 3 and next to solvated ions. Using ideal solution models, our simulations however can address the respective equilibrium constants separately.",

The latter is necessary since we can only fit to single points. As a result of the small energy differences, the frozen-geometry singlepoint energies and optimized energies differ by a significant amount. The development procedure is similar to the one employed for the HCTH/407 functional, and the set includes numerous atomization energies, proton affinities, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and dissociation energies of hydrogen-bonded dimers and transition metal complexes. 82 First, we fit to a subset of the 407 molecules in order to get close to the global minimum, then we fit to the full set. The latter subset ͑small set͒ is the G2-1 set plus two hydrogenbonded systems (H 2 O) 2 and (HF) 2 , and the additional structures on the potential energy surface, making 153 systems in all ͑the 147 of the HCTH/147 functional plus the five PES points, in addition to the NH 3 dissociation energy at the TZ2P basis͒. For each point on the PES, the counterpoise correction was employed. The results using the newly determined functionals as a function of the weights have been determined in both the first fit ͑to 153 systems͒ and the second fit ͑to 413 systems͒. Thus, we obtained new functionals with weights ranging from 0/0 ͑which corresponds to the HCTH/407 functional͒ to 200/200. The first weight is the one used in the subset, while the second corresponds to the large fit. The importance of the weights in the first fit can be seen from the differences by using weight pairs of 30/80 and 80/ 80-they differ by about a factor of 2 in the energy difference between the staggered and eclipsed geometry. Hence, the minimum obtained by the second fit will of necessity be close to the global minimum obtained by the first one. When increasing these weights, we approach the reference values as expected, with the 200/200 functional rendering the closest values",

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the properties of ammonia from the gas phase dimer to the liquid state by means of wavefunction-based quantum chemistry techniques, density functional theory, and ab initio molecular dynamics. The ammonia dimer is a particularly interesting hydrogen-bonded system, as it is known to feature a strongly bent hydrogen bond. In order to investigate possible consequences of this nonlinear hydrogen bond, important points on the potential energy surface were first investigated by means of ab initio methods up to W2-extrapolated CCSD͑T͒ theory, see Fig. 1 for the corresponding structures. The structure and energetics of important isomers are obtained up to unprecedented accuracy without resorting to experiment; see Fig. 1 and Table IV for structures, and Fig. 2 and Table III for energies. It is confirmed that the structure of the global minimum ͑having eclipsed C s symmetry͒ possesses a substantially nonlinear hydrogen bond with an H-N¯N angle that is predicted to be 20.7°; note that the corresponding angle is predicted to be 5.5°in the water dimer. The energy difference between the global minimum and the C 2h transition state ͑which is the famous ''cyclic structure''͒ is about 3.5 cm Ϫ1 , and the energy penalty to make the hydrogen bond artificially linear amounts to only 70 cm Ϫ1 , i.e., 0.2 kcal/mol or 0.009 eV. This implies that the potential energy surface is very flat.",

A geometry optimisation was performed on the Hartree-Fock, i.e. self-consistent field (SCF), level using the basis set 6-31G, which is a split-valence orbital basis set without polarisable terms. The nucleus positions from this ab initio calculation were directly used to specifiy the positions of the five interaction sites.

At ammono-neutral conditions the uncharged Al(NH 2 ) 3 (NH 3 ) 2 0 complex is most preferred. Therein the 3NH 2 À ions form a triangle, whilst the 2NH 3 molecules constitute the top/bottom of a trigonal bi-pyramid. This unusual 5-fold coordination however reects a pK of 15.5 which is near the pH of ammono-neutral solutions (14 at 300 K). Thus, already mildly basic conditions lead to the formation of negatively charged Al(NH 2 ) 4 (NH 3 ) 2 À complexes. For direct comparison, we plotted the pK of the bulk liquid and ammonia within the uncharged M(NH 2 ) 3 (NH 3 ) 2 0 (M ¼ Al, Ga) complexes as functions of temperature in Fig. 3. Apart from the experimental and simulation data available for metal ion solvation in ammonia, at least some degree of comparison may be given by the different types of [M(NH 3 ) x ] q complexes in crystalline compounds. For example, 8-fold Table 1 Monovalent metal ion solvation in liquid ammonia at 300 K. Mimicking an autoclave scenario, the density is fixed to its average value at 240 K and 1 atm.

From a dipole vector oriented in Cartesian space (µ x , µ y , µ z ), the rotational dipoles (µ A , µ B , µ C ) can be calculated by using a change-of-basis with the rotational eigenmatrix.An important quantity for measuring the degree of asymmetry of a molecule is Ray's asymmetry parameter κ = (2B − A − C)/(A − C), where κ = −1 implies a perfectly prolate rotor and κ = 1 implies a perfectly oblate rotor.Based on a collection of rotational constants for a diverse set of roughly 400 molecules aggregated by Hellwege and Green 34 , Silbey and Kinsey 35 first observed that most measured molecules were highly prolate.Silbey et al. then derived an equation for the probability distribution of κ based on the construction of a random collection of point masses.As far as we know, this equation is the only attempt to describe the shape distribution of all possible molecular rotors.",

This scaling results in a series of equidistant Raman peaks separated by ∆Ω = 4B∆N , with ∆N being the smallest possible step in the molecular rotational ladder. Owing to the nuclear spin statistics, only odd values of N are allowed in the spectrum of 16 O 2 , which dictates ∆N = 2 and therefore ∆Ω ≈ 11.4 cm −1 . As shown in Figure 2 b, the detected peaks can indeed be resolved and assigned their respective rotational quantum numbers for up to N = 95. The peak separation, however, does not stay constant, but rather decreases with increasing angular momentum -a direct consequence of the centrifugal distortion. The effect is demonstrated in Figure 2 c for both Oxygen and Nitrogen. Being able to resolve the energies of extreme rotational states, we quantify the magnitude of the centrifugal distortion and verify that it is well described by the Dunham expansion to second power in N (N + 1) [Ref. [27]].\n\nTo study the rotational motion of the super rotors, we shorten the length of probe pulses to 500 fs and examine the time dependence of the Raman response. As shown in Figures 3 a and b for two levels of rotational excitation, molecules released from the centrifuge generate an oscillatory signal. The latter is indicative of the coherent rotation with well defined relative phase between the quantum states inside a rotational wave packet. Knowing the wave packet composition from the state-resolved detec-  In agreement with the general theory of quantum wave packets [28,29], the evolution of freely rotating molecules exhibits a discrete set of commensurate periods, revealed by a Fourier transform of the collected data (lower inset). In the case of a \"slow\" rotation (N = 29, upper blue curve), the main period of 2.9 ps coincides with the prediction of the \"rigid rotor\" model (vertical dashed line). Centrifugal distortion of a fast super rotor (N = 69) results in the stretching of the molecular bond and the correspondingly longer rotational period, as illustrated by the experimental results (bottom red line) and numerical calculations (middle green line).",

To quantify this point, the equilibrium rotational constants of some diatomics have been considered (see Table 1). Having only one geometrical parameter, they allow for a direct correlation between the bond distance and the unique rotational constant. A couple of small polyatomic molecules (water and formaldehyde) have been selected to emphasize how the situation is considerably more complicated when there is more than one geometrical parameter ( Table 2). Table 1 collects data for seven diatomic molecules, three of them also containing third-row atoms (SiS, PN and HCl) and two of them being radical species (CN and OH). In this table, for each molecule, the equilibrium distance and the corresponding equilibrium constant are reported together with the rotational constants resulting from increasing the bond distance by 0.0001 Å, 0.001 Å, and 0.002 Å. For the latter constants, the absolute and relative deviations from the equilibrium one are provided. Although being of limited importance to the present discussion, we note that bond distances were optimized at the CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ level, [54][55][56] with all electrons correlated (this level of theory has been chosen because of its accuracy 57 ). Inspection of the results of Table 1 confirms the fractional change pointed out in eqn (4) and, thus, an accuracy of 0.001 Å on the bond distance leads to a deviation of 0.1% on the rotational constant for bond lengths of about 2 Å such as that of SiS and of 0.2% for distances of about 1 Å. This table makes also clear that for light molecules deviations of about 0.1% in the rotational constant mean, in absolute terms, deviations of hundreds or even thousands of MHz.",

However, our irregularities ( Fig. 3) are distinctly not symmetric around the band origin; for example, the K = 2  3 to 1  2 spacing is much smaller than the 2  1 to 3  2 spacing. This asymmetry is closely related to the fact that our upper state (CO2 3) has a different symmetry than the ground state. As shown below, both the previous and current results can be very well explained using the same internal rotor model proposed in Ref. 1.\n\nSignificant broadening was observed for some of the lines in our spectrum, which we attribute to shortened lifetimes in the excited state, that is, to predissociation.

This separation defines two major fields for quantum chemistry, electronic structure theory and the corresponding electronic Hamiltonian (in atomic units): \nH el = − n e i=1 1 2 r i + n e i=1\nwith the r i electronic and R n nuclear positions and electric charges, Z n ; and nuclear motion theory with the Hamiltonian for the motion of the atomic nuclei (or rovibrational Hamiltonian):\nH nuc =T(ρ) +V,( 2 )\nwhereT(ρ) is the rovibrational kinetic energy operator and the potential energy,V, which is called the potential energy surface and it is obtained from the eigenvalues of Equation (1) computed at different positions of the atomic nuclei. Within this framework, a variety of molecular properties are derived from the eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, Equation (1), and an effective combination of the quantum mechanics of electrons with classical electronic properties of identifiable nuclei and quantum mechanics for nuclear motions, Equation (2).\n\nSeveral chemical concepts gain a theoretical background from this construct, most importantly the potential energy surface (PES) is defined. Its minimum structure (or structures if it has several local minima) defines the equilibrium structure, which is a purely mathematical construct resulting from the separability approximation but it is usually identified with the classical molecular structure. Then, the nuclei are re-quantised to solve the Schrödinger equation of the atomic nuclei, Equation (2), to calculate rovibrational states, resonances, reaction rates, etc.",

The spectra of rotor molecules are sensitive to the physical environment and to molecular structure, making these molecules important in many astrophysical and computational chemistry applications [7]. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the geometric potential term V R in asymmetric rotor molecules. This term vanishes for molecules with an internal 3fold symmetry, which are the only rotor molecules in which a formal theory of the centrifugal distortion has been thouroughly developed [8][9][10][11][12]. Important aspects of this term are is its universality, and the fact that it can be calculated relatively simply from the molecular structure. The downside of the geometrical potential is that it is small compared to leading order terms in the potential which can only be evaluated ab initio by heavy-duty numerical calculations.\n\nThe study of molecules with internal rotation goes back a long way, with many theoretical developments made in the 1950's [13]. Some recent methodology can be found in a review by Kleiner [7]. The basic set-up is shown schematically in figure 1. The molecule consists of two sets of atoms A and B which are free to rotate independently about a common molecular axis, with angle α between A and B. The molecule frame is centred on the centre of mass with z axis aligned parallel to the internal rotation axis [13] and the x axis is fixed with respect to B. The molecule coordinates are the Euler angles θ, φ and ψ of the molecular frame and the internal rotation α. The approach adopted here is to develop concepts which are, as far as possible, independent of the choice of coordinates. The mass the molecule is denoted by M and the mass of A by M A . A vector σ runs from the centre of mass to a chosen point C on the molecular axis so that the locations of the individual nuclei are given by r n = R(θ, φ, ψ)(σ + R(0, 0, α n )a n ), where rotation matrices R act on the vectors a n fixed to A or B, and α n = α when n ∈ A, α n = 0 otherwise. The total moment of inertia of the molecule I ij is computed in the molecule frame with origin at the centre of mass, whilst the moments of inertia of A and B are more conveniently centred on the rotation axis at C.",

In the presented example for Oxygen at N ≈ 69, the initial period of 1.6 ps changes to twice that value at later times, in excellent agreement with the numerical calculations (see two upper insets in Fig.3).\n\nAs follows from the general theory of quantum wave packets [28,29], the oscillation periods are inversely proportional to the second derivative of E(N ) with respect to N . For a rigid-rotor model of Oxygen, this would result in the main period of T = (8Bc) −1 ≈ 2.9 ps (c being the speed of light in vacuum), marked by a vertical dashed line in the lower inset of Fig.3 c. Centrifugal distortion pulls the atoms apart, lengthening the molecular bond and increasing the molecular moment of inertia I. Being inversely proportional to I, the ro-tational constant B decreases, resulting in a longer period of oscillations at higher levels of rotational excitation, T = [8Bc(1 − 6 N (N + 1))] −1 , where ≡ D/B ≈ 3 × 10 −6 is the ratio between the two rotational constants in the Dunham expansion [27].

R K indicates the nuclear coordinates and M K refers to atomic masses. Eqn (1) provides the definition of rotational constant within the rigid-rotor approximation. However, as discussed in the next section, rotational constants can be written as the sum of an equilibrium term that only depends on isotopic masses and equilibrium structure (in quantum chemistry obtained from geometry optimizations), and a correction accounting for vibrational effects. The focus of this contribution is on the accuracy that computational predictions should meet in order to support rotational spectroscopy. In the next section, the requirements for accuracy are introduced. Then, the relation existing between the error affecting structural parameters and the corresponding deviation in rotational constants is addressed. Finally, the performance of different computational approaches is discussed through some examples.",

Imagine that pyrimidine biosynthesis slows down (e.g., through inhibition of ATCase). How might this impact flux through glycolysis? Explain. iii.

(4) (about zero driving force) we directly estimate ∆G ‡ = ∆G ‡ 0 + βeφ, with β = 0.5. a 1 is the activity of a dissolved proton, which is constant at fixed pH, so ∆G 1 is absent from ∆G net . a 2 is again hydrogen coverage. Therefore, when θ 1, ∆G net = 1.5eφ and the Tafel slope is 39 mV/dec, matching that seen in the microkinetic model. When θ ≈ 1, ∆G net = 0.5eφ and the Tafel slope is 118 mV/dec, matching that seen microkinetically when sites saturate.\n\nBased on this simple analysis, we can conclude that the only way to achieve a Tafel slope of ∼30 mV/dec is in the limit when both activities correspond to coverages that are changing exponentially. In our analysis, this can only be caused by the weak-binding hydrogens (top-top), and the UPD hydrogen must be a kinetic spectator over most HER potentials.",

This is one of the concept problems in Chapter 3 of Physical Chemistry (3rd ed.) by Engel and Reid. 1 Students are supposed to explain that liquid water contracts when heated at below 4°C in an isobaric process. Because work is done to the contracting water, less heat is required to increase its temperature in an isobaric process than in an isochoric process. The above explanation is flawed because it assumes, implicitly and incorrectly, that the internal energy change of water in an isobaric process is the same as in an isochoric process. As a result of the flawed assumption, C P,m is less than C V,m for H 2 O(l) near 4°C. The same flawed assumption also appears on page 252 of Physical Chemistry by Cooksy: 2 \"Why should C P be different from C V ? Briefly, because if the volume can change, some of the heat added to the system is used to do work by expansion, leaving less to raise the temperature of the sample\". This seemingly small mistake is beyond just a trivial omission of the variation of the internal energy with volume; it results in the violation of the second law of thermodynamics and thereby destroys the foundation of thermodynamics. Unfortunately, this severe error might have been infused into thousands of chemistry students and perhaps physics students as well. In University Physics by Ling, Sanny, and Moebs, 3 Conceptual Question 3.13 asks: \"Most materials expand when heated. One notable exception is water between 0 and 4°C, which actually decreases in volume with the increase in temperature. Which is greater for water in this temperature region, C P or C V ?\" The answer key is provided in this textbook: \"Typically C P is greater than C V because when expansion occurs under constant pressure, it does work on the surroundings. Therefore, heat can go into internal energy and work. Under constant volume, all heat goes into internal energy. In this example, water contracts upon heating, so if we add heat at constant pressure, work is done on the water by surroundings and therefore, C P is less than C V \". In University Physics by Young and Freedman, 4 Q19.10 asks \"There are a few materials that contract when their temperature is increased, such",

This leads to serious qualitative and quantitative failures of the model, some of which we have seen above and which will discuss further below. However, given the (mathematical and conceptual) simplicity and the computational economy of the method one would like to improve the method as far as possible. So far we have treated the theory as parameter free. However, if we treat the model as a semi-empirical method instead one can include some of the effects due to electron-electron interactions without greatly increasing the computational cost of the method. For example, one can make α dependent on the charge on the atom. This is reasonable, as the more electrons we put on an atom the harder it is to add another due to the additional Coulomb repulsion from the extra electrons. The simplest way to account for this is the 'ω technique' (10) where one replaces\nα i → α i = α i + ω(q 0 − q i )β,(28)\nwhere q i is the charge on atom i, q 0 is a (fixed) reference charge and ω is a parameter. The ω technique suppresses the unphysical fluctuations of the electron density, which are often predicted by the Hückel model (cf. the discussion of H 2 above). Similar techniques can also be applied to β. These parameterisations only slightly complicate the model and do not lead to a major inflation of the computational cost, but can significantly improve the accuracy of the predictions of the Hückel model (15).\n\n\nB. Crystals (the tight binding model)\n\nFor infinite systems it is necessary to work with a fixed chemical potential rather than a fixed particle number. Therefore before we discuss the tight binding model we will briefly review the chemical potential (also see Ref. 6 for a discussion of the chemical potential in a chemical context).\n\n\nThe chemical potential",

Inclusion of corresponding pair constraints and connection to unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory.That UHF has the corresponding pairs property has little to do with UHF per se. It originates simply from the observation 16 that the eigenvalues of a matrix that is the half-sum of two idempotent matrices are 0, 1, 1 2 , or a corresponding pair (n, 1 − n). Similarly, the eigenvalues of a matrix written as the half-difference of two idempotent matrices are 0, ± 1 2 , or a corresponding pair (−n, n). 17 Thus, for example, M has eigenvalues adding to 0 in pairs while P has eigenvalues adding to 1 in pairs. Quite generally, any non-integer eigenvalues of the charge density matrix from a single determinant method will be either 1 2 or occur in a corresponding pair. Eigenvalues of 1 2 could be part of a corresponding pair (for entangled electrons) or may occur singly for open shells. We should be clear that while matrices written as the sum of two idempotent matrices exhibit the corresponding pairs property, the converse is not necessarily true; a matrix whose eigenvalues come in corresponding pairs may or may not be the sum of two idempotents.",

Phys. Vol. 309 (2005), pp. 209 - 211)\", arXiv:0706.0975v2\"The weighted Hilbert spaces L 2 r k (R 3 ) with k = −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . are based on the inner product (D.3) which involves an integration over the whole three-dimensional space R 3 with weight function w(r) = r k . The Coulomb potential 1/|r − r ′ | does not belong to any of the weighted Hilbert spaces L 2 r k (R 3 ) which Guseinov implicitly used in his work. This implies that the one-range addition theorems (4.5) of the Coulomb potential diverge for k = −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . in the mean with respect to the norms (D.4) of the weighted Hilbert spaces L 2 r k (R 3 ). Guseinov was not the first one who had derived a divergent expansion for the Coulomb potential in terms of a complete and orthonormal function set. Salmon, Birss, and Ruedenberg [66] derived a bipolar expansion of the Coulomb potential in terms of the Gaussian-type eigenfunctions of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator which are complete and orthonormal in the Hilbert space L 2 (R 3 ) of square integrable functions. However, Silverstone and Kay [67] demonstrated that this expansion diverges, which was confirmed by Ruedenberg and Salmon [68]. Apparently, this observation was some kind of death sentence for the bipolar expansion of Salmon, Birss, and Ruedenberg [66]. As far as I know, nobody has ever used this expansion.",

Studying crystal structures and the types of bonding and coordination that occurred within them, Pauling found out that crystal structures obeyed the rules now known as Pauling's rules [16,17]. In his seminal paper \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry\" [17], Linus Pauling reconstructed the foundations of chemistry -for the first time he explained the structure of molecules in terms of quantum mechanics. Linus Pauling described it this way: \"From Richard C. Tolman, Harry Bateman, and other remarkable teachers at Caltech, I obtained an excellent grounding in chemistry, physics, and mathe matics, with emphasis on the old quantum theory and atomic structure. Quantum mechanics was discovered a few months after I had received my PhD degree. The Schrödinger papers on wave mechanics were published about the time that I arrived at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (Professor Arnold Sommerfeld) at the University of Munich in April 1926. I immediately began to apply an approximate quantum mechanical treatment to the problem of the structure of atoms with many electrons and to simple molecules, making use of the treatments of the hydrogen molecule-ion and hydrogen molecule that had been formulated by Ø. Burrau, E.U. Condon, W. Heitler, and F. London.\n\nThese new ideas had applications to many aspects of chemistry. The applications included the nature of square, tetrahedral, and octahedral coordination complexes of metals; the stability of aromatic substances as determined by the resonance energy; the planarity of resonating and conjugated systems of single and double bonds; the secondary structures of proteins and the importance of the hydrogen bond in proteins, polynucleotides, and other substances; and the nature of interatomic forces in metals\" [18].",

Accordingly, Guseinov's one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential converge for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . in the mean with respect to the norm (D.4) of L 2 r k (R 3 ), but not for k = −1 (see also Appendix E where the convergence of the one-center limit of these addition theorems is analyzed).\n\nAs discussed in Section 4, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces L 2 r k (R 3 ) which Guseinov had implicitly used. This is quite consequential: Guseinov's one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential diverge for all k = −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . in the mean with respect to the norm (D.4) of L 2 r k (R 3 ), although they were derived by a limiting procedure from the corresponding addition theorems of the Yukawa potential, which converge at least for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . in the mean. This is another example that the limit β → 0 in expressions involving the Yukawa potential exp(−βr)/r need not be continuous and does not necessarily produce something finite.",

In such methods a harmonic varying heat current, Re(P e iωt ), with angular frequency ω and complex amplitude P , is produced at a surface in contact with the liquid; this heat then \"effuses\" into the liquid. At the surface a corresponding harmonic temperature oscillation, Re(δT e iωt ), with complex amplitude δT , is created. The current and temperature can be thought of as stimuli and response (but which is which can be interchanged at will), and the two are linearly related if the amplitudes, |P | and |δT |, are small enough. Hence it is convenient to introduce the complex frequency-dependent thermal impedance of the liquid\nZ liq = δT P ,(5)\nthis impedance depends on the properties of the liquid.\n\nThe terminology thermal impedance derives naturally from the close analogy between the flow of thermal heat and the flow of electricity [16]. Temperature corresponds to electric potential and heat current to electrical current. The analogy also applies to the heat conductivity which corresponds to the specific electrical conductivity, and the specific heat which corresponds to electrical capacity.\n\nAs an example the thermal impedance of a thermally thin sample is given as\nZ liq,thin = 1 iωcV (6)\nwhere V is the volume of the sample. Again an equation completely equivalent to the electrical correspondence between capacitance and impedance.\n\nIn the classical case of a planar heater in a thermal thick situation the thermal impedance is found to be [3] Z liq,planar = 1\nA √ iωcλ (7)\nwhere A is the plate area. The lateral dimension W has to be large (W ≫ |l D (ω)|) for this formula to be exact and unfortunately correction terms that take boundary effects into account decays only slowly as ω −1/2 [9].\n\n\nIII.

INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the last review that appeared in this journal some 30 years ago (1), the understanding of the funda-mental concepts of the mechanics of the pleural space has undergone a continual evolution.The previous review invoked hydrostatic equilibrium of pleural liquid as the fundamental principle.In the current review, surface forces due to the opposing elastic recoils of lung and chest wall are the primary determinants of the pressure in the intervening pleural liquid.The pleural surface pressure, defined as the force per unit pleural surface area, is equal to the pressure in the pleural liquid.The difference between the vertical gradient in pleural pressure and the hydrostatic value (1 cmH 2 O/cm height) drives a viscous flow within the pleural space.A function of the liquid in the pleural space is to lubricate the pleural surfaces.The uniform thickness of the lubricating layer is maintained by recirculation of pleural liquid driven by gravity and ventilatory and cardiogenic motions.Pleural liquid is a microvascular filtrate that is cleared by pleural lymphatics, a process similar to that in the interstitium of all body organs.\n\nThe review is divided into the following sequence.A brief summary of regional volume and pleural pressure is presented, followed by a description of the different types of pleural pressure measurements.Then pleural liquid thickness is described within the context of pleural lubrication.Circulation of pleural liquid within the pleural space is treated as part of viscous flow theory.The next section describes the formation of pleural liquid as a microvascular filtrate and its absorption via lymphatic stomata.Finally, pleural liquid protein and the factors that determine its concentration and absorption are discussed.\n\n\nA.

(180) and Agostoni et al. (14) proposed that pleural liquid, like the capillary blood, was in hydrostatic equilibrium with a vertical pressure gradient equal to 1 cmH 2 O/cm height.They proposed that hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved by absorption of pleural liquid into the blood until a balance of hydrostatic and osmotic forces between pleural liquid and the blood occurred.The absorptive pressure was calculated to be Ϫ11 cmH 2 O, lower than the surface pressure required to maintain the lung at its end-expiratory volume.The difference between pleural liquid and surface pressures was attributed to points of contact between the two pleural surfaces.This concept of the mechanics of the pleural space has been the focus of several reviews by Agostoni and co-workers (1,2,9,18).\n\nThe second concept (97,98,103) is the one that I emphasize in this review.The surface pressure acting to expand the lung, equal and opposite to the pressure expanding the chest wall, is transmitted hydraulically across the thin pleural liquid space with the surface pressure equal to the pleural liquid pressure.Thus pleural surface pressure is the major determinant of the pleural liquid pressure.The difference between the vertical gradient in pleural surface pressure and the hydrostatic value drives a viscous flow of pleural liquid downward in the pleural space.This conception of the mechanics of the pleural space requires a continuous pleural liquid space with no pleural contact.\n\n\nII.

Imagine a liquid confined between the to radii, r 1 and r 2 . The imposed oscillating outward heat current, Re P (r 1 )e iωt , at radius r 1 results in a temperature oscillation, Re δT (r 1 )e iωt , at the same radius. The heat wave propagating out into the liquid gives rise to a coupled strain wave due to thermal expansion. The heat diffusion is thus dependent on the mechanical boundary conditions and mechanical properties of the liquid. It is widely assumed that the transport of heat in a continuum is described by the heat diffusion equation\niωδT = D∇ 2 δT.(8)\nBy the same token one might take the heat diffusion constant as D = λ/c v if the surfaces at r 1 and r 2 are clamped and D = λ/c p if one of the surfaces is free to move. This common belief is not entirely correct. If shear modulus is nonvanishing compared to bulk modulus the description of heat diffusion cannot be decoupled to a bare heat diffusion equation [12][13][14]17]. Such a situation arises dynamically at frequencies where ω ≈ 1 /τM. The fully coupled thermomechanical equations have been discussed in detail, by some of us, in planar geometry [12] and in spherical geometry [14].

These distinct components can be considered individual thermodynamic control volumes, each of which is simulated using a set of dynamic energy and heat transfer equations that account for sources/sinks and interactions between and amongst the components as well as those in adjacent nodes. Within the components, an energy equation was formulated by applying the First Law of Thermodynamics with heat transfer modeled by finite difference methods. To reduce simulation time, the fluid channels were modeled as control volumes with constant properties and a single unique temperature and set of species concentrations. Similarly, the electrolyte was also assumed to have constant properties and was modeled as one bulk component even though it consists of a molten carbonate salt mixture (sodium, potassium, or lithium salts) that is retained in a ceramic matrix of lithium aluminum oxide with electrodes on both sides. For all the solid components, a lumped capacitance condition is assumed.\n\nDue to the cell's planar configuration and operating conditions, the stream-wise and normal to the top of the cell directions were assumed to be the primary directions of heat flux. This is because the largest exposed area is on the upper and lower surfaces of the cell and the thermal profile (due primarily to non-uniform heat generation) and convective fluxes are important in the stream-wise direction.\n\nFor the fluid channel, the energy equation is simultaneously solved with the momentum and species conservation equations, which were discussed earlier. For the fluid within the channel flow between the nodes, it was assumed that the mass that leaves or enters the control volume has a specific energy. Thus, an energy balance can determine the bulk fluid temperature within each channel for every node. So, the energy equation can be written as [12]: (14) where E denotes energy; m is mass flux; Q conv , convective heat transfer in the electrolyte (subscript e) and at the separator plate (subscript s); E 1 , the net rate of flow energy added at the control volume inlet and outlet, and the subscripts in and out denote into and out of control volume, respectively.",

The proton rms charge radius r p determined from the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen disagrees significantly with values determined from H and D transition frequencies as well as from electron-proton scattering experiments. Although the uncertainty of the muonic hydrogen value is significantly smaller than the uncertainties of these other values, its negative impact on the internal consistency of the theoretically predicted and experimentally measured frequencies, as well as on the value of the Rydberg constant, was deemed so severe that the only recourse was to not include it in the final least-squares adjustment on which the 2010 recommended values are based.\n\nMuon magnetic moment anomaly. Despite extensive new theoretical work, the long-standing significant difference between the theoretically predicted, standard-model value of a µ and the experimentally determined value remains unresolved. Because the difference is from 3.3 to possibly 4.5 times the standard uncertainty of the difference, depending on the way the all-important hadronic contribution to the theoretical expression for a µ is evaluated, the theory was not incorporated in the 2010 adjustment.

This value of α is in excellent agreement with a competitive experimental value with an uncertainty of 6.6 × 10 −10 .

That may become important for future astrophysical measurements with higher accuracy.  [46]. The ammonia molecule has a pyramidal shape and the inversion frequency depends on the exponentially small probability of tunneling of the three hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms through the potential barrier [66]. Because of that, it is very sensitive to any changes of the parameters of the system, particularly to the reduced mass for this vibrational mode. The authors of Ref. [46] found that for ND 3 molecule, δω/ω = −5.6 δµ/µ. Therefore, the inversion frequency of ND 3 is nearly an order of magnitude more sensitive to µ-variation than typical molecular vibrational frequencies (note that Ref. [46] contains a misprint in the sign of the effect).\n\nHowever, even such enhanced sensitivity is insufficient to make the laboratory experiment on the time-variation of µ using conventional molecular beams competitive. Stark-deceleration was used in Ref. [46] to slow down the beam to 52 m/s. Still, a much slower beam, or a fountain is necessary to increase the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude before a competitive experiment can be performed. The work in this direction is in progress [67].",

The decelerated antiprotons, about 30 % of the antiprotons entering the RFQD, are then diverted to a low pressure cryogenic helium gas target at 10 K by an achromatic momentum analyzer, the purpose of which is to eliminate the large background that the remaining 70 % of undecelerated antiprotons would have produced.\n\nAbout 3 % of thep stopped in the target formp He + , in which ap with large principle quantum number (n ≈ 38) and angular momentum quantum number (l ≈ n) circulates in a localized, nearly circular orbit around the He 2+ nucleus while the electron occupies the distributed 1S state. Thesep energy levels are metastable with lifetimes of several microseconds and de-excite radiatively.

Rutherford on the Photon, Atomic Energy, and the Laws of Nature 11.1. The Photon In a letter dated January 26, 1917, Rutherford nominates Charles Barkla (1877-1944 to the Nobel Prize in Physics. Arriving late, this nomination is taken to be valid for 1918. This is the only nomination Barkla ever receives and is sufficient to earn him, in 1918, the Nobel Prize for 1917, which had not yet been awarded. Barkla's \"competitors\" on the Nobel scene, Einstein and Planck, have each had six nominations in 1918; in 1919, Planck receives the 1918 Prize in Physics. Rutherford nominates Barkla for:\n\n\"his important original contributions to our knowledge of the nature of X-rays, and particularly for his discovery of the characteristic X-radiations of the elements.\n\nThe proof that each element under certain conditions emits an X-radiation of the element is a contribution that, in my opinion, ranks only second in importance to the subsequent discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by Laue. ...\" (Max von Laue had already been awarded the 1914 Nobel Prize.)\n\nIn praising Barkla, at the end of his nomination, Rutherford adds a surprising statement:\n\n\"Professor Barkla was throughout a staunch adherent of the view that X-rays were a type of wave motion, and championed this with vigour when a more materialistic hypothesis appeared to be gaining ground.\"\n\nThis means that, in 1917, neither Barkla nor Rutherford believe in Einstein's photon of 1905! However, a nomination letter by Rutherford in 1929, proposing Richardson to the Prize, suggests that he (perhaps) accepts the photon.\n\nHow fortunate he was not to know about atomic bombs! 11.3.

In addition, the contribution of some systematic effects changes sign when the direction of the selection and measuring Raman beams is exchanged. Hence, for each up and down trajectory, the selection and measuring Raman beams are reversed and two velocity spectra are taken. The mean value of these two measurements is free from systematic errors to first order.

Individual molecules Unlike atoms, molecules possess the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, with characteristic energy scales ∼100 MHz -100 THz. Electronic excitations in molecules usually correspond to optical transition frequencies (10 14 − 10 15 Hz), vibrational excitations to the infrared region (10 13 − 10 14 Hz), and rotational excitations to the microwave region (10 9 − 10 11 Hz). In addition to the spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions, intrinsic to any atomic or molecular system, the rotational motion of molecules gives rise to new perturbations, such as Λ-doubling, which generates closely spaced energy levels with characteristic excitation frequencies < 100 MHz [52]. The eigenstates of a molecular Hamiltonian can be generally expanded in products of the electronic, vibrational and rotational states dressed by the electron and nuclear spin states. The interactions of the electrons and nuclei with the static and far-off-resonant optical fields used in experiments give rise to matrix elements with magnitudes ≤ 100 GHz. Except in special cases, these interactions are unlikely to perturb the electronic and vibrational structure of molecules. On the other hand, the rotational, fine and hyperfine structure can be strongly altered by an applied field. In this section, we summarize general considerations at the core of the analysis of molecular structure in dc and non-resonant ac fields. Sec. VI discusses the effects of resonant and nearly resonant optical fields on molecular energy levels.",

Physicists and chemists, theoreticians and experimentalists, engineers and philosophers, all would find at least one good reason to be interested in these systems. We shall refer here to \"quantum nanomagnets\" as the broad family of molecules containing a core of magnetic transition-metal ions, which interact by strong superexchange and which possess magnetic anisotropy due to crystal field effects[13]. At sufficiently low temperatures (typically ∼ 10 K), i.e. much lower than the typical intramolecular exchange interaction energy, the whole molecule effectively behaves as a nanometer-sized magnet. The total ground state spin value can be rather large, S ∼ 10, and is often called \"giant spin\". The best studied examples are Mn 12 [22], Fe 8 [50] and Mn 4 [3]. The magnetic core of each molecule is stabilized by organic ligands, and the molecules are typically bound to each other by van der Waals forces to form electrically insulating crystals(Fig. 1). With just a few exceptions[49,16], the magnetic interaction between different molecules is only of dipolar origin, thus orders of magnitude weaker than the intramolecular exchange. Single-ion anisotropies, exchange interactions, point symmetry and crystal structure all contribute in a complicated way to the total magnetic anisotropy of the giant spin. The first great success of molecular magnets consisted in the demonstration of magnetic bistability and hysteresis at the molecular level [35], i.e. not arising from long-range interactions but only from local ones. Molecules possessing this sort of bistability were named \"Single Molecule Magnets\" (SMMs). One could then think",

A detailed review on ab initio calculation of shielding constants and chemical shifts is presented in (13). We only summarize the conceptual framework, which is crucial to the quantum chemical calculations performed by commercially available softwares. We start by writing the NMR Spin Hamiltonian\nH = − K γ K B T (1 −σ K )Î K + 1 2 K =L γ K γ LÎ T 2 (D KL +K KL ) ·Î L .(1)\nHere, γ K is the gyromagnetic ratio,Î K is the nuclear spin operator,σ K is the magnetic shielding tensor (due to electron density),D KL andK KL are dipolar and indirect coupling constants. The notation of (13) has been preserved for the reader's convenience. The isotropic Hamiltonian can be written as the rotational average of Eq.1,\nH = − K γ K (1 − σ K )BÎ Kz + 1 2 K =L γ K γ L K KL 2Î K ·Î L .(2)\nwhere σ K = 1 3 tr(σ K ) and K KL = 1 3 tr(K KL ). The second term in the Hamiltonian can be compactly written in terms of the spin-spin coupling tensor J KL , which is defined as\nJ KL = γ K γ L K KL 2π .(3)\nWe then note that the shielding and indirect spin-spin coupling is four orders weaker than Zeeman and Dipolar Interactions and hence could be treated as first order perturbation. To find the NMR parameters from the Spin Hamiltonian, the energy (E( B, M )) is expanded in terms of magnetic field and magnetic dipole moment M . This gives us the following relations, which are solved by variational perturbation theory.\nσ K = B T d 2 E( B, M ) d Bd M K M K ,K KL +D KL =M T L d 2 E( B, M ) dM L dM KM K(4)",

As a result, electric-field-induced interactions must couple states of different parity, while interactions induced by the magnetic field must conserve parity. It should also be noted that, for an electromagnetic wave, the magnitudes of the magnetic and electric fields are related as E = Bc, where c is the speed of light. This implies that it is much easier to perturb the molecular energy levels by an electric field than by a magnetic one. The effect of a dc electric field on the molecular structure is determined by the matrix elements of the operator While J is not a good quantum number, it is often possible to introduce an adiabatic label,J, such that the hybrid state |JM → |JM when the electric field magnitude E → 0. The degree of molecular orientation in the laboratory frame is given by the expectation value of the orientation cosine, cos θ J M = J M | cos θ|J M , which corresponds to the expectation value of the electric dipole moment in the space-fixed frame, d J M = d cos θ J M . Note that at any finite value of the electric field, the molecular orientation is confined to a finite range of angles, e.g. at a relatively strong field value of 100 kV/cm the axis of a NaK molecule (d = 2.7 Debye, B e = 0.091 cm −1 ) keeps librating with the amplitude ±25 • . According to the uncertainty principle, in order to achieve a perfect orientation, cos θ = 1, one would need to hybridize an infinite number of the angular momentum states.

As a result of the first action, the excitation of one type of nuclei occurs, then, the second effect promotes the transfer of magnetization to neighboring nuclei, depending on whether the nuclei of one element or two different elements are exposed to the first and second effects, distinguish between homonuclear and heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR. In this case, the spins of the nuclei interact with each other through a chemical bond through a spin-spin interaction or through a dipole-dipole mechanism. The peak position is determined by the chemical shift or resonance frequencies of the interacting spins.

During the two-dimensional NMR experiment, several consecutive measurements of the same sample are made, while the time t1 increases with each subsequent experiment according to the linear law. The initial value t1=0, and with each subsequent experiment it increases by Δt. A feature of the period of evolution is that the excited state of the spin is not immediately detected by the receiving coils, so it is also called the period of \"indirect measurement\". During the mixing period, the magnetization of nuclei A is transferred to the nuclei B.",

In particular from a consideration of the scattering of a-partieles it has been found that the atom consists essentially of a very concentrated charge at the centre of the atom* surrounded by electricity of the opposite sign, probably electrons, distributed throughout the remainder of the atom. Further, Darwinf and BohrJ have attempted to obtain information as to the number and distribution of electrons in the atom by a consideration of the absorption or loss of velocity of the a-partides in passing through matter. The only data for this purpose so far obtainable are provided by the velocity curves, or relations between velocity and thickness of matter traversed, in aluminium as determined by Rutherford, § and in mica as determined by Geiger.|| It seemed, therefore, of interest to make a more complete investigation of the velocity curves in various substances, more particularly as the earlier observations are subject to slight errors due to the assumption that equal thicknesses of matter have the same air equivalent at different parts of|the range of a-particles.In the present experiments the velocity curves in gold, copper, aluminium, mica and air have been determined, using as source the a-particles of",

As shown explicitly in Appendix A, this is expressed as (see, e.g., [14])\nm dv dt = F ext + v rel dm dt ,(1)\nwhere dm/dt > 0 is the rate at which mass is gain (i.e., equivalent to particles entering an open system) and v rel (t) is the relative velocity of the gained mass with respect to the body moving with a growth velocity of magnitude v(t) ≡ |v(t)|. The above term φ(t) ≡ v rel (dm/dt) corresponds to the momentum flux being tranferred into the body by the added mass. This is interpreted as the force exerted on the body by the mass that joins it [15] and F ext is the external force of gravity acting on the variable mass system. The surface of the earth is taken as the zero level of gravitational potential energy.\n\nIn applying the Newton law for the vertical growth of humans, it corresponds to the analysis of an extended system of N particles rather than to the analysis of a single particle of mass m i and velocity v i at time t. In this case one can only consider averaged values for all the physical quantities -such as the external force, due to the complexity of the body system. Hence, if n(h i ) is the number of objects at various heights h i , of a total of n objects distributed among ℓ heigths, then the mean average value of any given function f for those objects is in general\nf ≡< f i >= 1 n ℓ i=1 n(h i ) f i = ℓ i=1 n(h i ) n f i = ℓ i=1 ρ i f i ,(2)\nwhere ρ i is interpreted as the probability that a fraction of the objects n(h i )/n has the height h i . So as the sum of all fractions of the whole system is unity (f = 1), the probability distribution function is also normalized such that ℓ i=1 ρ i = 1. It can be seen that ρ i directly affect the outcome of averaged results since it weights the values of the given function f at each height i. The above mean value equation is used throughout the theory of statistical physics.",

Richardson, F.R.S.-\nSeveral investigators have claimed th at electrons are emitted from metals under the influence of chemical action. I t was shown by Haber and Just that drops of liquid caesium or the liquid alloy of sodium and potassium emit electrons when acted on, at a low pressure, by a number of chemically active gases.Prof. Richardson investigated the phenomena with a view to obtaining quantitative information. He determined the characteristic curve for the emission from drops of a liquid alloy of sodium and potassium when acted on, at a low pressure, by Cl2, C0C12 and H 20. He also showed th at the distribution of energy among the emitted electrons obeyed Maxwell's Law.* These results were established only to the degree of accuracy permitted by the experimental conditions. The present work was undertaken, under the direction of Prof. Richardson, with the object of improving the experi mental methods, extending the observations over a wider range of pressures and emissions, and, if possible, of accounting for the exceptional effects found in Prof. Richardson's earlier experiments, and described in the first edition of ' The Emission of Electrons from Hot Bodies,' p. 294.Description of the Apparatus.The apparatus is, with the exception of certain alterations and additions, which are here described, similar to that described in Prof. Richardson's paper. A diagram of the 46 testing vessel \" is given on page 23 of that paper.The applied potential was measured by means of a Weston double-range voltmeter, where the range required was not more than 15 volts, and accurate readings were necessary ; for potentials greater than 15 volts a Weston volt meter reading to 100 volts was substituted.The current was measured, as in the previous work, by means of a quadrant electrometer, but, in addition, a method due to Townsendf was substituted",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter.

For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight.

This tray is shaken parallel to the ground. The small balls will move very fast in straight lines until they hit another ball or the rim of the tray or a metal ring. The larger rings themselves will not move by the shaking because their inertia and drag on the tray is too large. However, hits by metal balls move the large rings slightly. If we keep shaking, the metal rings will perform a small wiggling motion due to the continuous random hits by the small metal balls.

He suspended these small particles in water and observed their wiggling motion under a light microscope (Brown, 1866). The smallest particles he studied were 0.8 micron. He noticed that the magnitude of the wiggling motion is much less for larger particles. Brown investigated different materials including inorganic minerals and found the wiggling motion for all of them. Brown also stated \"these kinds of particles when immersed in water are generally seen in vivid motion; but the apparent motions of the larger particles might in these cases perhaps be caused by the rapid motion oscillation of the more numerous molecules.\", where the term \"molecules\" refers to the small particles. Today we know that his speculation was not far from the truth. The wiggling motion he observed is the particle diffusion that has its origin in the interaction with the thermal motion of the fluid molecules (the balls on our tray). To credit the observation of Brown, particle diffusion is also called Brownian diffusion. Brown's experiment has been rebuilt in the Exploratorium -The museum of science, art and human perception at the Palace of Fine Arts, in San Francisco (http://www.exploratorium.edu).",

However, during the early days about 3.9 billion years ago and about 700 million years after the planets of our solar system had formed things were very different. At that time a cataclysmic spike in the cratering rate occurred as can be deduced from observations of the moon today [35,36]. This event is referred to as late heavy bombardment or lunar cataclysm and was characterized by a peak in the lunar impact rate by comets and asteroids that was about 100 times heavier than anything immediately before or after [37]. It is obvious that during the late heavy bombardment the early Earth was also subjected to massive impacts. Huge amounts of kinetic energy were stored in the projectiles when they were on their way towards their target Earth. At a constant velocity, the kinetic energy E of an asteroid is defined as:\nE = ½ mv 2\nwhere m is the mass, and v is the velocity.\n\nDue to the considerably high velocities and notable masses involved, those impacts are accompanied by the absorption of tremendous quantities of kinetic energy. Even today, although fortunately with a much lower probability, cosmic impacts can in principle transfer energies sufficient enough to result in a global catastrophe and therefore still represent a permanent and serious danger for humankind [38,39]. The most popular example of such an event is the asteroid impact 65 million years ago which is believed to be the cause of the mass extinction at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary that ultimately led to the dying out of the dinosaurs [40]. More recently, the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter in 1994 impressively demonstrated the persistent danger from cometary impacts even today [41]. Beyond all question, impacts are hostile events and, provided that life has already come into existence before that as some authors suppose [42][43][44], the late heavy bombardment is assumed being a sterilizing period wiping out all such life forms, at least on the surface of the early Earth [45,46].",

Moreover, energy quanta are expected to disappear faster than particles since only the most energy-rich particles are filtered by the threshold ε ‡ for flying away. Interestingly, the drop in total energy resulting from the evasion of the first particles can prevent the remaining particles to obtain their own travelling passport, rendering them definitely prisoners in absence of energy refueling. A good illustration of this situation is the rate of evaporation of water molecules from a hot soup. Ordinary experience shows that evaporation decreases as the soup cools. For modeling this, let us transform the total number of energy quanta in the soup by a continuous variable x(t) decreasing with time and the total number of particles by a continuous variable y(t) also decreasing with time. Let us suppose that the medium is not sticky to allow the particles to clear off once their energy content reaches ε ‡ . Then, the efflux rate derived from the geometric distribution depends on the evolution of x(t) and y(t) and obey the following system\nk(t) = k ‡ x(t) y(t) + x(t) ε ‡ (20a) withẋ (t) = ε ‡ẏ (t) (20b) andẏ (t) = −k(t)y(t)(20c)\nThe fate of this system (Fig.3), depends on the relative values of the reaction threshold ε ‡ and of the starting amounts x 0 and y 0 .

In particular from a consideration of the scattering of a-partieles it has been found that the atom consists essentially of a very concentrated charge at the centre of the atom* surrounded by electricity of the opposite sign, probably electrons, distributed throughout the remainder of the atom. Further, Darwinf and BohrJ have attempted to obtain information as to the number and distribution of electrons in the atom by a consideration of the absorption or loss of velocity of the a-partides in passing through matter. The only data for this purpose so far obtainable are provided by the velocity curves, or relations between velocity and thickness of matter traversed, in aluminium as determined by Rutherford, § and in mica as determined by Geiger.|| It seemed, therefore, of interest to make a more complete investigation of the velocity curves in various substances, more particularly as the earlier observations are subject to slight errors due to the assumption that equal thicknesses of matter have the same air equivalent at different parts of|the range of a-particles.In the present experiments the velocity curves in gold, copper, aluminium, mica and air have been determined, using as source the a-particles of",

As shown explicitly in Appendix A, this is expressed as (see, e.g., [14])\nm dv dt = F ext + v rel dm dt ,(1)\nwhere dm/dt > 0 is the rate at which mass is gain (i.e., equivalent to particles entering an open system) and v rel (t) is the relative velocity of the gained mass with respect to the body moving with a growth velocity of magnitude v(t) ≡ |v(t)|. The above term φ(t) ≡ v rel (dm/dt) corresponds to the momentum flux being tranferred into the body by the added mass. This is interpreted as the force exerted on the body by the mass that joins it [15] and F ext is the external force of gravity acting on the variable mass system. The surface of the earth is taken as the zero level of gravitational potential energy.\n\nIn applying the Newton law for the vertical growth of humans, it corresponds to the analysis of an extended system of N particles rather than to the analysis of a single particle of mass m i and velocity v i at time t. In this case one can only consider averaged values for all the physical quantities -such as the external force, due to the complexity of the body system. Hence, if n(h i ) is the number of objects at various heights h i , of a total of n objects distributed among ℓ heigths, then the mean average value of any given function f for those objects is in general\nf ≡< f i >= 1 n ℓ i=1 n(h i ) f i = ℓ i=1 n(h i ) n f i = ℓ i=1 ρ i f i ,(2)\nwhere ρ i is interpreted as the probability that a fraction of the objects n(h i )/n has the height h i . So as the sum of all fractions of the whole system is unity (f = 1), the probability distribution function is also normalized such that ℓ i=1 ρ i = 1. It can be seen that ρ i directly affect the outcome of averaged results since it weights the values of the given function f at each height i. The above mean value equation is used throughout the theory of statistical physics.",

July 19. 2018Received December 20,1923.)468 (Communicated by Prof. 0. W. Richardson, F.R.S.-\nSeveral investigators have claimed th at electrons are emitted from metals under the influence of chemical action. I t was shown by Haber and Just that drops of liquid caesium or the liquid alloy of sodium and potassium emit electrons when acted on, at a low pressure, by a number of chemically active gases.Prof. Richardson investigated the phenomena with a view to obtaining quantitative information. He determined the characteristic curve for the emission from drops of a liquid alloy of sodium and potassium when acted on, at a low pressure, by Cl2, C0C12 and H 20. He also showed th at the distribution of energy among the emitted electrons obeyed Maxwell's Law.* These results were established only to the degree of accuracy permitted by the experimental conditions. The present work was undertaken, under the direction of Prof. Richardson, with the object of improving the experi mental methods, extending the observations over a wider range of pressures and emissions, and, if possible, of accounting for the exceptional effects found in Prof. Richardson's earlier experiments, and described in the first edition of ' The Emission of Electrons from Hot Bodies,' p. 294.Description of the Apparatus.The apparatus is, with the exception of certain alterations and additions, which are here described, similar to that described in Prof. Richardson's paper. A diagram of the 46 testing vessel \" is given on page 23 of that paper.The applied potential was measured by means of a Weston double-range voltmeter, where the range required was not more than 15 volts, and accurate readings were necessary ; for potentials greater than 15 volts a Weston volt meter reading to 100 volts was substituted.The current was measured, as in the previous work, by means of a quadrant electrometer, but, in addition, a method due to Townsendf was substituted",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter.

This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

This tray is shaken parallel to the ground. The small balls will move very fast in straight lines until they hit another ball or the rim of the tray or a metal ring. The larger rings themselves will not move by the shaking because their inertia and drag on the tray is too large. However, hits by metal balls move the large rings slightly. If we keep shaking, the metal rings will perform a small wiggling motion due to the continuous random hits by the small metal balls. In 1827 the botanist Robert Brown studied the motion of small particles contained within pollen grains. He suspended these small particles in water and observed their wiggling motion under a light microscope (Brown, 1866). The smallest particles he studied were 0.8 micron. He noticed that the magnitude of the wiggling motion is much less for larger particles. Brown investigated different materials including inorganic minerals and found the wiggling motion for all of them. Brown also stated \"these kinds of particles when immersed in water are generally seen in vivid motion; but the apparent motions of the larger particles might in these cases perhaps be caused by the rapid motion oscillation of the more numerous molecules.\", where the term \"molecules\" refers to the small particles. Today we know that his speculation was not far from the truth. The wiggling motion he observed is the particle diffusion that has its origin in the interaction with the thermal motion of the fluid molecules (the balls on our tray). To credit the observation of Brown, particle diffusion is also called Brownian diffusion. Brown's experiment has been rebuilt in the Exploratorium -The museum of science, art and human perception at the Palace of Fine Arts, in San Francisco (http://www.exploratorium.edu).",

However, during the early days about 3.9 billion years ago and about 700 million years after the planets of our solar system had formed things were very different. At that time a cataclysmic spike in the cratering rate occurred as can be deduced from observations of the moon today [35,36]. This event is referred to as late heavy bombardment or lunar cataclysm and was characterized by a peak in the lunar impact rate by comets and asteroids that was about 100 times heavier than anything immediately before or after [37]. It is obvious that during the late heavy bombardment the early Earth was also subjected to massive impacts. Huge amounts of kinetic energy were stored in the projectiles when they were on their way towards their target Earth. At a constant velocity, the kinetic energy E of an asteroid is defined as:\nE = ½ mv 2\nwhere m is the mass, and v is the velocity.\n\nDue to the considerably high velocities and notable masses involved, those impacts are accompanied by the absorption of tremendous quantities of kinetic energy. Even today, although fortunately with a much lower probability, cosmic impacts can in principle transfer energies sufficient enough to result in a global catastrophe and therefore still represent a permanent and serious danger for humankind [38,39]. The most popular example of such an event is the asteroid impact 65 million years ago which is believed to be the cause of the mass extinction at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary that ultimately led to the dying out of the dinosaurs [40]. More recently, the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter in 1994 impressively demonstrated the persistent danger from cometary impacts even today [41]. Beyond all question, impacts are hostile events and, provided that life has already come into existence before that as some authors suppose [42][43][44], the late heavy bombardment is assumed being a sterilizing period wiping out all such life forms, at least on the surface of the early Earth [45,46].",

The SI unit of γ is s −1 T −1 = C kg −1 = A s kg −1 . In this section we summarize measurements of the gyromagnetic ratio of the shielded proton\nγ ′ p = 2µ ′ p h ,(246)\nand of the shielded helion\nγ ′ h = 2|µ ′ h | h ,(247)\nwhere, as in previous sections that dealt with magneticmoment ratios involving these particles, the protons are those in a spherical sample of pure H 2 O at 25 • C surrounded by vacuum; and the helions are those in a spherical sample of low-pressure, pure 3 He gas at 25 • C surrounded by vacuum. As discussed in detail in CODATA-98, two methods are used to determine the shielded gyromagnetic ratio γ ′ of a particle: the low-field method and the high-field method. In either case the measured current I in the experiment can be expressed in terms of the product K J R K , but B depends on I differently in the two cases. In essence, the low-field experiments determine γ ′ /K J R K and the highfield experiments determine γ ′ K J R K . This leads to the relations\nγ ′ = Γ ′ 90 (lo) K J R K K J−90 R K−90(248)γ ′ = Γ ′ 90 (hi) K J−90 R K−90 K J R K ,(249)",

Moreover, energy quanta are expected to disappear faster than particles since only the most energy-rich particles are filtered by the threshold ε ‡ for flying away. Interestingly, the drop in total energy resulting from the evasion of the first particles can prevent the remaining particles to obtain their own travelling passport, rendering them definitely prisoners in absence of energy refueling. A good illustration of this situation is the rate of evaporation of water molecules from a hot soup. Ordinary experience shows that evaporation decreases as the soup cools. For modeling this, let us transform the total number of energy quanta in the soup by a continuous variable x(t) decreasing with time and the total number of particles by a continuous variable y(t) also decreasing with time. Let us suppose that the medium is not sticky to allow the particles to clear off once their energy content reaches ε ‡ . Then, the efflux rate derived from the geometric distribution depends on the evolution of x(t) and y(t) and obey the following system\nk(t) = k ‡ x(t) y(t) + x(t) ε ‡ (20a) withẋ (t) = ε ‡ẏ (t) (20b) andẏ (t) = −k(t)y(t)(20c)\nThe fate of this system (Fig.3), depends on the relative values of the reaction threshold ε ‡ and of the starting amounts x 0 and y 0 .

The standard intensity of the solar extraterrestrial radiation on a unit area exposed normally to the sun rays at one astronomical unit is called the \"solar constant\". The value of the solar constant has been a subject of debate in radiometry over the twentieth century, mainly due to the low precision of ground-based instruments. The value of the solar constant as measured in space is about 1366 Wm −2 [12]. Despite its name, this value is not constant [13] but slightly fluctuates, due to the variation in solar activity, on every timescale at which it has been measured (from minutes to decades). Moreover, since the Earth's orbit around the Sun is elliptical, yearly variations in the Sun-Earth distance (about 3%) are also affecting the total solar irradiance.\n\n\nSpectral Distribution of the Extraterrestrial Solar Irradiance\n\nWhile nowadays the absolute value of the solar constant is known with high accuracy and precision, larger uncertainties are associated with its spectral distribution. The simplest description of the solar spectral irradiance is obtained from Planck's law, considering the solar spectrum as a black-body at about 5800 K. While this approach is oversimplified, it provides a reasonable estimation for the fraction of solar spectrum in either UV, visible or IR. Currently, the latest radiometric measurements of the extraterrestrial solar irradiance (also referred to as \"zero air mass\" solar spectra irradiance) are collected in the ASTM standard E490-00a [12]. From the comparison between the calculated blackbody radiation and the radiometric measurements plotted in Fig. 1, it is evident how the actual spectral irradiance from the sun does not strictly follow the black-body law.\n\n\nSpectral Distribution of the Ground Solar Irradiance",

As illustrated, for energy associated with the thermal infrared into the far infrared, the area can be approximated by:\n\n(0.075)(100,000-3,000) = 7,275 W/m 3 Based upon the above rough approximation; at sea level the energy associated with both the thermal and far infrared may be several times the energy that is associated with the near infrared and into the visible spectrum. Obviously, the visual appearances of our Sun's insolation, such as Fig. 1, can be deceptive to the eye.\n\nIt raises the question as to, \"how exactly was the thermal infrared measured?\". In the previous calculation, it was assumed to be an asymptote curve, which could be approximated as a linear line parallel to the wavelength. Even if it was considered as a decreasing function, so that we are now considering the area in a triangle, then our Sun's thermal energy would still be 3 or more times greater.\n\nOne must also decide as to what all constitutes thermal energy. What if \"our Sun's actual thermal radiation started at 2,000 nm that being close to the improved linear functionality in Fig. 1, and then extended through the far infrared, as sketched in Fig. 2?\" Now our Sun's thermal radiation becomes closer to 8 times that of its visible and near infrared radiation.\n\nMoreover, if our Sun's thermal radiation was considered to start in the near infrared then one might deduce that the Sun's thermal radiation was significantly greater than its radiation associated with visible light. And \"what about those frequencies absorbed by matter in the visible spectrum?\"\n\nAt this point we are not claiming to know all the frequencies that constitute thermal energy, but it may constitute much more of our Sun's insolation than most currently believe.",

OUR SUN'S INSOLATION\n\n\"Is the near infrared [aka visible infrared: 740 nm to 3000 nm], actually part of what is called thermal radiation?\" Interestingly, near infrared emission and adsorption are often attributed to changes in a molecule's rotationalvibrational movement, which implies some sort of thermal energy. Of course, our new understanding poises the question \"is this in excess of the thermal signature that is generally subtracted as a blank in a spectrometer?\" It seems logical. Fig. 1. Sketch illustrating the differences in our Sun's spectral irradiance at the top of the atmosphere versus at sea level. Notice how the curve flattens out as the wavelengths become longer. Fig. 1 shows our Sun's irradiance versus wavelength, i.e., blackbody curve for T=5,700 K. It is accepted that our Solar radiation is; 5% ultraviolet (300-370 nm), 43% visible (370-740 nm), and 52% infrared [13]. Note that, Fig. 1 only shows up to the near infrared (740-3,000 nm), with the thermal infrared starting at 3,000 nm, i.e., extending to the far right.\n\nConsider the near infrared spectral irradiance, as is witnessed at sea level. It roughly approximates a \"decreasing linear\" function of increasing wavelength. However, the requirement for the Rayleigh-Jean's approximation as ascribed by ℎ ≪ is not valid for most of the near infrared. It can be shown that ℎ ≈ when, λ ≈2,500 nm =2.5μm. I.e., the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation when applied to our Sun's insolation only becomes valid when λ>2.5μm.\n\nAccepting that λ > 3μm = 3,000 nm constitutes the majority of thermal energy that is witnessed here on Earth, may help explain why system's thermal energies here on Earth tend to be directly proportional to temperature. When viewed in Fig. 1, it visually appears irrelevant.\n\n\nIX. COMPARING SUN'S INFRARED TO VISIBLE",

There is virtually no UV light above 13.6 eV, the ionization energy of atomic hydrogen (H), because of absorption by neutral H surrounding stellar sources of UV radiation.

                    "contents": "New Thermodynamics: Temperature, Sun’s Insolation, Thermal, and Blackbody RadiationThe following metaphysical argument arises. Traditionalists claim that the act of placing a thermometer into the vacuum, is the act of giving that vacuum a temperature. Certainly, the energy associated with thermal radiation is generally minute, when compared to the thermal energy of molecular motions. Therefore, more often than not, ignoring a system's thermal radiation, enables one to still accurately calculate a system's total thermal energy. This does not mean that a vacuum has no temperature.\n\nWhen a spectrum of photons strikes matter, the photons are either, (a) reflected by the matter's surface, where Published on March 9, 2020. reflected visible spectrum photons give the matter its color, (b) transmitted through the matter, i.e., do not interact with the matter except for the photon's refraction, or (c) absorbed into the matter becoming molecular vibrations within that matter, i.e., thermal phonons.\n\nA blackbody is considered to be the perfect absorber, which is to say that all incident radiation is absorbed by the matter thus explaining its blackness, e.g., carbon black is considered as the perfect absorber, i.e., its absorptivity approaches unity. A perfect absorber by definition is also a perfect emitter, and this is Stewart's Law [3], i.e., a perfect emitter's emissivity also approaches unity. A graybody is a substance whose emissivity is less than unity.\n\n\nII. INTRODUCTION: BLACKBODY RADIATION\n\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total emitted power (P) is proportional to the matter's temperature to the fourth power, which is generally considered as being blackbody radiation [3]:\n= 4(1)\nwhere = emissivity = 2π 5 k 4 /15c 2 h 3 = 5.670400x10 -8 J/sm 2 k 4 , and A = surface area [4] The spectral radiancy gives the power emitted [ ( ) ] at each frequency ( ), [4]. Confusingly, the radiance (W/sr . m 2 ) (aka intensity) of a substance is the radiant flux emitted or received, by a surface in a given direction per unit solid angle per unit area. Irradiance is the power received per unit surface area with units being W/m 2 . And The spectral irradiance is the irradiance per unit wavelength or frequency.",

Arguably, some frequencies may be considered as thermal energy, although not necessarily in the same manner as infrared.\n\nPart of the reason that it is so awkward to properly visualize and then interpret may be the constant changing of scale of wavelengths, e.g., nm, , mm. \"Does this help explain the assertion that temperature is directly proportional to the thermal energy density here on Earth's surface?\" It is certainly getting interesting but it is still not conclusive. Namely, \"how does one now explain the reality that system's here on Earth radiate blackbody radiation whose thermal signature cannot be approximated as some linear function of temperature?\"\n\nTemperature is a comparative based upon the Zeroth law. Here on Earth, all comparisons are made to our atmosphere, whose temperature is strongly influenced by our Sun's insolation. Arguably, our atmosphere's temperature adheres to the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation.\n\nFurthermore, thermal equilibrium does not mean that two systems in thermal contact exchange precisely the same radiation spectrum. Rather that they exchange the same quantity of thermal energy. And here on Earth, as the biggest of all heat sinks/baths, our atmosphere will govern the relationships that define any exchanges of thermal energy.\n\nSo perhaps, the best explanation for thermal energy witnessed here on Earth generally being a linear function of temperature is as follows. \"Our atmosphere has its thermal energy density (ET/V) directly proportional to temperature (T). And since all our systems are ultimately compared to the comparatively massive atmosphere then they too can be contemplated in terms of, ET/V ∝ T.\"\n\n\nXI. RETHINKING BLACKBODY RADIATION\n\nInstead of thinking of blackbody radiation as the spectrum that is adsorbed and then re-radiated by most forms of matter, \"what if we think of it as the radiation associated with inelastic molecular (both inter and intra) collisions?\" Just as Bremsstrahlung radiation is associated with an electron's braking in an EM field, blackbody radiation may now be associated with inelastic collisions, at the molecular scale.",

Sodium LGS work by using a ground-based laser, at a wavelength of approximately 589 nm, to excite the D2 resonance of sodium atoms in the mesosphere. Neutral sodium atoms are a minor component of Earth's upper atmosphere, which are predominantly located in the upper mesosphere between about 80 km and 105 km above sea level [10]. These sodium atoms originate primarily from the ablation of meteors [11]. Although atomic sodium is, overall, a minor component of our atmosphere, its large optical crosssection makes it the most favorable atmospheric component for optical excitation [12].\n\nIn general, LGS don't help at all with the problem of precisely measuring the magnitudes of astronomical sources. Moreover, the problem of precisely measuring magnitudesunlike the problem of eliminating atmospheric distortion -is unfortunately not \"simply solved\" by moving one's telescope above the Earth's atmosphere into space [13]. However, by exciting certain alternative resonances (i.e., instead of the D2 resonance) of the upper-atmospheric sodium atoms, one can create a mandatory \"cascade\" of sodium de-excitations, that will then create a two-color artificial star with a precisely 1:1 ratio of yellow (589 nm) to near-infrared (820 nm) photons that are produced in the upper atmosphere. Since the precision of that 1:1 photon production ratio will be known to better than a part in 10 4 (i.e., better than 0.01%), such a \"laser photometric ratio star\" (LPRS) would allow the calibration of astronomical magnitudes Figure 1: A pseudocolor image of a laser guide star (LGS) beacon located near the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, Spain, taken using a small portable telescope placed 3 m from the laser launch site, is shown [8].\n\nIn visible light, a laser photometric ratio star (LPRS) would be expected to appear fairly similar to this image.",

The attenuation in the UV/visible portion of the spectrum of HD 44179 is therefore much greyer than typical interstellar extinction, an effect attributed in the past to extinction by larger grains in the RR (Men'shchikov et al. 2002). We consider it more likely that the large value of R V arises from the fact that only scattered light from HD 44179 can be observed at optical wavelengths. Upon first scattering, scattered light is initially bluer than that of the illumination source, but upon transfer through an optically thick medium and multiple scattering, scattered light also reddens but at a slower rate than expected from the optical path length covered, as shown in the example of the colors of reflection nebulae by Witt (1985). The high value of the estimated visual attenuation of A V = 4.2 mag and the fact that scattered light must be re-directed by 90 degrees require that multiple scattering is the dominant process for the transfer of optical radiation from the center of the RR.\n\n\nUV/Optical Attenuation Curve",

From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres 1-5 . Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto a large rocky or icy core 6 .",

As a result, it is unlikely that any ice exists on grains that receive substantial UV radiation. Therefore, protostellar UV radiation will likely not contribute to the energetic processing of grains in hot cores/hot corinos at 100-300 K. The ices will have sublimated at these temperatures into the gas phase, where high abundances of terrestrial-like organic molecules are observed. In contrast, in protoplanetary disks, stellar blackbody radiation from young stars, f including UV photons as well as intense bursts of stellar X-rays, lead to photochemistry as well as radiation chemistry. Similarly, blackbody radiation from the outer layers of the Sun, along with the solar wind of high-energy (up to10 keV) particles, is responsible for the photochemistry and radiation chemistry of solar system planetary objects.\n\n\nSecondary UV radiation\n\nThe source of UV light that initiates chemical reactions within cold starless cores and their environs, known as dark clouds, is thought to be local because these clouds are opaque to external UV light from the interstellar radiation field. The UV photons are formed interior to these molecular clouds where cosmic rays, mainly comprised of protons with energies between 10 and 100 MeV, ionize molecular hydrogen to generate secondary electrons, with mean energies around 30 eV. 13 These low-energy secondary electrons and primary cosmic rays excite the Lyman and Werner band systems of molecular hydrogen. The subsequent relaxation of the generated excited states leads to UV emission, whose spectrum is shown in Figure 2. The UV spectrum within dark clouds is, therefore, very similar to that of microwave-discharge hydrogen-flow lamps (MDHLs) used in typical \"photochemistry\" experiments. 14 However, the flux of secondary UV photons is estimated to be 10 3 photons cm −2 sec −1 , which is significantly smaller than that of MDHLs used in the laboratory to simulate UV radiation in dark, dense molecular clouds.\n\nf Young stars are categorized as T Tauri stars, Herbig Ae/Be stars, or massive young stellar objects.\n\n\nFigure 2",

( 2): absorption by water vapor in star magnitudes for 1 cm ppw, and µ -the dimensionless parameter describing the variation of the absorption with the water vapor concentration.The parameter c is constant for a given pressure.In real observations, in the first approximation it corresponds to the average effective pressure of the water vapor in the atmosphere, P eff.(for Lindenberg, P eff.= 0.845 atm = 856 hPa).Estimates show that P eff.deviates from its average value by less than ±70 hPa, which corresponds to the expected maximum variation of c±4−5%.Therefore, the dependence of the parameter c on P eff.should be taken into account only for a small number of abnormal cases.Schmid et al.

The Herzberg bands, a series of bands between 300 and 250 nm corresponding excitation to the 3 uA   levels, lie below the ground state dissociation energy and are therefore strictly forbidden to dissociate.47 The Herzberg continuum does not contribute to the UV opacity of the Earth's atmosphere because it is overlapped by far stronger ozone absorption, also plotted inFigure 11, while the Schumann-Runge continuum and bands dominate their part of the atmosphere's absorption spectrum, with the next-greatest contribution from Rayleigh scattering being negligible in comparison.47",

It can be observed how the solar spectrum does not strictly follow the blackbody law in atmospheric composition with location, elevation and season are limited. More significant seasonal and location-dependent fluctuation are observed in the precipitable water, i.e., the water contained in a column of unit cross-section extending from the Earth's surface to the \"top\" of the atmosphere. Finally, the last atmospheric parameter affecting solar irradiance in cloudless conditions is the aerosol, i.e., the presence of small suspended particles that manifests itself with a reduced visibility or increased turbidity. In Fig. 2, the effect of a standard atmosphere is shown with respect to the extra-terrestrial radiation (ETR). The absorption by the ozone layer is responsible for a significant shielding in the UV-portion, shifting the begin of the window for solar photochemistry from 250 to 300 nm [17]. The lack of UVC photons in the solar radiation at ground has a significant impact on the photochemical transformation that can be powered by solar light. In recent years, mostly thanks to photoredox catalysis, visible light has been recognized as a viable activation method for several reactions. On the one hand, the use of visible light simplifies the photoreactor design: for example, UV-transparent glass (e.g., quartz of Vycor) can be replaced by less expensive glass or polymeric materials. On the other hand, the wide availability of inexpensive, efficient and narrowband lamps emitting in the visible, such as LEDs, reduces the attractiveness of sunlight as a free photon source. It should be noted, though, that the intensity of the solar spectrum in the visible is significantly higher than in the UV range (see Fig. 2). This comparison is even more compelling when the solar spectrum is described in term of its quantic photon flux as opposed to the energy associated with its radiation.

WHAT IS THERMAL ENERGY?\n\nThermal energy resides within condensed matter, as both intermolecular vibrations that are between molecules, and intramolecular vibrations that are between the various atoms within a molecule. A better definition may be that thermal energy consists of a spectrum of thermal photons (thermal radiation) whose wavelengths are sufficiently long that they are readily absorbed by condensed matter plus any phonons that are associated with molecular vibrations (both inter and intra). Of course, a most rudimentary definition being that thermal energy is heat.\n\nHere on Earth, thermal energy primarily involves frequencies at, and/or close to the infrared spectrum with the emphasis on the \"thermal infrared\" [aka mid infrared: (3μm < λ < 8μm)] and into the far infrared [aka long infrared (8μm < λ < 15μm)].\n\nShorter wavelength photons, such as those in the near infrared (740nm < λ < 3μm) and those considered as visible light (380nm < λ < 740nm) can also contribute as thermal energy, e.g., when they are absorbed by matter. This absorbed energy becomes part of that matter's various vibrational energies. And this energy is generally, then reradiated as thermal photons, i.e., at a lower frequency (infrared) than the absorbed frequencies.\n\n\nVI. WHAT ABOUT BLACKBODY RADIATION?\n\nBlackbody radiation is theoretically limited to cavities within crystalline matter. Strangely, it is also association with radiation from both our Sun, and very hot molten metal, neither of which are crystalline.\n\nMoreover, both liquids and amorphous solids lack any crystalline structure, and yet it is accepted that the thermal energy resides. \"Is this not also blackbody?\"\n\nBased upon accepted theory one might argue that there is some profound difference between thermal energy and blackbody radiation beyond their associations with temperature. Yet when considering their heat capacities, all condensed matter fundamentally adheres to the same principles, e.g., the law of Dulong and Petit. It strikes this author as odd that crystalline solids thermally behave the same as amorphous solids, yet theoretically they are not theoretically considered the same it comes to their radiation.",

Far from losing their photochemical characteristics, these dilute, thin layers of material apparently acquire a number of new ones, which, as Weigert has pointed out (1921), will be of significance in any consideration of the mechanism of color vision.\n\nWe may therefore accept the proposition that the high intensity curve in Fig. 5 represents the absorption spectrum of a dilute solution of a photosensitive substance in the condition in which it is in the cones.

The fluorescence streak was also present only with a phase-matched mixture of the two gasses. (Fig. 6).

For Xe and Kr, a threshold of 500 was used, and for Ar a threshold of 20000 relative intensity was used. The Xe/Ar spectrum (Fig. 7 (a)) shows predominantly Xe I spectral lines and weak Ar I spectral lines. The lines are similar in relative signal to those observed from a xenon arc lamp, indicating that the fluorescence is likely from electron-ion recombination in xenon. The spectrum for the Xe/Kr system (Fig.7 (b)) also shows predominantly Xe I spectral lines, with Kr I spectral lines appearing relatively weakly. Xenon is ionized preferentially despite being present in a lower concentration than the phasematching gasses (Ar or Kr). This would seem to indicate that ionization is not due to just the high electric field of the 355 nm light, but a resonant process involving xenon. The energetics suggest a two-photon process is causing the ionization of xenon. The energy of a single 118 nm photon (10.5eV) is below the ionization potential of xenon (12.1 eV).

The electron begins again to acquire energy, producing another excitation, but under proper conditions never acquires energy sufficient to ionize xenon atoms.\n\nThe excited xenon gas atom rapidly forms an excimer. An infrared transition produces a relaxed excimer, for which the characteristic excitation energy is ~7.3 eV, (175 nm) somewhat less than the first excited state of xenon at 8.32 eV.

In other words, for broadly optimal E/p conditions, only about ~10 -12 V is expended per photon. For example, a gain M =1000 is possible with 10 -12 kV across the gap supporting the EL field. In practice, due to limited geometrical coverage and PMT quantum efficiency, the detection efficiency of the EL light is less than 10%, and the number of detected photons n pe is the quantum bottleneck dominating the statistical precision.",

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe characteristics of the Desirs beamline FTS [49][50][51] and general properties of ultraviolet interferometry 48 are given in detail elsewhere and are only briefly described here. The spectrometer is based upon a wave-frontdivision interferometer and may be operated at XUV and VUV wavelengths. A reflection-only configuration has been chosen due to the difficulty in manufacturing beamsplitters with the required optical-quality in the VUV and transparency in the XUV. The coherent synchrotronbeam is spatially divided at the interface of two roofshaped reflectors and an interference pattern is generated following its recombination at a photodiode. An interferogram is recorded by systematically translating one of the reflectors, altering the optical path-difference of the divided beams. The purified 14 N 15 N sample flows continuously through a 100 mm windowless absorption-cell with two 150 mm × 28 mm 2 external capillaries. Thus, the sample gas column density could not be diagnosed absolutely.",

N is considered a quantum number and can be constant and take on only whole integer values. A transition where n=1 is known as a fundamental absorption. These fundamental absorptions are about 100 times less energetic in the NIR region and less energetic means longer wavelength. When n is greater than 1, the transition is known as an overtone. By looking at Equation 2, it is evident that as n increases, the energy to be absorbed also increases. This in turn indicates that shorter wavelengths will need to be absorbed. These absorptions generally occur in the NIR region. Equation 2 predicts fairly well the absorptions of two atoms bonded together (called diatomic molecules), but does not take into account all of the surrounding effects for polyatomic (many atom) molecules, such as overlapping absorption bands or hydrogen bonding. Organic molecules exist in energy states that absorb NIR wavelengths (energies). Metals, such as silver, lead, and most inorganics, cannot absorb NIR light because they have electrons incapable of absorbing NIR wavelengths, therefore there is no interaction to measure. Generally, only organic molecules can absorb wavelengths in the NIR region. It is actually the energy state of a molecule which allows us to perform a measurement with NIR. Now imagine a sample made up of many, many electrons, protons and neutrons. These particles are arranged into atoms, and further into molecules. The sample can be made of different types of molecules, meaning there can be water molecules, protein molecules and so on. When they take on these arrangements, they also take on different properties such as the ability to absorb different wavelengths of light, therefore, quite a few different energies might be absorbed. When a measurement is performed on this sample, what the instrument is measuring is the number of photons which undergo the absorption process for a particular wavelength. The number of photons absorbed is proportional to the amount of particular type of molecule present in the sample. This statement is more or less Beer's Law which states that \"absorption is proportional to concentration.\" In principle, that is what is occurring and is the basis for an NIR measurement.

This spectral region is clearly irrelevant with respect to photolysis in the lower troposphere, where only solar radiation at λ>290 nm is available. In the 500-750 nm region of the I 2 spectrum, the underlying continuum is overlapped with vibrational structure between 500 and 650 nm, which arises from the B 3 (0 + u )←X 1 + g transition (Calvert and Pitts, 1966;Okabe, 1978 Fig. 3.

These investigations demonstrated that as the total gas pressure is raised (at constant I 2 vapour pressure), absorption in the highly structured region from 500 to 570 nm initially increases before levelling off at a pressure of about 500 Torr. Pressure broadening is thought to prevent saturation at line centres in this region, so that cross-sections in the high pressure regime should be more accurate than those measured under low ambient gas pressure (Goy and Pritchard, 1964;Ogryzlo and Thomas, 1965;and Tellinghuisen , 1973).

By using the magnetic field deflector, it was proved that the possible contribution of the negative ions into the threshold electron intensity is less than 3%. The E i = 20 eV spectrum measured for forward scattering (Θ = 10 • ) displays three main energy-loss bands at 4.9, 6.4 and 7.2 eV and is similar to that obtained in the UV photoabsorption [11,12]. The spectrum, however, shows different relative intensities of the bands to those in the UV spectrum. It is in accord with energy-loss spectrum recorded earlier at 100 eV incident energy [40]. The E R = 2 eV spectrum obtained at backward scattering (Θ = 180 • ) reveals the lowest lying intense energy-loss band at 4.0 eV. In this spectrum, the maxima of the 4.9 and 6.4 eV bands are shifted now to lower energies by about 100 and 150 meV, respectively. Moreover, the origin of the 6.4 eV peak is moved to lower energy and the 7.2 eV band is wider and has much lower relative intensity. The 4.0 eV energy-loss peak supports the earlier observations of excitation transitions in the He + ion [20] and electron [12,19,20] impacts. The E R = 15 meV threshold spectrum, in comparison to that of E i = 20 eV, exhibits the maximum of the 4.9 eV band moved by about 100 meV to higher energy. Overlapping bands are also evident in the energy region around 5.5 eV. Further, the 6.4 eV energyloss band significantly gained in intensity and a low intensity peak appeared at 8.3 eV.

Basically, one distinguishes between ultraviolet photoemission (UPS), mainly for the (angle-resolved) investigation of valence band states (ARUPS) and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), providing the investigation of core-level states at higher binding energies. This separation is mainly based on the two different types of quasimonochromatic excitation sources that are available under laboratory conditions, namely VUV line spectra of discharge lamps for energies in the range of approximately 10-50 eV, e.g. with rare gases like helium (He I α : 21.23 eV and He II α : 40.82 eV), and the characteristic lines from the x-ray source, for which the most commonly used anode materials are aluminium (Al-K α 1,2 : 1486.6 eV) and magnesium (Mg-K α 1,2 : 1253.6 eV).

First, the random errors introduced by fitting to a noisy spectrum were assessed by the optimisation routine and varied broadly depending on the signal-to-noise ratio at each line's peak and its blendedness. Second, the column density of flowing 14 N 15 N in the FTS absorption cell is unknown so that the deduced absorption f -values must be uniformly scaled relative to an absolute reference. There are no existing measurements of 14 N 15 N absolute f -values but 14 N 2 has been characterised with 10% uncertainty in a previous synchrotron-and diffraction-grating-based absorption experiment. [17][18][19] A calibration of 14 N 15 N column density may be made relative to 14 N 2 assuming an isotopomeric independence of f -values. This independence is reasonable only for the lowest b 1 Π u vibrational levels because of the occurrence of large isotopomer-sensitive perturbations for higher-energy electronic-vibrational states, as discussed below. A column density of 1.2 × 10 15 cm −2 was deduced for the lower-energy FTS spectrum plotted in Fig. 1 following the comparison of 14 N 2 and 14 N 15 N f -values for 82 rotational transitions to 5 excited vibrational levels, b 1 Π u (v = 0 − 4). Overlapping bands of the higher-lying spectrum were cross calibrated with this and a column density of 1.1 × 10 15 cm −2 deduced. Given the large number of transitions compared between experiments and spectra, the uncertainty of the deduced column densities are dominated by the original 10% transferred from measurements of 14 N 2 . Thus, a 10% systematic uncertainty has been assigned to all measured f -values. Third, a significant addition to the uncertainty of measured f -values arises from environmentallyinduced mechanical vibrations afflicting the translation mechanism of the FTS. Assuming the occurrence of a periodic translation-error as the path difference of the interferometer is scanned, the resultant spectrum will include ghost reproductions of itself doubly repeated at higher and lower energies. 56 In the present measurements, the environmental noise is sufficiently aperiodic that sharp spectral features are not apparently aliased in this way, apart from a few extremely-weak ghost features which are likely",

In this paper, I focus on the possibility that it may be possible to reduce F itself, substantially, while maintaining G F by a proportional increase in optical gain.\n\n\nThe Fano factor and the Penning effect\n\nThe Fano factor reflects the impact of a fixed energy input on the energy partition among major pathways of energy loss. The fluctuations in number populations of ionization, excitation, and heat are constrained by the fixed energy input. Providentially, the Fano factor for not-too-dense xenon, as foot-noted above, is much smaller than 1. The only apparent way to reduce F further is to eliminate or severely reduce the population of excitations through the Penning effect. Because one of two populations is severely reduced, the fluctuations in both populations is reduced, producing the desired result for ionization.\n\nThe Penning effect occurs in noble gases, to which an impurity atom/molecule with an ionization potential (IP) slightly smaller than the excitation energy of the long-lived noble gas atoms or excimers has been added. Collisional de-excitation of the majority noble gas by the impurity leads to 2 The factor J CP honors the pioneering contributions of C. A. N. Conde  ionization of the impurity. With xenon, no noble gas Penning effect candidates are possible, leaving only molecular species. For molecular impurities, the efficiency of the Penning process appears to depend not only on the IP, but on chemical or structural characteristics as well, as breakup reactions may also occur, instead of ionization. The choices appear to be few.",

A value of α Xe = 0.84(1) × 10 −37 cm 5 is extracted from the fit, where the error bar represents only the statistical uncertainty in the fit. We can compare this value of α Xe to one calculated using an oscillator strength f = 0.379 from Chan et al. 39 and a collisional broadening coefficient β = 5.6GHz/T orr extracted from the experimental data in Ferrel et al. 38 . The two lines in xenon nearest to the 118 nm light are the Xe ( 2 P 3/2 )5d 3 2 line at 119.2 nm and the Xe ( 2 P 3/2 )7s line at 117 nm.

Here, * indicates a convolution; I 0 (ν) is the νdependent intensity of the synchrotron light-source; N is the column density of the target gas; and the instrumental broadening is represented by the right-hand braced term which consists of two components convolved together. The first of these arises from the finite pathdifference achievable while recording interferograms and contributes a FWHM of Γ 1 = 0.27 cm −1 , which is the instrument's theoretical resolution. The second factor contributes additional Gaussian-shaped broadening which was found to be necessary during the analysis of the 14 N 15 N spectrum. The natural linewidths of several observed bands are known from previous experiments; i.e., excitations to b(0), b(1), b(5), b(6), and c 3 (0) (with widths and references listed in Table II); and c ′ 4 (2) (listed in Table III). Without additional instrumental broadening the fitted widths of transitions to these levels were consistently larger than expected by ∼0.05 cm −1 FWHM. Because of this, a compensating Gaussian broadening was introduced by setting Γ 2 in Eq. (1) to 0.13 cm −1 . This value was arrived at by fixing the widths of model transitions to the 6 levels listed above and optimising Γ 2 so as to best match the observed spectrum. The 6 bands were fitted independently with Γ 2 falling in the range 0.11-0.14 cm −1 FWHM, neglecting a somewhat larger value for the relatively weakly appearing b(0) − X band. This spread implies an uncertainty in the adopted mean value of ∼ 0.02 cm −1 FWHM. The likely cause of this extra broadening is the non-ideal collimation of the synchrotron beam entering the FTS. The broadening of narrow features in FTS spectra has been previously noted 52,53 where a component of the incident radiation is not aligned with the interferometer's principal axis. The angular distribution of the present synchrotron beam is  apparently significant but is not well known. Here, a simple Gaussian model of the resultant broadening was adopted in the absence of a more precise characterisation.",

Traditionalists claim that the act of placing a thermometer into the vacuum, is the act of giving that vacuum a temperature. Certainly, the energy associated with thermal radiation is generally minute, when compared to the thermal energy of molecular motions. Therefore, more often than not, ignoring a system's thermal radiation, enables one to still accurately calculate a system's total thermal energy. This does not mean that a vacuum has no temperature.\n\nWhen a spectrum of photons strikes matter, the photons are either, (a) reflected by the matter's surface, where Published on March 9, 2020. reflected visible spectrum photons give the matter its color, (b) transmitted through the matter, i.e., do not interact with the matter except for the photon's refraction, or (c) absorbed into the matter becoming molecular vibrations within that matter, i.e., thermal phonons.\n\nA blackbody is considered to be the perfect absorber, which is to say that all incident radiation is absorbed by the matter thus explaining its blackness, e.g., carbon black is considered as the perfect absorber, i.e., its absorptivity approaches unity.

PVLAS [13] Collaboration and Q & A Collaboration [14] are specifically looking for such a QED vacuum birefringence. With high requirements on sensitivity, the apparatuses of these experiments are applicable to the gaseous CME measurement, especially for tiny birefringent effects, such as that of hydrogen, neon, helium, or gas under low pressure or in low magnetic field. PVLAS Collaboration has recently measured Cotton-Mouton effects in krypton, xenon, nitrogen [15], neon [16], with an earlier result on oxygen [17] at the wavelength of 1064 nm. In this Letter, we report our results at the same wavelength for various gases. The results on argon and carbon dioxide are new.\n\nThe small ellipticity induced in gas can be measured from a pair of crossed polarizers with high extinction ratio. The magnetic birefringence is due to difference in the index of refraction n for light polarization parallel and perpendicular to the external transverse magnetic field B and is proportional to the magnitude of this field B to the second power. For dilute gas, n is proportional to the pressure P. For the Cotton-Mouton coefficient we will follow [10] and use the normalized Cotton-Mouton birefringence n u at P = 1 atm and B = 1 T. With this definition, we have n  n || -n  = n u (B/1 T) 2 (P/1 atm).\n\n(1)\n\nThe phase retardation  of light between these two polarization directions is:\n = (2/)nL B ,(2)\nwhere L B is the effective length of the magnetic field, and the wavelength of light.

Many investigations have been made of the catalytic reaction which occurs in contact with various surfaces, and of the phenomena accompanying the production of flame or explosion in the gas. Little is known about the conditions governing the rate of the actual chemical change in the gas phase, because although flames and explosions depend very much upon these they are determined by a great many other factors as well.\n\nIn 1899 Bodenstein,* following up some work initiated by Victor Meyer, made a long series of experiments by streaming mixtures of the two gases through porcelain vessels, heated to a constant temperature, and then analysing the products. He came to the conclusion that the reaction is of the third order, following the equation d [H20 ][dt = h [H2]2 combination was very different in different vessels, he inferred that the reaction was taking place almost entirely on the surface of the vessel.\n\nBone and Wheeler,f by circulating the gases at lower temperatures for long periods, measured the rate of slow surface combination in contact with various materials, including porcelain, and found that under these conditions the reaction was of the first order.\n\nComparing these results with those of Bodenstein, the natural conclusion would be that at the lowT er temperatures the porcelain surface is relatively thickly covered with adsorbed molecules, so that pressure has a comparatively small effect on the reaction, thus giving an apparent order of unity. With increasing temperature the adsorption diminishes and ultimately becomes small enough for the chance that two molecules of hydrogen and one of oxygen should find themselves in juxtaposition on the surface to be proportional to the concentration product [H2]2 [0 2] in the gas phase.",

Both the familiar and unacquainted readers would find this information interesting and even entertaining at times. Generally, the origins of modern medical hydrogen research are similar to most fields of research, beginning with a basic observation in nature followed by the development of hypotheses. The surprising elements come from the facts and anecdotes, ranging from TV documentary series to descriptions of multiple mind-boggling medical miracles. Others may also be intrigued to read examples of how popular culture and seemingly improbable events deemed to be nonscientific could lead to substantial biomedical research. The information located in the middle of the book is more technical and scientifically based. These sections provide information regarding endogenous production, diffusion, conductivity, saturation, and heat capacity of hydrogen. The writers also expertly delve into the safety and toxicity on hydrogen relaying findings from diving medicine research containing information of how hydrogen affects the respiratory system, the circulatory system, and the gastrointestinal system. In addition, detailed descriptions of several detection methods of hydrogen such as the various techniques involving gas chromatography, oxidometry, and rheophore detection are analyzed and discussed too.\n\n\nBOOK REVIEW\n\n\nAn innovative collection in hydrogen molecular biology and medicine research\n\nA comprehensive classification of the components of reactive oxygen species (ROS) combined with thorough characterizations of how an imbalance of ROS can lead to oxidative stress and injury can also be gained from reading this book. Furthermore, the reader can find descriptions of studies where hydrogen therapy has played roles combatting oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis in many diseases.\n\nIn the final portions, the editors generate ideas about barriers to hydrogen therapy research and translation as well as where the field of hydrogen biology and medicine is headed next. Although hydrogen therapy has been demonstrated in more than 60 animal models and 6 human diseases with reports of minimal or no side effects, specific details concerning the correct amount, frequency, and timing of dosage still requires further investigation. The editors also suggest that remaining research should be more focused around the molecular mechanism of action, dose-response in the clinical setting, double-blinded randomized clinical trials, biological systems testing, and the study of similar gas molecules.",

If we dispense with the assumption that nitrogen peroxide acts as a catalytic poison for the deactivating process 3, the denominator of the expression above will not be positive at all until the value of [N 0 2] reaches that corresponding to the upper limit. In other words, the smallest trace of nitrogen peroxide should initiate the explosion. But it is also evident that if [N 02] is actually zero there is no explosion. Now the first traces of nitrogen peroxide added may be rendered ineffectual by adsorption on the walls. Thus a finite concentration would be necessary to raise the effective value of & i/{[N 02], [H2]}, the numerator, above zero. This would correspond to the critical lower limit.We do not suggest that the above explanations are exact in detail, for the whole process is evidently one of great complexity. But it seemed to be a definite advantage if the principal facts could be fitted into some simple hypothetical scheme, which should at least represent the kind of mechanism underlying this remarkable reaction.

Of these bands, on the basis of the presence or absence of certain low J lines, two are clearly (Ω ′ = 3/2) ← (Ω ′′ = 3/2), and two are clearly (Ω ′ = 1/2) ← (Ω ′′ = 3/2) with considerable Ω-doubling. Based on values of the rotational constants, band origin ν, and isotope shifts, we are able to assign these four bands and the remaining four less well-resolved bands to a common lower electronic state, with rotational constants in good agreement with the X1.5 state identified in Ref. 7. The upper state of these bands we assign to one of two newly identified electronic states: a state with Ω ′ = 3/2 at 14223 cm −1 , which we label [14.2]1.5, and a state with Ω ′ = 1/2 at 13833 cm −1 , which we label [13.8]\n0.5.\nOn each of the bands acquired at high resolution we perform a non-linear least squares fit to a vibrational band contour. The doubling for all Ω = 3/2 levels is unresolved. For the lower states of all eight bands and for the upper states of the bands at 13496, 13554, 14159, and 14223 cm −1 we fit using the following Hamiltonian:\nF (J) = T + BJ(J + 1).(1)\nThe bands at 13760, 13833, 14352, and 14429 cm −1 we fit to an upper state using the Hamiltonian [11], with selection rules for the P, Q, and R branches:",

In the past, this equation has been used to determine vibrational polarizabilities from experimental IR data and from calculations. 10 We include our derivation here because it appears to be rather simple in comparison to previous derivations that appear in the literature. Eq. (20) follows immediately from Eq. (17.29) of Born and Huang. 11 It has also been derived by Flytzanis. 12 Probably the earliest modern discussion of vibrational polarizabilities using quantum-mechanical derivations can be found in Ref. 7,8 where applications to CHCl 3 and CHF 3 are discussed and the above formula is derived within a sum over states method within the clamped nucleus approximation. Eq. (1) and A5 of Ref. 7b lead to our Eq. (20). However, as noted in Refs 7 and 8, one of the earliest discussions dates back to 1924. 9 In addition to the interaction discussed above, there are other smaller vibrational effects that modify the polarizability of a molecule. The presence of the field modifies the spring constant matrix which changes the zeropoint energy of the molecule. Also, the occurrence of anharmonicity, both diagonal and off-diagonal, leads to further corrections. We are unaware of discussions on the role of off-diagonal anharmonicity, but discussion of the zero-point effect and diagonal anharmonicity may be found in Ref. 13. In the notation of the work of Marti and Bishop, the above term is equivalent to [µ 2 ] 0,0 in their paper.",

A similar level of accuracy was obtained byKaledin and Miller    propagating coherent states.35 This result confirms the quality of theMC-SCIVR approximation independently of the particular reference state (harmonic or coherent)propagated.For a general N v -dimensional system, the size of the (truncated) harmonic basis set, obtained considering all the possible N v -dimensional direct products of 1dimensional harmonic eigenstates up to the quantum number k max , is (k max + 1) Nv , and hence it grows exponentially with the number of vibrational degrees of freedom. This issue makes the description of vibrational wavefunctions of medium-size or larger molecular systems (i.e. when N v ∼ 10 or bigger) virtually undoable because the dimension of the basis set would be too large to be stored in a computer. This is not the case for the water molecule (N v = 3) and hence, expanding the eigenfunctions in terms of the first 11 harmonic states (k max = 10) the total number of states in the basis set adds up to just 11 3 = 1331. Even if such a calculation for water is feasible, in view of future applications of this method to molecules of higher dimensionality we reduced the amount of data to be stored by setting all coefficients with amplitude smaller than 0.01 to zero. The surviving coefficients were refined by enforcing orthonormality by means of the GS algorithm. In this way, the ground state eigenfunction was decomposed on just five harmonic states, while excited states required to increase the basis set size up to about 10 elements.The eigenfunctions are plotted in three different cuts of the configurational space inFig. 3where they are also compared with their reference DVR estimate. The accuracy obtained is very high for all cases and the effect of the truncation of the basis set is barely visible on the nodal planes where the SC wavefunctions are slightly overstructured. In perspective, this procedure can help overcome the curse of dimensionality given by the exponential growth of the size of the harmonic basis as a function of the system dimensionality. In fact, in order to moderate the number of harmonic states to generate, a polynomial growth can be enforced",

Calculated Δ 298,g values were also compared to an alternative experimental reference set in which eighteen presumably more accurate Δ 298,g values recommended by Dorofeeva and colleagues [20][21][22][23][24] were substituted for corresponding values in the original set of experimental values. Also substituted in this alternative experimental reference set was the Δ 298,g value for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene listed in Cox and Pilcher's \"Thermochemistry of Organic and Organometallic Compounds\" [19]. Finally, it should be noted that during the course of this investigation it appeared that the experimental Δ 298,g value for dinitromethylbenzene might be several kcal/mol too low. To address this possibility we used an approach similar to that used successfully by Dorofeeva et al. [21][22][23] to deal with such issues. Specifically we used density functional theory (EDF2 [30] functional and the 6-311++G (2df,2p) basis set) coupled with the use of ten isodesmic equations to calculate a Δ 298,g reference value of 14.2 ± 0.3 for dinitromethylbenzene. This value was also included in the alternative reference set.\n\nIt should be mentioned that many of the computed RM1 and PM7 Δ 298,g values for compounds appearing in Table 1 have been previously reported [13,14]. Similarly most of the T1 Δ 298,g values appear in the Spartan Spectra and Properties Database (SSPD) data base that accompanies Spartan 14. In general, our results are quite consistent with these previously reported values. In some instances, however, slightly lower Δ 298,g values were calculated indicating the existence of lower-energy equilibrium geometries than those used in previous investigations.\n\n\nResults and Discussion",

One such quantity is H o (298.15 K)-H o (0 K), the standard molar enthalpy increment (standard integrated heat capacity) of H 2 16 O between 298.15 and 0 K [H o (0 K) = 0.0 J mol −1 ]. This value is given for water in the official CODATA compilation 10 as 9.905 ± 0.005 kJ mol −1 . Naturally, the value we compute, 9.904 04 ± 0.000 01 kJ mol −1 , falls within the uncertainty of the old value, but it is more accurate by about two orders of magnitude. The newly determined value is insensitive to any reasonable change in the energy levels; the value is completely determined by energy levels lower than about 5000 cm −1 , and, notably, even the present first-principles PoKaZaTeL energy levels yield the same value though with higher uncertainty. While the present suggested change in the standard molar enthalpy increment of H 2 16 O is more or less inconsequential for most thermochemistry, as enthalpies of formation cannot be determined with this exceedingly small uncertainty, it nevertheless exemplifies the fact that it is more and more realistic to use high-resolution spectroscopic data to directly calculate thermodynamic quantities with minuscule uncertainties.\n\n\nThe low-temperature limit",

Water dependence could account for the differences in the DeMore and Cox studies as water vapour concentrations were significant in these studies. Although water was used as a precursor in the studies of Dransfeld and Wagner and Braun et al., water was present at such low concentrations that it could not have contributed through gas phase complexation of HO 2 , but reactions were carried out under conditions where heterogeneous processes could have contributed. In all studies, k 1 has been extracted from complex and from relatively slow chemistry enhancing the potential for secondary chemistry or other systematic issues. Of course, as stated in the main text, we cannot rule out the potential for unknown systematic errors in our work. i) Grain size -in a master equation, energies of the species are divided into grains. The smaller the grain size, the more accurate, but also, more expensive the calculation is. Table  S4a shows the variation in k 1 with grain size. Our calculations typically use a 50 cm -1 grain size which is a good compromise between precision and computational cost.  iii) Low frequency vibrations in the transition state -Densities of states and state counts required for RRKM calculations are strongly influenced by the lowest frequency vibrations. Indeed, whether a motion is treated as a vibration or a hindered rotor, can have a significant effect. Table S4c shows the variation in k 1 as the lowest vibrational frequency for the transition state calculated by Burke et al. (121 cm -1 ) is either halved or doubled. As would be expected, decreasing the vibrational frequency increases the number of states accessible in the transition state and hence increases k 1. iv) -Imaginary frequency - Table S4d shows the variation in k 1 is the imaginary frequency. The range has been chosen deliberately to be so wide, reflecting the magnitude of the variation in the imaginary frequency as shown in Table 2. There is a significant effect, with the reaction being enhanced by a higher imaginary frequency. In summary, individually varying the barrier height, low frequency vibrations and imaginary frequency of the Burke et al. calculations input into MESMER can vary k 1 from 2.1 -10.5 x 10 -11 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 . Figure S9 summarizes the impact of varying the lowest frequency vibration and imaginary frequency on k 1 .",

This suggests that oscillation frequency and hardness would merely act upon the thermal distribution. This overlay (assuming R ¼ 0.001986 kcal K À1 mol À1 ) is presented in Fig. 3's inset, demonstrating outstanding agreement. Furthermore, comparing this to \"Region II\" in Fig. 3 well delineates the additional benet of the increased collision rate acting on the thermally available energy. In effect, this means controlling A in the Arrhenius equation. It is important to note that an equivalent control over collision rate cannot be had in well-stirred solutions (e.g., solutions with no gradient in concentration or temperature).",

The only methods then available were fractional recrystallization and distillation, and column chromatography on silica gel, alumina, or partially activated charcoal. Few purified solvents or chemical reagents were available commercially; indeed, as subsequent work showed, most commercially available chemicals were very crude mixtures. Benzene was purified by shaking with sulfuric acid to remove thiophene, then fractionally distilled and fractionally crystallized but was still far from pure as judged from melting-point studies and from later studies with 14C-benzene when that was finally prepared. Other chemicals, especially the potential \"metabolites of benzene, namely, phenol, catechol, quinol (hydroquinone), and hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene), were rigorously purified before use by preparation of derivatives, recrystallization to constant melting points, then hydrolyzed to regenerate the original compounds, which were further recrystallized to purity. In many cases the physical constants of the highly purified metabolites and their derivatives were significantly different from those previously recorded in the literature; this was particularly true where 14C-labeled compounds had been synthesized and where constant specific radioactivity was the accepted criterion of purity. This gave rise to the view, often expressed by British and American chemists at that time, that the physical constants of aromatic compounds characterized before 1950 were probably incorrect and should be redetermined using specific radioactivity as the criterion of purity-an invitation that we firmly resisted so that we could concentrate our research efforts on the metabolism problems. Many years later, when we had adopted gas-liquid chromatography as the means of purification, with a symmetrical peak in two systems as a criterion of purity, we were amazed to receive a sample of 14Ccyclohexane from Amersham (Amersham, U.K.) that contained not only 14C_cyclo_ hexene, 14C-cyclohexadiene, and 14C-benzene, but also 36CI-chlorobenzene as impurities. This discovery led to the realization that coelution of chemically similar compounds could prejudice the use of gas chromatography in purification procedures. Initial studies at Oxford with gas chromatography in the early 1960s showed that commercially",

The relation between this quantity of heat and the temperature of the saturated vapour was found to be in agree ment with the empirical formula :-\nX = 109*0 + 0*24429 t -0-0001315*2,\nin which t is the temperature and X the specified quantity of heat. Unfortunately, data for the specific heat of benzene liquid are not available for the purpose of calculating the latent heat between these temperatures from Regnault's figures. I t is clear, however, from the values obtained for the specific heat at 0° C. (Mills and MaeRae, 5 J. Phys. Chem.,' vol. 14, p. 797, 1910 ;Pickering ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 49, p. 11, 1891) and the fact that this quantity increases with rising temperature, that the equation for the latent heat, L, would become:-\nL = a -bt -2 ...,\nwhere a, b and c are all positive quantities. Thus the variation of the latent heat with temperature would be represented by a curve bending towards the temperature axis. Griffiths and Marshall (£ Phil. Mag.,' 1896) determined the latent heat of benzene at low pressures. The determinations were made over a comparatively small range of temperature, namely 30° C. to 50° C., and one additional experi ment was performed at 20° C. Over this range the latent heat was found to be satisfactorily represented by the linear relation :-L = 107*05 -0*158£.\n\nThe value at the boiling point (80*2° C.) calculated from this formula is 94*37 calories per gram.",

Little change is seen in the vibrational bands of benzene and this is consistent with the negligible changes in the spacings of the vibronic bands in the VUV spectra.

As seen in Section 3.1.1, a blueshift in the vibronic bands is consistent with concentration dependent benzene-water mixing, suggesting strong evidence for benzene-water interaction at the benzene-water interface disrupting the benzene-benzene bonds. The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the residual spectrum after subtraction of a spectrum of benzene deposited on MgF 2 together with the initially deposited water spectrum. The negative baseline above 220 nm is due to scattering effects. However what is also apparent is negative features corresponding to the vibronic bands of the 1 B 1u state. The positions of the negative features are redshifted with respect to the layered spectrum. This negative redshifted component translates to an enhanced blueshifted component of the vibronic bands and suggests an effect due to the benzene-water interaction consistent with the discussion in Section 3.1.1 where the benzene-benzene interaction results in a resdhift of the bands while the condensed phase benzene-water interaction causes a blueshift in the electronic states of benzene. The position of the positive feature near 180 nm in the residual is consistent with the energy of the 1 E 1u state in the dilute 1 : 100 benzene-water matrix. All these arguments point to strong evidence of a benzene-water interaction at the interface of the benzene-water layer. What is also interesting to note is the slightly blueshifted position of the water band 4a 1 : Ã 1 B 1 ' 1b 1 : X 1 A 1 transition from 143.8 nm as  deposited to 142.2 nm in the residual. This is consistent with the blueshift in the water band observed in the 1 : 100 mixture of benzene : water (Section 3.1.1) relative to pure water and may hence be indicative of benzene-water interaction.",

By comparing the similarities between the two components of this band with that of the pure dOH bands, the authors assign them to benzene bonded to 2-coordinated (higher wavenumber) and 3-coordinated (lower wavenumber) dOH respectively. This band appears diminished in intensity and redshifted to 3568 cm À1 in our 1 : 10 mixture, shifting towards the reported positions of the antisymmetric 'double-donor OH-stretches (3568-3543 cm À1 ) in the interaction of benzene with the water octamer' 38 or the 'dO mode' (3549 cm À1 ) in amorphous solid water. 42 We can therefore attribute the 'redshift' of the dOH-p band in the 1 : 10 mixture of benzene to the fact that less of the water ice matrix is disrupted by benzene molecules, giving rise to more higher coordinated water bonds.\n\nOn annealing the 1 : 1 mixture of benzene and water there is a redshift in the dOH-p band from 3616 cm À1 at 24 K to 3599 cm À1 at 90 K and 3593 cm À1 at 140 K. There is little or no evidence of the dOH-p band at 160 K as most of the benzene is desorbing with water crystallisation.

The original method of Pearce et al. (3) was modified to optimize for sensitivity (4), which was 1 pg benzene with an accuracy of ± 5%. Subsequently, when a variable wavelength UV spectrophotometer had been built, the benzene was trapped in ethanol, then quantified spectrophotometrically in the prototype Unicam SP500 (Cambridge Instruments, Cambridge, U.K.) by measurement of the absorption at 255.0 nm with a slit width of 0.4 mm and an Emax of 240 (5). Also, when 14C-benzene had been synthesized, a radiometric method was used; the benzene was trapped in ethanol, converted to the clathrate complex, then counted by the end-window GM tube method.\n\nThe experimental animals were chinchilla rabbits (23 kg bw); they were dosed Environmental Health Perspectives -Vol 104, Supplement 6 * December 1996 with benzene administered orally by gastric intubation or by ip injection.

Qualitatively however the estimated cross sections are reasonable within experimental error and it is interesting to note that the cross sections tend towards the gas phase values with increasing dilution, consistent with the observed energy shifts. 3.1.3 Infrared spectra of benzene : water mixtures. The effect of intermolecular interactions between benzene and water is clearly evident from the infrared spectra of C 6 H 6 : H 2 O mixtures. Fig. 4 shows the infrared spectra of pure water, benzene and 1 : 1, 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 mixtures of C 6 H 6 : H 2 O. What is immediately noticeable is an intense broad (60 cm À1 FWHM) feature at 3616 cm À1 in the OH stretching region of H 2 O in the spectrum of the 1 : 1 mixture of benzene and water. This is the signature region in the IR spectrum of water corresponding to 'dangling' O-H stretches of incompletely hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The position of the band matches well with that of matrix isolated benzene-water at 17 K, reported by Engdahl et al. 31 who observe a concentration dependent structured band between 3620 and 3612 cm À1 due to the benzene-water complex. Silva et al. 30 report a broad (35 cm À1 FWHM) band at 3585 cm À1 in dilute mixtures of benzene and water at 12-15 K. This band is assigned to the p hydrogen-bonded OH benzene-water complex, 38 dOH-p. A benzene-induced apparent redshift of the 'dOD' band was observed by Bahr et al. 33 in D 2 O films exposed to various coverages of benzene at 124 K. The authors report that as benzene coverage was increased, the surface dangling OD band of amorphous deuterated water (at 2728 cm À1 ) decreased in intensity, whilst a broad 'dOD*' band emerged, redshifted by 75 cm À1 relative to dOD. The authors report the same effect in co-deposited benzene and D",

There is a progressive increase in the cross sections of the intense 1 E 1u ' 1 A 1g electronic transition with increased dilution in water from that of pure amorphous benzene towards that of the gas phase. There appears to be a slight increase in the cross sections of the vibronic bands associated with the 1 B 2u ' 1 A 1g electronic transition with increasing dilution of benzene in water which is coincident with a blueshift towards gas phase energies. It is to be noted that these calculations are approximate with estimated errors of up to 20% in the values of the cross sections which would account for any observed discrepancies between the absorbance area normalised data in Fig. 1 and the cross section data in Fig. 3. There are many factors that are expected to contribute to these errors. We know little about the morphology of the ice mixtures and hence the effect on the density of the ice due to mixing. Although it is assumed that there is homogeneous mixing between benzene and water in the ice film as evidenced by the shifts in the bands as a function of concentration, it is possible that there are areas of inhomogeneity due to the nonwetting interaction between water and benzene. The mixing ratios are determined from the partial pressures of benzene and water vapours that are pre-mixed in the gas line. Experience tells us that there could be discrepancies between the mixing cell ratios and the ratios of the vapour deposited ice films. The blue wing of the intense 1 E 1u ' 1 A 1g transition of benzene overlaps with the with the red tail of the water band, adding a concentration dependent error that would be particularly significant in very dilute benzene mixtures. Furthermore the effect of benzene on water cross sections is not known. \n\n\nView Article Online",

There is slight redshift in the 1 B 2u vibronic bands and broadening of the 1 B 1u and 1 E 1u bands. It is not clear what the cause of this is, but may be due to some benzene-benzene interaction as the ice re-orders and desorbs and benzene is very mobile at 160 K which is well above its desorption temperature. The reason why we might be observing this in the 1 : 100 mixture and not in the 1 : 10 mixture may be due to the sample thickness. The 1 : 100 film was much thicker (840 nm) than the 1 : 10 (90 nm) in order to resolve the benzene peaks in the dilute mixture and was therefore captured while it was still in the process of desorbing, whereas the thinner samples were already completely desorbed. 3.1.2 Determining the VUV photoabsorption cross sections of benzene in mixtures. Extracting photoabsorption cross sections of benzene in mixtures with water would be immensely useful in modelling photon driven processes in mixed water matrices. The task is not trivial and introduces many errors, however we made an attempt at extracting such cross sections by assuming a weighted number density n i of benzene molecules in water mixtures for the different concentrations and using eqn (2) where the weighted number density n i (molecules cm À3 ) is determined from:",

                    "contents": "Probing the interaction between solid benzene and water using vacuum ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy.There are four bands visible in the C-H stretching region of the IR spectrum of pure benzene between 3100 and 3000 cm À1 . The same bands are seen in the 1 : 1 mixture, redshifted by 1-3 cm À1 . These bands are too weak to be seen in the more diluted mixtures. The free benzene molecule exhibits four C-H fundamental modes: n 2 (A 1g ), n 7 (E 2g ), n 20 (E 1u ) and n 13 (B 1u ) (in Wilson notation). However, only the n 20 fundamental is IR allowed and in the gas phase the n 1 + n 6 + n 19 and n 8 + n 19 combination bands are observed. 43 Due to the breakdown in symmetry in the solid phase due to intermolecular interactions between the benzene molecules the IR forbidden modes are likely to be allowed, however they are weak and overlap with the combination bands. 34 It can clearly be seen on annealing the benzene film that the bands near 3090 cm À1 and 3003 cm À1 split (Fig. 6). This occurs as a result of crystallisation and ordering of the benzene molecules breaking the degeneracy of the vibrational modes. The splitting is also observed in the 1 : 1 mixture albeit at a higher temperature, consistent with crystallisation observed at higher temperature in the VUV spectra. Benzene C-H stretching features are too weak to be resolved in the 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 mixtures. The splitting in the C-H stretch, n 19 C-C stretch and n 18 C-H twist modes in the 1 : 1 mixture at 140 K is consistent with that of pure benzene at 90 K and indicates little disruption by the presence of water molecules. Furthermore at this temperature the water O-H stretch band resembles the profile of pure water crystallisation, suggesting segregation of benzene and water as both become mobile and benzene begins to desorb. \n\n\nView Article Online",

Is the nature of stabilization in these complexes the same as in others?The attraction in halogen bonded complexes was originally assigned to electrostatic attraction between the positive σ-hole and a negative electron donor, and the recent IUPAC definition of a halogen bond 1 is in accord with this view. However, we recently highlighted the important role of dispersion interaction,95,96 which is the attraction caused by the interaction of temporary electric multipole with an induced electric multipole. This is understandable in the light of the fact that in any halogen bond, two atoms with high polarizability (halogen and electron donor) are located close together (closer than the sum of their van de Waals radii). This somewhat contradicts the previously mentioned definition of a halogen bond, which states, \"The forces involved in the formation of the halogen bond are primarily electrostatic, but polarization, charge transfer, and dispersion contributions all play an important role.\" To explain this contradiction, we investigated in detail the nature of different halogen bonds, from the weakest ones with stabilization energy around a few kcal/mol to the strongest ones with stabilization energy higher than tens of kcal/mol. We deduced the nature of the halogen bond on the basis of dominant energy terms; this means that the total stabilization energy in halogen bonded complexes should be decomposed to single energy components.Several computational methods have been suggested to decompose the total stabilization energy.

The M06-2X functional is highly accurate for maingroup chemistry, including noncovalent interactions, and it explicitly accounts for dispersion interaction [37]. Di Labio et al. evaluated non-counterpoise-corrected DFT interaction energies against a revision of the HB23 data set, and found the M06-2X functional to perform well with a mean absolute deviation of only 0.21 kcal mol −1 [38]. The 6-311 + G(2df,2p) basis set is similar in size to the basis set used by Di Labio, and is sufficiently flexible and diffuse to reduce the basis set superposition error to acceptable levels. Additional computations have been performed at the same level of theory using a point charge to represent the Br − anion. These computations used the optimized geometries of the halogen-bonded complexes, but a negative point charge (-1 au) was placed at the position of Br − . In addition, the electrostatic potential was computed from the unperturbed density, and from the point-charge-perturbed density, of the halogen-bond donors in the geometries of the complexes. All computations were performed using the Gaussian 16 suite of software [39].\n\n\nPC model and trends in interaction energies",

The last two terms describe ionic binding as one associated both electrons with a single atom and then looks one the attraction of another ionic core. This is quite similiar to the interaction in the H + 2 molecule. Within this approach, one actually finds a binding energy of E b = −2.64 eV at an equilibrium distance of R e = 1.4a 0 . The experimentally measured values differs quite substantially as we have E b = −4.7 eV. A substantial approximation was here that we neglected the interaction between the electrons, which should repel.\n\n\nThe Heitler-London method\n\nAs the two electrons should repel each other, we can assume that the ionic binding is strongly suppressed. So the wavefunction is now assumed to be:\nψ HL = 1 √ 2+2S 2 (ψ 1s (r A1 )ψ 1s (r B2 ) + ψ 1s (r B1 )ψ 1s (r A2 ))(28)\nAgain, the wavefunction cannot be factorized and the two electrons are entangled because of the interactions. Recognize the common theme with the Helium atom. Calculation of the binding energy within this approximation leads to E b = −3.14 eV and R e = 1.6a 0 .\n\nIn the next lecture (mol, b) we will discuss how we can move on from these extremely simple diatomic molecules to the assembly of richer systems.\n\nFigure 1 :\n1The H 2 + ion as discussed in the main text.\n\nFigure 2 :Figure 3 :\n23Molecular potential curves for the molecular hydrogen ion.

(6) were obtained from either a Gaussian basis set and the GAMESS code, a numerical integration and the ATSP2K code, [24] or the best available values in the literature (all calculated using the appropriate Hamiltonian). E ZP and R e were obtained from the {Y ij }, but D e was obtained from the fitted potential. Both of the pseudo-atoms possess only a single electron, hence only HF calculations were required. All-electron atomic HF results were calculated numerically or with a Gaussian basis, as appropriate, and the post-HF AE atomic energies are from the same papers as the molecular data. No AE QMC calculations were performed. The data in Table III allows a direct comparison of estimates of the vibrational and rotational properties, the equilibrium geometry, and dissociation energies. In order to be consistent with the experimental results the 'harmonic equilibrium separation' of Eq. (4) is reported rather than interatomic separation with lowest total energy, but the difference between these two quantities is less than 10 −5Å .\n\nThe experimental results taken as benchmark data are found in the bottom two lines of the table. The \"CD Model\" values are extracted from the CD model potential [8] using exactly the same procedure as for the ab initio results. The \"Experimental\" values are those recommended in the literature for low level excitations, which are the most appropriate for our results, i.e., the results obtained by Maki et al. and reviewed by Stwalley [11].",

This requires the best possible phase properties and the widest possible excitation for a given limit on peak radiofrequency power. However, the ABSTRUSE logic can be applied, with one important proviso, to any swept-frequency pulse shape. Where maximum bandwidth for a given duration is the overriding aim, a logical choice of pulse shape is the simple chirp pulse of Bodenhausen et al., [14][15][16][17][18] leading to a pulse sequence of the form of Fig. 1a. The chirp pulse has uniform RF amplitude, except for smoothed ends, and therefore spreads RF power uniformly over almost the full frequency range. The important proviso is that a basic chirp pulse does not share the benign phase characteristics of the hyperbolic secant pulse, and it is therefore necessary to correct the residual nonlinear dependence of signal phase on excitation frequency.",

Let T i be the duration of the field quantity changes plus the duration of the subsequent pause. In cases where T i is greater than 1 s, T i is set equal to 1 s. Let t D be the total duration of the field changes. Now, for BGM:\nV ¼ min ffiffiffiffi ffi T i t D r ; V max :ð25Þ\nThis means that the reference levels actually are only increased by the factor V. This factor lies between unity and V max and depends on the crest factor of the signal. How this works can be seen clearly from the example of a pulsed and sinusoidal signal: If T i is equal to t D , there are no pauses. Thus, V is unity, and the sinusoidal signal must meet the normal reference levels. If t D is now kept constant and T i is increased, V increases in inverse proportion to the falling RMS value of the pulsed signal. The permissible amplitude of the sinusoidal signal is now higher by the factor V, but the permissible RMS value of the pulsed signal remains the same as that of the non-pulsed signal. This is allowed until V equals V max .\n\nThe intricate and exemplified wording of BGM can now be translated very roughly as:\nEI BGM ¼ max EI WRM ; EI WPM V max :ð26Þ\nIn eqn (26), EI BGM is the exposure index of BGM, EI WRM is the exposure index of WRM with an integration time of 1 s, and EI WPM is the exposure index of WPM. Because BGM is worded very intricately and only covers specific examples, eqn (26) is naturally not an exact description of BGM. It also does not emulate the unnecessary overestimations at low frequencies and linear field changes or the negative effects of the unrealistic piecewise linear reference curves. Nevertheless, it does make the effect of V max quite clear and shows what BGM does in principle, as well as how BGM could be expanded to cover any field characteristic mathematically exactly and unambiguously. The STD method available in commercial measuring devices since the year 2000 can be configured so that it exactly calculates eqn (26).",

If the initial density operator term is e.g. ρ (3) (0) = I z , obviously the desired final operator is −I y . Hence, the expectation value of the operator I y is considered to be a desired term (D), taking into account the correct phase according to the specification of the pulse.\n\nThe expectation values of all other terms should be as small as possible and hence are undesired (U). However, note that a PP 90 • 1 H (spin I) pulse that transfers I z to −I y does not necessarily leave I x invariant -in fact the improved performance of PP 90 • pulses results from the additional degree of freedom related to the fact that the final term can be anywhere in the x-z plane. Hence, if the initial density operator term is ρ (1) (0) = I x , the expectation values of both I x and I z are arbitrary and will not play a role in the pulse sequence, otherwise a UR pulse should have been chosen at this point in the sequence. Therefore, for ρ (1) (0) = I x , the expectation values of the operators I x and I z can be ignored (I), whereas all remaining operators are undesirable (U) as the initial I x operator should not leak to any of the remaining 13 product operator terms as a result of coupling evolution.\n\nFor all combinations of 1 H and 13 C pulse classes, the tables shown in Figs. 10 -13 summarize the desired terms (D), the undesired terms (U), and the terms of the final density operator that can be ignored (I) for all considered initial Cartesian product operators ρ (1) (0), · · · ρ (15) (0).",

This means that the discharge times are much more rapid. All of the above is a condensed version of what is now established nsPEF biophysics.\n\nTo our knowledge the Assisted Discharge (AD) mechanism hypothesis for bipolar cancellation (BPC) was introduced by Pakhomov and co-workers, see their Fig. 6 and associated text, included here as Fig. 1, but it has no equations [5]. Subsequent publications cite the AD hypothesis. We find six significant flaws, identified and defined below.",

Indeed, it is seen from Figure 14(b) that the higherorder harmonic with the smallest frequency is that at λ 193 nm, while the higher-order harmonic at λ 112 nm is approximately the second-order harmonic with respect to the smallest-frequency one (at λ 193 nm) and the third-order harmonic with respect to the laser wavelength of λ l = 300 nm used to excite H + 2 . Needless to add that, as usual, harmonic at λ 193 nm corresponds to the frequency of ω ρ 1 ≈ ω osc , while harmonic at λ 112 nm corresponds to the doubled frequency of ρ-oscillations ω ρ 2 ≈ 2ω osc , where the oscillation frequency ω osc corresponds to the wavelength λ osc 200 nm.\n\nFinally, in Figure 15, power spectra A z (ω) and A ρ (ω) are presented for the case when H + 2 is excited by one-cycle laser pulse at the laser wavelength of λ l = 400 nm. In the usual nomenclature of the harmonic order, three sequential peaks appeared in the power spectrum A z (ω), shown in Figure 15(a). They correspond respectively to the second, the fourth, and the fifth harmonics with respect to the laser wavelength of λ l = 400 nm used to excite H + 2 . In a suggested new nomenclature, the second and the third peaks (those at 98 and 82 nm) approximately correspond to the second harmonic of the smallest frequency peak at 200 nm.",

The required 13 C bandwidth is 28.8 kHz at 600 MHz. The HMBC pulse sequence with hard pulses (red) shows poor performance at large offsets compared to the Fanta4-HMBC (black) (Fig. 7). Traces from this 2D HMBC spectrum are compared in Fig. 8, providing further detail of the signal-tonoise enhancement available using Fanta4, showing gains of up to a factor of three in signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have designed two sets of shaped pulses, referred to as Fanta4 pulses, that can be used to replace all 90 • and 180 • hard pulses on 1 H and 13 C, respectively, in conventional pulse sequences for improved performance. HSQC and HMBC experiments were provided to show that each hard pulse in a sequence can be easily replaced with the corresponding Fanta4 shaped pulse without further modifying the existing pulse sequence. Compared to rectangular pulses, Fanta4 pulses provide far more robust performance with respect to large frequency offsets, RF inhomogeneity and/or RF miscalibration. The duration of the current generation of Fanta4 pulses is 1 ms, which renders them suitable for small and medium sized molecules with moderate relaxation values.",

Replacing e.g. a given pair of rectangular pulses (c.f. Fig. 1a) in a sequence with a better performing pair of shaped pulses with different durations (c.f. Fig. 1b) typically requires a nontrivial redesign of the pulse sequence. Additional pulses and delays are required to reestablish the timing and refocusing that achieve the goals of the original hard-pulse sequence. In order to avoid these complications, here we developed a set of shaped pulses with identical durations, such that the replacement of rectangular pulses by shaped pulses does not introduce additional delays (c.f. Fig. 1c).\n\nThe goal of the present work is to provide a fundamental set of better-performing pulses that can simply replace, in one-to-one fashion, all the hard 90 • and 180 • pulses in any existing NMR sequence. This includes important sequences such as HSQC, HMBC, HMQC, INADEQUATE, COSY, and NOESY, which are some of the most basic pulse sequences used for finding correlations between nuclei within a given molecule. Since hard pulses perform a universal rotation (UR) about a given fixed axis for any orientation of the initial magnetization, better-performing UR 90 • and UR 180 • pulses are, in principle, all that are needed. However, UR pulses are only strictly necessary for refocusing or combined excitation/flip-back. Point-topoint (PP) pulses, which transform only one specific initial state to a desired final state, are sufficient for excitation, flip-back, or inversion, and these can be designed more easily and with better performance for their specific task than UR pulses [19][20][21].",

In addition, only the Zeeman term  HL distinguishes between spin up and spin down (by symmetry, no magnetization is ever formed at B = 0 T), and this term must be involved in the commutator pathway as well.

Will the current principles governing the groups and periods of the Periodic Table still be valid for the heaviest elements and what defines the place an element occupies in the Periodic System? These intricate questions are the topic of current research in nuclear chemistry. Fig.  1 shows a modern Periodic Table. The nuclide 244 Pu, with a radioactive half-life of 81.2 million years could still be present on earth as a primordial element or be of cosmic origin due to explosive stellar nucleosynthesis, for example, from a nearby supernova that occurred after the formation of our solar system. Indeed, a concen-tration of about 2500 atoms 244 Pu per gram of Bastnaesite, a mineral highly enriched in rare earth elements, was reported nearly 40 years ago. [2] However, a recent search for 244 Pu in Bastnaesite from same mine using accelerator mass spectrometry remained negative with a detection limit of less than 550 atoms per gram. [3] Thus, all known elements heavier than Pu are man-made. The last element that can be produced in weighable quantities is fermium with atomic number 100. It can be produced by breeding in high-flux nuclear reactors and quantities of few nanograms have been isolated and supplied for chemical experiments, i.e. for laser spectroscopic measurements of the atomic level structure. [4] All elements heavier than fermium have so far been produced only at accelerators in heavy ion fusion reactions. Up to element lawrencium (Z = 103), the identification of a new element and the assignment of the atomic number were made based on chemical properties. The position at which a newly discovered radioactive species was eluted from a cation-exchange column in α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution was indicative of its ionic radius and thus its position within the group of actinides. [1] The element with atomic number 101, mendelevium (Md), was the first for which only single atoms could be produced and analyzed. In an experiment about 10 9 atoms of 253 Es were bombarded",

ForbesTo which of these two views does Mr. Forbes mean to hold, that of a rapidly and constantly increasing density from pressure, or that in which, limiting the condensing effect of pressure, he seeks to explain the density of the earth by a nucleus of heavy metallic compounds ? The latter is seemingly an after-thought of the critic, suggested by some notion of the principle involved in the augmentation by pressure of the fusing point of bodies which expand in melting. As was shown by James Thomson, the effect of pressure upon ice (and naturally upon such metals and metallic alloys as, like it, contract in melting) would be to reduce its melting point, a fact which has been experimentally established for ice. Reasoning from the same principle, Sir Wm. Thomson deduced the conclusion that a reverse effect should result from pressure for all such solids as expand in melting; that is to say, that their points of fusion would be raised, a conclusion verified by the experiments of Bunsen, and by those of Fairbairn and Hopkins. From some apparent irregularities in these results, and from the fact that certain of the substances submitted to experiment were bodies of the carbon series, which Mr. Forbes calls \"organic,\" he argues against the conclusions which depend upon a well-defined physical law. In the case of the fusible alloys tried by Mr. Hopkins, it is to be remarked that most of these bodies, like ice, expand in cooling, and consequently should not have their melting points raised by pressure. For the memoirs of James and William Thomson, see Trans. Royal Soc Edin., xvL part 5, and L. E. D. Philos. Mag., [3] xxxyii. 135.

These were subsequently identified as single atoms after chemical isolation by their characteristic radioactive decay. [5] This was the first of a long series of 'oneatom-at-a-time' chemistry experiments. In this case the classical mass action laws and the definitions of chemical equilibrium and partition coefficient are no longer valid. The question arose whether one single atom actually displays chemical properties and how typical these properties are compared to bulk properties and how they can be measured. It can be shown that partition coefficients can be defined for single atoms, if one replaces concentrations by probabilities to find a single atom in a given state, i.e. in the gas phase or adsorbed to a surface in gas-phase chemistry, or in the aqueous phase vs. the organic phase in a liquid-liquid extraction step. [6] As will be discussed later, it is indeed possible to perform chemical experiments with only one single atom or molecule at a time and to quantitatively measure thermochemical properties, distribution coefficients, and so on. Such experiments need to be designed in such a manner that the atom under investigation has the possibility to probe its state repeatedly, such as in chromatography experiments.",

By these methods of fusion, biotites can be readily distinguished from muscovites, as follows :-To the mica residue on plantinum foil, after fusion for about five minutes with ammonium fluoride in a good blowpipe flame, add a small quantity of strong, pure, hydrochloric acid, and boil in a beaker or test-tube for a few minutes.

When all this has been done, and a clear solution obtained, test it for magnesia by adding a little ammo nium phosphate, and shaking the whole mixture of liquids vigorously (in a test-tube) for about a minute. If magnesia is present in any but the very smallest quantity, a white crystalline precipitate will soon separate out from the liquid. If the presence of magnesia by this method is distinctly shown, the mica may safely be referred to the biotite or hydrobiotite species. Should no, or almost no, magnesia precipitate whatever appear, the mica is either lepidomelane, and in that case will be raven black or dark green, and readily fusible alone before the blowpipe, or one of the muscovites or hydromuscovites.

As the case of the nuclear shell model demonstrated, it might be interesting to have a look at the answers that theoretical chemists give to predict the chemical properties of superheavy elements. Traditionally, the chemical properties of an unknown element and its compounds were predicted by exploiting the fundamental relationships of the physicochemical data of the elements and their compounds within the groups and the periods of the Periodic Table. However, with the increasing nuclear charges in heavy elements, the innermost electrons become more tightly bound and are thus moving with velocities which are a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore they obey the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics. Due to relativistic rearrangements, which are predicted for the electronic structure of the heaviest elements, quite unexpected chemical properties are to be expected. These so-called relativistic effects are already severely influencing the chemical properties of lighter elements such as gold. The yellow color and the rather inert chemical behavior can be attributed to relativistic effects and explained by fully relativistic quantum chemical calculations. [17] Early predictions of the chemical properties of superheavy elements were rather spectacular. One of the articles was entitled 'Are elements 112, 114, and 118 relatively inert gases?'. [18] Nowadays, with the use of powerful supercomputers the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations is increasing rapidly. Latest calculations come to the conclusion that element 112 (Cn) is not completely inert as expected for a noble gas, but should form a chemical bond with Au, which, however, is weaker than that of the lighter homolog Hg. [19] Also, element 114 might be relatively inert but should interact stronger with an Au surface than Cn. [19] Element 118 is predicted to be the first element in the row of noble gases with an electron affinity. [20] Due to the considerable experimental difficulties in experimentally studying the chemical properties of superheavy elements, the gap between experimental observables and theoretical predictions is still large.",

They tend also to be difficult to excite, so that the spectral lines connecting to the ground state of C, N, and O also lie in the UV. They happily form compounds, some very tightly bound (including CO, the second most abundant molecule, after H 2 in the interstellar medium), but these are gaseous. Thus the ices of C, N, O, and H are said to be volatile, and they, too, did not condense at high enough temperatures to be fairly represented on earth, though they are abundant in the outer giant planets, which scooped up gases gravitationally.\n\nIn contrast on the far left of the periodic table live elements with one or two electrons outside a closed shell. These can be excited by photons with visible energies, so that lines of Na, Ca, Mg, and K (and to a lesser extent Li) are strong in the solar spectrum. They also form stable compounds with silicon and oxygen that are condensed into solids (along with Fe, Ni, and a few other common metals) at temperatures well above 1000 • C. These elements are called refractory, and are well represented in the terrestrial planets, which condensed close to the sun, where it was (and is) hot. At least some fraction of the volatiles we have were apparently brought in as comets and asteroids that originally condensed out beyond Mars and were kicked inward by the giant planets migrating through the proto-planetary disk from the locations where they originally formed. This gave rise to the phase in solar system evolution called the Late Heavy Bombardment, which may have been essential for formation of life on earth.\n\nH and He are also, of course, difficult to excite, which is why Payne was able to conclude from their visibility in stellar spectra that they must be very abundant, and anyone who didn't want to accept this had to mumble \"anomalous excitation\" so that their n = 2 levels would be populated and could absorb visible light.\n\n\nAppendix B: Stellar evolution and nuclear reactions, the view from 2010",

The analogy of an apple seems fitting: We would have penetrated the apple to just below its peel. So, most of the interesting things are still deeper below, awaiting their discovery. This demand for higher pressures can easily be understood then we think about chemical bonding and crystal structures. To investigate transitions in the electronic or atomic environment of a solid, we need to be able to increase its energy density, i.e. the pressure, up to a point where atomic distances in a system are below a certain threshold, triggering phase transitions. Here, we are typically not only talking about structural phase transitions but also about higher order phase transitions like electronic or magnetic transitions 5 . Of course, the pressure needed to trigger these transitions changes from system to system. For example, the cuprate high-temperature super-conductors exhibit a layered structure with copper-oxygen layers separating their charge reservoirs [26]. These systems are prone to react rather sensitively to the application of pressure. For example, it was reported that the super-conducting transition temperature T c in Hg 1−x Pb x Ba 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 8+δ rises significantly under an application of about 30 GPa with a maximum in T c of 164 K [27]. Inducing structural phase changes in these systems can potentially occur at pressures far below 10 GPa 6 , as it was reported in YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 [28], followed by a complete collapse of super-conductivity [29,30]. More robust systems like atomic metals, e.g. sodium or lithium, require a much higher energy density before any electronic or structural changes can occur [31,32]. At this point, DAC-NMR appeared to be stuck in a crisis until into the late 2000s. It was quickly realised that two major problems should be solved, the first being to achieve stable pressures above 10 GPa with good sensitivities, allowing for realistic and time-saving experiments on nuclei other than 1 H or 19 F, with sample dimensions rapidly decreasing due to the demand for higher pressures. The second issue was a minimisation of the diamond anvils to a point below what was possible at that time in NMR spectroscopy. Apparently, the most promising solution was to use RF microcoils as close as possible to the sample, even if that would",

If Hs has any resemblance to its lighter homolog Os, then it should also form tetroxides. Due to the perfect tetrahedral symmetry of OsO 4 , this compound only interacts very weakly with non-reducing surfaces and is therefore very volatile, similar to a noble gas. In experiments with Hs, recoiling atoms were converted in situ with an admixture of O 2 gas to the volatile HsO 4 . Another chemically very favorable case constitutes Cn as an expected homolog of Hg. Sufficiently volatile reaction products such as Hg and Cn can be transported directly with the flowing gas. It is well known that Hg interacts strongly with other metals such as Zn or Au. Single atoms of Hg can be quantitatively adsorbed on an Au surface by diffusion-controlled deposition from a stream of He. The isolated atoms (or superheavy elements with atomic numbers 112 and 114 with larger production cross sections than the so-called 'cold' fusion reactions used at GSI. First results indicated that the nuclide 283 Cn has a fantastically long half-life of about 5 min and decayed by SF, while one atom of 289 114 lived longer than 30 s. Even though these results were published in renowned journals, [10] these results could not be reproduced in independent experiments and it was feared that the group in Dubna had to face the same fiasco as the group in Berkeley, which was forced to retract an article about the alleged synthesis of element 118. [11] In subsequent improved experiments the group in Dubna reported new decay data that was measured with a gas-filled magnetic separator system. In theses experiments several new nuclides were observed, [12] among them 283 Cn with a half-life of about 4 s and 289 114 with a half-life of 2.6 s. Both nuclides decayed by alpha-particle emission and were formed with production cross sections that were 5 to 10 times higher than those observed in cold fusion reactions for Cn. So far, in two independent experiments the same decay characteristics for 283 Cn were indeed observed: first in a chemistry experiment [13] and shortly after in an experiment conducted at SHIP.

Furthermore, in Table 1 the distribution of the elements Z = 104 to 120 is in agreement with Seaborg's predictions based on atomic shell calculations. In contrast to his predictions, however, Table 1 shows that the elements Z = 121 to 138 form a new family having no homologue among the known elements. In addition, Table 1 suggests that the family of super-actinides contains the elements Z = 139 to 152 (and not Z = 122 to 153 as predicted by Seaborg).\n\nWe have mentioned in Table 1 the name darmstadtium recently given to the element Z = 110 and mentioned the recent observation of the elements Z = 113 and Z = 115 [28].

No experimental measurements exist for the atom density at 500 GPa. Theoretical estimates range from 6.6 to 8.8 × 10 23 particles/cm 3 (26). This is consistent with one electron per atom, so molecular hydrogen is dissociated, and the sample is atomic MH, or the WH phase. Whereas some predictions suggest metallization of molecular hydrogen at high pressure (3), this requires one electron for every two atoms instead. MH at 495 GPa is about 15-fold denser than zero-pressure molecular hydrogen. We compared MH with other elements in the first column of the periodic table (Table 1), which has a remarkable contrast in properties.\n\nWe have produced atomic MH in the laboratory at high pressure and low temperature.\n\nMH may have an important impact on physics and perhaps will ultimately find wide technological application. Theoretical work suggests a wide array of interesting properties for MH, including high-temperature superconductivity and superfluidity (if a liquid) (40). A looming challenge is to quench MH and if so, study its temperature stability to see whether there is a pathway for production in large quantities. Table 1.

The 1888 version of Crookes's ideas appears as a presidential address to the Chemical Society (in London), meaning that he was allowed to say whatever he wanted 4 . He is worth quoting. \"If we may hazard any conjectures as to the source of energy embodied in a chemical atom, we may, I think, premise that the heat radiations propagated outwards through the ether from the ponderable matter of the universe, by some process of nature not yet known to me, are transformed at the confines of the universe into the primary -the essentialmotions of chemical atoms, which the instant they are formed gravitate inwards and thus restore to the universe the energy which otherwise would be lost to it through radiant heat. If this conjecture be well founded, Sir William Thomson's startling prediction of the final decrepitude of the universe through the dissipation of its energy falls to the ground\" 5 .\n\nThese are cosmic processes, occurring in the long-ago universe, or at least Galaxy, as a whole, though Crookes also proposed stellar interiors as a possible site for assembling protyle into the elements at an 1879 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nIndependent of site, you may well be surprised (I was) that any progress at all could be made in the absence of neutrons to put into nuclei and the notion of barrier penetration to help bring charged particles together. Indeed without them, a very high temperature is needed to bring even hydrogen and helium into equilibrium (Tolman 1922). Tolman incidentally started life as a chemist, though we now probably more often associate him with relativity and cosmology, thanks to his classic 1934 text (Tolman 1934).\n\nLet us therefore turn to George Gamow, whose career spanned these fundamental discoveries and contributed to one of them.",

This 3-year program was fully funded by the Department of the Army. The NBS program manager again had freedom of project choice. He did not have to seek, but often received, NBS division support. The basic ideas came from Herbert Broida and Arnold Bass, who had shown that small molecular fragments with an odd number of extranuclear electrons (i.e., free radicals) could be trapped in solid matrices at the melting point of helium [20]. With earlier experience in Britain of recording diffracted x-rays from specimens at high and low temperatures, I came to NBS to join Floyd Mauer and Leonard Bolz to build a liquid-helium Dewar for observing such solids with free radicals by x-ray powder diffraction and to examine their highly exothermic transformations on warming. The results were described in Chaps. 5 and 9 of Ref. [20]. The detection of free-radical H*, the potentially most interesting free radical, or N* within the crystal structures was neither expected, nor identified in substitutional or interstitial sites. The experiments with the free radicals did, however, reveal significant new details of low temperature phases including the polymorphic structures of water and ammonia. The significance to terrestrial upper atmospheric reactions of water and to possible ammonia seas of some other planet came under discussion. The current views on ice reactions in the cosmos were not foreseen [21].\n\nA series of papers with Jack Watchman, such as [22], had the purpose to explore, by application of group theory, the symmetry of possible paths by which point defects could move around a special crystal site or with freedom in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions of a given crystal structure on overcoming distinct energy barriers. The observation of corresponding temperature change points would have been a challenge, but was not attempted. Deductions on internal friction were considered, but the simple derivation of the subgroup of a crystal's symmetry by union with the symmetry of an outside mechanical stress or field was a simple output of this work [23].",

[19] The authors predicted an adsorption position of Cn between Hg and Rn and gave -DH Au ads (Cn) = 44 kJ·mol -1 . In conclusion it can be stated that Cn is forming metallic bonds with Au which are weaker than for the homolog Hg. But Cn is chemically not as inert as a noble gas, as was initially suggested. [18] Experiments with Element 114\n\nThe next heavier element currently under investigation is element 114, which would be placed as eka-Pb into group 14 of the Periodic Table. Suitable nuclides for chemical experiments are 287 114 (T 1/2 = 0.5 s), 288 114(T 1/2 = 0.8 s) or 289 114 (T 1/2 = 2.6 s) which can be synthesized in the reaction 48 Ca + 242 Pu or 244 Pu. In a first publication, observation of three atoms of element 114 was reported in an experiment at FLNR similar to the ones performed for Cn. [24] From these three events an adsorption enthalpy of −DH Au ads (E114) = 34 +20 −3 kJ·mol -1 was deduced for the adsorption on an Au surface. If true, this result would be very puzzling, since eka-Pb is expected to be more reactive than Cn and should thus deposit at higher temperatures than Cn. Also, theoretical calculations which predicted the adsorption of Cn sufficiently accurately, predict −DH Au ads (E114) = 68 kJ·mol -1 , somewhat less volatile than Cn. Due to the fact that a background made the positive identification of element 114 events more difficult than in the case of Cn, this first result was met with some skepticism.\n\nIn order to remove this background, the very successful chemical techniques developed so far are coupled to a physical preseparator, such as a gas-filled separator. At GSI Darmstadt the dedicated gas-filled separator TASCA (Trans Actinide Separator and Chemistry Apparatus) was constructed and successfully commissioned. [26]  [%]",

We argue that solid tungsten becomes stable already at very high temperatures of order 2000 K, that it could provide just about the right numbers of seed particle per H-atom to form micron-sized silicate grains, but that a strong super-cooling of order 300 K-400 K is required and that high pressures of the order of milli-bars are necessary to make tungsten nucleation an efficient process.\n\nAppendix A: Solving gas phase chemical equilibrium down to 100 K Solving the system of non-linear equations (Eq. 5), i.e. finding the root vector of atomic partial pressures which satisfies the element conservation equations after elimination of all molecular partial pressures in chemical equilibrium according to Eq. (4), seems to be a simple numerical standard problem. Indeed, a simple Newton-Raphson iteration may lead to quick success at high temperatures. However, at low temperatures, the solution vector becomes more and more degenerate, with some atomic partial pressures approaching values < 10 − several hundred dyn/cm 2 , for example carbon, whereas others like hydrogen stay of order 1. This leads to a number of numerical problems, in particular (i) the conditional number of the Jacobi matrix becomes large, i.e. the resolution of the linearised equation system is not possible without substantial losses of precision, and (ii) the Newton-Raphson method only works satisfactory when a good initial estimate of the solution vector is provided, which becomes increasingly difficult at low temperatures.",

The discovery of superfluidity of liquid helium-3. In 1972, American physicist David Morris Lee (Fig. 3), working in the US as Professor at Cornell University, in collaboration with another Professor of this University Robert Coleman Richardson (Fig. 4) and graduate student Douglas Dean Osheroff (Fig. 5) (Moscow), with the absolute temperatures below 2.19 K was discovered a unique physical effect in the material -the phenomenon of superfluidity in the isotope helium 2 4 He − liquid helium-II [10]. For the «basic inventions and discoveries in the field of low-temperature» Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR P.L. Kapitsa was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for 1978 [4,10]. Taking into account the fundamental nature of obtained by D.M. Li, R.C. Richardson, and D.D. Osheroff scientific results, in 1996 they were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics [4,[7][8][9]. The discovery of superfluidity of liquid helium-3 promoted promising fundamental and applied research in many fields of physics [4,7].  It is well known that in the microcosm of the atom of matter the temperature measure (molecules) or particles their kinetic energy [2,11]. A great contribution to this energy and, respectively, in the temperature gives the translational velocity of said microscopic objects. A smaller contribution of this indicator makes the frequency of natural oscillations [2,11]. Therefore, the faster moving and more micro-object vary, so it will be «hot». By physicists it was found that at «minus» 270 С (about 3 K) translational velocity substance atom is about 100 m/s [11]. T the ambient temperature («plus» 20 С) atoms, this velocity value is close to 1000 m/s [2,10,16]. If we reduce the speed of 0.01 m/s, then the atom is virtually «frozen». This can be done by various physical methods. Studies conducted in the United States by S. Chu, W. Phillips, and C. Cohen-Tannoudji showed that the most convenient for this method is the method of laser cooling of atoms [11][12][13][14][15].

There are also three varieties of this species, each of which corresponds to the same numbered variety under muscovite:-1. Margarodite or hydrous-potash-muscovite. White, grey, or pale yellow in colour. 2. Paragonite or hydrous-soda-musfcovite. Whitish to pale yellow and pale green. 3. Hydrolepidolite or Oookeite. This variety, which is not at all common, is usually very pale lilac to white in colour, but is sometimes yellowish-green, and has a pearly lustre. Its hardness is 2*5, and its specific 2'7.\n\n\nIt contains lithia, and about 12 per cent, of water.\n\nBiotite occurs in hexagonal plates or irregularly defined folia or scales. It is usually black in colour or exhibits some dark shade of green, and more rarely brown, red, or dark grey. Its hardness varies from 2 ; 5 to 3, and its specific gravity from 2*74 to 3*13. It is a silicate of alumina, combined with silicate of magnesia or iron, or both, and is practically anhydrous. Its percentage of water as in muscovite is less than 2*5, but like that mineral it passes over quite gradually into hydrobiotite by the increase of water to 4, 5, or 6 per cent., or more. There are likewise three varieties of biotite:-1. Common biotite, which has usually a dark green, brown, or black colour, and is translucent to opaque. It con tains generally about 20 per cent, of magnesia, and about 10 or 12 per cent, of iron oxides. 2. Phlogopite, which is yellowish-brown to brownish-red, and rarely white in colour. It contains much magnesia, and little or almost no iron. This variety of biotite is not very common.",

[9]In spite of these difficulties, there has been progress in the chemical characterisation of transactinides, with flevorium (Z = 114) marking the superheavy limit of chemistry today. [10]e ontological shift is evident in the current requirement of detecting \"at least a nuclide with an atomic number Z […] existing for at least 10 -14 s,\" [11] for claiming the discovery of a new element.This minimum lifetime is selected taking into account the time it takes for a nucleus to acquire its outer electrons; which brings up subtle consequences, e.g. that the periodic system based on chemical compounds a la 1860s is a romantic idea, as forming bonds requires for an atom 10 thousand times the time it spends completing its valence shell.ix Thus, there is no room for chemical experiments for these very short lived atoms and the system is then left to the theoretical arenas, lacking experimental evidence to test hypothesis.\n\n\nA system based upon the chemical space",

It is part of the folklore that he moved from his hometown of Odessa to Petrograd/St. Petersburg/Leningrad to work with A.A. Friedman, who died almost immediately thereafter (not, we suppose, causal). Instead 4 Admittedly he was the editor of another journal in which many of his papers appear, Chemical News, allowing him to put forward new elements with names like Decipium, Philippium, and Mosandrum, to live among the rare earths, which were just then being differentiated by a number of chemists(Crookes, 1886(Crookes, , 1889. 5 Crookes's universe was our Galaxy; Thomson is later Lord Kelvin. Worrying about what became of light and heat not caught by planets also occupied SimonNewcomb (1906) in the same time frame. Crookes notes further along that, although he is speaking of the Milky Way, M31 probably behaves in a similar fashion. And a similar sort of restorative process, in which photons travel around the universe and come back as cosmic ray particles was advocated by Jeno and Madelaine Barnothy in the 1960s(Barnothy 1963,Barnothy and Forro (1946).\nFor many decades, including the period covered in this article, atomic weights were indicated with a small number in the upper right hand corner, C 13 for instance.

In GAMESS, non-zero CSFs must have a weight larger than 10 −6 , many of the listed CSFs have very small weights; the weights of the LCs are of the same magnitude. In the following, LCs with weight larger than 0.01 will be called significant; LCs having weight larger than 0.1 will be called large. Figure S1 shows the change in the number of non-zero, significant, and large LCs. The left branch of the ground state with Σ + g character starts with about 100 non-zero LCs and goes up to about 160 LCs, then, in the middle branch, jumps down to about 100 LCs and rises in to about 110 LCs, the right branch finally jumps up to 150 LCs. This corresponds to the changes from Σ + g to ∆ g and back to Σ + g character. For the second A g state, the left branch (Σ + g character) has about 120 LCFs, the next branch (∆ g character) jumps to about 80 LCs and rises to about 100 LCs, the next branch has again Σ + g character and is described by 140 to 160 LCs, the last branch has again ∆ g character and is described by about 110\n\nLCs.

[60] They worked together to create a rigorous \"effective mass theory\" for the electronic energy levels produced when impurity atoms are purposely substituted for germanium or silicon atoms in pure crystals of the latter. The crucial importance of these impurities and their quantum mechanical states to the extraordinary electrical properties of semiconductors had been explained qualitatively by William Shockley in his seminal treatise, Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors (1950). However, careful electron spin resonance and cyclotron resonance experiments at Bell Labs and elsewhere demanded a quantitative theory. Not for the first time and not for the last time, Kohn combined the creation of a novel and sophisticated theory with variational calculations designed to produce numbers for comparison with measurements for specific material systems. That fall, Kohn and Luttinger completed three substantial papers in semiconductor physics Luttinger 1955a,b) and thereby finished in a virtual dead heat with Berkeley solid state theorist, Charles Kittel, who published similar work independently (Kittel andMitchell 1954, Dresselhaus et al. 1955). [61] Joaquin Luttinger was Kohn's principal scientific collaborator in the 1950's. Courtesy of Walter Kohn. In the spring of 1955, Walter worked hard to convince the British theoretical solid state physicist Harry Jones to accept an offer of a chaired position at Carnegie Tech. Jones had co-authored (with Nevill Mott) the influential book The Theory of the Properties of Metals and Alloys (1934) and he had spent the spring 1954 semester as a visiting professor in Kohn's department. Kohn wrote to Jones and pointed out that \"all of us in solid state physics, as well as all the people in metallurgy, would be delighted to see you come here. With your field of interest, I honestly think that probably no other school in this country could offer you better opportunities for creative work along research and teaching lines\" (WKP 1955). Jones ultimately declined for personal reasons. The undeterred Kohn pursued the physics of semiconductors and metals simultaneously and submitted two manuscripts to the Physical Review. The first paper, co-authored with his first Carnegie Tech Ph.D. student, Daniel",

At the age of 26 he became an Assistant Professor in theoretical chemistry, worked on X-ray crystal studies, and performed quantum mechanical calculations on molecules and atoms. Studying crystal structures and the types of bonding and coordination that occurred within them, Pauling found out that crystal structures obeyed the rules now known as Pauling's rules [16,17]. In his seminal paper \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry\" [17], Linus Pauling reconstructed the foundations of chemistry -for the first time he explained the structure of molecules in terms of quantum mechanics. Linus Pauling described it this way: \"From Richard C. Tolman, Harry Bateman, and other remarkable teachers at Caltech, I obtained an excellent grounding in chemistry, physics, and mathe matics, with emphasis on the old quantum theory and atomic structure. Quantum mechanics was discovered a few months after I had received my PhD degree. The Schrödinger papers on wave mechanics were published about the time that I arrived at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (Professor Arnold Sommerfeld) at the University of Munich in April 1926. I immediately began to apply an approximate quantum mechanical treatment to the problem of the structure of atoms with many electrons and to simple molecules, making use of the treatments of the hydrogen molecule-ion and hydrogen molecule that had been formulated by Ø. Burrau, E.U. Condon, W. Heitler, and F. London.\n\nThese new ideas had applications to many aspects of chemistry. The applications included the nature of square, tetrahedral, and octahedral coordination complexes of metals; the stability of aromatic substances as determined by the resonance energy; the planarity of resonating and conjugated systems of single and double bonds; the secondary structures of proteins and the importance of the hydrogen bond in proteins, polynucleotides, and other substances; and the nature of interatomic forces in metals\" [18].",

Analytical eq 41 with a comparison with the literature data is presented in Figure 9.\n\nAs can been seen, the equation for the fitted vapor pressure of ice by Murphy and Koop 36 is in good agreement with the literature data. Assuming all Q i 's are equal to 1 in eq 23 we end up with eq 25 as\n* ≈ * p p K / w i c e(25)\nTo test the validity of eq 25, the second virial coefficient at subzero temperatures is needed.

First, ice floats on water because ice has lower density due to its open hydrogen-bonded tetrahedral structures. A second anomaly is that water has a temperature of maximum density (TMD, of approximately 4°C) in its liquid range, whereas other materials are maximally dense in their solid states. Upon going from its melting point at 0°C to its TMD at 4°C, liquid water gets denser because heating melts some low-density, cage-structure waters into higher density van der Waals contact structures. This is also reflected in a third anomaly: just above 0°C, water has a negative thermal expansion coefficient, indicating its increasing density with temperature. Then, heating beyond the TMD, liquid water expands like other materials do because heating loosens the intermolecular bonding.\n\nThere are practical consequences of water's density anomalies. One is shown in Figure 9. Whereas simpler materials freeze from the bottom up, lakes filled with water freeze from the top down, since ice is less dense than liquid water.",

After all, melting points are determined easily under laboratory conditions for many substances by simply heating the solid at constant pressure until it melts. Although liquids can be supercooled, solid cannot be superheated as first stated by Bridgmann [64]: 'It is impossible to superheat a crystalline phase with respect to the liquid.' For this reason there is in principle no risk in determining melting points by simply heating the solid until it melts. However, in computer simulations the situation is somewhat different. If conventional NpT simulations are performed for ice I h then it does not melt at T m but at a somewhat higher temperature [65][66][67][68]. It is worth mentioning that superheating has also been recently found experimentally [69,70] for ice I h but only on a short time scale (about 200 ps). The difference between the results of NpT simulations and those found in experiments (summarized in the Bridgman's statement) is striking. However, there is a fundamental difference between experiments and NpT simulations of bulk solids. Whereas in experiments the ice (or a solid in general) must have a surface (or rather an interface at which it is in contact with another phase; vapour or liquid), this interface is missing in conventional NpT simulations of bulk solids. When no interface is present ice must melt via bulk melting [71].",

From a well-documented review by Murphy and Koop, 12 it follows that eq 1 applies adequately in the temperature region 175 < T < 273, whereas also more elaborate parameterizations have been proposed, for example, in the frequently cited theoretical work of Wexler. 13 We selected both the recently presented data of Bielska et al. 14 and the earlier study by Marti and Mauersberger 15 and found these to obey = × − P T 3.647 10 exp( 6148.5/ ) id 12 (7) in the above-mentioned region. Later, however, Mauersberger and Krankowsky 16 were able to extend the temperature range down to 164.5 K and thereby observed a significant departure from eq 7. Their data were displayed in a logarithmic graph, from which we obtained pressure values that are as accurate as possible. In Figure 6, it is shown that the combined data of refs 14 and 16 connect nicely into one continuous plot, which easily extrapolates to P = 0 at T 0 = ca. 160 K.\n\nFollowing the analysis described in the foregoing sections, we find that P/P id is close to unity from T = 273 K down to 169 K but decreases thereafter according to P/P id = [1 − exp(−a(T − T 0 ))], with a = 0.45 K −1 and T 0 = 158 K. With this high value for a, the plot of P/P id against T sharply bends toward the arrest temperature, as shown in Figure 7. Notably, the additional data of ref 16 are essentially valuable for the analysis.\n\nIce is an important substance and so besides vapor pressure several more of its properties have been described in the literature, which may support our value of T 0 , although one would wish for more accurate data points at low temperatures. A possible example is the dielectric relaxation of ice-Ih as a function of temperature, which was the subject of the pioneering study in 1958 by Auty and Cole. 17 In later work by other researchers, severely different results were reported, which only recently could be ascribed to the manner of   \n\n\nACS Omega",

However, in order to identify kinetic barriers, it is useful to freeze the levels at their 300 K values and to introduce another fictitious temperature, T ′ , that can be varied at will. In particular it can be set to zero to identify characteristic times that diverge in this limit. We find that the eigenvalues (the inverse relaxation times) either tend to zero as T ′ approaches zero (there are four such eigenvalues with eigenvectors corresponding to the 4 local minima) or they tend to integer values of 1, 2 or 3. The other eigenvalues correspond to downhill motion in the free energy landscape and are determined by the its local topology. As T ′ increases there are Arrhenius-like corrections to the T ′ =0 limit and considerable mixing of the levels.",

Later, we will discuss what functional of E is the most adequate when dealing with a small system far from the thermodynamical equilibrium.\n\nIf we approximate our isolated molecule by an ensemble of N quantum harmonic oscillators, the total molecular energy is\n, ZP k k k E E n h   =+  (3)\nwhere nk is the number of quanta deposited in vibrational mode k, and  denotes a particular ensemble   k n .Thus, to know the number of microstates, we must determine the number of solutions of Eq. ( 3).This means the number of ways we can distribute different values of nk among the vibrational modes, keeping E constant.Despite the simplicity of this formulation, it is a formidably tricky problem to solve analytically.We can approach it numerically, but the number of microstates is so large that it may become unattainable to compute even for a molecule with only six atoms.\n\nFortunately, as I will also show later (Section E.3), we can get an approximated solution for the number of microstates by supposing the ensemble of vibrational frequencies   k  can be replaced by a single average frequency  .The degenerated problem, which simplifies to , 2\nM N E M hv  =+  (4)\nwhere k k Mn =  , is a very well-known statistical-mechanics textbook example. 21,22 \n\n\nModeling an isolated molecule",

( 3).This energy flow is crucial for the molecule to ensure that all microstates sharing the same energy are equally probable.For instance, suppose the molecule has 1 = 300 cm -1 and 2 = 600 cm -1 , a microstate with n1 = 2 and n2 = 0 should be as likely to occur as another one with with n1 = 0 and n2 = 1 (assuming that nk for k > 2 is the same in both microstates).Although weak coupling is assumed, it is never explicitly considered.\n\nThis quantum harmonic vibrational mode will not describe strongly anharmonic modes, like intramolecular hydrogen bonds or internal rotations (like those methyl groups are prone to).\n\nWe will also not discuss temperature associated with the energy allocated in the translational and rotational modes.Even though these components are relevant when probing the isolated molecule, 23 they go beyond the defined scope of this work.\n\n\nB.

Instead, the title of the HK paper is simply \"Inhomogeneous electron gas\" and the first line of the abstract announces that \"this paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r).\" The Introduction goes on to note that \"during the last decade there has been considerable progress in understanding the properties of a homogeneous, interacting electron gas.\"A footnote refers the reader to David Pines' book Elementary Excitation in Solids (1963) for the details. HK then remind the reader about the Thomas-Fermi method, in which the electronic density n(r) plays a central role. . . This approach has been useful, up to now, for simple though crude descriptions of inhomogeneous systems like atoms and impurities in metals. Lately, there have been some important advances along this second line of approach. . . .

Here, (a) T 1 = T 2 = 10 and (b) t = 5 and t = 10. VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS When a thermal equilibrium system interacts with an external source, either by interchanging particles or only energy, its thermodynamic quantities as the entropy, internal energy and Helmholtz and Gibbs potentials present a change that can be sudden or not depending on the type of interaction with the environment. The main results of our work are the following: we demonstrated that the change in these quantities has upper and lower bounds when the system achieves thermal equilibrium after the interaction. Using the relative entropy between two thermal equilibrium states, the upper and lower bounds of the difference of entropies ∆S and the Helmholtz and Gibbs potentials were obtained. In the case where the thermal equilibrium states are expressed in terms of the Hamiltonian eigenvectors, these bounds can be written as a sum of the Franck-Condon factors of the two systems. From this, our results can be of interest in the measurement of the vibronic structure of electronic lines in molecules. The possibility of use this bounds to approximate the analytic values is also discussed as the limits can be obtained through the calculation of mean values of the Hamiltonians and the number operator before and after a sudden interaction between the system and an environment.",

The other mean value Tr(e −β 2Ĥ2Ĥ 1 )/Z(Ĥ 2 , T 2 ) is the mean value of the Hamiltonian, when the system undergoes the changeĤ 2 →Ĥ 1 and can be interpreted as a reversibility term. Also as the relative entropy between the two thermal statesρ 1 andρ 2 measures the distance between the two states, it can be used to compare the different HamiltoniansĤ 1 and H 2 which define the two systems. It is also worth clarifying that the limits for the difference ∆S are only valid if the initial and final states are of thermal equilibrium, e.g., in the following situation:\n\ninitially the system is kept in thermal equilibrium at T 1 with HamiltonianĤ 1 for all times t < t 1 ;\n\nat t = t 1 , a change in the temperature and the interaction Hamiltonian is done until a certain time\nt = t 2 .\nAfter this, the system is kept at temperature T 2 , and interaction HamiltonianĤ 2 until it finally achieves thermal equilibrium. When these conditions are satisfied, the difference of the entropy (or free energy) between the two equilibrium states can be approximated using only the mean value of the Hamiltonian corresponding to the times just before and after an abrupt change in the conditions of the system is done. This implies that measuring the change on the mean value of the Hamiltonian before and after the change one can have a quick estimate of the difference of the thermodynamic quantities even before the systems reach equilibrium.",

It is interesting to note that the statistical physics still lacks effective ways of checking the system for metastability. In other words, there is no possibility of determining whether the system is in the local minimum or in the deepest one than through the enumeration of all the minima and through the comparison of their depths. On reaching certain pressures and temperatures, a high probability of overcoming the corresponding energy barriers within the time of the experiment (figure 1) arises; in this case, the metastable phases go beyond the quasi-equilibrium area of reversibility (figure 2) and relax, often through energy- Transitional phase diagram of initially metastable phases. The grey band corresponds to the irreversible non-equilibrium relaxation of metastable phases to the stable modifications and separates the quasiequilibrium and equilibrium P, T -regions. Inside these regions the transformations (1-2, 2-3, 1-3 and 4-5) are reversible.

Joel is pictured seated at the right end of the front row. His meetings continue on as major events twice every year at Rutgers University in New Jersey, but in the 1960s, the venue for the meeting was a classroom at Yeshiva University in New York City. At the time, Lebowitz was on the faculty of Yeshiva's Belfer Graduate School of Science. (With this meeting in mind, I named Berkeley's annual meeting the Mini Stat Mech Meeting, to distinguish it from Joel's longer-running stat mech meeting.) In those early years, everyone attending the Yeshiva meeting was expected to present a four-to five-minute talk on some new result or idea, using a blackboard for no more than one equation or sketched graph. I recall that Michael Fisher had something intelligent (and often critical) to say about nearly every presentation. He was intimidating.\n\nOnsager, on the other hand, was a quiet presence. In fact, he was napping in the chair next to mine for most of the morning at that Yeshiva meeting, and I was surprised to learn, when his name was called, that this old man was Onsager himself. (It was a year prior to him being awarded the Nobel Prize for his contributions to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.) Onsager went to the board, mumbled something as he wrote an equation blocked from view by his notable height and broad shoulders. Upon completing the equation, he turned to show us all, and with a smile and a twinkle in his eye, he told us the uncovered formula was a remarkable result. I couldn't understand its content, but the presentation so captivated me that to this day I almost always think of Onsager when I say or write \"remarkable.\"",

We assume that the Grüneisen parameter is an analytic function of x ≡ V 1/3 , essentially the interatomic distance, and that the coefficient of x in the Taylor-Maclaurin series expansion for γ is non-zero. The simplest model that satisfies all of these requirements is\nγ(V ) = 1 2 + c 1 V 1/3 + c 2 V q , c 1 , c 2 , q = const, q > 1,(6)\nNote that γ(V ) − 1/2 is asymptotic to c 1 V 1/3 ; this is discussed in more detail in the next section. The term c 2 V q represents the contribution of the quadratic and higher-order terms in x which must sum to make γ a concave-up function of V at small compressions. Eq.

In the low compression range by choosing the suitable set of input parameters all the equations can be fitted to give the experimental results as at low pressure all EOSs give almost the same results. But as pressure increases the difference of the values calculated from different EOSs increase. For high compression the small difference in 0 and 0 has little effect on the calculated values and at high compression the form of an EOS becomes more significant and different EOSs give different results.",

This is a fundamental question in physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering. This question hangs in the minds of many students, instructors, and researchers. The first instinct is to answer \"Yes, for water between 0 and 4°C\" if one knows that water expands as temperature decreases in this temperature range. The same question is asked in several Physical Chemistry and Physics textbooks. Students are supposed to answer that water contracts when heated at below 4°C in an isobaric process. Because work is done to the contracting water, less heat is required to increase the water temperature in an isobaric process than in an isochoric process. Therefore, C P is less than C V . However, this answer is fundamentally flawed because it assumes, implicitly and incorrectly, that the internal energy change of water depends solely on its temperature change. Neglecting the variation of the internal energy with volume (internal pressure) will invalidate the Clausius inequality and violate the second law of thermodynamics. Once the internal pressure is properly taken into account, it becomes clear that C P cannot be less than C V for any substance at any temperature regardless of the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient of the substance.\n■ INTRODUCTION \"",

In other words, if one mol of the gas were compressed isothermally (reversibly) from V 1 to V 2 , an amount RT ln(V 1 /V 2 ) of actual energy equivalent in quality to gravitational potential energy would be converted into an amount RT ln(V 1 /V 2 ) of ambient thermal energy plus an amount RT ln(V 1 /V 2 ) of an energy of the gas which is ordinarily ignored when encountered in this context, but which obviously must be viewed as being free energy. If we were to consider this free energy to be actual energy, the First Law of Thermodynamics would of course appear to be very seriously in error. That it is not in error is evident from the fact that, if the free energy were not used for reversing the degradation of the nonthermal actual energy into ambient thermal energy, it would simply disappear, never to reappear. Thus, if the compressed gas were allowed to expand from V 2 to V 1 without doing work on the surroundings, as would be the case if the massless and frictionless piston holding the gas in the compressed state ( Figure 1) were suddenly released, it would do so rapidly without a net change in actual energy of any kind in either the gas or its surroundings [2].\n\nIf free energy is not actually energy, what, then, is it? Since in the course of the compression phase of the above cyclic process it would become dissociated from the actual energies W and Q, it appears in this case to be an available work potential that is free of actual energy. The facts (i) that complete recovery of the reversibly imparted free energy could be achieved only if the compressed gas were allowed to expand and do work at an infinitesimal rate and (ii) that, if the gas were allowed to expand without doing work, it would do so at the maximum possible rate with complete loss of the free energy suggest that free energy expenditure is what makes things happen within finite amounts of time. Accordingly, by combining the well-established equations of steady-state kinetics with those of classical equilibrium thermodynamics, it is possible to show quantitatively for stationary-state (apparent-equilibrium) reactions that the faster the reaction, the greater the amount of free energy consumed [3].",

However, the relative uncertainty of the theoretical value of the static electric dipole polarizability of the ground state of the 4 He atom, which is required to calculate k from A ǫ /R, has been lowered by more than a factor of ten to below 2 × 10 −7 ( Lach et al., 2004). Nevertheless, the change in its value is negligible at the level of uncertainty of the PTB result for A ǫ /R; hence, the value k = 1.380 65(4) × 10 −23 J K −1 [30 × 10 −6 ] from the PTB experiment given in CODATA-02 is unchanged.\nk = 2R ∞ h cA r (e)M u α 2 R = R N A .(340)",

Callendar, F.R.S.-\nThe energy of a gram molecule of an ideal gas can be calculated from the kinetic theory. From this, by the application of the Maxwell-Boltzmann hypothesis, the molecular specific heats at constant volume, Se, of ideal mon atomic and diatomic gases are deduced to be 3R /2 and 5R /2 respectively at all temperatures. R is the gas constant per gram molecule = 1-985 gm. cal./° C. The corresponding molecular specific heats at constant pressure, Sp, can be obtained by the addition of R.In the case of real gases, which obey some form of characteristic equation other than P . Y = R . T, it can be shown from thermodynamical considera tions that the value of depends upon the pressure, but as the term involving the pressure also includes the temperature, is not independent of the tempera ture but it increases in value as the temperature is reduced. Assuming the characteristic equation proposed by Callendar*, v -b -RT -c (where b is the co-volume, c is the coaggregation volume which is a function of the temperature of the form c = c0(T0/T)w , n being dependent on the nature of the gas), it is easy to show from the relation and, by combining this with the corresponding values of Sw can be obtained.The constant of integration Sp° in the above expression is the limiting value of Sp at zero pressure and at a temperature T, but thermodynamical con siderations alone give no information of the way in which Sp° itself depends upon the temperature. hat oo , n(n-\\-\\ .",

Similar advances in the construction of capacitance level sensing equipment, in constant-volume valves and articulating seals, and in high-accuracy dilatometry have resulted from this project.The basic physical concepts of the gas thermometry experiments described herein involve techniques that are well understood, while their realization and refinement have occupied highly trained and dedicated workers during whole careers of meticulous effort. The work described herein has considerably improved our understanding of the Kelvin Thermodynamic Temperature Scale, but it is clear from a glance at figure 12 that the Kelvin Thermodynamic Scale still is uncertain in the range upwards from 200 °C by about ±20 ppm. Reducing this uncertainty is a task that we leave to future thermometrists, who well may employ a different technology.AcknowledgmentsThe author is grateful to R. E. Edsinger and to L. A.

The term fullerene more generally refers to compounds C n consisting of n carbon atoms, each of which is bonded to three other carbons through two single bonds and one double bond, forming a closed surface.\n\nInteractions of intense ultrashort laser pulses with C 60 fullerene, and the ensuing competition between ionization and fragmentation, have attracted considerable attention [34,35,36] as a means of studying the mechanisms of molecular energy deposition. At low intensity irradiation, the vibrational modes of C 60 are excited, especially its fundamental A g , or breathing, mode [37,38]. Beyond a certain intensity, C 60 undergoes fragmentation and decomposes into C n fragments [39,36].",

The DOS of a spherical top has a dependence on the square root of the frequency 33 , which agrees well with the trend of VDOS at near zero frequency for FCC C 60 at 300 K. Therefore the large VDOS at near zero frequency in C 60 shall be attributed to the rotational motion of buckyballs. While in PCBM, the VDOS for buckyballs is nearly zero below 1 meV (see Fig. 3(b)) suggesting that the rotational motions are fully suppressed by the alkyl chains.\n\nCompared with the VDOS of FCC C 60 , above 10 meV, the peaks in the partial VDOS of the buckyballs in PCBM are shifted or new peaks are created because of the changes in intra-molecular bonding with the addition of alkyl chains. However, the VDOS of the buckyball in the low frequency regime, dominated by the inter-molecular interaction, have been modified significantly by the alkyl chains in PCBM, as depicted in Fig. 3(b). The VDOS of C and H atoms in alkyl chains of PCMB is also shown in Fig. 3(b). below 5 meV, the VDOS of C and H atoms in alkyl chain is small compared to that of the buckyballs in PCBM. This significant mismatch of VDOS between buckyballs and alkyl chains can cause intense scattering of low frequency phonons. As low frequency inter-molecular phonons may dominate the thermal transport in fullerene, the scattering by alkyl chains can lead to significant decrease of thermal conductivity.",

We have analyzed the nature of low-lying excited states. Isomers of a given cluster show a distinct signature spectrum, indicating a strong-structure property relationship. This fact can be used in experiments to distinguish between different isomers of a cluster. Owing to the sophistication of our calculations, our results can be used for benchmarking of the absorption spectra. The optical excitations involved are found to be collective type, and plasmonic in nature. Our results were found to be significantly different as compared to the TDLDA results, 163 for the clusters studied here.

In order to demonstrate a non-trivial arrangement of the atomic nuclei within a molecule, the H 2 D + = {p + , p + , d + , e − , e − } molecular ion was studied in Ref. [73]. Interestingly, the qualitative features of the computed density functions (see Figure 6) converged very fast, small basis sets and a loose parameterisation was sufficient to observe converged structural features, whereas the energies were far from spectroscopic accuracy. Figure 6 summarises the particle-density functions which highlight characteristic structural features of the system. First, we can observe the delocalised electron cloud (ρ 0,e ), the proton shell (ρ 0,p ), and the deuteron shell (ρ 0,d ) around the centre of mass (0). The deuteron shell is more peaked and more localised in comparison with the proton shell. (Remember that these plots show the spherically symmetric density along a ray, ρ ab , and the density functions are normalised to one.)\n\nNext, let's look at the probability density functions for the included angle, 0,ab , of two particles measured from the molecular centre of mass ('0'). The dashed line in the plots shows the angular density corresponding to a hypothetical system in which the two particles (a and b) are independent. It is interesting to note that for the two electrons 0,ee shows very small deviation from the (uncorrelated system's) dashed line. At the same time, we see a pronounced deviation from the dashed line for the nuclei, 0,pp and 0,pd . These numerical observations are in line with Claverie and Diner's suggestion based on theoretical considerations [103] that molecular structure could be seen in an fully quantum-mechanical description as correlation effects for the nuclei.",

In our calculations of the FCC C 60 crystal, there is only one buckyball in each primitive unit cell. Thus there are six branches of dispersion curves below 8 meV, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a), which correspond to intermolecular motions including three translation components and three libration components 21 . In low-frequency regime below 8 meV, three acoustic branches are observed with larger group velocities which characterize the translational vibrations of buckyballs. The other three branches with small group velocity are observed below 1.5 meV which represent the librational  vibrations. Here, the librational vibration means the molecules rotate slightly back and forth with a nearly fixed orientation, as restricted by external forces or constraints.\n\nThe comparison of dispersion curves between C 60 and PCBM is shown in Fig. 3 for frequency below 8 meV. It is observed that the maximum frequency of acoustic branches is reduced from 6.4 THz in C 60 to 3.0 THz in PCBM, which indicates that fullerene is stiffer than its derivatives with alkyl chains. Above the acoustic branches in PCBM, optical branches are observed with small separations. The absence of the band gap in PCMB phonon dispersion between intermolecular modes and intramolecular modes allows more scattering of the low-frequency intermolecular phonons, and thereby lower their phonon mean free path and subsequently the thermal conductivity.",

The calculated ionization energies of [C60-Metal] + (8.65, 8.95, and 9.04 eV for Ca, Fe, and V, respectively) are much lower than that of C60 + (18.98 ± 0.35 eV) 13 .

In a Habing field, there are of the order of 10 8 photons cm -2 s -1 between 6 and 9 eV 14 . The C60 photoabsorption cross section in this photon energy range is about 200 Mb (1 Mb = 1× 10 −18 cm 2 ) 15 , which yields a PA on the order of 2×10 -8 s -1 .

In earlier work, with a statistical model provided for C60H2, which has a binding energy of 2.9 eV comparable to that of C60V + , the dissociation rate d was estimated to be on the order of 10 -5 -10 -1 s -1 following absorption of a photon between 6 and 9 eV 14 .

Typically, these molecules are deposited in an anthracene (Ac) matrix, primarily to guard against oxidation and photobleaching, processes that limit the photostability of the molecule. DBT has a purely electronic, zero phonon line (ZPL) around 785 nm. At low temperatures, the phonon induced dephasing of the transition dipole of the ground to S 1 state vanishes; the spectral line width of this transition is then limited only by the electronic dephasing time, and DBT can act as a two level system, similar to a trapped atom [1].\n\nThe development of such molecules as single photon sources requires an understanding of their electronic states [10]. There are multiple strategies for calculating these, such as Density Function Theory (DFT) [10,11] and applications of Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) [12,13]. These techniques can be quite accurate, but are often computationally intensive. DMRG, in particular, is a technique that has yielded significant insight into the nature of the ground state of the -acene series; the mid sized -acenes, such as tetracene, pentacene, and hexacene, are a set of molecules closely related to DBT in their structure.

[13] for periodic molecular crystals that the correction to exciton energies due to nuclear quantum motion becomes more important for smaller molecules. For the single-molecule systems studied here we find that the same trend holds, as shown in Figure 6 for the acene and aliphatic hydrocarbons families of molecules. The results in Figure 6 are obtained at the TD-DFT B3LYP level of theory. We believe that the reason for the observed trend is that smaller molecules have a greater electronic density in the vicinity of localized atomic motions that are activated due to quantum fluctuations, hence leading to stronger excitonvibration interactions. Another way of reaching the same conclusion is using Hückel theory. Let us consider the example of linear polyenes, such as ethene, butadiene, hexatriene and octatetraene that are studied here and are included among other aliphatic hydrocarbons in Figure 6b, showing a decrease in the exciton energy correction with increasing system size. For a linear polyene consisting of N carbon atoms, Hückel theory predicts the energy of the i th orbital is: E i = α + 2β cos (2πn/(N + 1)), with α, β the Hückel parameters, and i = 1, 2, ..., N .\n\nFrom this, we find for the HOMO-LUMO gap:\n\nE gap ∝ sin π 2(N + 1)\n\n.\n\nIn the limit of N → ∞, this gives E gap ∝ 1/N . A similar result can be obtained for cyclic polyenes. Assuming that the same holds for any general conjugated molecule, this suggests that in larger systems the HOMO is less bonding and the LUMO less anti-bonding than in comparably smaller systems. Therefore, from the intuitive picture of Figure 2, the curvature of the ground and excited state surfaces of large molecules is similar, and the difference in their normal mode frequencies is small. Hence, according to the expression 10 that results from the quadratic approximation, the correction to the exciton energy is also smaller than that for a smaller molecule.\n\nThis is encouraging, in the sense that corrections due to nuclear quantum motion are mostly important for small systems, for which they are cheaper to compute.\n\n\nAccuracy and speed of the quadratic method",

In fact, applying solid-state concepts to the valence 'Bloch electrons' on the C 60 sphere results in an 'angular band structure' [7] from which other relevant quantities (such as plasma frequencies and group velocities) can be extracted.

In denser medium, the proportionality above no longer holds and the energy dependence of ǫ 2 is now given by a non-linear Clausius-Mossotti relation. In the extreme situation of highly packed particles, with no interstices, the function ǫ 2 should resemble the bulk dielectric function. As the particles condense, any similarity between the energy dependencies of ǫ 2 and σ is lost. The qualitative aspects of this analysis still hold for more complicated cases, such as non-spherical and/or inhomogeneous particles. Some predictions of the Mie theory for the optical properties of nanostructures have been discussed in recent first-principles calculations: the emergence of a Mie plasmon in nanoclusters 79 ; and the dependence of dielectric function with respect to concentration in periodic arrangements of nanowires 80 . In Fig. 7, the parameter is particle size rather than concentration. From the calculated spectra, one can recover the bulk limit by increasing the concentration or the size of particles. In the first case, the Mie theory predicts a red shift of ǫ 2 with respect to σ. The second case should certainly involve a similar phenomenon but it requires a more elaborate analysis, because of the crossover between particle size and wavelength. The crossover does not necessarily affect the absorption cross section because light is not an essential element in absorption measurements (for instance, one can use electron beams instead of photons as probe).

In this case, certain nonessential atoms were ignored in the geometric analysis and the Points B andC became degenerate. The results are represented on Figure 5. The points at (44 , 115 ) and (136 , 65 ) have a large β value, which is characteristic of the edge-to-face dimers in herringbone packing. However, the α values are unusually far from 0 or 180 , showing a packing arrangement specific to this crystal. The point at (0 , 0 ) is in this case only related to the dimers which monomers form with periodic images of themselves.3.2 | Exciton analysis3.2.1 | Exciton classificationThe exciton model is a framework to characterize different types of many-body electronic excitations in collections of molecules.The excitation can be associated with a localized Frenkel exciton, or a charge-transfer state, which are characterized by the electron density, respectively, migrating intramolecularly and intermolecularly. A delocalized Frenkel excitation corresponds to electron density reorganization throughout the dimer with no net charge transfer.

Due to the almost negligible amplitude of d,pp at around 180 degrees the linear arrangement of the three nuclei (in the ground state) can be excluded. Thus, the structure of H 2 D + derived from our pre-BO numerical study is in agreement with the equilibrium structure (equilateral triangle) known from BO electronic-structure computations.\n\n\nClassical structure from quantum mechanics\n\nRelying on the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, the structure of H + 2 was visualised as a proton shell ( Figure 5) with the protons found at around the antipodal points, and H 2 D + was seen as a proton shell and a deuteron shell within which the relative position of the three nuclei is dominated by a triangular arrangement ( Figure 6). This analysis has demonstrated that elements of molecular structure can be recognised in the appropriate marginal probability densities calculated from the full electron-nuclear wave function. At the same time, a chemist would rather think about H + 2 as a (classical) rotating dumbbell (Figure 7) and H 2 D + as a (nearly) equilateral triangle. Although elements can be recognised in the probability density functions, the link to the classical structure which chemists have used for more than a century to understand and design new reaction pathways for new materials, is not obvious [97,99,100,102,121,122].\n\nIn the next couple of paragraphs we briefly outline a promising direction which can offer a resolution to this puzzle. We collect the most relevant aspects and ideas, whereas their detailed exploration is left for future work in this field. In order to recover the classical molecular structure from a fully quantum mechanical treatment, it is necessary to obtain for a molecule (a) the shape; (b) the handedness: chiral molecules are found exclusively in their left-or right-handed version or in a classical mixture (called racemic mixture) of these mirror images but 'never' in their superposition; (c) the individual labelling of the atomic nuclei (distinguishability).",

These effects were determined to be small but nonzero for intermolecular distances greater than 7-8Å, while TDDFT predicts a significant departure from the Heitler-London picture at smaller distances. It also predicts some charge-transfer character at these smaller distances. In the future it would be useful to develop more reliable estimates of this charge-transfer character 7 in order to analyze the interplay between excitonic and charge transfer states in chromophore arrays relevant to natural photosynthesis, such as, e.g., the bacterial reaction center 67 .\n\nWe expect that our investigation and refinement of effective Hamiltonian descriptions of molecular aggregates will inform the modeling of large molecular aggregates formed by direct aggregation or aggregation by protein templated assembly.

These three angles correspond to the Euler angles α, β, and γ, respectively.

Taking R f = 6.627a 0 and Z = 12e in the fullerene C 60 , we find for the field strength E = 1.38 × 10 11 V/m. This is smaller than the critical value (evaporation field) for the carbon E max = 1.48 × 10 11 V/m, above which the ion field emission starts [55,56]. One can reasonably assume that this field value should not be exceeded also for the onion-like structures.",

Spherical fullerenes are also called buckyballs and they resemble the balls used in association football. Cylindrical ones are called carbon nanotubes or buckytubes. Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite, which is composed of stacked graphene sheets of linked hexagonal rings; but they may also contain pentagonal (or sometimes heptagonal) rings [1].\n\nThe first fullerene to be discovered, and the family's namesake, buckminsterfullerene (C 60 ), was prepared in 1985 by Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Harold Kroto at Rice University. The name was homage to Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes it resembles. The structure was also identified some five years earlier by Sumio Iijima, from an electron microscope image, where it formed the core of a \"bucky onion\" [2]. Fullerenes have since been found to occur in nature [2]. More recently, fullerenes have been detected in outer space [3]. According to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, \"It's possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth\" [3].\n\nFullerenes are stable, but not totally unreactive. The sp 2hybridized carbon atoms, which are at their energy minimum in planar graphite, must be bent to form the closed sphere or tube, which produces angle strain. The characteristic reaction of fullerenes is electrophilic addition at 6,6-double bonds, which reduces angle strain by changing sp 2 -hybridized carbons into sp 3hybridized ones. The change in hybridized orbitals causes the bond angles to decrease from about 120° in the sp 2 orbitals to about 109.5° in the sp 3 orbitals. This decrease in bond angles allows for the bonds to bend less when closing the sphere or tube, and thus, the molecule becomes more stable.",
