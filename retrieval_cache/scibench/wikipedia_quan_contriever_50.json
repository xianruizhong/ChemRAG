The 2018 IPCC report suggested that a carbon price of $135–5.500 in 2030 and $245–13.000/t in 2050 would be needed to drive carbon emissions to stay below the 1.5 °C limit. This is more than three times higher than for a 2 °C limit. Large studies in the late 2010s estimatedthe social cost of carbon as high as $417/t or as low as $54/t. Both those studies subsume wide ranges; the latter is a meta-study whose source estimates range from -$13.36/t to $2,386.91/t. Note that the costs derive not from the element carbon, but the molecule carbon dioxide. Each tonne of carbon dioxide consists of about 0.27 tonnes of carbon and 0.73 tonnes of oxygen. In 2021, the study \"The social cost of carbon dioxide under climate-economy feedbacks and temperature variability\" estimated even costs of more than $3000/t.",

If the number of particles is a bit larger there are usually some particles inside the box. We can define an average, but the actual number of particles in the box has relatively large fluctuations around this average. 3. In the case of a very large number of particles there will always be a lot of particles in the small box. The number will fluctuate but the fluctuations around the average are relatively small. The average number is proportional to ΔV and ΨΨ∗ is now interpreted as the particle density.",

While attempts at verifying the internal clock hypothesis and measuring clock frequency are so far not conclusive, recent experimental data is at least compatible with de Broglie's conjecture. Non-nullity and variability of mass According to de Broglie, the neutrino and the photon have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low. That a photon is not quite massless is imposed by the coherence of his theory. Incidentally, this rejection of the hypothesis of a massless photon enabled him to doubt the hypothesis of the expansion of the universe.",

Arnold Sommerfeld calculated that, for a 1s orbital electron of a hydrogen atom with an orbiting radius of 0.0529 nm, α ≈ 1/137. That is to say, the fine-structure constant shows the electron traveling at nearly 1/137 the speed of light. One can extend this to a larger element with an atomic number Z by using the expression for a 1s electron, where v is its radial velocity, i.e., its instantaneous speed tangent to the radius of the atom. For gold with Z = 79, v ≈ 0.58c, so the 1s electron will be moving at 58% of the speed of light. Plugging this in for v/c in the equation for the relativistic mass, one finds that mrel = 1.22me, and in turn putting this in for the Bohr radius above one finds that the radius shrinks by 22%.

Note that the NDDO approximation is still in effect, and that only a few of the possible TERIs are explicitly computed. The values of the explicit TERIs are scaled using empirically-derived functions to obtain experimentally relevant results. One-center two-electron repulsion integrals (OCTEs) are derived initially to reproduce atomic properties. These values are then fixed and carried forward as further elemental parameterization proceeds.

It uses a linear combination of configuration state functions (CSF), or configuration determinants, to approximate the exact electronic wavefunction of an atom or molecule. In an MCSCF calculation, the set of coefficients of both the CSFs or determinants and the basis functions in the molecular orbitals are varied to obtain the total electronic wavefunction with the lowest possible energy. This method can be considered a combination between configuration interaction (where the molecular orbitals are not varied but the expansion of the wave function) and Hartree–Fock (where there is only one determinant, but the molecular orbitals are",

It was seven years later that J. J. Thomson showed that cathode rays consist of streams of particles, to be called electrons, and made more precise measurements of their mass-to-charge ratio again using a cathode ray tube. The second measurement was of the charge of the electron. This was determined with a precision of better than 1% by Robert A. Millikan in his famous oil drop experiment in 1909. Together with the mass-to-charge ratio, the electron mass was thereby determined with reasonable precision. The value of mass that was found for the electron was initially met with surprise by physicists, since it was so small (less than 0.1%) compared to the known mass of a hydrogen atom.",

One of the consequences of this oscillation is that it encourages electrons to decay to the lowest energy state. When this happens due to the presence of the electromagnetic field from a photon, a photon is released in the same phase and direction as the \"stimulating\" photon, and is called stimulated emission. The rate at which stimulated emission occurs is proportional to the number of atoms N2 in the excited state, and the radiation density of the light. The base probability of a photon causing stimulated emission in a single excited atom was shown by Albert Einstein to be exactly equal to the probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom in the ground state. Therefore, when the numbers of atoms in the ground and excited states are equal, the rate of stimulated emission is equal to the rate of absorption for a given radiation density.",

As the electromagnetic field is coupled to the state of the atom, and the atom can only absorb a single photon before having to decay, the most basic case then is if the field only contains a single photon.
