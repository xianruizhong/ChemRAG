Although these two symbols appear nearly identical, they mean very different things). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as being a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued that Bohr's assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is considered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that only an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit (Figure 3.17).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.17 If an electron is viewed as a wave circling around the nucleus, an integer number of wavelengths must fit into the orbit for this standing wave behavior to be possible.\n\nFor a circular orbit of radius $r$, the circumference is $2 \\pi r$, and so de Broglie's condition is:\n\n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$",

Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.\n\nSubstances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy ( $\\boldsymbol{U}$ ), sometimes symbolized as $E$.\n\nAs a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat $(q)$ from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work ( $w$ ) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire's temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.\n\nThe relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U=q+w\n$$",

As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a onedimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 3.7 shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen in Figure 3.7. The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths $n$. Since the number of nodes is $n-1$, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves.

The n:p ratio increases, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide.\n\nElectron capture occurs when one of the inner electrons in an atom is captured by the atom's nucleus. For example, potassium-40 undergoes electron capture:\n\n$$\n{ }_{19}^{40} \\mathrm{~K}+{ }_{-1}^{0} \\mathrm{e} \\longrightarrow{ }_{18}^{40} \\mathrm{Ar}\n$$\n\nElectron capture occurs when an inner shell electron combines with a proton and is converted into a neutron. The loss of an inner shell electron leaves a vacancy that will be filled by one of the outer electrons. As the outer electron drops into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an X-ray. Like positron emission, electron capture occurs for \"proton-rich\" nuclei that lie below the band of stability. Electron capture has the same effect on the nucleus as does positron emission: The atomic number is decreased by one and the mass number does not change. This increases the n:p ratio, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Whether electron capture or positron emission occurs is difficult to predict. The choice is primarily due to kinetic factors, with the one requiring the smaller activation energy being the one more likely to occur.",

Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation - \nThe minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the activation energy $\\left(\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$. How this energy compares to the kinetic energy provided by colliding reactant molecules is a primary factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. If the activation energy is much larger than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, the reaction will occur slowly since only a few fast-moving molecules will have enough energy to react. If the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, a large fraction of molecules will be adequately energetic and the reaction will proceed rapidly.\n\nFigure 17.14 shows how the energy of a chemical system changes as it undergoes a reaction converting reactants to products according to the equation\n\n$$\nA+B \\longrightarrow C+D\n$$\n\nThese reaction diagrams are widely used in chemical kinetics to illustrate various properties of the reaction of interest. Viewing the diagram from left to right, the system initially comprises reactants only, $A+B$.

The unstable transition state can then subsequently decay to yield stable products, $C+D$.

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the lowfrequency end to gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Since these wavelengths are comparable to the spaces between atoms in a crystalline solid, X-rays are scattered when they pass through crystals. The scattered rays undergo constructive and destructive interference that creates a specific diffraction pattern that may be measured and used to precisely determine the positions of atoms within the crystal. This phenomenon of X-ray diffraction is the basis for very powerful techniques enabling the determination of molecular structure. One of the pioneers who applied this powerful technology to important biochemical substances was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.\n\nBorn in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910 to British parents, Dorothy's fascination with chemistry was fostered early in her life. At age 11 she was enrolled in a prestigious English grammar school where she was one of just two girls allowed to study chemistry. On her 16th birthday, her mother, Molly, gifted her a book on X-ray crystallography, which had a profound impact on the trajectory of her career. She studied chemistry at Oxford University, graduating with first-class honors in 1932 and directly entering Cambridge University to pursue a doctoral degree. At Cambridge, Dorothy recognized the promise of X-ray crystallography for protein structure determinations, conducting research that earned her a PhD in 1937. Over the course of a very productive career, Dr. Hodgkin was credited with determining structures for several important biomolecules, including cholesterol iodide, penicillin, and vitamin B12. In recognition of her achievements in the use of X-ray techniques to elucidate the structures of biochemical substances, she was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1969, she led a team of scientists who deduced the structure of insulin, facilitating the mass production of this hormone and greatly advancing the treatment of diabetic patients worldwide. Dr. Hodgkin continued working with the international scientific community, earning numerous distinctions and awards prior to her death in 1993.",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor.

The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

For example, one type of compound she is developing captures carbon dioxide waste from power plants and catalytically converts it into useful products (see Figure 19.27).\n\n\nFIGURE 19.27 Catalytic converters change carbon dioxide emissions from power plants into useful products, and, like the one shown here, are also found in cars.\n\nAnother project involves the development of porous, sponge-like materials that are \"photoactive.\" The absorption of light causes the pores of the sponge to change size, allowing gas diffusion to be controlled. This has many potential useful applications, from powering cars with hydrogen fuel cells to making better electronics components. Although not a complex, self-darkening sunglasses are an example of a photoactive substance.\n\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/16DeannaD) to learn more about this research and listen to Dr. D'Alessandro (shown in Figure 19.28) describe what it is like being a research chemist.\n\n\nFIGURE 19.28 Dr. Deanna D'Alessandro is a functional materials researcher.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- State the first law of thermodynamics\n- Define enthalpy and explain its classification as a state function\n- Write and balance thermochemical equations\n- Calculate enthalpy changes for various chemical reactions\n- Explain Hess's law and use it to compute reaction enthalpies\n\nThermochemistry is a branch of chemical thermodynamics, the science that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and other forms of energy in the context of chemical and physical processes. As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.\n\nSubstances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy ( $\\boldsymbol{U}$ ), sometimes symbolized as $E$.\n\nAs a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat $(q)$ from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work ( $w$ ) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire's temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.\n\nThe relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U=q+w\n$$",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

As discussed previously, the $3 d$ orbital with no radial nodes is higher in energy because it is less penetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the $4 s$, which has three radial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s ${ }^{1}$. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valence shell configuration.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThis view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstax.org/l/16combustion) illustrates the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into energy of motion.\n\nAs discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as $\\Delta U=q+w$. Internal energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m , and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 9.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).\n\n\nFIGURE 9.20 Paths $X$ and $Y$ represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path). (credit: modification of work by Paul Shaffner)\n\nChemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system's internal energy $(U)$ and the mathematical product of its pressure ( $P$ ) and volume ( $V$ ):\n\n$$\nH=U+P V\n$$",

Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions.\n\nThe properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of $1+$. Their\nreactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal $\\left(0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right)$.\n\nThe alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide.

Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in Figure 18.4 , to prevent contact with air and moisture.

In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of alkali metal compounds.",

Streetlights sometime employ sodium vapor lights because the sodium vapor penetrates fog better than most other light. This is because the fog does not scatter yellow light as much as it scatters white light. The other alkali metals and their salts also impart color to a flame. Lithium creates a bright, crimson color, whereas the others create a pale, violet color.\n\n\nFIGURE 18.5 Dipping a wire into a solution of a sodium salt and then heating the wire causes emission of a bright yellow light, characteristic of sodium.",

Such lighting consists of a range of broadly distributed frequencies that form a continuous spectrum. Figure 3.9 shows the wavelength distribution for sunlight.

Unfortunately, most of these organisms cannot absorb nitrogen from its most abundant source-the atmosphere. Atmospheric nitrogen consists of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ molecules, which are very unreactive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond. However, a few organisms can overcome this problem through a process known as nitrogen fixation, illustrated in Figure 18.32.\n\n\nFIGURE 18.32 All living organisms require nitrogen. A few microorganisms are able to process atmospheric nitrogen using nitrogen fixation. (credit \"roots\": modification of work by the United States Department of Agriculture; credit \"root nodules\": modification of work by Louisa Howard)\n\nNitrogen fixation is the process where organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful chemicals. To date, the only known kind of biological organisms capable of nitrogen fixation are microorganisms. These organisms employ enzymes called nitrogenases, which contain iron and molybdenum. Many of these microorganisms live in a symbiotic relationship with plants, with the bestknown example being the presence of rhizobia in the root nodules of legumes.\n\nLarge volumes of atmospheric nitrogen are necessary for making ammonia-the principal starting material\nused for preparation of large quantities of other nitrogen-containing compounds. Most other uses for elemental nitrogen depend on its inactivity. It is helpful when a chemical process requires an inert atmosphere. Canned foods and luncheon meats cannot oxidize in a pure nitrogen atmosphere, so they retain a better flavor and color, and spoil less rapidly, when sealed in nitrogen instead of air. This technology allows fresh produce to be available year-round, regardless of growing season.\n\nThere are compounds with nitrogen in all of its oxidation states from 3- to $5+$. Much of the chemistry of nitrogen involves oxidation-reduction reactions. Some active metals (such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) can reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides.

This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins).

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

Determining Percent Composition from Molecular or Empirical Formulas - \nPercent composition is also useful for evaluating the relative abundance of a given element in different compounds of known formulas.

The element nitrogen is the active ingredient for agricultural purposes, so the mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and economic concern for consumers choosing among these fertilizers. For these sorts of applications, the percent composition of a compound is easily derived from its formula mass and the atomic masses of its constituent elements. A molecule of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ contains one N atom weighing 14.01 amu and three H atoms weighing a total of (3 $\\times 1.008 \\mathrm{amu})=3.024 \\mathrm{amu}$. The formula mass of ammonia is therefore $(14.01 \\mathrm{amu}+3.024 \\mathrm{amu})=17.03 \\mathrm{amu}$, and its percent composition is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\% \\mathrm{~N}=\\frac{14.01 \\mathrm{amu} \\mathrm{~N}}{17.03 \\mathrm{amu} \\mathrm{NH}} 3 \\mathrm{am} \\\\\n& \\% \\mathrm{H}=\\frac{3.024 \\mathrm{amu} \\mathrm{H}}{17.03 \\mathrm{amu} \\mathrm{NH}_{3} \\times 100 \\%=82.27 \\%}=17.76 \\%\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis same approach may be taken considering a pair of molecules, a dozen molecules, or a mole of molecules, etc. The latter amount is most convenient and would simply involve the use of molar masses instead of atomic and formula masses, as demonstrated Example 6.4. As long as the molecular or empirical formula of the compound in question is known, the percent composition may be derived from the atomic or molar masses of the compound's elements.",

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$.

Nuclear Fusion and Fusion Reactors - \nThe process of converting very light nuclei into heavier nuclei is also accompanied by the conversion of mass into large amounts of energy, a process called fusion.

Answer: - \nAs the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the forward direction, reactant concentrations decrease (as does the denominator of $Q_{c}$ ), product concentration increases (as does the numerator of $Q_{c}$ ), and the reaction quotient consequently increases. When equilibrium is achieved, the concentrations of reactants and product remain constant, as does the value of $Q_{c}$.\n\nIf the reaction begins with only product present, the value of $Q_{c}$ is initially undefined (immeasurably large, or infinite):\n\n$$\nQ_{c}=\\frac{\\left[\\mathrm{SO}_{3}\\right]^{2}}{\\left[\\mathrm{SO}_{2}\\right]^{2}\\left[\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right]}=\\frac{\\left[\\mathrm{SO}_{3}\\right]^{2}}{0} \\rightarrow \\infty\n$$\n\nIn this case, the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the reverse direction.

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins).

Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron ( $n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ ). The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 . The first two electrons in lithium fill the $1 s$ orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:\n\n\nAn atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4 , contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus. The fourth electron fills the remaining space in the $2 s$ orbital.",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant.\n\nIt should be noted that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nHeisenberg's principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science.

Entropy and Microstates - \nFollowing the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates ( $W$ ) possible for the system. A microstate is a specific configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The relation between a system's entropy and the number of possible microstates is\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nAs for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final ( $S_{\\mathrm{f}}$ ) and initial $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ values:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=S_{\\mathrm{f}}-S_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{f}}-k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\n\nFor processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the entropy of the system increases and $\\Delta S>0$. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}<W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, yield a decrease in system entropy, $\\Delta S<0$. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.\n\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of $N$ particles distributed among $n$ boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is $n^{N}$. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in $2^{4}=16$ different microstates as illustrated in Figure 12.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)",

In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section.

A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to $1 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}{ }^{2} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$, which is also called 1 newton-meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.\n\nWe now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of heat ( $q$ ) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change $(\\Delta T)$ of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):\n\n$$\nC=\\frac{q}{\\Delta T}\n$$\n\nHeat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive property-its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.\n\nFor example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast\niron frying pan is found by observing that it takes $18,150 \\mathrm{~J}$ of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by $50.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ :",

The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) and is the property that defines an atom's elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is\napproximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.\n\nIsotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4.

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a distance of approximately $10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$.

To give you an idea of how small this is, a thin pencil line is about 3 million carbon atoms wide.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas.\n\nParticles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In general, real gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at high pressures, the molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between the molecules is reduced. At these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes appreciable relative to the total volume occupied by the gas. The gas therefore becomes less compressible at these high pressures, and although its volume continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is not proportional as predicted by Boyle's law.\n\nAt relatively low pressures, gas molecules have practically no attraction for one another because they are (on average) so far apart, and they behave almost like particles of an ideal gas. At higher pressures, however, the force of attraction is also no longer insignificant. This force pulls the molecules a little closer together, slightly decreasing the pressure (if the volume is constant) or decreasing the volume (at constant pressure) (Figure 8.36). This change is more pronounced at low temperatures because the molecules have lower KE relative to the attractive forces, and so they are less effective in overcoming these attractions after colliding with one another.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.36 (a) Attractions between gas molecules serve to decrease the gas volume at constant pressure compared to an ideal gas whose molecules experience no attractive forces. (b) These attractive forces will decrease the force of collisions between the molecules and container walls, therefore reducing the pressure exerted at constant volume compared to an ideal gas.\n\nThere are several different equations that better approximate gas behavior than does the ideal gas law. The first, and simplest, of these was developed by the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals in 1879. The van der Waals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces between them.\n\n$$\nP V=n R T \\longrightarrow\\left(P+\\frac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}\\right)(V-n b)=n R T\n$$",

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThe Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstax.org/1/16PhetScatter) allows you to investigate the differences between a \"plum pudding\" atom and a Rutherford atom by firing $\\alpha$ particles at each type of atom.\n\nAnother important finding was the discovery of isotopes. During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a \"new element\" produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the English chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopes-atoms of the same element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery.\n\nOne puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found evidence of neutrons, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The existence of the neutron also explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of\nneutrons, but they are chemically identical because they have the same number of protons. This will be explained in more detail later.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Balancing Nuclear Reactions - \nA balanced chemical reaction equation reflects the fact that during a chemical reaction, bonds break and form, and atoms are rearranged, but the total numbers of atoms of each element are conserved and do not change. A balanced nuclear reaction equation indicates that there is a rearrangement during a nuclear reaction, but of nucleons (subatomic particles within the atoms' nuclei) rather than atoms. Nuclear reactions also follow conservation laws, and they are balanced in two ways:\n\n1. The sum of the mass numbers of the reactants equals the sum of the mass numbers of the products.\n2. The sum of the charges of the reactants equals the sum of the charges of the products.\n\nIf the atomic number and the mass number of all but one of the particles in a nuclear reaction are known, we can identify the particle by balancing the reaction.

With regard to atomic substances, heavier atoms possess greater entropy at a given temperature than lighter atoms, which is a consequence of the relation between a particle's mass and the spacing of quantized translational energy levels (a topic beyond the scope of this text). For molecules, greater numbers of atoms increase the number of ways in which the molecules can vibrate and thus the number of possible microstates and the entropy of the system.\n\nFinally, variations in the types of particles affects the entropy of a system. Compared to a pure substance, in which all particles are identical, the entropy of a mixture of two or more different particle types is greater. This is because of the additional orientations and interactions that are possible in a system comprised of nonidentical components. For example, when a solid dissolves in a liquid, the particles of the solid experience both a greater freedom of motion and additional interactions with the solvent particles. This corresponds to a more uniform dispersal of matter and energy and a greater number of microstates.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the physical factors that lead to deviations from ideal gas behavior\n- Explain how these factors are represented in the van der Waals equation\n- Define compressibility (Z) and describe how its variation with pressure reflects non-ideal behavior\n- Quantify non-ideal behavior by comparing computations of gas properties using the ideal gas law and the van der Waals equation\n\nThus far, the ideal gas law, $P V=n R T$, has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from\nreaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.\n\nOne way in which the accuracy of $P V=n R T$ can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its molar volume, $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ ) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the compressibility factor ( $\\mathbf{Z}$ ) with:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Z}=\\frac{\\text { molar volume of gas at same } T \\text { and } P}{\\text { molar volume of ideal gas at same } T \\text { and } P}=\\left(\\frac{P V_{m}}{R T}\\right)_{\\text {measured }}\n$$\n\nIdeal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1 , and any deviation from 1 is an indication of non-ideal behavior. Figure 8.35 shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.35 A graph of the compressibility factor $(Z)$ vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.\n\nAs is apparent from Figure 8.35, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures. To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas.",

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the lowfrequency end to gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThe next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively charged alpha particles ( $\\alpha$ particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of radium; $\\alpha$ particles consist of two protons and two neutrons (you will learn more about radioactive decay in the chapter on nuclear chemistry). Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a beam of $\\alpha$ particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering of the $\\alpha$ particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an $\\alpha$ particle.\nWhat did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source (Figure 2.9). Rutherford described finding these results: \"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you., ${ }^{\\underline{1}}$\n\n\nFIGURE 2.9 Geiger and Rutherford fired $\\alpha$ particles at a piece of gold foil and detected where those particles went, as shown in this schematic diagram of their experiment. Most of the particles passed straight through the foil, but a few were deflected slightly and a very small number were significantly deflected.\n\nHere is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving $\\alpha$ particles passed through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like charges repel one another, the few positively charged $\\alpha$ particles that changed paths abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:",

This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.\n\nDifferent types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 20.33). A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

The blackbody spectrum matches the solar spectrum quite well. A blackbody is a convenient, ideal emitter that approximates the behavior of many materials when heated. It is \"ideal\" in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed\nwith a spectrometer so that the wavelengths and their intensities can be measured. Figure 3.10 shows the resulting curves for some representative temperatures. Each distribution depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, $\\lambda_{\\max }$, shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high temperatures begin to glow a darker red that becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming white hot at very high temperatures as the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo metabolic reactions that provide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy for transportation, heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then used to manufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers, and bridges.\n\n\nFIGURE 9.2 The energy involved in chemical changes is important to our daily lives: (a) A cheeseburger for lunch provides the energy you need to get through the rest of the day; (b) the combustion of gasoline provides the energy that moves your car (and you) between home, work, and school; and (c) coke, a processed form of coal, provides the energy needed to convert iron ore into iron, which is essential for making many of the products we use daily.

Such lighting consists of a range of broadly distributed frequencies that form a continuous spectrum. Figure 3.9 shows the wavelength distribution for sunlight.

This lack of resistance means that there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity. This would lead to a significant reduction in the cost of electricity.\n\nMost currently used, commercial superconducting materials, such as NbTi and $\\mathrm{Nb}_{3} \\mathrm{Sn}$, do not become superconducting until they are cooled below $23 \\mathrm{~K}\\left(-250^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. This requires the use of liquid helium, which has a boiling temperature of 4 K and is expensive and difficult to handle. The cost of liquid helium has deterred the widespread application of superconductors.\n\nOne of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 1980s was the characterization of compounds that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above 90 K . (Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.) Typical among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of several rare earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio. The formula of the ionic yttrium compound is $\\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \\mathrm{Cu}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{7}$.\n\nThe new materials become superconducting at temperatures close to 90 K (Figure 19.10), temperatures that can be reached by cooling with liquid nitrogen (boiling temperature of 77 K ). Not only are liquid nitrogencooled materials easier to handle, but the cooling costs are also about 1000 times lower than for liquid helium.\n\nFurther advances during the same period included materials that became superconducting at even higher temperatures and with a wider array of materials. The DuPont team led by Uma Chowdry and Arthur Sleight identified Bismouth-Strontium-Copper-Oxides that became superconducting at temperatures as high as 110 K and, importantly, did not contain rare earth elements. Advances continued through the subsequent decades until, in 2020, a team led by Ranga Dias at University of Rochester announced the development of a roomtemperature superconductor, opening doors to widespread applications. More research and development is needed to realize the potential of these materials, but the possibilities are very promising.",

When 1.00 g of coal is burned in a bomb calorimeter (Figure 9.17), the temperature increases by $1.48{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. If the heat capacity of the calorimeter is $21.6 \\mathrm{~kJ} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, determine the heat produced by combustion of a ton of coal $\\left(2.000 \\times 10^{3}\\right.$ pounds).\n33.

Any nuclear reactor that produces power via the fission of uranium or plutonium by bombardment with neutrons must have at least five components: nuclear fuel consisting of fissionable material, a nuclear moderator, reactor coolant, control rods, and a shield and containment system. We will discuss these components in greater detail later in the section. The reactor works by separating the fissionable nuclear material such that a critical mass cannot be formed, controlling both the flux and absorption of neutrons to allow shutting down the fission reactions. In a nuclear reactor used for the production of electricity, the energy released by fission reactions is trapped as thermal energy and used to boil water and produce steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which powers a generator for the production of electricity.\n\n\nFIGURE 20.19 (a) The Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant near San Luis Obispo is the only nuclear power plant currently in operation in California. The domes are the containment structures for the nuclear reactors, and the brown building houses the turbine where electricity is generated. Ocean water is used for cooling. (b) The Diablo Canyon uses a pressurized water reactor, one of a few different fission reactor designs in use around the world, to produce electricity. Energy from the nuclear fission reactions in the core heats water in a closed, pressurized system. Heat from this system produces steam that drives a turbine, which in turn produces electricity.

Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we will need 64 times as much to heat it by $64^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (that is, from $21^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $85^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ).\n\nThis can be summarized using the equation:",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

The sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the remaining Crab Nebula (Figure 3.1) continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored\nfilaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms. We will also see how this radiation can be used to identify elements, even from thousands of light years away.",

To accommodate the units of the other terms in the mass-energy equation, the mass must be expressed in kg , since $1 \\mathrm{~J}=1 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$. Converting grams into kilograms yields a mass defect of $3.05 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~kg} /$ mol. Substituting this quantity into the mass-energy equivalence equation yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E=m c^{2}=\\frac{3.05 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~kg}}{\\mathrm{~mol}} \\times\\left(\\frac{2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m}}{\\mathrm{~s}}\\right)^{2}=2.74 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\\\\n& =2.74 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~J} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}=2.74 \\mathrm{TJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

Although these two symbols appear nearly identical, they mean very different things). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as being a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued that Bohr's assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is considered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that only an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit (Figure 3.17).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.17 If an electron is viewed as a wave circling around the nucleus, an integer number of wavelengths must fit into the orbit for this standing wave behavior to be possible.\n\nFor a circular orbit of radius $r$, the circumference is $2 \\pi r$, and so de Broglie's condition is:\n\n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

With IR irradiation, the energy absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to increase molecular vibrations. With UV radiation, the energy absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to promote an electron from a lower-energy orbital to a higherenergy one in a conjugated molecule. The conjugated diene 1,3-butadiene, for instance, has four $\\pi$ molecular orbitals, as shown previously in FIGURE 14.3. The two lower-energy, bonding MOs are occupied in the ground state, and the two higher-energy, antibonding MOs are unoccupied.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the lowfrequency end to gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

Molecular polarity results from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule. As a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar substances are insoluble in water.\n\nNet polarity is measured by a quantity called the dipole moment and can be thought of in the following way: assume that there is a center of mass of all positive charges (nuclei) in a molecule and a center of mass of all negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don't coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.\n\nThe dipole moment, $\\mu$ (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge $Q$ at either end of the molecular dipole times the distance $r$ between the charges, $\\mu=Q \\times r$. Dipole moments are expressed in debyes $(\\mathrm{D})$, where $1 \\mathrm{D}=3.336 \\times 10^{-30}$ coulomb meters ( $\\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$ ) in SI units. For example, the unit charge on an electron is $1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nClick here (http://openstax.org/l/16JJThomson) to hear Thomson describe his discovery in his own voice.\n\nIn 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist Robert A. Millikan via his \"oil drop\" experiments. Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the charge on individual drops (Figure 2.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.7 Millikan's experiment measured the charge of individual oil drops. The tabulated data are examples of a few possible values.\n\nLooking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that the charge of an oil droplet is always a multiple of a specific charge, $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a fundamental charge-the charge of a single electron-with his measured charges due to an excess of one electron ( 1 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), two electrons ( 2 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), three electrons ( 3 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), and so on, on a given oil droplet. Since the charge of an electron was now known due to Millikan's research, and the charge-to-mass ratio was already known due to Thomson's research ( $1.759 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{kg}$ ), it only required a simple calculation to determine the mass of the electron as well.\n\n$$\n\\text { Mass of electron }=1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~kg}}{1.759 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{C}}=9.107 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}\n$$",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

Line Spectra - \nFIGURE 3.13 Compare the two types of emission spectra: continuous spectrum of white light (top) and the line spectra of the light from excited sodium, hydrogen, calcium, and mercury atoms.\n\nThe origin of discrete spectra in atoms and molecules was extremely puzzling to scientists in the late nineteenth century, since according to classical electromagnetic theory, only continuous spectra should be observed.

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the lowfrequency end to gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nFIGURE 3.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as $2 s$, $3 p$, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, $n$. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

For example, a carbon atom weighs less than $2 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~g}$, and an electron has a charge of less than $2 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ (coulomb). When describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the atomic mass unit (amu) and the fundamental unit of charge (e). The amu was originally defined based on hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu . (This isotope is known as \"carbon-12\" as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of one carbon-12 atom: $1 \\mathrm{amu}=1.6605 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~g}$. (The Dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative units that are equivalent to the amu.)

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

If we interconvert cis-2-butene with trans-2-butene and allow them to reach equilibrium, we find that they aren't of equal stability. The trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer by $2.8 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(0.66 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$ at room temperature, corresponding to a $76: 24$ ratio.\n\n\nCis alkenes are less stable than their trans isomers because of steric strain between the two larger substituents on the same side of the double bond. This is the same kind of steric interference that we saw previously in the axial conformation of methylcyclohexane (Section 4.7).\n\ncis-2-Butene\n\ntrans-2-Butene\n\nAlthough it's sometimes possible to find relative stabilities of alkene isomers by establishing a cis-trans equilibrium through treatment with strong acid, a more general method is to take advantage of the fact that alkenes undergo a hydrogenation reaction to give the corresponding alkane when treated with $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum.\n\n\nEnergy diagrams for the hydrogenation reactions of cis- and trans-2-butene are shown in FIGURE 7.6. Because cis-2-butene is less stable than trans-2-butene by $2.8 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, the energy diagram shows the cis alkene at a higher energy level. After reaction, however, both curves are at the same energy level (butane). It therefore follows that $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for reaction of the cis isomer must be larger than $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for reaction of the trans isomer by 2.8 $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. In other words, more energy is released in the hydrogenation of the cis isomer than the trans isomer because the cis isomer has more energy to begin with.",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

They earned the name \"noble\" because they were assumed to be nonreactive since they have filled valence shells. In 1962, Dr. Neil Bartlett at the University of British Columbia proved this assumption to be false.\n\nThese elements are present in the atmosphere in small amounts. Some natural gas contains $1-2 \\%$ helium by mass. Helium is isolated from natural gas by liquefying the condensable components, leaving only helium as a gas. The United States possesses most of the world's commercial supply of this element in its helium-bearing gas fields. Argon, neon, krypton, and xenon come from the fractional distillation of liquid air. Radon comes from other radioactive elements. More recently, it was observed that this radioactive gas is present in very\nsmall amounts in soils and minerals. Its accumulation in well-insulated, tightly sealed buildings, however, constitutes a health hazard, primarily lung cancer.\n\nThe boiling points and melting points of the noble gases are extremely low relative to those of other substances of comparable atomic or molecular masses. This is because only weak London dispersion forces are present, and these forces can hold the atoms together only when molecular motion is very slight, as it is at very low temperatures. Helium is the only substance known that does not solidify on cooling at normal pressure. It remains liquid close to absolute zero $(0.001 \\mathrm{~K})$ at ordinary pressures, but it solidifies under elevated pressure.\n\nHelium is used for filling balloons and lighter-than-air craft because it does not burn, making it safer to use than hydrogen. Helium at high pressures is not a narcotic like nitrogen. Thus, mixtures of oxygen and helium are important for divers working under high pressures. Using a helium-oxygen mixture avoids the disoriented mental state known as nitrogen narcosis, the so-called rapture of the deep. Helium is important as an inert atmosphere for the melting and welding of easily oxidizable metals and for many chemical processes that are sensitive to air.",

It has been clearly demonstrated that chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs (known commercially as Freons), which were\npresent as aerosol propellants in spray cans and as refrigerants, caused depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. This occurred because ultraviolet light also causes CFCs to decompose, producing atomic chlorine. The chlorine atoms react with ozone molecules, resulting in a net removal of $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ molecules from stratosphere. This process is explored in detail in our coverage of chemical kinetics. There is a worldwide effort to reduce the amount of CFCs used commercially, and the ozone hole is already beginning to decrease in size as atmospheric concentrations of atomic chlorine decrease. While ozone in the stratosphere helps protect us, ozone in the troposphere is a problem. This ozone is a toxic component of photochemical smog.\n\nThe uses of ozone depend on its reactivity with other substances.

Radiation causes the ionization of the gas in a Geiger-Müller tube. The rate of ionization is proportional to the amount of radiation.

Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and argon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms (Figure 1.14). One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A molecule consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of soda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A molecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a unit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of golf balls.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.14 The elements hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur form molecules consisting of two or more atoms of the same element.

Both ESI and MALDI are soft ionization methods that produce charged molecules with little fragmentation, even with sensitive biological samples of very high molecular weight.\n\nIn an ESI source, as a sample solution exits the tube, it is subjected to a high voltage that causes the droplets to become charged. The sample molecules gain one or more protons from charged solvent molecules in the droplet. The volatile solvent quickly evaporates, giving variably protonated sample molecules $\\left(M+H_{n}{ }^{n+}\\right)$. In a MALDI source, the sample is adsorbed onto a suitable matrix compound, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, which is ionized by a short burst of laser light.

At these temperatures, all molecules dissociate into atoms, and the atoms ionize, forming plasma. These conditions occur in an extremely large number of locations throughout the universe-stars are powered by fusion. Humans have already figured out how to create temperatures high enough to achieve fusion on a large scale in thermonuclear weapons. A thermonuclear weapon such as a hydrogen bomb contains a nuclear fission bomb that, when exploded, gives off enough energy to produce the extremely high temperatures necessary for fusion to occur.\n\nAnother much more beneficial way to create fusion reactions is in a fusion reactor, a nuclear reactor in which fusion reactions of light nuclei are controlled. Because no solid materials are stable at such high temperatures, mechanical devices cannot contain the plasma in which fusion reactions occur. Two techniques to contain plasma at the density and temperature necessary for a fusion reaction are currently the focus of intensive research efforts: containment by a magnetic field and by the use of focused laser beams (Figure 20.23). A number of large projects are working to attain one of the biggest goals in science: getting hydrogen fuel to ignite and produce more energy than the amount supplied to achieve the extremely high temperatures and pressures that are required for fusion. At the time of this writing, there are no self-sustaining fusion reactors operating in the world, although small-scale controlled fusion reactions have been run for very brief periods.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant.\n\nIt should be noted that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables.

The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement of $\\pm 0.01$ gram. If the coin is weighed on a more sensitive balance, the mass might be 6.723 g . This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used\n(and the user's ability). All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant figures or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows \" 120 ,\" then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.\n\nA measurement result is properly reported when its significant digits accurately represent the certainty of the measurement process. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is significant and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require some thought. We will use the terms \"leading,\" \"trailing,\" and \"captive\" for the zeros and will consider how to deal with them.\n\n\nStarting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the left of the decimal point.\n\n\nCaptive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never significant-they merely tell us where the decimal point is located.\n\n\nThe leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation (as described in Appendix B) and express the number as $8.32407 \\times 10^{-3}$; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, and $10^{-3}$ locates the decimal point.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Using the concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at \"time zero,\" when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle's initial rate-analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction-would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes ( $t_{0}$ ). A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment-call it $t_{1}$-would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car's average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop ( $\\Delta t$ ). Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. In a plot of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at any time $t$ is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time (Figure 17.3).

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks.

The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space.

The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus.

Overall, the reaction can be formulated as\n\n\nThe reaction is an example of a polar reaction type known as an electrophilic addition reaction and can be understood using the general ideas discussed in the previous section.

We know from Section 1.8 that a carbon-carbon double bond results from the orbital overlap of two $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms.

For one thing, double\nbonds have a greater electron density than single bonds-four electrons in a double bond versus only two in a single bond. In addition, the electrons in the $\\pi$ bond are accessible to approaching reactants because they are located above and below the plane of the double bond rather than being sheltered between the nuclei (FIGURE 6.3). As a result, the double bond is nucleophilic and the chemistry of alkenes is dominated by reactions with electrophiles.\n\n\n> Carbon-carbon $\\sigma$ bond: stronger; less accessible bonding electrons\n\n\nCarbon-carbon $\\pi$ bond: weaker; more accessible electrons\n\nFIGURE 6.3 A comparison of carbon-carbon single and double bonds.

The answer is that we don't know it's correct; at least we don't know with complete certainty. Although an incorrect reaction mechanism can be disproved by demonstrating that it doesn't account for observed data, a correct reaction mechanism can never be entirely proven. The best we can do is to show that a proposed mechanism is consistent with all known facts. If enough facts are accounted for, the mechanism is probably correct.\n\nOne of the best pieces of evidence supporting the carbocation mechanism for the electrophilic addition reaction was discovered during the 1930s by F. C. Whitmore of Pennsylvania State University, who found that structural rearrangements often occur during the reaction of HX with an alkene. For example, reaction of HCl with 3 -methyl-1-butene yields a substantial amount of 2 -chloro-2-methylbutane in addition to the \"expected\" product, 2-chloro-3-methylbutane.\n\n\nIf the reaction takes place in a single step, it would be difficult to account for rearrangement, but if the reaction takes place in several steps, rearrangement is more easily explained. Whitmore suggested that it is a carbocation intermediate that undergoes rearrangement. The secondary carbocation intermediate formed by protonation of 3-methyl-1-butene rearranges to a more stable tertiary carbocation by a hydride shift-the shift of a hydrogen atom and its electron pair (a hydride ion, $: \\mathrm{H}^{-}$) between neighboring carbons.\n\n\n2-Chloro-3-methylbutane\n2-Chloro-2-methylbutane\nCarbocation rearrangements can also occur by the shift of an alkyl group with its electron pair. For example, reaction of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene with HCl leads to an equal mixture of unrearranged 3 -chloro-2,2-dimethylbutane and rearranged 2 -chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane. In this instance, a secondary carbocation rearranges to a more stable tertiary carbocation by the shift of a methyl group.",

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states. One is termed the $\\alpha$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being in the positive direction of the $z$ axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number $m_{s}=\\frac{1}{2}$. The other is called the $\\beta$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being negative and $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$.

Molecular polarity results from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule.

If these two centers don't coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.\n\nThe dipole moment, $\\mu$ (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge $Q$ at either end of the molecular dipole times the distance $r$ between the charges, $\\mu=Q \\times r$.

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long.

Why do $2,6,10,14 \\pi$ electrons lead to aromatic stability, while other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$. Any other number would leave an energy level partially filled.\n\nThe six $\\pi$ molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are shown again in FIGURE 15.6.

The next two lowest-energy orbitals, $\\psi_{2}$ and $\\psi_{3}$, are degenerate, and it therefore takes four electrons to fill both.

Energy-usually as heat-is always released and flows out of the chemical system when a bond forms. Conversely, energy is added to the chemical system when a bond breaks. Making bonds always releases energy, and breaking bonds always absorbs energy. The how question is more difficult. To answer it, we need to know more about the electronic properties of atoms.\n\nWe know through observation that eight electrons (an electron octet) in an atom's outermost shell, or valence shell, impart special stability to the noble-gas elements in group 8A of the periodic table: $\\mathrm{Ne}(2+8)$; $\\mathrm{Ar}(2+8+$ 8 ); $\\mathrm{Kr}(2+8+18+8)$. We also know that the chemistry of the main-group elements on the left and right sides of the periodic table is governed by their tendency to take on the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas. The alkali metals such as sodium in group 1A, for example, achieve a noble-gas configuration by losing the single $s$ electron from their valence shell to form a cation, while the halogens such as chlorine in group 7A achieve a noble-gas configuration by gaining a $p$ electron to fill their valence shell and form an anion.

A few guidelines involving formal charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a particular molecule or ion:\n\n1. A molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in which some formal charges are not zero.\n2. If the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the smallest nonzero formal charges is preferable.\n3. Lewis structures are preferable when adjacent formal charges are zero or of the opposite sign.\n4. When we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of formal charges, the structure with the negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms is preferable.\n\nTo see how these guidelines apply, let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

There is an $\\mathrm{O}=\\mathrm{O}$ double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Figure 5.1. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?\n\nMagnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 5.27), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Should we draw a double bond to the \"top\" oxygen and a single bond to the \"bottom\" oxygen, or vice versa?\n\n\nAlthough the two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion appear different in line-bond structures, experiments show that they are equivalent.

In other words, neither of the two structures for acetate is correct by itself. The true structure is intermediate between the two, and an electrostatic potential map shows that both oxygen atoms share the negative charge and have equal electron densities (red).\n\n\nThe two individual line-bond structures for acetate ion are called resonance forms, and their special resonance relationship is indicated by the double-headed arrow between them. The only difference between the two resonance forms is the placement of the $\\pi$ and nonbonding valence electrons. The atoms themselves occupy exactly the same place in both resonance forms, the connections between atoms are the same, and the threedimensional shapes of the resonance forms are the same.\n\nA good way to think about resonance forms is to realize that a substance like the acetate ion is the same as any other. Acetate doesn't jump back and forth between two resonance forms, spending part of the time looking like one and part of the time looking like the other. Rather, acetate has a single unchanging structure that we say is a resonance hybrid of the two individual forms and has characteristics of both. The only \"problem\" with acetate is that we can't draw it accurately using a familiar line-bond structure-line-bond structures just don't work for resonance hybrids.

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Figure 3.34. Within a period, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ generally increases with increasing $Z$. Down a group, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ value generally decreases with increasing $Z$. There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as $l$ increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the $s$ electrons are lower in energy than the $p$ electrons. This means that an $s$ electron is harder to remove from an atom than a $p$ electron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2}$ ) is an $s$ electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}$ ) is a $p$ electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring each time a new subshell begins.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.33 The first ionization energy of the elements in the first five periods are plotted against their atomic number.\n\nFirst Ionization Energies of Some Elements (kJ/mol)",

Variation in Electron Affinities - \nWe also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that the second element in the group most often has the most negative EA. This can be attributed\nto the small size of the $n=2$ shell and the resulting large electron-electron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA value of $-348 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine is $-322 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion ( $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$), we add an electron to the $n=2$ shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the $n=3$ shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily, resulting in a more negative EA.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.35 This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) for selected elements.\n\nThe properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.",

Valence bond theory is the more easily visualized of the two, so most of the descriptions we'll use in this book derive from that approach.\n\nAccording to valence bond (VB) theory, a covalent bond forms when two atoms approach each other closely and a singly occupied orbital on one atom overlaps a singly occupied orbital on the other atom. The electrons are now paired in the overlapping orbitals and are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, thus bonding the atoms together.

Having now seen the valence bond approach, which uses hybrid atomic orbitals to account for geometry and assumes the overlap of atomic orbitals to account for electron sharing, let's look briefly at the molecular orbital approach to bonding. We'll return to this topic in Chapters 14, 15, and 30 for a more in-depth discussion.\n\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes covalent bond formation as arising from a mathematical combination of atomic orbitals (wave functions) on different atoms to form molecular orbitals, so called because they belong to the entire molecule rather than to an individual atom. Just as an atomic orbital, whether unhybridized or hybridized, describes a region of space around an atom where an electron is likely to be found, so a molecular orbital describes a region of space in a molecule where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nLike an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a specific size, shape, and energy. In the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule, for example, two singly occupied $1 s$ atomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals. There are two ways for the orbital combination to occur-an additive way and a subtractive way. The additive combination leads to formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy and roughly egg-shaped, while the subtractive combination leads to a molecular orbital that is higher in energy and has a node between nuclei (FIGURE 1.18). Note that the additive combination is a single, egg-shaped, molecular orbital; it is not the same as the two overlapping 1 s atomic orbitals of the valence bond description. Similarly, the subtractive combination is a single molecular orbital with the shape of an elongated dumbbell.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.18 Molecular orbitals of $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{2}}$. Combination of two hydrogen $1 s$ atomic orbitals leads to two $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecular orbitals. The lowerenergy, bonding MO is filled, and the higher-energy, antibonding MO is unfilled.",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long.

Why do $2,6,10,14 \\pi$ electrons lead to aromatic stability, while other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$. Any other number would leave an energy level partially filled.\n\nThe six $\\pi$ molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are shown again in FIGURE 15.6.

The ionized sample molecule is called the molecular ion, $M^{+}$, and measurement of its mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by interpreting the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion. Mass-spectral fragmentations are usually complex, however, and interpretation is often difficult. In biological mass spectrometry, molecules are protonated using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the protonated molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy involves the interaction of a molecule with electromagnetic radiation. When an organic molecule is irradiated with infrared energy, certain frequencies are absorbed by the molecule. The frequencies absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular vibrations such as bond stretching and bending. Since every functional group has a characteristic combination of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal alkyne $\\equiv \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond absorbs IR radiation of $3300 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and the alkene $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ bond absorbs in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. By observing which frequencies of infrared radiation are absorbed by a molecule and which are not, it's possible to determine the functional groups a molecule contains.",

We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Group 2: The Alkaline Earth Metals - \nThe alkaline earth metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium) constitute group 2 of the periodic table. The name alkaline metal comes from the fact that the oxides of the heavier members of the group react with water to form alkaline solutions. The nuclear charge increases when going from group 1 to group 2. Because of this charge increase, the atoms of the alkaline earth metals are smaller and have higher first ionization energies than the alkali metals within the same period. The higher ionization energy makes the alkaline earth metals less reactive than the alkali metals; however, they are still very reactive elements. Their reactivity increases, as expected, with increasing size and decreasing ionization energy. In chemical reactions, these metals readily lose both valence electrons to form compounds in which they exhibit an oxidation state of $2+$. Due to their high reactivity, it is common to produce the alkaline earth metals, like the alkali metals, by\nelectrolysis. Even though the ionization energies are low, the two metals with the highest ionization energies (beryllium and magnesium) do form compounds that exhibit some covalent characters.

Answer: - \nAs for the diprotic acid examples, each successive ionization reaction is less extensive than the former, reflected in decreasing values for the stepwise acid ionization constants. This is a general characteristic of polyprotic acids and successive ionization constants often differ by a factor of about $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$.\n\nThis set of three dissociation reactions may appear to make calculations of equilibrium concentrations in a solution of $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ complicated. However, because the successive ionization constants differ by a factor of $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$, large differences exist in the small changes in concentration accompanying the ionization reactions. This allows the use of math-simplifying assumptions and processes, as demonstrated in the examples above.\n\nPolyprotic bases are capable of accepting more than one hydrogen ion. The carbonate ion is an example of a diprotic base, because it can accept two protons, as shown below. Similar to the case for polyprotic acids, note the ionization constants decrease with ionization step. Likewise, equilibrium calculations involving polyprotic bases follow the same approaches as those for polyprotic acids.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lc}\n\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)+\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}(a q) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(a q)+\\mathrm{OH}^{-}(a q) & K_{\\mathrm{b} 1}=2.1 \\times 10^{-4} \\\\\n\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)+\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(a q) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}(a q)+\\mathrm{OH}^{-}(a q) & K_{\\mathrm{b} 2}=2.3 \\times 10^{-8}\n\\end{array}\n$$",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The most common types of radioactivity are $\\alpha$ decay, $\\beta$ decay, $\\gamma$ emission, positron emission, and electron capture. Nuclear reactions also often involve $\\gamma$ rays, and some nuclei decay by electron capture. Each of these modes of decay leads to the formation of a new nucleus with a more stable n:p ratio. Some\nsubstances undergo radioactive decay series, proceeding through multiple decays before ending in a stable isotope. All nuclear decay processes follow first-order kinetics, and each radioisotope has its own characteristic half-life, the time that is required for half of its atoms to decay. Because of the large differences in stability among nuclides, there is a very wide range of half-lives of radioactive substances. Many of these substances have found useful applications in medical diagnosis and treatment, determining the age of archaeological and geological objects, and more.",

Since first-order reactions have already been covered in detail in the kinetics chapter, we will now apply those concepts to nuclear decay reactions. Each radioactive nuclide has a characteristic, constant half-life $\\left(t_{1 / 2}\\right)$, the time required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. An isotope's half-life allows us to determine how long a sample of a useful isotope will be available, and how long a sample of an undesirable or dangerous isotope must be stored before it decays to a low-enough radiation level that is no longer a problem.\n\nFor example, cobalt-60, an isotope that emits gamma rays used to treat cancer, has a half-life of 5.27 years (Figure 20.10). In a given cobalt-60 source, since half of the ${ }_{27}^{60}$ Co nuclei decay every 5.27 years, both the amount of material and the intensity of the radiation emitted is cut in half every 5.27 years. (Note that for a given substance, the intensity of radiation that it produces is directly proportional to the rate of decay of the substance and the amount of the substance.) This is as expected for a process following first-order kinetics. Thus, a cobalt-60 source that is used for cancer treatment must be replaced regularly to continue to be effective.\n\n\nFIGURE 20.10 For cobalt-60, which has a half-life of 5.27 years, $50 \\%$ remains after 5.27 years (one half-life), 25\\% remains after 10.54 years (two half-lives), $12.5 \\%$ remains after 15.81 years (three half-lives), and so on.",

The n:p ratio increases, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide.\n\nElectron capture occurs when one of the inner electrons in an atom is captured by the atom's nucleus.

The loss of an inner shell electron leaves a vacancy that will be filled by one of the outer electrons. As the outer electron drops into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an X-ray. Like positron emission, electron capture occurs for \"proton-rich\" nuclei that lie below the band of stability. Electron capture has the same effect on the nucleus as does positron emission: The atomic number is decreased by one and the mass number does not change. This increases the n:p ratio, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Whether electron capture or positron emission occurs is difficult to predict. The choice is primarily due to kinetic factors, with the one requiring the smaller activation energy being the one more likely to occur.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Its effects are more pronounced in cells that reproduce rapidly, such as the stomach lining, hair follicles, bone marrow, and embryos. This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.\n\nDifferent types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 20.33). A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding. The ability of various kinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and some particles have almost no tendency to produce ionization. Alpha particles have about twice the ionizing power of fast-moving neutrons, about 10 times that of $\\beta$ particles, and about 20 times that of $\\gamma$ rays and X-rays.\n\n\nFIGURE 20.33 The ability of different types of radiation to pass through material is shown.

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed.

Ionizing radiation is the most harmful because it can ionize molecules or break chemical bonds, which damages the molecule and causes malfunctions in cell processes. It can also create reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage biological molecules and disrupt physiological processes. Radiation can cause somatic or genetic damage, and is most harmful to\nrapidly reproducing cells. Types of radiation differ in their ability to penetrate material and damage tissue, with alpha particles the least penetrating but potentially most damaging and gamma rays the most penetrating.\n\nVarious devices, including Geiger counters, scintillators, and dosimeters, are used to detect and measure radiation, and monitor radiation exposure. We use several units to measure radiation: becquerels or curies for rates of radioactive decay; gray or rads for energy absorbed; and rems or sieverts for biological effects of radiation. Exposure to radiation can cause a wide range of health effects, from minor to severe, and including death. We can minimize the effects of radiation by shielding with dense materials such as lead, moving away from the source, and limiting time of exposure.",

Over 10 million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed annually in the United States.

Damaged tissues in the heart, liver, and lungs absorb certain compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. After it is injected, the location of the technetium compound, and hence the damaged tissue, can be determined by detecting the $\\gamma$ rays emitted by the Tc-99 isotope. Thallium-201 (Figure 20.24) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two isotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study heart tissue. Iodine-131 concentrates in the thyroid gland, the liver, and some parts of the brain. It can therefore be used to monitor goiter and treat thyroid conditions, such as Grave's disease, as well as liver and brain tumors. Salt solutions containing compounds of sodium-24 are injected into the bloodstream to help locate obstructions to the flow of blood.\n\n\nFIGURE 20.24 Administering thallium-201 to a patient and subsequently performing a stress test offer medical professionals an opportunity to visually analyze heart function and blood flow.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and \"see\" its structure with your eyes?\n\nDetermining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy-you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Properties of the Transition Elements - \nFIGURE 19.4 Transition metals of the first transition series can form compounds with varying oxidation states.\nFor the elements scandium through manganese (the first half of the first transition series), the highest oxidation state corresponds to the loss of all of the electrons in both the $s$ and $d$ orbitals of their valence shells. The titanium(IV) ion, for example, is formed when the titanium atom loses its two $3 d$ and two $4 s$ electrons. These highest oxidation states are the most stable forms of scandium, titanium, and vanadium. However, it is not possible to continue to remove all of the valence electrons from metals as we continue through the series. Iron is known to form oxidation states from $2+$ to $6+$, with iron(II) and iron(III) being the most common. Most of the elements of the first transition series form ions with a charge of $2+$ or $3+$ that are stable in water, although those of the early members of the series can be readily oxidized by air.\n\nThe elements of the second and third transition series generally are more stable in higher oxidation states than are the elements of the first series. In general, the atomic radius increases down a group, which leads to the ions of the second and third series being larger than are those in the first series. Removing electrons from orbitals that are located farther from the nucleus is easier than removing electrons close to the nucleus.

The EA of some of the elements is given in Figure 3.35. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a -2 ion, and so on.\n\nAs we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 ( 5 A ), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher $n$ level, which is more difficult to do. Group $2(2 \\mathrm{~A})$ has a filled $n s$ subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy $n p$, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds\nTransition metals are defined as those elements that have (or readily form) partially filled $d$ orbitals. As shown in Figure 19.2, the $\\boldsymbol{d}$-block elements in groups 3-11 are transition elements. The $\\boldsymbol{f}$-block elements, also called inner transition metals (the lanthanides and actinides), also meet this criterion because the $d$ orbital is partially occupied before the $f$ orbitals. The $d$ orbitals fill with the copper family (group 11); for this reason, the\nnext family (group 12) are technically not transition elements. However, the group 12 elements do display some of the same chemical properties and are commonly included in discussions of transition metals. Some chemists do treat the group 12 elements as transition metals.\n\n\nFIGURE 19.2 The transition metals are located in groups 3-11 of the periodic table. The inner transition metals are in the two rows below the body of the table.\n\nThe $d$-block elements are divided into the first transition series (the elements Sc through Cu ), the second transition series (the elements Y through Ag), and the third transition series (the element La and the elements Hf through Au). Actinium, Ac, is the first member of the fourth transition series, which also includes Rf through Rg.\n\nThe $f$-block elements are the elements Ce through Lu, which constitute the lanthanide series (or lanthanoid series), and the elements Th through Lr, which constitute the actinide series (or actinoid series). Because lanthanum behaves very much like the lanthanide elements, it is considered a lanthanide element, even though its electron configuration makes it the first member of the third transition series. Similarly, the behavior of actinium means it is part of the actinide series, although its electron configuration makes it the first member of the fourth transition series.",

As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a onedimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 3.7 shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen in Figure 3.7. The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths $n$. Since the number of nodes is $n-1$, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves.

Converting one mole of fluorine atoms into fluoride ions is an exothermic process, so this step gives off energy (the electron affinity) and is shown as decreasing along the $y$-axis.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

A more substituted carbocation forms faster than a less substituted one and, once formed, rapidly goes on to give the final product.\n- A more substituted carbocation is more stable than a less substituted one. That is, the stability order of carbocations is tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl.\n\nWhat we have not yet seen is how these two points are related. Why does the stability of the carbocation intermediate affect the rate at which it's formed and thereby determine the structure of the final product? After all, carbocation stability is determined by the free-energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, but reaction rate is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$. The two quantities aren’t directly related.\n\nAlthough there is no simple quantitative relationship between the stability of a carbocation intermediate and the rate of its formation, there is an intuitive relationship. It's generally true when comparing two similar reactions that the more stable intermediate forms faster than the less stable one. The situation is shown graphically in FIGURE 7.14, where the energy profile in part (a) represents the typical situation, as opposed to the profile in part (b). That is, the curves for two similar reactions don't cross one another.\n\n\nFIGURE 7.14 Energy diagrams for two similar competing reactions. In (a), the faster reaction yields the more stable intermediate. In (b), the slower reaction yields the more stable intermediate. The curves shown in (a) represent the typical situation.\n\nCalled the Hammond postulate, the explanation of the relationship between reaction rate and intermediate stability goes like this: Transition states represent energy maxima. They are high-energy activated complexes that occur transiently during the course of a reaction and immediately go on to a more stable species. Although we can't actually observe transition states because they have no finite lifetime, the Hammond postulate says that we can get an idea of a particular transition state's structure by looking at the structure of the nearest stable species. Imagine the two cases shown in FIGURE 7.15, for example. The reaction profile in part (a) shows the energy curve for an endergonic reaction step, and the profile in part (b) shows the curve for an exergonic step.",

The Kinetic-Molecular Theory\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\n- State the postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory\n- Use this theory's postulates to explain the gas laws\n\nThe gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm . Although the gas laws describe relationships that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these relationships.\n\nThe kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term \"molecule\" will be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)\n\n1. Gases are composed of molecules that are in continuous motion, travelling in straight lines and changing direction only when they collide with other molecules or with the walls of a container.\n2. The molecules composing the gas are negligibly small compared to the distances between them.\n3. The pressure exerted by a gas in a container results from collisions between the gas molecules and the container walls.\n4. Gas molecules exert no attractive or repulsive forces on each other or the container walls; therefore, their collisions are elastic (do not involve a loss of energy).\n5. The average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is proportional to the kelvin temperature of the gas.\n\nThe test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT, which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately represent the properties of gas molecules.

We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride.

As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.\n\nSubstances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy ( $\\boldsymbol{U}$ ), sometimes symbolized as $E$.\n\nAs a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat $(q)$ from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work ( $w$ ) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire's temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.\n\nThe relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U=q+w\n$$",

According to frontier orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.\n\nLet's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal cyclization of $2,4,6$-octatriene. The $2 E, 4 Z, 6 E$ isomer yields cis product; the $2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z$ isomer yields trans product (FIGURE 30.6).\n\n\nIn the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts conrotatory ring-closure. In practice, however, the conjugated diene reaction can be observed only in the reverse direction (cyclobutene $\\rightarrow$ diene) because of the position of the equilibrium. We therefore find that the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene ring opens in a conrotatory fashion. cis-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 Z$ )-2,4-hexadiene, and trans-3,4-dimethylcyclobutene yields ( $2 E, 4 E$ )-2,4-hexadiene by conrotatory opening (FIGURE 30.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 30.7 Thermal ring-openings of cis- and trans-dimethylcyclobutene occur by conrotatory paths.",

In the following description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion. Note that we will use the popular phrase \"intermolecular attraction\" to refer to attractive forces between the particles of a substance, regardless of whether these particles are molecules, atoms, or ions.\n\nConsider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and gaseous matter:\n\n- Particles in a solid are tightly packed together and often arranged in a regular pattern; in a liquid, they are close together with no regular arrangement; in a gas, they are far apart with no regular arrangement.\n- Particles in a solid vibrate about fixed positions and do not generally move in relation to one another; in a liquid, they move past each other but remain in essentially constant contact; in a gas, they move independently of one another except when they collide.\n\nThe differences in the properties of a solid, liquid, or gas reflect the strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make up each phase. The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative extents of its intermolecular forces (IMFs) and the kinetic energies (KE) of its molecules. IMFs are the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module. These forces serve to hold particles close together, whereas the particles' KE provides the energy required to overcome the attractive forces and thus increase the distance between particles. Figure 10.2 illustrates how changes in physical state may be induced by changing the temperature, hence, the average KE , of a given substance.",

Because the leaving group is expelled with a negative charge in most $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions, the best leaving groups are those that best stabilize the negative charge in the transition state. The greater the extent of charge stabilization by the leaving group, the lower the energy of the transition state and the more rapid the reaction. But as we saw in Section 2.8 , the groups that best stabilize a negative charge are also the weakest bases. Thus, weak bases such as $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \\mathrm{Br}^{-}$, and tosylate ion make good leaving groups, while strong bases such as $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}{ }^{-}$make poor leaving groups.\n\n\nIt's just as important to know which are poor leaving groups as to know which are good, and the preceding data clearly indicate that $\\mathrm{F}^{-}, \\mathrm{HO}^{-}, \\mathrm{RO}^{-}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~N}^{-}$are not displaced by nucleophiles.

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

If the rate at which sunbathers enter the surf were to equal the rate at which swimmers return to the sand, then the numbers (though not the identities) of sunbathers and swimmers would remain constant. This scenario illustrates a dynamic phenomenon known as equilibrium, in which opposing processes occur at equal rates. Chemical and physical processes are subject to this phenomenon; these processes are at equilibrium when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. Equilibrium systems are pervasive in nature; the various reactions involving carbon dioxide dissolved in blood are examples (see Figure 13.1). This chapter provides a thorough introduction to the essential aspects of chemical equilibria.\n\nWe now have a good understanding of chemical and physical change that allow us to determine, for any given process:\n\n1. Whether the process is endothermic or exothermic\n2. Whether the process is accompanied by an increase of decrease in entropy\n3. Whether a process will be spontaneous, non-spontaneous, or what we have called an equilibrium process\n\nRecall that when the value $\\Delta G$ for a reaction is zero, we consider there to be no free energy change-that is, no\nfree energy available to do useful work. Does this mean a reaction where $\\Delta G=0$ comes to a complete halt? No, it does not. Just as a liquid exists in equilibrium with its vapor in a closed container, where the rates of evaporation and condensation are equal, there is a connection to the state of equilibrium for a phase change or a chemical reaction. That is, at equilibrium, the forward and reverse rates of reaction are equal. We will develop that concept and extend it to a relationship between equilibrium and free energy later in this chapter.\n\nIn the explanation that follows, we will use the term $Q$ to refer to any reactant or product concentration or pressure. When the concentrations or pressure of reactants and products are at equilibrium, the term $K$ will be used. This will be more clearly explained as we go along in this chapter.",

The carbocation is clearly different from the reactants, yet it isn't a transition state and it isn't a final product.\n\n\nWe call the carbocation, which exists only transiently during the course of the multistep reaction, a reaction intermediate. As soon as the intermediate is formed in the first step by reaction of ethylene with $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, it reacts further with $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$in a second step to give the final product, bromoethane. This second step has its own activation energy $\\left(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}\\right)$, its own transition state, and its own energy change ( $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ ). We can picture the second transition state as an activated complex between the electrophilic carbocation intermediate and the nucleophilic bromide anion, in which $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$donates a pair of electrons to the positively charged carbon atom as the new $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Br}$ bond just starts to form.\n\nA complete energy diagram for the overall reaction of ethylene with HBr is shown in FIGURE 6.8. In essence, we draw a diagram for each of the individual steps and then join them so that the carbocation product of step 1 is the reactant for step 2. As indicated in FIGURE 6.8, the reaction intermediate lies at an energy minimum between steps. Because the energy level of the intermediate is higher than the level of either the reactant that formed it or the product it yields, the intermediate can't normally be isolated. It is, however, more stable than its two neighboring transition states.",

The why question is relatively easy to answer: atoms bond together because the compound that results is more stable and lower in energy than the separate atoms. Energy-usually as heat-is always released and flows out of the chemical system when a bond forms. Conversely, energy is added to the chemical system when a bond breaks. Making bonds always releases energy, and breaking bonds always absorbs energy. The how question is more difficult. To answer it, we need to know more about the electronic properties of atoms.\n\nWe know through observation that eight electrons (an electron octet) in an atom's outermost shell, or valence shell, impart special stability to the noble-gas elements in group 8A of the periodic table: $\\mathrm{Ne}(2+8)$; $\\mathrm{Ar}(2+8+$ 8 ); $\\mathrm{Kr}(2+8+18+8)$. We also know that the chemistry of the main-group elements on the left and right sides of the periodic table is governed by their tendency to take on the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas. The alkali metals such as sodium in group 1A, for example, achieve a noble-gas configuration by losing the single $s$ electron from their valence shell to form a cation, while the halogens such as chlorine in group 7A achieve a noble-gas configuration by gaining a $p$ electron to fill their valence shell and form an anion. The resultant ions are held together in compounds like $\\mathrm{Na}^{+} \\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$by the electrical attraction of unlike charges that we call an ionic bond.",

As shown by a large number of experiments, E2 reactions occur with periplanar geometry, meaning that all four reacting atoms-the hydrogen, the two carbons, and the leaving group-lie in the same plane. Two such geometries are possible: syn periplanar geometry, in which the H and the X are on the same side of the molecule, and anti periplanar geometry, in which the H and the X are on opposite sides of the molecule. Of the two, anti periplanar geometry is energetically preferred because it allows the substituents on the two carbons to adopt a staggered relationship, whereas syn geometry requires that the substituents be eclipsed.\n\n\nAnti periplanar geometry (staggered, lower energy)\n\n\n\n\nSyn periplanar geometry\n(eclipsed, higher energy)\nWhat's so special about periplanar geometry? Because the $s p^{3} \\sigma$ orbitals in the reactant $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}$ bonds must overlap and become $p \\pi$ orbitals in the alkene product, there must also be some overlap in the transition state.

Water can be broken down\ninto hydrogen and oxygen gases by the addition of energy. One way to do this is with a battery or power supply, as shown in (Figure 1.15).\n\n\nFIGURE 1.15 The decomposition of water is shown at the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic levels. The battery provides an electric current (microscopic) that decomposes water. At the macroscopic level, the liquid separates into the gases hydrogen (on the left) and oxygen (on the right). Symbolically, this change is presented by showing how liquid $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ separates into $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gases.\n\nThe breakdown of water involves a rearrangement of the atoms in water molecules into different molecules, each composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, respectively. Two water molecules form one oxygen molecule and two hydrogen molecules. The representation for what occurs, $2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)$, will be explored in more depth in later chapters.\n\nThe two gases produced have distinctly different properties. Oxygen is not flammable but is required for combustion of a fuel, and hydrogen is highly flammable and a potent energy source. How might this knowledge be applied in our world? One application involves research into more fuel-efficient transportation. Fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) run on hydrogen instead of gasoline (Figure 1.16). They are more efficient than vehicles with internal combustion engines, are nonpolluting, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making us less dependent on fossil fuels. FCVs are not yet economically viable, however, and current hydrogen production depends on natural gas. If we can develop a process to economically decompose water, or produce hydrogen in another environmentally sound way, FCVs may be the way of the future.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.16 A fuel cell generates electrical energy from hydrogen and oxygen via an electrochemical process and produces only water as the waste product.",

However, we do find exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27. For instance, the electron configurations (shown in Figure 3.29) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper ( Cu ; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling.\n\nIn the case of Cr and Cu , we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the $4 s$ into the $3 d$ orbital to gain the extra stability of a half-filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cr ) or a filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cu ). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium ( Nb , atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{2} 4 d^{3}$. Experimentally, we observe that its ground-state electron configuration is actually $[\\mathrm{Kr}] 5 s^{1} 4 d^{4}$. We can rationalize this observation by saying that the electron-electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the $5 s$ orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the $5 s$ and $4 d$ orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe structure and properties of nonmetals\n\nThe nonmetals are elements located in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Their properties and behavior are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of the nonmetals are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The nonmetals exhibit a rich variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of elements, and they form many different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of the properties and chemical behaviors of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of these nonmetals are important in biological systems.\n\nIn many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in compounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given group and increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher electronegativities than do metals, and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic in nature because of the large differences in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the nonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand, compounds formed between two or more nonmetals have small differences in electronegativity between the atoms, and covalent bonding-sharing of electrons-results. These substances tend to be molecular in nature and are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure.\n\nIn normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their ionization energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion, $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the nitride ion, $\\mathrm{N}^{3-}$, and the selenide ion, $\\mathrm{Se}^{2-}$.",

(Technically, fissile material can undergo fission with neutrons of any energy, whereas fissionable material requires high-energy neutrons.) Nuclear fission becomes self-sustaining when the number of neutrons produced by fission equals or exceeds the number of neutrons absorbed by splitting nuclei plus the number that escape into the surroundings. The amount of a fissionable material that will support a self-sustaining chain reaction is a critical mass. An amount of fissionable material that cannot sustain a chain reaction is a subcritical mass. An amount of material in which there is an increasing rate of fission is known as a supercritical mass. The critical mass depends on the type of material: its purity, the temperature, the shape of the sample, and how the neutron reactions are controlled (Figure 20.17).\n\nSub-critical mass\n\n(a)\n\nCritical mass\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 20.17 (a) In a subcritical mass, the fissile material is too small and allows too many neutrons to escape the material, so a chain reaction does not occur.

When fissionable material is in small pieces, the proportion of neutrons that escape through the relatively large surface area is great, and a chain reaction does not take place. When the small pieces of fissionable material are brought together quickly to form a body with a mass larger than the critical mass, the relative number of escaping neutrons decreases, and a chain reaction and explosion result.",

As discussed previously, the plutonium forms from the combination of neutrons and the uranium in the fuel. In any nuclear reactor, only about $0.1 \\%$ of the mass of the fuel is converted into energy. The other $99.9 \\%$ remains in the fuel rods as fission products and unused fuel. All of the fission products absorb neutrons, and after a period of several months to a few years, depending on the reactor, the fission products must be removed by changing the fuel rods. Otherwise, the concentration of these fission products would increase and absorb more neutrons until the reactor could no longer operate.\n\nSpent fuel rods contain a variety of products, consisting of unstable nuclei ranging in atomic number from 25 to 60 , some transuranium elements, including plutonium and americium, and unreacted uranium isotopes. The unstable nuclei and the transuranium isotopes give the spent fuel a dangerously high level of radioactivity. The long-lived isotopes require thousands of years to decay to a safe level. The ultimate fate of the nuclear reactor as a significant source of energy in the United States probably rests on whether or not a politically and scientifically satisfactory technique for processing and storing the components of spent fuel rods can be developed.",

Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is known as the band of stability (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in Figure 20.2 represents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons ( $\\mathrm{n}: \\mathrm{p}$ ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead- 207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52.

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom.

Any nuclear reactor that produces power via the fission of uranium or plutonium by bombardment with neutrons must have at least five components: nuclear fuel consisting of fissionable material, a nuclear moderator, reactor coolant, control rods, and a shield and containment system. We will discuss these components in greater detail later in the section. The reactor works by separating the fissionable nuclear material such that a critical mass cannot be formed, controlling both the flux and absorption of neutrons to allow shutting down the fission reactions. In a nuclear reactor used for the production of electricity, the energy released by fission reactions is trapped as thermal energy and used to boil water and produce steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which powers a generator for the production of electricity.\n\n\nFIGURE 20.19 (a) The Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant near San Luis Obispo is the only nuclear power plant currently in operation in California.

(b) The Diablo Canyon uses a pressurized water reactor, one of a few different fission reactor designs in use around the world, to produce electricity. Energy from the nuclear fission reactions in the core heats water in a closed, pressurized system. Heat from this system produces steam that drives a turbine, which in turn produces electricity.

This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

The solid line is the line where $\\mathrm{n}=\\mathrm{Z}$.\n\nThe nuclei that are to the left or to the right of the band of stability are unstable and exhibit radioactivity. They change spontaneously (decay) into other nuclei that are either in, or closer to, the band of stability. These nuclear decay reactions convert one unstable isotope (or radioisotope) into another, more stable, isotope. We will discuss the nature and products of this radioactive decay in subsequent sections of this chapter.\n\nSeveral observations may be made regarding the relationship between the stability of a nucleus and its structure. Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable (see Table 20.1). Nuclei with certain numbers of nucleons, known as magic numbers, are stable against nuclear decay. These numbers of protons or neutrons $(2,8,20,28,50,82$, and 126 ) make complete shells in the nucleus. These are similar in concept to the stable electron shells observed for the noble gases.

These trends in nuclear stability may be rationalized by considering a quantum mechanical model of nuclear energy states analogous to that used to describe electronic states earlier in this textbook. The details of this model are beyond the scope of this chapter.\n\nStable Nuclear Isotopes\n\n| Number of Stable Isotopes | Proton Number | Neutron Number |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 157 | even | even |\n| 53 | even | odd |\n| 50 | odd | even |\n| 5 | odd | odd |\n\nTABLE 20.1",

Because the neutrons may induce additional fission reactions when they combine with other heavy nuclei, a chain reaction can result. Useful power is obtained if the fission process is carried out in a nuclear reactor. The conversion of light nuclei into heavier nuclei (fusion) also produces energy.

The chapter on atoms, molecules, and ions introduced the basic idea of nuclear structure, that the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons and, with the exception of ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$, neutrons. Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the mass number (A). Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same element. When referring to a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the notation ${ }_{Z}^{A} \\mathrm{X}$, where X is the symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for example, ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ ). Often a nuclide is referenced by the name of the element followed by a hyphen and the mass number. For example, ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is called \"carbon-14.\"",

Nuclear Fission - \nMany heavier elements with smaller binding energies per nucleon can decompose into more stable elements that have intermediate mass numbers and larger binding energies per nucleon-that is, mass numbers and binding energies per nucleon that are closer to the \"peak\" of the binding energy graph near 56 (see Figure 20.3). Sometimes neutrons are also produced. This decomposition is called fission, the breaking of a large nucleus into smaller pieces. The breaking is rather random with the formation of a large number of different products. Fission usually does not occur naturally, but is induced by bombardment with neutrons. The first reported nuclear fission occurred in 1939 when three German scientists, Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassman, bombarded uranium-235 atoms with slow-moving neutrons that split the U-238 nuclei into smaller fragments that consisted of several neutrons and elements near the middle of the periodic table. Since then, fission has been observed in many other isotopes, including most actinide isotopes that have an odd number of neutrons. A typical nuclear fission reaction is shown in Figure 20.14.\n\n\nFIGURE 20.14 When a slow neutron hits a fissionable U-235 nucleus, it is absorbed and forms an unstable U-236 nucleus. The U-236 nucleus then rapidly breaks apart into two smaller nuclei (in this case, Ba-141 and Kr-92) along with several neutrons (usually two or three), and releases a very large amount of energy.\n\nAmong the products of Meitner, Hahn, and Strassman's fission reaction were barium, krypton, lanthanum, and cerium, all of which have nuclei that are more stable than uranium-235. Since then, hundreds of different isotopes have been observed among the products of fissionable substances. A few of the many reactions that occur for $\\mathrm{U}-235$, and a graph showing the distribution of its fission products and their yields, are shown in Figure 20.15. Similar fission reactions have been observed with other uranium isotopes, as well as with a variety of other isotopes such as those of plutonium.",

Its effects are more pronounced in cells that reproduce rapidly, such as the stomach lining, hair follicles, bone marrow, and embryos. This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.\n\nDifferent types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 20.33). A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding. The ability of various kinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and some particles have almost no tendency to produce ionization.

The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThe next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively charged alpha particles ( $\\alpha$ particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of radium; $\\alpha$ particles consist of two protons and two neutrons (you will learn more about radioactive decay in the chapter on nuclear chemistry). Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a beam of $\\alpha$ particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering of the $\\alpha$ particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an $\\alpha$ particle.\nWhat did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source (Figure 2.9). Rutherford described finding these results: \"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you., ${ }^{\\underline{1}}$\n\n\nFIGURE 2.9 Geiger and Rutherford fired $\\alpha$ particles at a piece of gold foil and detected where those particles went, as shown in this schematic diagram of their experiment. Most of the particles passed straight through the foil, but a few were deflected slightly and a very small number were significantly deflected.\n\nHere is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving $\\alpha$ particles passed through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like charges repel one another, the few positively charged $\\alpha$ particles that changed paths abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil.

During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a \"new element\" produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the English chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopes-atoms of the same element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery.\n\nOne puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found evidence of neutrons, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The existence of the neutron also explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of\nneutrons, but they are chemically identical because they have the same number of protons.

In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave.

The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next.

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and \"see\" its structure with your eyes?\n\nDetermining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy-you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

It is \"ideal\" in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed\nwith a spectrometer so that the wavelengths and their intensities can be measured.

This lack of resistance means that there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity. This would lead to a significant reduction in the cost of electricity.\n\nMost currently used, commercial superconducting materials, such as NbTi and $\\mathrm{Nb}_{3} \\mathrm{Sn}$, do not become superconducting until they are cooled below $23 \\mathrm{~K}\\left(-250^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. This requires the use of liquid helium, which has a boiling temperature of 4 K and is expensive and difficult to handle. The cost of liquid helium has deterred the widespread application of superconductors.\n\nOne of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 1980s was the characterization of compounds that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above 90 K . (Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.) Typical among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of several rare earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio. The formula of the ionic yttrium compound is $\\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \\mathrm{Cu}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{7}$.\n\nThe new materials become superconducting at temperatures close to 90 K (Figure 19.10), temperatures that can be reached by cooling with liquid nitrogen (boiling temperature of 77 K ). Not only are liquid nitrogencooled materials easier to handle, but the cooling costs are also about 1000 times lower than for liquid helium.\n\nFurther advances during the same period included materials that became superconducting at even higher temperatures and with a wider array of materials. The DuPont team led by Uma Chowdry and Arthur Sleight identified Bismouth-Strontium-Copper-Oxides that became superconducting at temperatures as high as 110 K and, importantly, did not contain rare earth elements. Advances continued through the subsequent decades until, in 2020, a team led by Ranga Dias at University of Rochester announced the development of a roomtemperature superconductor, opening doors to widespread applications. More research and development is needed to realize the potential of these materials, but the possibilities are very promising.",

Heating and Cooling Curves - \nIn the chapter on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance, $q$, and its accompanying temperature change, $\\Delta T$, was introduced:\n\n$$\nq=m c \\Delta T\n$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the substance and $c$ is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled, but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a change in state, its temperature remains constant. Figure 10.29 shows a typical heating curve.\n\nConsider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the water's temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state is in progress.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.29 A typical heating curve for a substance depicts changes in temperature that result as the substance absorbs increasing amounts of heat.

Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature.

At room temperature, for example, the reaction is so slow that if we prepared a mixture of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, no detectable amount of ammonia would form during our lifetime.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Dispersal of Matter and Energy - \nExtending the discussion of thermodynamic concepts toward the objective of predicting spontaneity, consider now an isolated system consisting of two flasks connected with a closed valve.

Instead, the driving force appears to be related to the greater, more uniform dispersal of matter that results when the gas is allowed to expand. Initially, the system was comprised of one flask containing matter and another flask containing nothing. After the spontaneous expansion took place, the matter was distributed both more widely (occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each flask).\n\n\nFIGURE 12.4 An isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a\nsecond flask containing a vacuum.

In each case, an unsymmetrically substituted alkene has given a single addition product rather than the mixture that might be expected. For example, 2-methylpropene might react with HCl to give both 2-chloro-2-methylpropane and 1-chloro-2-methylpropane, but it doesn't. It gives only 2-chloro-2-methylpropane as the sole product. Similarly, it's invariably the case in biological alkene addition reactions that only a single product is formed. We say that such reactions are regiospecific (ree-jee-oh-specific) when only one of two possible orientations of an addition occurs.\n\n\nAfter looking at the results of many such reactions, the Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov proposed in 1869 what has become known as:\n\nMarkovnikov's rule\nIn the addition of HX to an alkene, the H attaches to the carbon with fewer alkyl substituents and the X\nattaches to the carbon with more alkyl substituents.\n\n\n\n1-Methylcyclohexene\n1-Bromo-1-methylcyclohexane\nWhen both double-bonded carbon atoms have the same degree of substitution, a mixture of addition products results.\n\n\nBecause carbocations are involved as intermediates in these electrophilic addition reactions, Markovnikov's rule can be restated in the following way:\n\nMarkovnikov's rule restated\nIn the addition of HX to an alkene, the more highly substituted carbocation is formed as the intermediate rather than the less highly substituted one.\n\nFor example, addition of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$to 2-methylpropene yields the intermediate tertiary carbocation rather than the alternative primary carbocation, and addition to 1-methylcyclohexene yields a tertiary cation rather than a secondary one.

In the E 2 reaction, $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}$ bondbreaking occur simultaneously when a base abstracts $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$from one carbon while the leaving group departs from the neighboring carbon. The reaction takes place preferentially through an anti periplanar transition state in which the four reacting atoms-hydrogen, two carbons, and leaving group-are in the same plane. The reaction shows second-order kinetics and a deuterium isotope effect, and occurs when a secondary or tertiary substrate is treated with a strong base. These elimination reactions usually give a mixture of alkene products in which the more highly substituted alkene predominates (Zaitsev's rule).\n\nIn the E1 reaction, $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}$ bond-breaking occurs first.

Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the mass spectrum of the compound (see discussion of this technique in a previous chapter on atoms and molecules). Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text.\n\nMolecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound's molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula. If the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance is known, it may be divided by the empirical formula mass to yield the number of empirical formula units per molecule (n):\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text { molecular or molar mass }\\left(\\mathrm{amu} \\text { or } \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{~mol}}\\right)}{\\text { empirical formula mass }\\left(\\mathrm{amu} \\text { or } \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{~mol}}\\right)}=n \\text { formula units/molecule }\n$$\n\nThe molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by $n$, as shown by the generic empirical formula $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{x}} \\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{y}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\left(A_{x} B_{y}\\right)_{n}=A_{n x} B_{n y}\n$$\n\nFor example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$. The empirical formula mass for this compound is approximately 30 amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H atoms, and 16 amu for one 0 atom). If the compound's molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu , this indicates that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical formula:",

For example, the hydrogen molecule, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 4.4 illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the $x$-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the $x$-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n\n\nFIGURE 4.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond.

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron ( $n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ ). The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins).

In other words, the value of the wavefunction $\\psi$ is zero at this distance for this orbital. Such a value of radius $r$ is called a radial node. The number of radial nodes in an orbital is $n-1-1$.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.20 The graphs show the probability ( $y$ axis) of finding an electron for the $1 s, 2 s, 3 s$ orbitals as a function of distance from the nucleus.\n\nConsider the examples in Figure 3.20. The orbitals depicted are of the $s$ type, thus $l=0$ for all of them. It can be seen from the graphs of the probability densities that there are $1-0-1=0$ places where the density is zero (nodes) for $1 s(n=1), 2-0-1=1$ node for $2 s$, and $3-0-1=2$ nodes for the $3 s$ orbitals.\n\nThe $s$ subshell electron density distribution is spherical and the $p$ subshell has a dumbbell shape. The $d$ and $\\boldsymbol{f}$ orbitals are more complex. These shapes represent the three-dimensional regions within which the electron is likely to be found.",

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.

X-Ray Crystallography - \nThe size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining waves' maxima are separated (see Figure 10.63).\n\n\nConstructive interface\n(a)\n\n\nDestructive interface\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 10.63 Light waves occupying the same space experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b) intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and minima.\n\nWhen X-rays of a certain wavelength, $\\lambda$, are scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, $d$, they may undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, $n$, of the wavelength.

H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. Figure 10.64 illustrates two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive interference.",

If in doubt, though, the equivalence or nonequivalence of two protons can be determined by comparing the structures that would be formed if each hydrogen were replaced by an X group. There are four possibilities.\n\n- One possibility is that the protons are chemically unrelated and thus nonequivalent. If so, the products formed on substitution of H by X would be different constitutional isomers. In butane, for instance, the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons are different from the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ - protons.

In butane, for instance, the six $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ hydrogens on C 1 and C 4 are identical, would give the identical structure on substitution by X , and would show an identical NMR absorption.

Crystal Field Theory - \nIn an uncomplexed metal ion in the gas phase, the electrons are distributed among the five $d$ orbitals in accord with Hund's rule because the orbitals all have the same energy. However, when ligands coordinate to a metal ion, the energies of the $d$ orbitals are no longer the same.\nIn octahedral complexes, the lobes in two of the five $d$ orbitals, the $d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, point toward the ligands (Figure 19.33). These two orbitals are called the $\\boldsymbol{e}_{g}$ orbitals (the symbol actually refers to the symmetry of the orbitals, but we will use it as a convenient name for these two orbitals in an octahedral complex). The other three orbitals, the $d_{x y}, d_{x z}$, and $d_{y z}$ orbitals, have lobes that point between the ligands and are called the $\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\mathbf{2 g}}$ orbitals (again, the symbol really refers to the symmetry of the orbitals). As six ligands approach the metal ion along the axes of the octahedron, their point charges repel the electrons in the $d$ orbitals of the metal ion. However, the repulsions between the electrons in the $e_{g}$ orbitals (the $d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals) and the ligands are greater than the repulsions between the electrons in the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals (the $d_{z y}, d_{x z}$, and $d_{y z}$ orbitals) and the ligands. This is because the lobes of the $e_{g}$ orbitals point directly at the ligands, whereas the lobes of the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals point between them. Thus, electrons in the $e_{g}$ orbitals of the metal ion in an octahedral complex have higher potential energies than those of electrons in the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals. The difference in energy may be represented as shown in Figure 19.34.",

The Third Law of Thermodynamics - \nThe previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K ). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal ( $W=1$ ). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero.\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W=k \\ln (1)=0\n$$\n\nThis limiting condition for a system's entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.\n\nCareful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance's entropy and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions. Standard entropies ( $\\boldsymbol{S}^{\\circ}$ ) are for one mole of substance under standard conditions (a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 298.15 K ; see details regarding standard conditions in the thermochemistry chapter of this text).

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the mass number (A). Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same element. When referring to a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the notation ${ }_{Z}^{A} \\mathrm{X}$, where X is the symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for example, ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ ).

After the spontaneous expansion took place, the matter was distributed both more widely (occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each flask).\n\n\nFIGURE 12.4 An isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a\nsecond flask containing a vacuum.

One way we measure a change in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. The liquid in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature changes, and the position of the trapped liquid's surface along a printed scale may be used as a measure of temperature.\n\nTemperature scales are defined relative to selected reference temperatures: Two of the most commonly used are the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 ${ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is defined as the freezing temperature of water and $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is defined as $32^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ and the boiling temperature as $212^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$. The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).\n\nDefining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another ( $\\mathrm{y}=\\mathrm{mx}$ ). Using familiar length units as one example:\n\n$$\n\\text { length in feet }=\\left(\\frac{1 \\mathrm{ft}}{12 \\mathrm{in} .}\\right) \\times \\text { length in inches }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{y}=$ length in feet, $\\mathrm{x}=$ length in inches, and the proportionality constant, m , is the conversion factor. The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, however, do not share a common zero point, and so the relationship between these two scales is a linear one rather than a proportional one ( $y=m x+b$ ). Consequently, converting a temperature from one of these scales into the other requires more than simple multiplication by a conversion factor, $m$, it also must take into account differences in the scales' zero points (b).",

Water ( $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, molecular mass 18 amu ) is a liquid, even though it has a lower molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between the two compounds to dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion forces. Additionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded ( 4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or 3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively small sizes of $\\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{O}$, or N atoms, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these atoms.

Because a neutral, isolated carbon atom has four valence electrons, and because the carbon atom in methane still owns four, the methane carbon atom is neutral and has no formal charge.\n\n\nThe same is true for the nitrogen atom in ammonia, which has three covalent $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds and two nonbonding electrons (a lone pair). Atomic nitrogen has five valence electrons, and the ammonia nitrogen also has five-one in each of three shared $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds plus two in the lone pair. Thus, the nitrogen atom in ammonia has no formal charge.\n\n\nThe situation is different in dimethyl sulfoxide. Atomic sulfur has six valence electrons, but the dimethyl sulfoxide sulfur owns only five-one in each of the two $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds, one in the $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{O}$ single bond, and two in a lone pair. Thus, the sulfur atom has formally lost an electron and therefore has a positive formal charge. A similar calculation for the oxygen atom shows that it has formally gained an electron and has a negative charge. Atomic oxygen has six valence electrons, but the oxygen in dimethyl sulfoxide has seven-one in the $O-S$ bond and two in each of three lone pairs. Thus, the oxygen has formally gained an electron and has a negative formal charge.\n\n\nTo express the calculations in a general way, the formal charge on an atom is equal to the number of valence electrons in a neutral, isolated atom minus the number of electrons owned by that bonded atom in a molecule. The number of electrons in the bonded atom, in turn, is equal to half the number of bonding electrons plus the nonbonding, lone-pair electrons.",

Both substances contain a carbon-carbon double-bond functional group, and both therefore react with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in the same way to give a product in which a Br atom has added to each of the double-bond carbons (FIGURE 3.2). This example is typical: the chemistry of every organic molecule, regardless of size and complexity, is determined by the functional groups it contains.\n\n\n\nEthylene\n\n\n\nMenthene\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 The reactions of ethylene and menthene with bromine. In both molecules, the carbon-carbon double-bond functional group has a similar polarity pattern, so both molecules react with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in the same way. The size and complexity of the molecules are not important.\n\nLook at TABLE 3.1, which lists many of the common functional groups and gives simple examples of their occurrence. Some functional groups have only carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; others have halogen atoms; and still others contain oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Much of the chemistry you'll be studying is the chemistry of these functional groups.",

All atoms and molecules will condense into a liquid or solid in which the attractive forces exceed the kinetic energy of the molecules, at sufficiently low temperature.\n4. (a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are distributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as argon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g., Ar). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end of one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (e.g., ICI molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to one of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom. The electrostatic attraction between the partially positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partially negative atom in another molecule gives rise to a strong dipole-dipole interaction called a hydrogen bond (e.g., HF...HF ).\n5.

Of those groups, amines are among the most abundant and have among the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological reactions are amines.\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia. They are named in the IUPAC system either by adding the suffix -amine to the name of the alkyl substituent or by considering the amino group as a substituent on a more complex parent molecule.\nThe chemistry of amines is dominated by the lone-pair electrons on nitrogen, which makes amines both basic and nucleophilic. The basicity of arylamines is generally lower than that of alkylamines because the nitrogen lone-pair electrons are delocalized by interaction with the aromatic $\\pi$ system. Electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring further weaken the basicity of a substituted aniline, while electron-donating substituents increase basicity. Alkylamines are sufficiently basic that they exist almost entirely in their protonated form at the physiological pH of 7.3.\n\nHeterocyclic amines are compounds that contain one or more nitrogen atoms as part of a ring. Saturated\nheterocyclic amines usually have the same chemistry as their open-chain analogs, but unsaturated heterocycles such as pyrrole, imidazole, pyridine, and pyrimidine are aromatic. All four are unusually stable, and all undergo aromatic substitution on reaction with electrophiles. Pyrrole is nonbasic because its nitrogen lone-pair electrons are part of the aromatic $\\pi$ system. Fused-ring heterocycles such as quinoline, isoquinoline, indole, and purine are also commonly found in biological molecules.",

Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the mass spectrum of the compound (see discussion of this technique in a previous chapter on atoms and molecules). Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text.\n\nMolecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound's molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula. If the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance is known, it may be divided by the empirical formula mass to yield the number of empirical formula units per molecule (n):\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text { molecular or molar mass }\\left(\\mathrm{amu} \\text { or } \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{~mol}}\\right)}{\\text { empirical formula mass }\\left(\\mathrm{amu} \\text { or } \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{~mol}}\\right)}=n \\text { formula units/molecule }\n$$\n\nThe molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by $n$, as shown by the generic empirical formula $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{x}} \\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{y}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\left(A_{x} B_{y}\\right)_{n}=A_{n x} B_{n y}\n$$\n\nFor example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$.

If the compound's molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu , this indicates that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical formula:",

Answer: - \n(a) noble gas; (b) chalcogen; (c) alkaline earth metal; (d) alkali metal\n\nAs you will learn in your further study of chemistry, elements in groups often behave in a somewhat similar manner. This is partly due to the number of electrons in their outer shell and their similar readiness to bond. These shared properties can have far-ranging implications in nature, science, and medicine. For example, when Gertrude Elion and George Hitchens were investigating ways to interrupt cell and virus replication to fight diseases, they utilized the similarity between sulfur and oxygen (both in Group 16) and their capacity to bond in similar ways. Elion focused on purines, which are key components of DNA and which contain oxygen. She found that by introducing sulfur-based compounds (called purine analogues) that mimic the structure of purines, molecules within DNA would bond to the analogues rather than the \"regular\" DNA purine. With the normal DNA bonding and structure altered, Elion successfully interrupted cell replication. At its core, the strategy worked because of the similarity between sulfur and oxygen. Her discovery led directly to important treatments for leukemia. Overall, Elion's work with George Hitchens not only led to more treatments, but also changed the entire methodology of drug development. By using specific elements and compounds to target specific aspects of tumor cells, viruses, and bacteria, they laid the groundwork for many of today's most common and important medicines, used to help millions of people each year. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1988.\n\nIn studying the periodic table, you might have noticed something about the atomic masses of some of the elements. Element 43 (technetium), element 61 (promethium), and most of the elements with atomic number 84 (polonium) and higher have their atomic mass given in square brackets. This is done for elements that consist entirely of unstable, radioactive isotopes (you will learn more about radioactivity in the nuclear chemistry chapter). An average atomic weight cannot be determined for these elements because their radioisotopes may vary significantly in relative abundance, depending on the source, or may not even exist in nature. The number in square brackets is the atomic mass number (and approximate atomic mass) of the most stable isotope of that element.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

They earned the name \"noble\" because they were assumed to be nonreactive since they have filled valence shells. In 1962, Dr. Neil Bartlett at the University of British Columbia proved this assumption to be false.\n\nThese elements are present in the atmosphere in small amounts. Some natural gas contains $1-2 \\%$ helium by mass. Helium is isolated from natural gas by liquefying the condensable components, leaving only helium as a gas. The United States possesses most of the world's commercial supply of this element in its helium-bearing gas fields. Argon, neon, krypton, and xenon come from the fractional distillation of liquid air. Radon comes from other radioactive elements. More recently, it was observed that this radioactive gas is present in very\nsmall amounts in soils and minerals. Its accumulation in well-insulated, tightly sealed buildings, however, constitutes a health hazard, primarily lung cancer.\n\nThe boiling points and melting points of the noble gases are extremely low relative to those of other substances of comparable atomic or molecular masses. This is because only weak London dispersion forces are present, and these forces can hold the atoms together only when molecular motion is very slight, as it is at very low temperatures. Helium is the only substance known that does not solidify on cooling at normal pressure. It remains liquid close to absolute zero $(0.001 \\mathrm{~K})$ at ordinary pressures, but it solidifies under elevated pressure.\n\nHelium is used for filling balloons and lighter-than-air craft because it does not burn, making it safer to use than hydrogen. Helium at high pressures is not a narcotic like nitrogen. Thus, mixtures of oxygen and helium are important for divers working under high pressures. Using a helium-oxygen mixture avoids the disoriented mental state known as nitrogen narcosis, the so-called rapture of the deep. Helium is important as an inert atmosphere for the melting and welding of easily oxidizable metals and for many chemical processes that are sensitive to air.",

Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.

Oxygen occurs as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules and, to a limited extent, as $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ (ozone) molecules in air. It forms about $20 \\%$ of the mass of the air.

Although it is only slightly soluble in water ( 49 mL of gas dissolves in 1 L at STP), oxygen's solubility is very important to aquatic life.\n\nMost of the oxygen isolated commercially comes from air and the remainder from the electrolysis of water. The separation of oxygen from air begins with cooling and compressing the air until it liquefies. As liquid air warms, oxygen with its higher boiling point ( 90 K ) separates from nitrogen, which has a lower boiling point (77 $K$ ). It is possible to separate the other components of air at the same time based on differences in their boiling points.\n\nOxygen is essential in combustion processes such as the burning of fuels.

We sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound. For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$.

By the same token, the carbon atoms of pyrrole are more electron-rich and more nucleophilic than typical double-bond carbons.

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

Band Theory - \nIn order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is \"easy\" to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so \"large\" that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when \"moderate\" amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics.\n\nSemiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

Figure 5.2 illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 5.2.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm , which is the bond length observed for the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule.\n\nIn addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for two $s$ orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 5.3 illustrates this for two $p$ orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are inphase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.\n\nIn a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically $>10^{23}$ atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When $N$ valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, $N / 2$ (filled) bonding orbitals and $N / 2$ (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 5.39 shows the bands for three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.39 Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the size of the \"band gap\" between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move electrons from the valance band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but not as well as conductors.",

For example, the hydrogen molecule, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 4.4 illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the $x$-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the $x$-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n\n\nFIGURE 4.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond.

A small amount of sample, typically a few milligrams or less, is dissolved in a small amount of solvent, the solution is placed in a thin glass tube, and the tube is placed into the narrow ( $1-2 \\mathrm{~cm}$ ) gap between the poles of a strong magnet. Imagine, though, that a much larger NMR instrument were available. Instead of a few milligrams, the sample size could be tens of kilograms; instead of a narrow gap between magnet poles, the gap could be large enough for a whole person to climb into so that an NMR spectrum of body parts could be obtained. That large instrument is exactly what's used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a diagnostic technique of enormous value to the medical community.\n\nLike NMR spectroscopy, MRI takes advantage of the magnetic properties of certain nuclei, typically hydrogen, and of the signals emitted when those nuclei are stimulated by radiofrequency energy. Unlike what happens in NMR spectroscopy, though, MRI instruments use data manipulation techniques to look at the threedimensional location of magnetic nuclei in the body rather than at the chemical nature of the nuclei. As noted, most MRI instruments currently look at hydrogen, present in abundance wherever there is water or fat in the body.\n\nThe signals detected by MRI vary with the density of hydrogen atoms and with the nature of their surroundings, allowing identification of different types of tissue and even allowing the visualization of motion. For example, the volume of blood leaving the heart in a single stroke can be measured, and heart motion can be observed. Soft tissues that don't show up well on X-ray images can be seen clearly, allowing diagnosis of brain tumors, strokes, and other conditions. This technique is also valuable in diagnosing damage to knees or other joints and is a noninvasive alternative to surgical explorations.\n\nSeveral types of atoms in addition to hydrogen can be detected by MRI, and the applications of images based on\n${ }^{31} \\mathrm{P}$ atoms are being explored.

Colored compounds have such elaborate systems of conjugation that their \"UV\" absorptions extend into the visible region. $\\beta$-Carotene, for instance, has 11 double bonds in conjugation, and its absorption occurs at $\\lambda_{\\max }=455 \\mathrm{~nm}$ (FIGURE 14.14).\n\n\nFIGURE 14.14 Ultraviolet spectrum of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$-carotene, a conjugated molecule with 11 double bonds.

When white light strikes $\\beta$-carotene, the wavelengths from 400 to 500 nm (blue) are absorbed while all other wavelengths are transmitted and can reach our eyes. We therefore see the white light with the blue removed, which we perceive as a yellow-orange color for $\\beta$-carotene.\n\nConjugation is crucial not only for the colors we see in organic molecules but also for the light-sensitive molecules on which our visual system is based. The key substance for vision is dietary $\\beta$-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A by enzymes in the liver, oxidized to an aldehyde called 11-trans-retinal, and then isomerized by a change in geometry of the C11-C12 double bond to produce 11-cis-retinal.",

Instead, they typically use either electrospray ionization ( $E S I$ ) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), typically linked to a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. Both ESI and MALDI are soft ionization methods that produce charged molecules with little fragmentation, even with sensitive biological samples of very high molecular weight.\n\nIn an ESI source, as a sample solution exits the tube, it is subjected to a high voltage that causes the droplets to become charged. The sample molecules gain one or more protons from charged solvent molecules in the droplet. The volatile solvent quickly evaporates, giving variably protonated sample molecules $\\left(M+H_{n}{ }^{n+}\\right)$. In a MALDI source, the sample is adsorbed onto a suitable matrix compound, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, which is ionized by a short burst of laser light. The matrix compound then transfers the energy to the sample and protonates it, forming $\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}_{n}{ }^{n+}$ ions.\n\nFollowing ion formation, the variably protonated sample molecules are electrically focused into a small packet with a narrow spatial distribution, and the packet is given a sudden kick of energy by an accelerator electrode. As each molecule in the packet is given the same energy, $E=m v^{2} / 2$, it begins moving with a velocity that depends on the square root of its mass, $v=\\sqrt{2 E / m}$. Lighter molecules move faster, and heavier molecules move slower.

On the one hand, this complexity is a problem because it generally limits the laboratory use of IR spectroscopy to pure samples of fairly small molecules-little can be learned from IR spectroscopy about large, complex biomolecules. On the other hand, this complexity is useful because an IR spectrum acts as a unique fingerprint of a compound. In fact,\nthe complex region of the IR spectrum, from $1500 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to around $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, is called the fingerprint region. If two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.\n\nFortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information. Most functional groups have characteristic IR absorption bands that don't change much from one compound to another.

In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.

This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.\n\nDifferent types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 20.33). A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding. The ability of various kinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and some particles have almost no tendency to produce ionization.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

If the parent nuclide undergoing $\\alpha$ decay lies below the band of stability (refer to Figure 20.2), the daughter nuclide will lie closer to the band.\n\nBeta ( $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ ) decay is the emission of an electron from a nucleus.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThe next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively charged alpha particles ( $\\alpha$ particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of radium; $\\alpha$ particles consist of two protons and two neutrons (you will learn more about radioactive decay in the chapter on nuclear chemistry). Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a beam of $\\alpha$ particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering of the $\\alpha$ particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an $\\alpha$ particle.\nWhat did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source (Figure 2.9). Rutherford described finding these results: \"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you., ${ }^{\\underline{1}}$\n\n\nFIGURE 2.9 Geiger and Rutherford fired $\\alpha$ particles at a piece of gold foil and detected where those particles went, as shown in this schematic diagram of their experiment. Most of the particles passed straight through the foil, but a few were deflected slightly and a very small number were significantly deflected.\n\nHere is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving $\\alpha$ particles passed through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like charges repel one another, the few positively charged $\\alpha$ particles that changed paths abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength.

The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

After many more experiments, Rutherford also discovered that the nuclei of other elements contain the hydrogen nucleus as a \"building block,\" and he named this more fundamental particle the proton, the positively charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Explain the basic behavior of waves, including travelling waves and standing waves\n- Describe the wave nature of light\n- Use appropriate equations to calculate related light-wave properties such as period, frequency, wavelength, and energy\n- Distinguish between line and continuous emission spectra\n- Describe the particle nature of light\n\nThe nature of light has been a subject of inquiry since antiquity. In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

Although these two symbols appear nearly identical, they mean very different things). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as being a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued that Bohr's assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is considered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that only an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit (Figure 3.17).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.17 If an electron is viewed as a wave circling around the nucleus, an integer number of wavelengths must fit into the orbit for this standing wave behavior to be possible.\n\nFor a circular orbit of radius $r$, the circumference is $2 \\pi r$, and so de Broglie's condition is:\n\n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

LINK TO LEARNING - \nThe Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstax.org/1/16PhetScatter) allows you to investigate the differences between a \"plum pudding\" atom and a Rutherford atom by firing $\\alpha$ particles at each type of atom.\n\nAnother important finding was the discovery of isotopes. During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a \"new element\" produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the English chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopes-atoms of the same element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery.\n\nOne puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found evidence of neutrons, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The existence of the neutron also explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of\nneutrons, but they are chemically identical because they have the same number of protons. This will be explained in more detail later.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

Molecular polarity results from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule. As a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar substances are insoluble in water.\n\nNet polarity is measured by a quantity called the dipole moment and can be thought of in the following way: assume that there is a center of mass of all positive charges (nuclei) in a molecule and a center of mass of all negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don't coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.\n\nThe dipole moment, $\\mu$ (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge $Q$ at either end of the molecular dipole times the distance $r$ between the charges, $\\mu=Q \\times r$.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

Answer: - \nred, 620-800 nm\n\nSmall changes in the relative energies of the orbitals that electrons are transitioning between can lead to drastic shifts in the color of light absorbed. Therefore, the colors of coordination compounds depend on many factors. As shown in Figure 19.38, different aqueous metal ions can have different colors.

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second $\\left[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right]$, is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, $\\left(1 \\mathrm{MHz}=1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$ and gigahertz $\\left(1 \\mathrm{GHz}=1 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$. The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 3.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed.

Amplitude is one-half the height of the wave from peak to trough.\n\nThe product of a wave's wavelength $(\\lambda)$ and its frequency $(\\nu), \\lambda \\nu$, is the speed of the wave.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

The structure of an organic molecule is usually determined using spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry (MS) tells the molecular weight and formula of a molecule; infrared (IR) spectroscopy identifies the functional groups present in the molecule.\n\nIn small-molecule mass spectrometry, molecules are first ionized by collision with a high-energy electron beam. The ions then fragment into smaller pieces, which are magnetically sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. The ionized sample molecule is called the molecular ion, $M^{+}$, and measurement of its mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by interpreting the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion. Mass-spectral fragmentations are usually complex, however, and interpretation is often difficult. In biological mass spectrometry, molecules are protonated using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the protonated molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy involves the interaction of a molecule with electromagnetic radiation. When an organic molecule is irradiated with infrared energy, certain frequencies are absorbed by the molecule. The frequencies absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular vibrations such as bond stretching and bending. Since every functional group has a characteristic combination of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal alkyne $\\equiv \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond absorbs IR radiation of $3300 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and the alkene $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ bond absorbs in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The nucleus consists of subatomic particles called neutrons, which are electrically neutral, and protons, which are positively charged. Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom.

He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

Thus, by measuring the UV spectrum of an unknown, we can derive structural information about the nature of any conjugated $\\pi$ electron system present in a molecule.\n\nOne of the most important factors affecting the wavelength of UV absorption by a molecule is the extent of conjugation.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Although the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale.

It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom's mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom's volume.

Bond angles that are too large or too small cause angle strain; bond lengths that are too short or too long cause stretching or compressing strain; unfavorable eclipsing interactions around single bonds cause torsional strain; and nonbonded atoms that approach each other too closely cause steric, or van der Waals, strain.\n\n$$\nE_{\\text {total }}=E_{\\mathrm{bond} \\text { stretching }}+E_{\\text {angle strain }}+E_{\\text {torsional strain }}+E_{\\text {van der Waals }}\n$$\n\n\n\nFIGURE 4.19 Computer programs make it possible to accurately represent molecular geometry.

After dozens or hundreds of iterations, the calculation ultimately converges on a minimum energy that corresponds to the most favorable, least strained conformation of the molecule.\n\nSimilar calculations have proven to be particularly useful in pharmaceutical research, where a complementary fit between a drug molecule and a receptor molecule in the body is often the key to designing new pharmaceutical agents (FIGURE 4.20).\n\n\nFIGURE 4.20 The structure of Tamiflu (oseltamivir), an antiviral agent active against type A influenza, along with a molecular model of its minimum-energy conformation as calculated by molecular mechanics.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive.

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first.

The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins).

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ).

Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space.

However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a -2 ion, and so on.\n\nAs we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases.

An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure - \nFIGURE 3.24 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale).\n\nElectrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the $5 p$ orbitals fill immediately after the $4 d$, and immediately before the $6 s$. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, $n$, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of 1 increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order $s>p>d>f$. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron-nucleus attractions slightly (recall\nthat all electrons have -1 charges, but nuclei have $+Z$ charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals ( $1 s$ through $3 p$ ), the increase in energy due to $n$ is more significant than the increase due to $l$; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.\n\nThe arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom. We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information (Figure 3.25):\n\n1. The number of the principal quantum shell, $n$,\n2.

In the first case, the oxygen side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule.

The second case is clearly more likely to result in the formation of carbon dioxide, which has a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms $(\\mathrm{O}=\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O})$. This is a rather simple example of how important the orientation of the collision is in terms of creating the desired product of the reaction.\n\n\nFIGURE 17.13 Illustrated are two collisions that might take place between carbon monoxide and oxygen molecules. The orientation of the colliding molecules partially determines whether a reaction between the two molecules will occur.\n\nIf the collision does take place with the correct orientation, there is still no guarantee that the reaction will proceed to form carbon dioxide. In addition to a proper orientation, the collision must also occur with sufficient energy to result in product formation. When reactant species collide with both proper orientation and adequate energy, they combine to form an unstable species called an activated complex or a transition state. These species are very short lived and usually undetectable by most analytical instruments. In some cases, sophisticated spectral measurements have been used to observe transition states.\n\nCollision theory explains why most reaction rates increase as concentrations increase. With an increase in the concentration of any reacting substance, the chances for collisions between molecules are increased because there are more molecules per unit of volume. More collisions mean a faster reaction rate, assuming the energy of the collisions is adequate.",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nFIGURE 3.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as $2 s$, $3 p$, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, $n$. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

Molecular Orbital Theory\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called $\\sigma$ MOs. They can be formed from $s$ orbitals or from $p$ orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from $p$ orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called $\\pi$ orbitals.\n\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund's rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field.

Covalent radius increases as we move down a group because the $n$ level (orbital size) increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across a period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons increases, and the electrons are pulled in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained constant. Ionization energy (the energy associated with forming a cation) decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it is easier to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity (the energy associated with forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic) when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the nucleus. Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to right across the periodic table and decreases as we move down a group.

A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its mass number (A).

The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.\n\nAnother quantum number is $l$, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take the values, $l=0,1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have only one value of $l, l=0$, whereas $n=2$ permits $l=0$ and $l=1$, and so on.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nWhen atoms of nonmetal elements form ions, they generally gain enough electrons to give them the same number of electrons as an atom of the next noble gas in the periodic table. Atoms of group 17 gain one electron and form anions with a 1- charge; atoms of group 16 gain two electrons and form ions with a 2- charge, and so on. For example, the neutral bromine atom, with 35 protons and 35 electrons, can gain one electron to provide it with 36 electrons. This results in an anion with 35 protons, 36 electrons, and a 1 - charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the next noble gas, krypton, and is symbolized $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$. (A discussion of the theory supporting the favored status of noble gas electron numbers reflected in these predictive rules for ion formation is provided in a later chapter of this text.)\n\nNote the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge (Figure 3.40). Moving from the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to form cations with a charge equal to the group number. That is, group 1 elements form $1+$ ions; group 2 elements form $2+$ ions, and so on. Moving from the far right to the left on the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge\nequal to the number of groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one group left of the noble gases) form 1-ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form 2-ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases, but its predictive value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by their location in the table. For example, copper can form ions with a $1+$ or $2+$ charge, and iron can form ions with a $2+$ or $3+$ charge.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.40 Some elements exhibit a regular pattern of ionic charge when they form ions.",

Transition states for endergonic steps structurally resemble products, and transition states for exergonic steps structurally resemble reactants.\n\nHow does the Hammond postulate apply to electrophilic addition reactions? The formation of a carbocation by protonation of an alkene is an endergonic step. Thus, the transition state for alkene protonation structurally resembles the carbocation intermediate, and any factor that stabilizes the carbocation will also stabilize the nearby transition state. Since increasing alkyl substitution stabilizes carbocations, it also stabilizes the transition states leading to those ions, thus resulting in a faster reaction. In other words, more stable carbocations form faster because their greater stability is reflected in the lower-energy transition state leading to them (FIGURE 7.16).\n\n\nFIGURE 7.16 Energy diagrams for carbocation formation. The more stable tertiary carbocation is formed faster (green curve) because its increased stability lowers the energy of the transition state leading to it.\n\nWe can imagine the transition state for alkene protonation to be a structure in which one of the alkene carbon atoms has almost completely rehybridized from $s p^{2}$ to $s p^{3}$ and the remaining alkene carbon bears much of the positive charge (FIGURE 7.17).

Variation in Electron Affinities - \nWe also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that the second element in the group most often has the most negative EA. This can be attributed\nto the small size of the $n=2$ shell and the resulting large electron-electron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA value of $-348 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine is $-322 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion ( $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$), we add an electron to the $n=2$ shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the $n=3$ shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily, resulting in a more negative EA.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.35 This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) for selected elements.\n\nThe properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.",

In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

Because any $s$ subshell can contain only two electrons, the fifth electron must occupy the next energy level, which will be a $2 p$ orbital. There are three degenerate $2 p$ orbitals ( $m_{l}=-1,0,+1$ ) and the electron can occupy any one of these $p$ orbitals.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Define ionic and molecular (covalent) compounds\n- Predict the type of compound formed from elements based on their location within the periodic table\n- Determine formulas for simple ionic compounds\n\nIn ordinary chemical reactions, the nucleus of each atom (and thus the identity of the element) remains unchanged. Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During the formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged particles called ions (Figure 3.39).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.39 (a) A sodium atom ( Na ) has equal numbers of protons and electrons (11) and is uncharged. (b) A sodium cation $\\left(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}\\right)$has lost an electron, so it has one more proton (11) than electrons (10), giving it an overall positive charge, signified by a superscripted plus sign.\n\nYou can use the periodic table to predict whether an atom will form an anion or a cation, and you can often predict the charge of the resulting ion. Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a cation with a $2+$ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a $2+$ charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The name of a metal ion is the same as the name of the metal atom from which it forms, $\\mathrm{so}_{\\mathrm{Ca}}{ }^{2+}$ is called a calcium ion.",

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and \"see\" its structure with your eyes?\n\nDetermining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy-you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Explain the basic behavior of waves, including travelling waves and standing waves\n- Describe the wave nature of light\n- Use appropriate equations to calculate related light-wave properties such as period, frequency, wavelength, and energy\n- Distinguish between line and continuous emission spectra\n- Describe the particle nature of light\n\nThe nature of light has been a subject of inquiry since antiquity. In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

X-Ray Crystallography - \nThe size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography.

X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal.

The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory.

The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Dipole Moments and Ionic Character - \nNow that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.\nIons, in turn, can associate by charge - simple Coulombic attraction - resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as polar.\nIn your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar nature - not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges divided by the square of the distance between those charges:\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $Q$ is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of $1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.

Since these wavelengths are comparable to the spaces between atoms in a crystalline solid, X-rays are scattered when they pass through crystals. The scattered rays undergo constructive and destructive interference that creates a specific diffraction pattern that may be measured and used to precisely determine the positions of atoms within the crystal. This phenomenon of X-ray diffraction is the basis for very powerful techniques enabling the determination of molecular structure. One of the pioneers who applied this powerful technology to important biochemical substances was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.\n\nBorn in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910 to British parents, Dorothy's fascination with chemistry was fostered early in her life. At age 11 she was enrolled in a prestigious English grammar school where she was one of just two girls allowed to study chemistry. On her 16th birthday, her mother, Molly, gifted her a book on X-ray crystallography, which had a profound impact on the trajectory of her career. She studied chemistry at Oxford University, graduating with first-class honors in 1932 and directly entering Cambridge University to pursue a doctoral degree. At Cambridge, Dorothy recognized the promise of X-ray crystallography for protein structure determinations, conducting research that earned her a PhD in 1937. Over the course of a very productive career, Dr. Hodgkin was credited with determining structures for several important biomolecules, including cholesterol iodide, penicillin, and vitamin B12. In recognition of her achievements in the use of X-ray techniques to elucidate the structures of biochemical substances, she was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1969, she led a team of scientists who deduced the structure of insulin, facilitating the mass production of this hormone and greatly advancing the treatment of diabetic patients worldwide. Dr. Hodgkin continued working with the international scientific community, earning numerous distinctions and awards prior to her death in 1993.",

What's \"Free\" about $\\Delta G$ ? - \nIn addition to indicating spontaneity, the free energy change also provides information regarding the amount of useful work ( $w$ ) that may be accomplished by a spontaneous process. Although a rigorous treatment of this subject is beyond the scope of an introductory chemistry text, a brief discussion is helpful for gaining a better perspective on this important thermodynamic property.\n\nFor this purpose, consider a spontaneous, exothermic process that involves a decrease in entropy. The free energy, as defined by\n\n$$\n\\Delta G=\\Delta H-T \\Delta S\n$$\n\nmay be interpreted as representing the difference between the energy produced by the process, $\\Delta H$, and the energy lost to the surroundings, $T \\Delta S$. The difference between the energy produced and the energy lost is the energy available (or \"free\") to do useful work by the process, $\\Delta G$. If the process somehow could be made to take place under conditions of thermodynamic reversibility, the amount of work that could be done would be maximal:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G=w_{\\max }\n$$\n\nHowever, as noted previously in this chapter, such conditions are not realistic. In addition, the technologies used to extract work from a spontaneous process (e.g., automobile engine, steam turbine) are never 100\\% efficient, and so the work done by these processes is always less than the theoretical maximum. Similar reasoning may be applied to a nonspontaneous process, for which the free energy change represents the minimum amount of work that must be done on the system to carry out the process.",

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds).

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 3.30.\n\nCovalent Radii of the Halogen Group Elements\n\n| Atom | Covalent radius (pm) | Nuclear charge |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| F | 64 | +9 |\n| Cl | 99 | +17 |\n| Br | 114 | +35 |\n| I | 133 | +53 |\n| At | 148 | +85 |\n\nTABLE 3.2\n\n\nFIGURE 3.30 (a) The radius of an atom is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei in a molecule consisting of two identical atoms joined by a covalent bond.

It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct $X$ positions, as shown in Figure 4.20: an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). As shown in Figure 4.19, the axial position is surrounded by bond angles of $90^{\\circ}$, whereas the equatorial position has more space available because of the $120^{\\circ}$ bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs.\n\nTheoretically, we can come up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the $\\mathrm{ClF}_{3}$ molecule (Figure 4.20).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Define ionic and molecular (covalent) compounds\n- Predict the type of compound formed from elements based on their location within the periodic table\n- Determine formulas for simple ionic compounds\n\nIn ordinary chemical reactions, the nucleus of each atom (and thus the identity of the element) remains unchanged. Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During the formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged particles called ions (Figure 3.39).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.39 (a) A sodium atom ( Na ) has equal numbers of protons and electrons (11) and is uncharged. (b) A sodium cation $\\left(\\mathrm{Na}^{+}\\right)$has lost an electron, so it has one more proton (11) than electrons (10), giving it an overall positive charge, signified by a superscripted plus sign.\n\nYou can use the periodic table to predict whether an atom will form an anion or a cation, and you can often predict the charge of the resulting ion. Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a cation with a $2+$ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a $2+$ charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons.\n\nWhen using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1 , a double bond has a bond order of 2 , and a triple bond has a bond order of 3 . We define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but both methods describe the same phenomenon.\n\nIn the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\text { bond order }=\\frac{\\text { (number of bonding electrons) }- \\text { (number of antibonding electrons) }}{2}\n$$\n\nThe order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases.

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins).

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

This is the defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: $\\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{Z}=$ number of neutrons.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { atomic number }(\\mathrm{Z}) & =\\text { number of protons } \\\\\n\\text { mass number }(\\mathrm{A}) & =\\text { number of protons+ number of neutrons } \\\\\n\\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{Z} & =\\text { number of neutrons }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAtoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.

An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an anion. Positively charged atoms called cations are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom $(Z=11)$ has 11 electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge ( $11-10=1+$ ).

If so, we would observe only a single NMR absorption signal in the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ spectrum of a molecule, a situation that would be of little use. In fact, the absorption frequency is not the same for all ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or all ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nuclei.\n\nAll nuclei in molecules are surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field is applied to a molecule, the electrons moving around nuclei set up tiny local magnetic fields of their own.

Because each chemically distinct nucleus in a molecule is in a slightly different electronic environment, each nucleus is shielded to a slightly different extent and the effective magnetic field felt by each is slightly different. These tiny differences in the effective magnetic fields experienced by different nuclei can be detected, and we thus see a distinct NMR signal for each chemically distinct ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ or ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus in a molecule.

Answer: - \nTABLE 3.4\n\nNote that there is a system for naming some polyatomic ions; -ate and -ite are suffixes designating polyatomic ions containing more or fewer oxygen atoms. Per- (short for \"hyper\") and hypo- (meaning \"under\") are prefixes meaning more oxygen atoms than -ate and fewer oxygen atoms than -ite, respectively. For example, perchlorate is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$, chlorate is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, chlorite is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{2}{ }^{-}$and hypochlorite is $\\mathrm{ClO}^{-}$. Unfortunately, the number of oxygen atoms corresponding to a given suffix or prefix is not consistent; for example, nitrate is $\\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$while sulfate is $\\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$. This will be covered in more detail later in the module on nomenclature.\n\nThe nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is the basis for classifying chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred and ions form, ionic bonds result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is, the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this case, cations and anions). When electrons are \"shared\" and molecules form, covalent bonds result. Covalent bonds are the attractive forces between the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms and one or more pairs of electrons that are located between the atoms. Compounds are classified as ionic or molecular (covalent) on the basis of the bonds present in them.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

Such lighting consists of a range of broadly distributed frequencies that form a continuous spectrum. Figure 3.9 shows the wavelength distribution for sunlight. The most intense radiation is in the visible region, with the intensity dropping off rapidly for shorter wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light, and more slowly for longer wavelength infrared (IR) light.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.9 The spectral distribution (light intensity vs. wavelength) of sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere as UV light, visible light, and IR light.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor.

The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

It is \"ideal\" in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed\nwith a spectrometer so that the wavelengths and their intensities can be measured.

In fact, this is due to less than $0.5 \\%$ of the air molecules. Of the energy from the sun that reaches the earth, almost $\\frac{1}{3}$ is reflected back into space, with the rest absorbed by the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. Some of the energy that the earth absorbs is re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation, a portion of which passes back out through the atmosphere into space. Most of this IR radiation, however, is absorbed by certain atmospheric gases, effectively trapping heat within the atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This effect maintains global temperatures within the range needed to sustain life on earth.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

This lack of resistance means that there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity.

This requires the use of liquid helium, which has a boiling temperature of 4 K and is expensive and difficult to handle. The cost of liquid helium has deterred the widespread application of superconductors.\n\nOne of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 1980s was the characterization of compounds that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above 90 K . (Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.) Typical among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of several rare earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio. The formula of the ionic yttrium compound is $\\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \\mathrm{Cu}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{7}$.\n\nThe new materials become superconducting at temperatures close to 90 K (Figure 19.10), temperatures that can be reached by cooling with liquid nitrogen (boiling temperature of 77 K ). Not only are liquid nitrogencooled materials easier to handle, but the cooling costs are also about 1000 times lower than for liquid helium.\n\nFurther advances during the same period included materials that became superconducting at even higher temperatures and with a wider array of materials. The DuPont team led by Uma Chowdry and Arthur Sleight identified Bismouth-Strontium-Copper-Oxides that became superconducting at temperatures as high as 110 K and, importantly, did not contain rare earth elements. Advances continued through the subsequent decades until, in 2020, a team led by Ranga Dias at University of Rochester announced the development of a roomtemperature superconductor, opening doors to widespread applications. More research and development is needed to realize the potential of these materials, but the possibilities are very promising.",

It is possible to separate the other components of air at the same time based on differences in their boiling points.\n\nOxygen is essential in combustion processes such as the burning of fuels.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current.

Several different scientific disciplines use chemical principles to help us better understand weather, the atmosphere, and climate. These are meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric science. Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere, atmospheric phenomena, and atmospheric effects on earth's weather. Meteorologists seek to understand and predict the weather in the short term, which can save lives and benefit the economy. Weather forecasts (Figure 8.7) are the result of thousands of measurements of air pressure, temperature, and the like, which are compiled, modeled, and analyzed in weather centers worldwide.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.7 Meteorologists use weather maps to describe and predict weather.

Earth's atmosphere, which is roughly 100-125 km thick, consists of roughly $78.1 \\%$ nitrogen and $21.0 \\%$ oxygen, and can be subdivided further into the regions shown in Figure 8.8: the exosphere (furthest from earth, $>700 \\mathrm{~km}$ above sea level), the thermosphere ( $80-700 \\mathrm{~km}$ ), the mesosphere ( $50-80 \\mathrm{~km}$ ), the stratosphere (second lowest level of our atmosphere, $12-50 \\mathrm{~km}$ above sea level), and the troposphere (up to 12 km above sea level, roughly $80 \\%$ of the earth's atmosphere by mass and the layer where most weather events originate). As you go higher in the troposphere, air density and temperature both decrease.",

Group 2: The Alkaline Earth Metals - \nThe alkaline earth metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium) constitute group 2 of the periodic table. The name alkaline metal comes from the fact that the oxides of the heavier members of the group react with water to form alkaline solutions. The nuclear charge increases when going from group 1 to group 2. Because of this charge increase, the atoms of the alkaline earth metals are smaller and have higher first ionization energies than the alkali metals within the same period. The higher ionization energy makes the alkaline earth metals less reactive than the alkali metals; however, they are still very reactive elements. Their reactivity increases, as expected, with increasing size and decreasing ionization energy. In chemical reactions, these metals readily lose both valence electrons to form compounds in which they exhibit an oxidation state of $2+$. Due to their high reactivity, it is common to produce the alkaline earth metals, like the alkali metals, by\nelectrolysis. Even though the ionization energies are low, the two metals with the highest ionization energies (beryllium and magnesium) do form compounds that exhibit some covalent characters. Like the alkali metals, the heavier alkaline earth metals impart color to a flame. As in the case of the alkali metals, this is part of the emission spectrum of these elements. Calcium and strontium produce shades of red, whereas barium produces a green color.\n\nMagnesium is a silver-white metal that is malleable and ductile at high temperatures. Passivation decreases the reactivity of magnesium metal. Upon exposure to air, a tightly adhering layer of magnesium oxycarbonate forms on the surface of the metal and inhibits further reaction. (The carbonate comes from the reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.) Magnesium is the lightest of the widely used structural metals, which is why most magnesium production is for lightweight alloys.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Radioactive Dating Using Nuclides Other than Carbon-14 - \nRadioactive dating can also use other radioactive nuclides with longer half-lives to date older events. For example, uranium-238 (which decays in a series of steps into lead-206) can be used for establishing the age of rocks (and the approximate age of the oldest rocks on earth). Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it takes that amount of time for half of the original $\\mathrm{U}-238$ to decay into $\\mathrm{Pb}-206$. In a sample of rock that does not contain appreciable amounts of $\\mathrm{Pb}-208$, the most abundant isotope of lead, we can assume that lead was not present when the rock was formed. Therefore, by measuring and analyzing the ratio of U-238:Pb-206, we can determine the age of the rock. This assumes that all of the lead-206 present came from the decay of uranium-238. If there is additional lead-206 present, which is indicated by the presence of other lead isotopes in the sample, it is necessary to make an adjustment. Potassium-argon dating uses a similar method. K-40 decays by positron emission and electron capture to form $\\mathrm{Ar}-40$ with a half-life of 1.25 billion years. If a rock sample is crushed and the amount of Ar-40 gas that escapes is measured, determination of the Ar-40:K-40\nratio yields the age of the rock. Other methods, such as rubidium-strontium dating ( $\\mathrm{Rb}-87$ decays into $\\mathrm{Sr}-87$ with a half-life of 48.8 billion years), operate on the same principle. To estimate the lower limit for the earth's age, scientists determine the age of various rocks and minerals, making the assumption that the earth is older than the oldest rocks and minerals in its crust. As of 2014, the oldest known rocks on earth are the Jack Hills zircons from Australia, found by uranium-lead dating to be almost 4.4 billion years old.",

Uses of Lanthanides in Devices - \nLanthanides (elements 57-71) are fairly abundant in the earth's crust, despite their historic characterization as rare earth elements. Thulium, the rarest naturally occurring lanthanoid, is more common in the earth's crust than silver ( $4.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\%$ versus $0.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\%$ by mass). There are 17 rare earth elements, consisting of the 15 lanthanoids plus scandium and yttrium. They are called rare because they were once difficult to extract economically, so it was rare to have a pure sample; due to similar chemical properties, it is difficult to separate any one lanthanide from the others. However, newer separation methods, such as ion exchange resins similar to those found in home water softeners, make the separation of these elements easier and more economical. Most ores that contain these elements have low concentrations of all the rare earth elements mixed together.\n\nThe commercial applications of lanthanides are growing rapidly. For example, europium is important in flat screen displays found in computer monitors, cell phones, and televisions. Neodymium is useful in laptop hard drives and in the processes that convert crude oil into gasoline (Figure 19.3). Holmium is found in dental and medical equipment. In addition, many alternative energy technologies rely heavily on lanthanoids.

Answer: - \n0.974 atm; $740 \\mathrm{~mm} \\mathrm{Hg} ; 98.7 \\mathrm{kPa} ; 0.987$ bar\n\nWe can measure atmospheric pressure, the force exerted by the atmosphere on the earth's surface, with a barometer (Figure 8.4). A barometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile liquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the column of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid surface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the tube is therefore\nproportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.4 In a barometer, the height, $h$, of the column of liquid is used as a measurement of the air pressure. Using very dense liquid mercury (left) permits the construction of reasonably sized barometers, whereas using water (right) would require a barometer more than 30 feet tall.\n\nIf the liquid is water, normal atmospheric pressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is rather inconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury ( Hg ) is about 13.6-times denser than water, a mercury barometer only needs to be $\\frac{1}{13.6}$ as tall as a water barometer-a more suitable size. Standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm at sea level ( $101,325 \\mathrm{~Pa}$ ) corresponds to a column of mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high.

If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons.

The postulates of this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual laws. To do this, we must first look at speeds and kinetic energies of gas molecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.\n\nIn a gas sample, individual molecules have widely varying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules and collisions involved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This molecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it depicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a given speed (Figure 8.32).\n\n\nFIGURE 8.32 The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at 300 K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds.

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second $\\left[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right]$, is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, $\\left(1 \\mathrm{MHz}=1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$ and gigahertz $\\left(1 \\mathrm{GHz}=1 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$. The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 3.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Distinguish between spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes\n- Describe the dispersal of matter and energy that accompanies certain spontaneous processes\n\nProcesses have a natural tendency to occur in one direction under a given set of conditions. Water will naturally flow downhill, but uphill flow requires outside intervention such as the use of a pump. Iron exposed to the earth's atmosphere will corrode, but rust is not converted to iron without intentional chemical treatment. A spontaneous process is one that occurs naturally under certain conditions. A nonspontaneous process, on the other hand, will not take place unless it is \"driven\" by the continual input of energy from an external source. A process that is spontaneous in one direction under a particular set of conditions is nonspontaneous in the reverse direction. At room temperature and typical atmospheric pressure, for example, ice will spontaneously melt, but water will not spontaneously freeze.\n\nThe spontaneity of a process is not correlated to the speed of the process. A spontaneous change may be so rapid that it is essentially instantaneous or so slow that it cannot be observed over any practical period of time. To illustrate this concept, consider the decay of radioactive isotopes, a topic more thoroughly treated in the chapter on nuclear chemistry. Radioactive decay is by definition a spontaneous process in which the nuclei of unstable isotopes emit radiation as they are converted to more stable nuclei. All the decay processes occur spontaneously, but the rates at which different isotopes decay vary widely. Technetium-99m is a popular radioisotope for medical imaging studies that undergoes relatively rapid decay and exhibits a half-life of about six hours. Uranium-238 is the most abundant isotope of uranium, and its decay occurs much more slowly, exhibiting a half-life of more than four billion years (Figure 12.2).\n\n\nFIGURE 12.2 Both U-238 and Tc-99m undergo spontaneous radioactive decay, but at drastically different rates. Over the course of one week, essentially all of a Tc-99m sample and none of a U-238 sample will have decayed.\n\nAs another example, consider the conversion of diamond into graphite (Figure 12.3).\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}(s, \\text { diamond }) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C}(s, \\text { graphite })\n$$",

The time periods in human history known as the Bronze Age and Iron Age mark the advancements in which societies learned to isolate certain metals and use them to make tools and goods. Naturally occurring ores of copper, silver, and gold can contain high concentrations of these metals in elemental form (Figure 19.5). Iron, on the other hand, occurs on earth almost exclusively in oxidized forms, such as rust $\\left(\\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}\\right)$. The earliest known iron implements were made from iron meteorites. Surviving iron artifacts dating from approximately 4000 to 2500 BC are rare, but all known examples contain specific alloys of iron and nickel that occur only in extraterrestrial objects, not on earth. It took thousands of years of technological advances before civilizations developed iron smelting, the ability to extract a pure element from its naturally occurring ores and for iron tools to become common.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIGURE 19.5 Transition metals occur in nature in various forms.

However, the ease of their recovery varies widely, depending on the concentration of the element in the ore, the identity of the other elements present, and the difficulty of reducing the element to the free metal.\n\nIn general, it is not difficult to reduce ions of the $d$-block elements to the free element. Carbon is a sufficiently strong reducing agent in most cases. However, like the ions of the more active main group metals, ions of the $f$-block elements must be isolated by electrolysis or by reduction with an active metal such as calcium.\n\nWe shall discuss the processes used for the isolation of iron, copper, and silver because these three processes illustrate the principal means of isolating most of the $d$-block metals.

Gases are also matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would not inflate (increase its volume) when filled with gas.\n\nSolids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on earth (Figure 1.6). A solid is rigid and possesses a definite shape. A liquid flows and takes the shape of its container, except that it forms a flat or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity, liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes that are very nearly independent of pressure. A gas takes both the shape and volume of its container.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.6 The three most common states or phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.\nA fourth state of matter, plasma, occurs naturally in the interiors of stars. A plasma is a gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of electrically charged particles (Figure 1.7). The presence of these charged particles imparts unique properties to plasmas that justify their classification as a state of matter distinct from gases. In addition to stars, plasmas are found in some other high-temperature environments (both natural and man-made), such as lightning strikes, certain television screens, and specialized analytical instruments used to detect trace amounts of metals.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.7 A plasma torch can be used to cut metal.

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second $\\left[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right]$, is the hertz (Hz).

The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 3.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs.

The chemical shift of TMS is set as the zero point, and other absorptions normally occur downfield, to the left on the chart. NMR charts are calibrated using an arbitrary scale called the delta ( $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ ) scale, where $1 \\delta$ equals 1 part-per-million ( 1 ppm ) of the spectrometer operating frequency. For example, if we were measuring the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum of a sample using an instrument operating at $200 \\mathrm{MHz}, 1 \\delta$ would be 1 part per million of $200,000,000 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, or 200 Hz . If we were measuring the spectrum using a 500 MHz instrument, $1 \\delta=500 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. The following equation can be used for any absorption:\n\n$$\n\\delta=\\frac{\\text { Observed chemical shift (number of Hz away from TMS) }}{\\text { Spectrometer frequency in } \\mathrm{MHz}}\n$$\n\nAlthough this method of calibrating NMR charts may seem complex, there's a good reason for it. As we saw earlier, the rf frequency required to bring a given nucleus into resonance depends on the spectrometer's magnetic field strength. But because there are many different kinds of spectrometers with many different magnetic field strengths available, chemical shifts given in frequency units ( Hz ) vary from one instrument to another. Thus, a resonance that occurs at 120 Hz downfield from TMS on one spectrometer might occur at 600 Hz downfield from TMS on another spectrometer with a more powerful magnet.\n\nBy using a system of measurement in which NMR absorptions are expressed in relative terms (parts per million relative to spectrometer frequency) rather than absolute terms (Hz), it's possible to compare spectra obtained\non different instruments. The chemical shift of an NMR absorption in $\\delta$ units is constant, regardless of the operating frequency of the spectrometer.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to $1 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}{ }^{2} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$, which is also called 1 newton-meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.\n\nWe now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of heat ( $q$ ) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change $(\\Delta T)$ of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):\n\n$$\nC=\\frac{q}{\\Delta T}\n$$\n\nHeat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive property-its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.\n\nFor example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast\niron frying pan is found by observing that it takes $18,150 \\mathrm{~J}$ of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by $50.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ :",

The standards for these units are fixed by international agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units (from the French, Le Système International d'Unités). SI units have been used by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964. Units for other properties may be derived from these seven base units.\n\nBase Units of the SI System\n\n| Property Measured | Name of Unit | Symbol of Unit |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| length | meter | m |\n| mass | kilogram | kg |\n| time | second | s |\n| temperature | kelvin | K |\n| electric current | ampere | A |\n| amount of substance | mole | mol |\n| luminous intensity | candela | cd |\n\nTABLE 1.2\n\nEveryday measurement units are often defined as fractions or multiples of other units. Milk is commonly packaged in containers of 1 gallon ( 4 quarts), 1 quart ( 0.25 gallon), and one pint ( 0.5 quart). This same approach is used with SI units, but these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix kilo means \"one thousand,\" which in scientific notation is $10^{3}(1$ kilometer $=1000 \\mathrm{~m}=10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}$ ). The prefixes used and the powers to which 10 are raised are listed in Table 1.3.\n\nCommon Unit Prefixes\n\n| Prefix | Symbol | Factor | Example |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| femto | f | $10^{-15}$ | 1 femtosecond $(\\mathrm{fs})=1 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{~s}(0.000000000000001 \\mathrm{~s})$ |\n| pico | p | $10^{-12}$ | 1 picometer $(\\mathrm{pm})=1 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}(0.000000000001 \\mathrm{~m})$ |",

The Third Law of Thermodynamics - \nThe previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K ). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal ( $W=1$ ). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero.\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W=k \\ln (1)=0\n$$\n\nThis limiting condition for a system's entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.\n\nCareful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance's entropy and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions. Standard entropies ( $\\boldsymbol{S}^{\\circ}$ ) are for one mole of substance under standard conditions (a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 298.15 K ; see details regarding standard conditions in the thermochemistry chapter of this text).

Measuring Nutritional Calories - \nIn your day-to-day life, you may be more familiar with energy being given in Calories, or nutritional calories, which are used to quantify the amount of energy in foods. One calorie (cal) = exactly 4.184 joules, and one Calorie (note the capitalization) $=1000 \\mathrm{cal}$, or 1 kcal . (This is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.)\n\nThe macronutrients in food are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats or oils. Proteins provide about 4 Calories per gram, carbohydrates also provide about 4 Calories per gram, and fats and oils provide about 9 Calories/ g. Nutritional labels on food packages show the caloric content of one serving of the food, as well as the breakdown into Calories from each of the three macronutrients (Figure 9.18).\n\n[^7]\n\nFIGURE 9.18 (a) Macaroni and cheese contain energy in the form of the macronutrients in the food. (b) The food's nutritional information is shown on the package label. In the US, the energy content is given in Calories (per serving); the rest of the world usually uses kilojoules. (credit a: modification of work by \"Rex Roof\"/Flickr)\n\nFor the example shown in (b), the total energy per 228-g portion is calculated by:\n$(5 \\mathrm{~g}$ protein $\\times 4$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})+(31 \\mathrm{~g}$ carb $\\times 4$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})+(12 \\mathrm{~g}$ fat $\\times 9$ Calories $/ \\mathrm{g})=252$ Calories\nSo, you can use food labels to count your Calories. But where do the values come from? And how accurate are they? The caloric content of foods can be determined by using bomb calorimetry; that is, by burning the food and measuring the energy it contains. A sample of food is weighed, mixed in a blender, freezedried, ground into powder, and formed into a pellet. The pellet is burned inside a bomb calorimeter, and the measured temperature change is converted into energy per gram of food.",

The postulates of this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual laws. To do this, we must first look at speeds and kinetic energies of gas molecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.\n\nIn a gas sample, individual molecules have widely varying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules and collisions involved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This molecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it depicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a given speed (Figure 8.32).\n\n\nFIGURE 8.32 The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at 300 K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds.

Much peptide sequencing is now done by mass spectrometry, using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) linked to a time-offlight (TOF) mass analyzer, as described in Section 12.4. Also in common use is a chemical method of peptide sequencing called the Edman degradation.\n\nThe general idea of peptide sequencing by Edman degradation is to cleave one amino acid at a time from an end of the peptide chain. That terminal amino acid is then separated and identified, and the cleavage reactions are repeated on the chain-shortened peptide until the entire peptide sequence is known. Automated protein sequencers are available that allow as many as 50 repetitive sequencing cycles to be carried out before a buildup of unwanted by-products interferes with the results. So efficient are these instruments that sequence information can be obtained from as little as 1 to 5 picomoles of sample-less than $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~g}$.\n\nAs shown in FIGURE 26.5, Edman degradation involves treatment of a peptide with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5}-\\mathrm{N}=\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{S}$, followed by reaction with trifluoroacetic acid. The first step attaches the PITC to the $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ group of the N -terminal amino acid, and the second step splits the N -terminal residue from the peptide chain, yielding an anilinothiazolinone (ATZ) derivative plus the chain-shortened peptide. Further acidcatalyzed rearrangement of the ATZ derivative with aqueous acid converts it into a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH), which is identified by comparison of its elution time with the known elution times of PTH derivatives of the 20 common amino acids. The chain-shortened peptide is then automatically resubmitted for another round of Edman degradation.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Instead, they typically use either electrospray ionization ( $E S I$ ) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), typically linked to a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. Both ESI and MALDI are soft ionization methods that produce charged molecules with little fragmentation, even with sensitive biological samples of very high molecular weight.\n\nIn an ESI source, as a sample solution exits the tube, it is subjected to a high voltage that causes the droplets to become charged. The sample molecules gain one or more protons from charged solvent molecules in the droplet. The volatile solvent quickly evaporates, giving variably protonated sample molecules $\\left(M+H_{n}{ }^{n+}\\right)$. In a MALDI source, the sample is adsorbed onto a suitable matrix compound, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, which is ionized by a short burst of laser light. The matrix compound then transfers the energy to the sample and protonates it, forming $\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}_{n}{ }^{n+}$ ions.\n\nFollowing ion formation, the variably protonated sample molecules are electrically focused into a small packet with a narrow spatial distribution, and the packet is given a sudden kick of energy by an accelerator electrode. As each molecule in the packet is given the same energy, $E=m v^{2} / 2$, it begins moving with a velocity that depends on the square root of its mass, $v=\\sqrt{2 E / m}$. Lighter molecules move faster, and heavier molecules move slower.

The blackbody spectrum matches the solar spectrum quite well. A blackbody is a convenient, ideal emitter that approximates the behavior of many materials when heated. It is \"ideal\" in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed\nwith a spectrometer so that the wavelengths and their intensities can be measured. Figure 3.10 shows the resulting curves for some representative temperatures. Each distribution depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, $\\lambda_{\\max }$, shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high temperatures begin to glow a darker red that becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming white hot at very high temperatures as the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor.

The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

With IR irradiation, the energy absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to increase molecular vibrations. With UV radiation, the energy absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to promote an electron from a lower-energy orbital to a higherenergy one in a conjugated molecule. The conjugated diene 1,3-butadiene, for instance, has four $\\pi$ molecular orbitals, as shown previously in FIGURE 14.3.

In fact, this is due to less than $0.5 \\%$ of the air molecules. Of the energy from the sun that reaches the earth, almost $\\frac{1}{3}$ is reflected back into space, with the rest absorbed by the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. Some of the energy that the earth absorbs is re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation, a portion of which passes back out through the atmosphere into space. Most of this IR radiation, however, is absorbed by certain atmospheric gases, effectively trapping heat within the atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This effect maintains global temperatures within the range needed to sustain life on earth. Without our atmosphere, the earth's average temperature would be lower by more than $30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (nearly $60^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ ).

Methanol, for instance, is one of the most important of all industrial chemicals. Historically, methanol was prepared by heating wood in the absence of air and thus came to be called wood alcohol. Today, approximately 173 million tons ( 50 billion gallons) of methanol is manufactured worldwide each year, most of it by catalytic reduction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen gas. Methanol is toxic to humans, causing blindness in small doses ( 15 mL ) and death in larger amounts ( $100-250 \\mathrm{~mL}$ ). Industrially, it is used both as a solvent and as a starting material for production of formaldehyde $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)$ and acetic acid $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CO}_{2} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$.\n\n\nEthanol was one of the first organic chemicals to be prepared and purified. Its production by fermentation of grains and sugars has been carried out for perhaps 9000 years, and its purification by distillation goes back at least as far as the 12 th century. Today, approximately 88 million tons ( 26 billion gallons) of ethanol are produced worldwide each year, most of it by fermentation of corn, barley, sorghum, and other plant sources. Almost all of this ethanol is used for bus and automobile fuel.\n\nEthanol for industrial use as a solvent or chemical intermediate is largely obtained by acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene at high temperature.\n\n\nPhenols occur widely throughout nature and also serve as intermediates in the industrial synthesis of products as diverse as adhesives and antiseptics. Phenol itself is a general disinfectant found in coal tar; methyl salicylate is a flavoring agent found in oil of wintergreen; and urushiols are the allergenic constituents of poison oak and poison ivy.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nAs the reaction begins ( $t=0$ ), the concentration of the $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$ reactant is finite and that of the $\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ product is zero, so the forward reaction proceeds at a finite rate while the reverse reaction rate is zero. As time passes, N.\n${ }_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$ is consumed and its concentration falls, while $\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is produced and its concentration increases (Figure $13.2 \\mathbf{b})$. The decreasing concentration of the reactant slows the forward reaction rate, and the increasing product concentration speeds the reverse reaction rate (Figure 13.2c). This process continues until the forward and reverse reaction rates become equal, at which time the reaction has reached equilibrium, as characterized by constant concentrations of its reactants and products (shaded areas of Figure $13.2 \\mathbf{b}$ and Figure 13.2c). It's important to emphasize that chemical equilibria are dynamic; a reaction at equilibrium has not \"stopped,\" but is proceeding in the forward and reverse directions at the same rate. This dynamic nature is essential to understanding equilibrium behavior as discussed in this and subsequent chapters of the text.\n\n\nFIGURE 13.3 A two-person juggling act illustrates the dynamic aspect of chemical equilibria. Each person is throwing and catching clubs at the same rate, and each holds a (approximately) constant number of clubs.\n\nPhysical changes, such as phase transitions, are also reversible and may establish equilibria. This concept was introduced in another chapter of this text through discussion of the vapor pressure of a condensed phase (liquid or solid). As one example, consider the vaporization of bromine:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Br}_{2}(l) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Br}_{2}(g)\n$$\n\nWhen liquid bromine is added to an otherwise empty container and the container is sealed, the forward process depicted above (vaporization) will commence and continue at a roughly constant rate as long as the exposed surface area of the liquid and its temperature remain constant. As increasing amounts of gaseous bromine are produced, the rate of the reverse process (condensation) will increase until it equals the rate of vaporization and equilibrium is established. A photograph showing this phase transition equilibrium is provided in Figure 13.4.",

Radioactive Dating Using Nuclides Other than Carbon-14 - \nRadioactive dating can also use other radioactive nuclides with longer half-lives to date older events. For example, uranium-238 (which decays in a series of steps into lead-206) can be used for establishing the age of rocks (and the approximate age of the oldest rocks on earth). Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it takes that amount of time for half of the original $\\mathrm{U}-238$ to decay into $\\mathrm{Pb}-206$. In a sample of rock that does not contain appreciable amounts of $\\mathrm{Pb}-208$, the most abundant isotope of lead, we can assume that lead was not present when the rock was formed. Therefore, by measuring and analyzing the ratio of U-238:Pb-206, we can determine the age of the rock. This assumes that all of the lead-206 present came from the decay of uranium-238. If there is additional lead-206 present, which is indicated by the presence of other lead isotopes in the sample, it is necessary to make an adjustment. Potassium-argon dating uses a similar method. K-40 decays by positron emission and electron capture to form $\\mathrm{Ar}-40$ with a half-life of 1.25 billion years. If a rock sample is crushed and the amount of Ar-40 gas that escapes is measured, determination of the Ar-40:K-40\nratio yields the age of the rock. Other methods, such as rubidium-strontium dating ( $\\mathrm{Rb}-87$ decays into $\\mathrm{Sr}-87$ with a half-life of 48.8 billion years), operate on the same principle. To estimate the lower limit for the earth's age, scientists determine the age of various rocks and minerals, making the assumption that the earth is older than the oldest rocks and minerals in its crust. As of 2014, the oldest known rocks on earth are the Jack Hills zircons from Australia, found by uranium-lead dating to be almost 4.4 billion years old.",

And while a gecko can lift its feet easily as it walks along a surface, if you attempt to pick it up, it sticks to the surface. How are geckos (as well as spiders and some other insects) able to do this? Although this phenomenon has been investigated for hundreds of years, scientists only recently uncovered the details of the process that allows geckos' feet to behave this way.\n\nGeckos' toes are covered with hundreds of thousands of tiny hairs known as setae, with each seta, in turn, branching into hundreds of tiny, flat, triangular tips called spatulae. The huge numbers of spatulae on its setae provide a gecko, shown in Figure 10.8, with a large total surface area for sticking to a surface. In 2000, Kellar Autumn, who leads a multi-institutional gecko research team, found that geckos adhered equally well to both polar silicon dioxide and nonpolar gallium arsenide. This proved that geckos stick to surfaces because of dispersion forces-weak intermolecular attractions arising from temporary, synchronized charge distributions between adjacent molecules. Although dispersion forces are very weak, the total attraction over millions of spatulae is large enough to support many times the gecko's weight.",

Properties of Liquids\nTABLE 10.3\n\n\nFIGURE 10.17 Surface tension (right) prevents this insect, a \"water strider,\" from sinking into the water.\nSurface tension is affected by a variety of variables, including the introduction of additional substances on the surface. In the late 1800s, Agnes Pockels, who was initially blocked from pursuing a scientific career but\nstudied on her own, began investigating the impact and characteristics of soapy and greasy films in water. Using homemade materials, she developed an instrument known as a trough for measuring surface contaminants and their effects. With the support of renowned scientist Lord Rayleigh, her 1891 paper showed that surface contamination significantly reduces surface tension, and also that changing the characteristics of the surface (compressing or expanding it) also affects surface tension. Decades later, Irving Langmuir and Katharine Blodgett built on Pockels' work in their own trough and important advances in surface chemistry. Langmuir pioneered methods for producing single-molecule layers of film; Blodgett applied these to the development of non-reflective glass (critical for film-making and other applications), and also studied methods related to cleaning surfaces, which are important in semiconductor fabrication.\n\nThe IMFs of attraction between two different molecules are called adhesive forces. Consider what happens when water comes into contact with some surface. If the adhesive forces between water molecules and the molecules of the surface are weak compared to the cohesive forces between the water molecules, the water does not \"wet\" the surface. For example, water does not wet waxed surfaces or many plastics such as polyethylene. Water forms drops on these surfaces because the cohesive forces within the drops are greater than the adhesive forces between the water and the plastic. Water spreads out on glass because the adhesive force between water and glass is greater than the cohesive forces within the water. When water is confined in a glass tube, its meniscus (surface) has a concave shape because the water wets the glass and creeps up the side of the tube. On the other hand, the cohesive forces between mercury atoms are much greater than the adhesive forces between mercury and glass. Mercury therefore does not wet glass, and it forms a convex meniscus when confined in a tube because the cohesive forces within the mercury tend to draw it into a drop (Figure 10.18).",

At these temperatures, all molecules dissociate into atoms, and the atoms ionize, forming plasma. These conditions occur in an extremely large number of locations throughout the universe-stars are powered by fusion. Humans have already figured out how to create temperatures high enough to achieve fusion on a large scale in thermonuclear weapons. A thermonuclear weapon such as a hydrogen bomb contains a nuclear fission bomb that, when exploded, gives off enough energy to produce the extremely high temperatures necessary for fusion to occur.\n\nAnother much more beneficial way to create fusion reactions is in a fusion reactor, a nuclear reactor in which fusion reactions of light nuclei are controlled. Because no solid materials are stable at such high temperatures, mechanical devices cannot contain the plasma in which fusion reactions occur. Two techniques to contain plasma at the density and temperature necessary for a fusion reaction are currently the focus of intensive research efforts: containment by a magnetic field and by the use of focused laser beams (Figure 20.23). A number of large projects are working to attain one of the biggest goals in science: getting hydrogen fuel to ignite and produce more energy than the amount supplied to achieve the extremely high temperatures and pressures that are required for fusion.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm .

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave.

Such lighting consists of a range of broadly distributed frequencies that form a continuous spectrum. Figure 3.9 shows the wavelength distribution for sunlight.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

Line Spectra - \nFIGURE 3.13 Compare the two types of emission spectra: continuous spectrum of white light (top) and the line spectra of the light from excited sodium, hydrogen, calcium, and mercury atoms.\n\nThe origin of discrete spectra in atoms and molecules was extremely puzzling to scientists in the late nineteenth century, since according to classical electromagnetic theory, only continuous spectra should be observed.

That equation is the following one, in which $k$ is a constant:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}=k\\left(\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\right), n=3,4,5,6\n$$\n\nOther discrete lines for the hydrogen atom were found in the UV and IR regions.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

When this spin-flip occurs, the magnetic nuclei are said to be in resonance with the applied radiation-hence the name nuclear magnetic resonance.\n\nThe exact frequency necessary for resonance depends both on the strength of the external magnetic field, the identity of the nucleus, and the electronic environment of the nucleus. If a very strong magnetic field is applied, the energy difference between the two spin states is larger and higher-frequency (higher-energy) radiation is required for a spin-flip.

Coupling constants are measured in hertz and generally fall in the range 0 to 18 Hz . The exact value of the coupling constant between two neighboring protons depends on the geometry of the molecule, but a typical value for an openchain alkane is $J=6$ to 8 Hz . The same coupling constant is shared by both groups of hydrogens whose spins are coupled and is independent of spectrometer field strength. In bromoethane, for instance, the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{Br}$ protons\nare coupled to the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons and appear as a quartet with $J=7 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. The $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons appear as a triplet with the same $J=7 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ coupling constant.\n\nBecause coupling is a reciprocal interaction between two adjacent groups of protons, it's sometimes possible to tell which multiplets in a complex NMR spectrum are related to each other. If two multiplets have the same coupling constant, they are probably related, and the protons causing those multiplets are therefore adjacent in the molecule.\n\nThe most commonly observed coupling patterns and the relative intensities of lines in their multiplets are listed in TABLE 13.4. Note that it's not possible for a given proton to have five equivalent neighboring protons. (Why not?)

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the lowfrequency end to gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

On the one hand, this complexity is a problem because it generally limits the laboratory use of IR spectroscopy to pure samples of fairly small molecules-little can be learned from IR spectroscopy about large, complex biomolecules. On the other hand, this complexity is useful because an IR spectrum acts as a unique fingerprint of a compound. In fact,\nthe complex region of the IR spectrum, from $1500 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to around $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, is called the fingerprint region. If two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.\n\nFortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information. Most functional groups have characteristic IR absorption bands that don't change much from one compound to another. The $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ absorption of a ketone is almost always in the range 1680 to $1750 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ absorption of an alcohol is almost always in the range 3400 to $3650 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ absorption of an alkene is almost always in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; and so forth.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.

Look at the acetate ion, for instance. When we draw a line-bond structure for acetate, we need to show a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to the other. But which oxygen is which? Should we draw a double bond to the \"top\" oxygen and a single bond to the \"bottom\" oxygen, or vice versa?\n\n\nAlthough the two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion appear different in line-bond structures, experiments show that they are equivalent. Both carbon-oxygen bonds, for instance, are 127 pm in length, midway between the length of a typical $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ single bond ( 135 pm ) and a typical $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ double bond ( 120 pm ). In other words, neither of the two structures for acetate is correct by itself. The true structure is intermediate between the two, and an electrostatic potential map shows that both oxygen atoms share the negative charge and have equal electron densities (red).\n\n\nThe two individual line-bond structures for acetate ion are called resonance forms, and their special resonance relationship is indicated by the double-headed arrow between them. The only difference between the two resonance forms is the placement of the $\\pi$ and nonbonding valence electrons. The atoms themselves occupy exactly the same place in both resonance forms, the connections between atoms are the same, and the threedimensional shapes of the resonance forms are the same.\n\nA good way to think about resonance forms is to realize that a substance like the acetate ion is the same as any other. Acetate doesn't jump back and forth between two resonance forms, spending part of the time looking like one and part of the time looking like the other. Rather, acetate has a single unchanging structure that we say is a resonance hybrid of the two individual forms and has characteristics of both. The only \"problem\" with acetate is that we can't draw it accurately using a familiar line-bond structure-line-bond structures just don't work for resonance hybrids. The difficulty, however, is with the representation of acetate on paper, not with acetate itself.",

Crystal Field Theory - \nIn an uncomplexed metal ion in the gas phase, the electrons are distributed among the five $d$ orbitals in accord with Hund's rule because the orbitals all have the same energy. However, when ligands coordinate to a metal ion, the energies of the $d$ orbitals are no longer the same.\nIn octahedral complexes, the lobes in two of the five $d$ orbitals, the $d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, point toward the ligands (Figure 19.33). These two orbitals are called the $\\boldsymbol{e}_{g}$ orbitals (the symbol actually refers to the symmetry of the orbitals, but we will use it as a convenient name for these two orbitals in an octahedral complex). The other three orbitals, the $d_{x y}, d_{x z}$, and $d_{y z}$ orbitals, have lobes that point between the ligands and are called the $\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\mathbf{2 g}}$ orbitals (again, the symbol really refers to the symmetry of the orbitals). As six ligands approach the metal ion along the axes of the octahedron, their point charges repel the electrons in the $d$ orbitals of the metal ion. However, the repulsions between the electrons in the $e_{g}$ orbitals (the $d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals) and the ligands are greater than the repulsions between the electrons in the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals (the $d_{z y}, d_{x z}$, and $d_{y z}$ orbitals) and the ligands. This is because the lobes of the $e_{g}$ orbitals point directly at the ligands, whereas the lobes of the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals point between them. Thus, electrons in the $e_{g}$ orbitals of the metal ion in an octahedral complex have higher potential energies than those of electrons in the $t_{2 g}$ orbitals.

In electrochemistry, the potentials of cells and halfcells are thermodynamic quantities that reflect the driving force or the spontaneity of their redox processes. The cell potential of an electrochemical cell is the difference in between its cathode and anode. To permit easy sharing of half-cell potential data, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is\nassigned a potential of exactly 0 V and used to define a single electrode potential for any given half-cell. The electrode potential of a half-cell, $E_{X}$, is the cell potential of said half-cell acting as a cathode when connected to a SHE acting as an anode.

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe nuclear structure in terms of protons, neutrons, and electrons\n- Calculate mass defect and binding energy for nuclei\n- Explain trends in the relative stability of nuclei\n\nNuclear chemistry is the study of reactions that involve changes in nuclear structure. The chapter on atoms, molecules, and ions introduced the basic idea of nuclear structure, that the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons and, with the exception of ${ }_{1}^{1} \\mathrm{H}$, neutrons. Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the mass number (A). Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same element. When referring to a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the notation ${ }_{Z}^{A} \\mathrm{X}$, where X is the symbol for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for example, ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ ). Often a nuclide is referenced by the name of the element followed by a hyphen and the mass number. For example, ${ }_{6}^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is called \"carbon-14.\"",

After the spontaneous expansion took place, the matter was distributed both more widely (occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each flask).\n\n\nFIGURE 12.4 An isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a\nsecond flask containing a vacuum.

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

The two species, $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\\mathrm{aq})$ and $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}(\\mathrm{aq})$, thus show a distinct difference in their redox activity towards copper: the silver ion spontaneously oxidized copper, but the lead ion did not. Electrochemical cells permit this relative redox activity to be quantified by an easily measured property, potential. This property is more commonly called voltage when referenced in regard to electrical applications, and it is a measure of energy accompanying the transfer of charge. Potentials are measured in the volt unit, defined as one joule of energy per one coulomb of charge, $\\mathrm{V}=\\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nWhen measured for purposes of electrochemistry, a potential reflects the driving force for a specific type of charge transfer process, namely, the transfer of electrons between redox reactants. Considering the nature of potential in this context, it is clear that the potential of a single half-cell or a single electrode can't be measured; \"transfer\" of electrons requires both a donor and recipient, in this case a reductant and an oxidant, respectively. Instead, a half-cell potential may only be assessed relative to that of another half-cell. It is only the difference in potential between two half-cells that may be measured, and these measured potentials are called\ncell potentials, E $_{\\text {cell }}$, defined as\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}_{\\text {cell }}=\\mathrm{E}_{\\text {cathode }}-\\mathrm{E}_{\\text {anode }}\n$$",

Instead, they typically use either electrospray ionization ( $E S I$ ) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), typically linked to a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. Both ESI and MALDI are soft ionization methods that produce charged molecules with little fragmentation, even with sensitive biological samples of very high molecular weight.\n\nIn an ESI source, as a sample solution exits the tube, it is subjected to a high voltage that causes the droplets to become charged. The sample molecules gain one or more protons from charged solvent molecules in the droplet. The volatile solvent quickly evaporates, giving variably protonated sample molecules $\\left(M+H_{n}{ }^{n+}\\right)$. In a MALDI source, the sample is adsorbed onto a suitable matrix compound, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, which is ionized by a short burst of laser light. The matrix compound then transfers the energy to the sample and protonates it, forming $\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}_{n}{ }^{n+}$ ions.\n\nFollowing ion formation, the variably protonated sample molecules are electrically focused into a small packet with a narrow spatial distribution, and the packet is given a sudden kick of energy by an accelerator electrode. As each molecule in the packet is given the same energy, $E=m v^{2} / 2$, it begins moving with a velocity that depends on the square root of its mass, $v=\\sqrt{2 E / m}$. Lighter molecules move faster, and heavier molecules move slower. The analyzer itself-the drift tube-is simply an electrically grounded metal tube inside which the different charged molecules become separated as they move at different velocities and take different amounts of time to complete their flight.",

The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.\n\nMore than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in which the separated ions are observed and counted.\n\n\nAmong the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electronimpact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or $6700 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. When a highenergy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cation radical-cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.\n\n\nElectron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral. The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z})$. Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto a detector, which records them as peaks at the various $m / z$ ratios. Since the number of charges $z$ on each ion is usually 1 , the value of $m / z$ for each ion is simply its mass $m$. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the process of electrolysis\n- Compare the operation of electrolytic cells with that of galvanic cells\n- Perform stoichiometric calculations for electrolytic processes\n\nElectrochemical cells in which spontaneous redox reactions take place (galvanic cells) have been the topic of discussion so far in this chapter. In these cells, electrical work is done by a redox system on its surroundings as electrons produced by the redox reaction are transferred through an external circuit. This final section of the chapter will address an alternative scenario in which an external circuit does work on a redox system by imposing a voltage sufficient to drive an otherwise nonspontaneous reaction, a process known as electrolysis. A familiar example of electrolysis is recharging a battery, which involves use of an external power source to drive the spontaneous (discharge) cell reaction in the reverse direction, restoring to some extent the composition of the half-cells and the voltage of the battery. Perhaps less familiar is the use of electrolysis in the refinement of metallic ores, the manufacture of commodity chemicals, and the electroplating of metallic coatings on various products (e.g., jewelry, utensils, auto parts). To illustrate the essential concepts of electrolysis, a few specific processes will be considered.",

Oxygen-15 is an example of a nuclide that undergoes positron emission:\n\n$$\n{ }_{8}^{15} \\mathrm{O} \\longrightarrow{ }_{+1}^{0} \\mathrm{e}+{ }_{7}^{15} \\mathrm{~N} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad{ }_{8}^{15} \\mathrm{O} \\longrightarrow{ }_{+1}^{0} \\beta+{ }_{7}^{15} \\mathrm{~N}\n$$\n\nPositron emission is observed for nuclides in which the n:p ratio is low. These nuclides lie below the band of stability. Positron decay is the conversion of a proton into a neutron with the emission of a positron. The n:p ratio increases, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide.\n\nElectron capture occurs when one of the inner electrons in an atom is captured by the atom's nucleus. For example, potassium-40 undergoes electron capture:\n\n$$\n{ }_{19}^{40} \\mathrm{~K}+{ }_{-1}^{0} \\mathrm{e} \\longrightarrow{ }_{18}^{40} \\mathrm{Ar}\n$$\n\nElectron capture occurs when an inner shell electron combines with a proton and is converted into a neutron. The loss of an inner shell electron leaves a vacancy that will be filled by one of the outer electrons. As the outer electron drops into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an X-ray. Like positron emission, electron capture occurs for \"proton-rich\" nuclei that lie below the band of stability. Electron capture has the same effect on the nucleus as does positron emission: The atomic number is decreased by one and the mass number does not change. This increases the n:p ratio, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Whether electron capture or positron emission occurs is difficult to predict. The choice is primarily due to kinetic factors, with the one requiring the smaller activation energy being the one more likely to occur.",

X-Ray Crystallography - \nThe size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining waves' maxima are separated (see Figure 10.63).\n\n\nConstructive interface\n(a)\n\n\nDestructive interface\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 10.63 Light waves occupying the same space experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b) intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and minima.\n\nWhen X-rays of a certain wavelength, $\\lambda$, are scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, $d$, they may undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, $n$, of the wavelength.

H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. Figure 10.64 illustrates two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive interference.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.
