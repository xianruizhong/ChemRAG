It is possible to obtain ε α (N − 1/2) without explicitly removing half an electron from the molecule. This is achieved by evaluating the following inner product: 11,12 \nε α (N − 1/2) = φ α − ∇ 2 2 + v ext + v H + v XC − V S φ α .(2)\nHere, we denote the HOMO wavefunction of a system with N electrons as φ α , while the external (v ext ), Hartree (v H ) and exchange-correlation (v XC ) potentials are the contributions to the KS potential. The term V S , called self-energy potential due to its similarity to its electrostatic counterpart, carries the information about the half-ionization. 20 It can be expressed as the difference between the KS potentials of the N and N − 1/2 electron systems, respectively. 11,12 Conceptually, V S is the potential needed to create half a hole in the HOMO. 11,12 A good approximation to V S is to consider it as a sum of the self-energy potentials of its atoms, 12\nV S (compound) ∼ = i V S (f i , atom i ),(3)\nwhere f i is the fractional charge removed from the i-th atom. Each self-energy potential V S (f i , atom i ) is then obtained in a separate calculation, as a difference between the KS potential of the atom and its corresponding ion with charge f i . f i should reflect how much each atom contributes to the HOMO of the actual system. To create the half hole, the total degree of ionization must satisfy i f i = 1/2. Equation (3) enables us to easily obtain the self-energy potential of a system, without half-ionizing it, as just the constituent atoms need to be ionized separately.",

Table 3 shows comparisons of approximations to χ ̅ in larger molecules. The real take-away from Table 3 is the notable agreement in absolute values of χ ̅ DFT* PBE , χ ̅ DFT* B3LYP , and χ ̅ MRCI . Our XC-corrected average electron energies χ ̅ DFT* are also systematically larger than χ ̅ orb HF . We can attribute the difference in energy to the missing correlation energy in a HF description.\n\nComplementary estimates to χ ̅ obtained from the averaging of photoionization peaks, i.e., χ ̅ IP values, are in part provided as a small test set for the experimental quantum chemistry approach of eq 4 in Table S1. Estimates of χ ̅ IP are clearly smaller in absolute terms, compared to χ ̅ DFT* , χ ̅ orb HF , and χ ̅ MRCI , as expected from electronic relaxation effects. 76 We note, however, that a linear regression of χ ̅ MRCI and χ ̅ IP in our test set of molecules has a coefficient of determination (r 2 ) of 0.9998, implying that relative measures, Δχ ̅ , can be productively approached experimentally ( Figure S1).",

At the CASSCF and MRCI+Q levels of theory, the computed ionization energies of N 2 are 16.33 eV and 15.52 eV, respectively, whereas those of atomic nitrogen are 13.37 eV and 14.45 eV. Thus, MRCI+Q yields ionization energies in good agreement with experiment whereas CASSCF does not.For stretched N 2 with r = 3.0 a 0 the charge transfer reaction energy of N + +N 2 → N+N + 2 is 0.84 eV and -0.38 eV at the CASSCF and MRCI+Q level of theory, respectively. Therefore, the triplet ground state may become the charge transfer state associated with the N+N + 2 dissociation limit. Even though these are rather high-energy regions of the PES, this aspect has to be monitored, as the CASSCF algorithm will converge to different solutions depending on the initial orbital guess if the natural orbitals between which the charge transfer occurs are spatially sufficiently separated and can therefore not mix.Figure 7illustrates such a case: at r = 3 a 0 two different CASSCF solutions for the lowest 3 A state are obtained depending on the initial orbital guess for values of R above ≈ 6 a 0 .

Since this Green's function is not selfconsistent, it will carry a starting reference dependence.\n\nSince the Green's function obtained by self-consistent or non-self-consistent GF2 is expressed on an imaginary grid, we aim to employ the Extended Koopman's Theorem (EKT) [33,34,36,37,39,44,45] to obtain ionization potentials and electron affinities, which are real axis quantities and can be used to produce the spectral density of states A(ω) expressed as A(ω) = − 1 π Tr[Im G(ω)S].

While the backbone of proteins strongly absorbs at wavelengths shorter than 250 nm (corresponding to photon energies higher than 5 eV), some amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) and nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil) and the corresponding nucleosides/nucleotides show intense absorption bands at longer deep UV (DUV) wavelengths, between 250 and 300 nm (photon energies between 4 and 5 eV). These bands correspond to the pp* transitions of the aromatic rings within these molecules, which are clearly separated from their backbone absorption. Other important molecular cofactors, such as avins, plastoquinones, thiobases and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, display absorption bands at even longer near UV (NUV) wavelengths (300-400 nm, corresponding to 3.2-4 eV photon energies). In addition, UV absorbing molecules are typically small enough to enable highly accurate computations of their energy level structure and dynamics, allowing the effective benchmarking of computational approaches with experiments. 17,18 This multitude of spectroscopic targets makes 2DES spectroscopy in the UV region (2DUV) a powerful investigation tool for the photophysics and photochemistry of biomolecular processes.",

Importantly, the first VDE of p-HBDI − in aqueous solution (6.8 ± 0.1 eV) was found to be more than double that of the deprotonated chromophore in vacuo (2.73 ± 0.01 eV) 60 and very similar to that in the S65T-GFP protein (7.1 eV). 59 This contrasts with the VEE of the first electronically excited singlet state of p-HBDI − , which is very similar in the gas-phase and protein and blue-shifted in aqueous solution. 56",

The model predicts six electronic states in C 2v symmetry, although transitions to the state of A 2 symmetry are electric dipole forbidden. 15 The intense long wavelength band is assigned to two overlapping bands centered at 312 and 286 nm, both of B 1 symmetry. The weaker feature at 250 nm is attributed to unresolved transitions to B 2 and A 1 states. A state of A 1 symmetry is responsible for the intense short wavelength absorption band at 214 nm. Subsequent magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements, however, suggest that the first absorption band corresponds to excitation to states of B 1 and B 2 symmetry and identify the state responsible for the band at 248 nm as A 1 . 16 The MCD measurements also reveal a weak shoulder near the long-wavelength onset of the first absorption band that was attributed to a nominally forbidden transition, most probably a triplet state. 16 Electronic structure calculations on CH 2 I 2 are limited and the predicted electronic state symmetries disagree with the exciton model. Zheng and Phillips used time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to characterize the first five singlet (and triplet) excited electronic states, resulting in assignments that agree with the interpretation of the MCD experiments. 17 More recent calculations have characterized the electronic states using the CASPT2 method 18 and TD-DFT, 19 although only the former study included spin-orbit coupling. Unsurprisingly for a molecule with two iodine atoms many of the excited states have strongly mixed singlet and triplet character. An apparent discrepancy between the CASPT2 and earlier TD-DFT results in the identification of the excited valence states can be attributed to the choice of coordinate system, which switches the B 1 and B 2 labels. Here we adopt the convention established first, in which the C 2 symmetry axis is defined as the z-axis and the y-axis is normal to the heavy atom plane.",

N is considered a quantum number and can be constant and take on only whole integer values. A transition where n=1 is known as a fundamental absorption. These fundamental absorptions are about 100 times less energetic in the NIR region and less energetic means longer wavelength. When n is greater than 1, the transition is known as an overtone. By looking at Equation 2, it is evident that as n increases, the energy to be absorbed also increases. This in turn indicates that shorter wavelengths will need to be absorbed. These absorptions generally occur in the NIR region. Equation 2 predicts fairly well the absorptions of two atoms bonded together (called diatomic molecules), but does not take into account all of the surrounding effects for polyatomic (many atom) molecules, such as overlapping absorption bands or hydrogen bonding. Organic molecules exist in energy states that absorb NIR wavelengths (energies). Metals, such as silver, lead, and most inorganics, cannot absorb NIR light because they have electrons incapable of absorbing NIR wavelengths, therefore there is no interaction to measure. Generally, only organic molecules can absorb wavelengths in the NIR region. It is actually the energy state of a molecule which allows us to perform a measurement with NIR. Now imagine a sample made up of many, many electrons, protons and neutrons. These particles are arranged into atoms, and further into molecules. The sample can be made of different types of molecules, meaning there can be water molecules, protein molecules and so on. When they take on these arrangements, they also take on different properties such as the ability to absorb different wavelengths of light, therefore, quite a few different energies might be absorbed. When a measurement is performed on this sample, what the instrument is measuring is the number of photons which undergo the absorption process for a particular wavelength. The number of photons absorbed is proportional to the amount of particular type of molecule present in the sample. This statement is more or less Beer's Law which states that \"absorption is proportional to concentration.\" In principle, that is what is occurring and is the basis for an NIR measurement.

Using specifically developed optic instrumentation, Popp [101] obtained quantitative measurements of the extremely weak photon emission (not to be confused with bioluminescence) of all living organisms in the visible and UV region, first observed by Gurwitsch and Gurwitsch in 1922 [102]. He proved the coherent (laser) properties of these so-called 'biophotons', defined as coherent photons produced by living organisms [103,104] but absent at death. Biophotons may be produced by DNA [98,[103][104][105][106] and by microtubules, whereby excited water plays a particular role [98,99,106]. Their coherent nature allows holograms to be generated, with all the remarkable properties of the latter including distributedness and extremely high information density, and offering the possibility of constructive (within cells) and destructive (between cells) interference [92,104]. Popp proposes that biophotons are ideally suited to coordinating the behavior of otherwise independent molecules located at distant places in cells, tissues, organs and even the whole body; and they could do this at the speed of light. Popp [88] concluded in a general way: 'biophotons may well provide the necessary activation energy for triggering all biochemical reactions in a cell at the right time at the right place'. In that respect, they are responsible for the common observation that a body acts as a single unit, despite it being composed of innumerable individual molecules. Precisely this unity of behavior constitutes the problem with which Schrödinger struggled. Of course, the coherent nature of biophotons would be dispersed if they had to trave through a non-coherent cytoplasm, as assumed by MT.",

However, the UV spectra [11,12] and the present energy-loss spectra measured at conditions, which favour excitation of the optically-allowed transitions, indicate that the 4.9, 6.4 and 7.2 eV excitation bands display asymmetric shapes. These bands were approximated by the bi-Gaussian profiles that is functions describing each wing of the profile by its own width. The initial series of the profiles, that was introduced into the fitting was constructed from the bands of the singlet states derived from the UV photoabsorption measurements and the new bands in the energy-loss spectra, which may correspond to the optically-forbidden transitions. For example, the 4.9 eV band was approximated by two profiles, a Gaussian and a bi-Gaussian profiles, following the observation of two singlet states in the UV spectrum [11]. The 4.0 eV energy-loss band, on the ground of its variation with E R and Θ, was approximated by two Gaussians. The constructed set of twelve initial profiles describing the energy-loss spectra were optimized to obtain the best fit to the all fourteen measured spectra. This was achieved by carrying out single fits in narrower, but overlapping, energy ranges (∼1.5 eV wide) in the individual spectra. These steps reduced the number of simultaneously determined parameters, energies and widths, of the functions and increased reliability of the fitting. The single fits were reiterated over the whole energy regions of the spectra and the fitting routine was interrupted when a satisfactory agreement was obtained for all experimental energy-loss spectra. It is worth noting that the energy positions and widths of the excitation bands deduced from the fourteen individual energy-loss spectra deviated from their average values by not more than ±30 and ±50 meV, respectively. The same procedure was applied in our recent study of electronic excitation of pyrimidine [41]. Figures 4 and 5 present the quality of fitting and the positions of the inferred excitation bands in the energy regions below 6 eV and above 5.5 eV, respectively, in the selected spectra.",

To illustrate this, the absorption spectrum of Rhodamine 6G in water was measured using UV−vis spectroscopy over the range 200−1000 nm. The imaginary part of α is derived using eq 1, see Figure 1a, and assumed to be zero outside that range. The real part is then calculated numerically from the KK integrals (eqs 2 and 3) and shown in Figure 1b. The effect of including UV peaks is also investigated by comparing this to the same calculation but setting the absorbance to zero below 400 nm. The difference between the two, that is, the real part of the polarizability due to UV absorption, is shown in the inset of Figure 1b. As expected, this exhibits strong features in the near-UV region but also a nonzero contribution above 400 nm. If we are only interested in the response in the visible region, then this contribution from the UV peaks is real and approximately constant at α UV = 2.6 × 10 −39 S.I. This value is large enough to affect theoretical predictions quantitatively and qualitatively in some cases and must therefore be taken into account.",

Among these sources we distinguish: (a) the lifetime broadening due to the nite lifetime of the excited state; (b) homogeneous broadening (also known as dynamic disorder) which originates from the interaction of the chromophore with its environment; (c) inhomogeneous broadening (also known as static disorder) which accounts for the different instantaneous local environment felt by each chromophore in the sample or for the different conformations explored by an aggregate of chromophores at a given instant in time. Moreover, the coupling between the electronic structure and the intramolecular nuclear degrees of freedom induces uctuations of the transition energies 3 i of a few thousand cm À1 . These uctuations introduce a vibrational ne structure and intensity beats into the spectral signatures. Finally, non-adiabatic population transfer between electronic states translates into intensity dynamics of their spectral signatures. The eld of theoretical spectroscopy deals with developing generalized models for incorporating the above phenomena into the simulations beyond the phenomenological treatment of eqn (4) which would enable comparison with the experiment, as well as with the development of methods for extracting physical quantities associated with the phenomena responsible for the lineshapes from the raw experimental data. [75][76][77] Much less attention has been devoted to the accurate computation of the transition energies 3 i and the transition dipole moments m ij , the key ingredients required for simulating the third-order nonlinear response recorded in 2DUV maps.

Here instead of summing up the momenta of all nuclei, let us consider each individual P µ = ⟨χ|p µ |χ⟩ R , wherê p µ = −i∇ Rµ + A µ . Once again, we use the Heisenberg equation of motion to arrive at\ndP µ dt = i⟨χ|[Ĥ n ,p µ ]|χ⟩ R + ⟨χ|∂ tpµ |χ⟩ R = ⟨χ|E µ |χ⟩ R + i⟨χ|[t n ,p µ ]|χ⟩ R .(11)\nLet us denote Q µ = i⟨χ|[t n ,p µ ]|χ⟩ R . The fact that dP µ /dt and ⟨χ|E µ |χ⟩ R are both real implies Q µ is real.

We work to order 1/c 2 and assume that the leading-order contribution to A is of order 1/c 2 . According to the principle of minimal coupling, the Hamiltonian in the Dirac rep-resentation becomes [17] \nH = cα α α · (p − qA) + βmc 2 + qΦ,(15)\nwhere q is the electron's electric charge. It is important now to distinguish between the canonical momentum p = p =p + O(1/c 3 ) and the total kinetic momentum π π π = p − qA =π π π + O(1/c 3 ) of the electron. It isπ π π rather thanp that obeys the Lorentz force law [32,33,49],\ndπ π π dt = q(E + α α α × B).(16)\nHere, E = E(r, t) = −∇ ∇ ∇Φ −Ȧ is the electric field and B = B(r, t) = ∇ ∇ ∇ × A is the magnetic field. The absence of explicit magnetic-dipole moment terms in (16) agrees with the view that the magnetic-dipole moment of the electron is an emergent feature, due to the electron's Zitterbewegung [18,24,27,28,34].\n\n\nA.

However, this leaves the fourth term unaccounted for. To proceed, we must recognise that the kinetic momentum should be cast in terms of the kinetic velocityv q , rather than the mean velocityv M . This leads us to recast the spin-dependent term in (21) as\n− βq(s × ∇ ∇ ∇Φ) 2mc 2 = βq(s × ∇ ∇ ∇Φ) 2mc 2 − βq(s × ∇ ∇ ∇Φ) mc 2 = βm(v q −v M ) +m ×Ê c 2 + O( 1 c 3 ),(22)\nwithm = βqs/m the magnetic-dipole moment of the electron.

(23)\nThus,p is comprised of relativistically corrected kinetic momentum terms (βmv q +p 2p /2m 2 c 2 ), an electromagnetic momentum term (qA) and, pleasingly, a hidden momentum term (m × E/c 2 ) with the prototypical form described in the introduction. We attribute this hidden momentum to a modification of the electron's Zitterbewegung by the electric field E. For the special case in which E is due to a \"test particle\", a complementary result was derived in [8]. A similar result was derived in [23], but with no explicit recognition of the hidden momentum. Note that the total kinetic momentumπ π π includes the hidden momentumm × E/c 2 . The hidden momentumm × E/c 2 is small, its expectation value being < ∼ −qh|E|/2mc 2 = |E| × 10 −40 A.s 2 in magnitude.",

Significantly stronger electric fields can be found in heavy atoms and molecules [63], in which case the hidden momentum might be significantly larger.\n\nIn the calculation leading to (34), the emergence of the hidden momentum can be traced to the '1' in the spinorbit factor f k (a translating magnetic-dipole moment resembles an electric-dipole moment [23,35,54]) whilst the emergence of the momentum difference m k (v k −v k ) can be traced to the '−q k /2m k γ k ' (Thomas precession [23,35,[55][56][57]).

The mean position takes on a simple form in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation [18,20],\nr M = r.(6)\nLoosely speaking,r M can be thought of as the kinetic position in the electron's rest frame, actively boosted with appropriate velocity [16,21,29,30]. It isr M that is usually regarded as being 'the' position of the electron in low-energy studies [18,31], although one can argue that the kinetic positionr q is closer to the classical notion of position for a particle like the electron [23]. The 'mean' terminology introduced in [18] forr M and other quantities is something of a misnomer -it isr q rather thanr M that embodies the electron's 'average' position [24]. The components of the velocityv q = dr q /dt = cα α α of charge [32,33] support discrete eigenvalues of ±c whilst the kinetic velocityv q = dr q /dt = βc 2 p/E p [23] and mean velocityv M = dr M /dt = βc 2 p/E p [18] vary continuously with p and are equal. Here,\nE p = m 2 c 4 + c 2 p 2 .(7)\nThe above can be summarised as follows: quantity definition position of charger q = r kinetic positionr q = 1\n4 1 H , Ĥ ,r q mean positionr M = r velocity of chargev q = cα α α kinetic velocityv q = βc 2 p/E p mean velocityv M = βc 2 p/E p momentump =p = p (8)\nwhere we have used curly brackets to indicate anticommutators.\n\n\nB.

More details can be found on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server https://www.cryst.ehu.es/. We see that degeneracies occur at the Γ point and A, and the rest of the bands are split. We now build a short ranged tight-binding model from these orbitals. We will primarily discuss the para-magnetic (spin-unpolarized) DFT results which provide a single-particle band structure. Including Coulomb repulsion favors a ferromagnetic groundstate which is expected due to the flat bands obtained in the tight-binding models.",

It is possible to obtain ε α (N − 1/2) without explicitly removing half an electron from the molecule. This is achieved by evaluating the following inner product: 11,12 \nε α (N − 1/2) = φ α − ∇ 2 2 + v ext + v H + v XC − V S φ α .(2)\nHere, we denote the HOMO wavefunction of a system with N electrons as φ α , while the external (v ext ), Hartree (v H ) and exchange-correlation (v XC ) potentials are the contributions to the KS potential. The term V S , called self-energy potential due to its similarity to its electrostatic counterpart, carries the information about the half-ionization. 20 It can be expressed as the difference between the KS potentials of the N and N − 1/2 electron systems, respectively. 11,12 Conceptually, V S is the potential needed to create half a hole in the HOMO. 11,12 A good approximation to V S is to consider it as a sum of the self-energy potentials of its atoms, 12\nV S (compound) ∼ = i V S (f i , atom i ),(3)\nwhere f i is the fractional charge removed from the i-th atom. Each self-energy potential V S (f i , atom i ) is then obtained in a separate calculation, as a difference between the KS potential of the atom and its corresponding ion with charge f i . f i should reflect how much each atom contributes to the HOMO of the actual system. To create the half hole, the total degree of ionization must satisfy i f i = 1/2. Equation (3) enables us to easily obtain the self-energy potential of a system, without half-ionizing it, as just the constituent atoms need to be ionized separately.",

In the first part, we discuss the basic assumption of the L-S coupling scheme, with which we derive the electronic states of a given electronic configuration. In addition, we use the spectral data of Group 15 elements (configuration np 3 , n = 2 -6), to show that the assumption of the L-S coupling scheme becomes less satisfactory as we go further and further down the Periodic Table. In the second part, we introduce the j-j coupling scheme, which is seldom covered in standard inorganic chemistry texts. We then use two worked examples, one involving nonequivalent electrons and the other containing equivalent electrons, to illustrate how to apply the j-j scheme to derive the electronic states arising from an atomic configuration.\n\nFinally, a correlation between the states derived by L-S and j-j schemes is shown pictorially. By studying both the j-j and the L-S coupling schemes, a student will gain a deeper, as well as a broader, perception of the concept of atomic electronic states.\n\nRiver, NJ, 2011. Using V(r) = -Z/r and <r -3 >  Z 3 /n 3 , it can be surmised that H SO varies as Z 4 /n 3 , where n is the principal quantum number of the outer electron.

At the age of 26 he became an Assistant Professor in theoretical chemistry, worked on X-ray crystal studies, and performed quantum mechanical calculations on molecules and atoms. Studying crystal structures and the types of bonding and coordination that occurred within them, Pauling found out that crystal structures obeyed the rules now known as Pauling's rules [16,17]. In his seminal paper \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry\" [17], Linus Pauling reconstructed the foundations of chemistry -for the first time he explained the structure of molecules in terms of quantum mechanics. Linus Pauling described it this way: \"From Richard C. Tolman, Harry Bateman, and other remarkable teachers at Caltech, I obtained an excellent grounding in chemistry, physics, and mathe matics, with emphasis on the old quantum theory and atomic structure. Quantum mechanics was discovered a few months after I had received my PhD degree. The Schrödinger papers on wave mechanics were published about the time that I arrived at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (Professor Arnold Sommerfeld) at the University of Munich in April 1926. I immediately began to apply an approximate quantum mechanical treatment to the problem of the structure of atoms with many electrons and to simple molecules, making use of the treatments of the hydrogen molecule-ion and hydrogen molecule that had been formulated by Ø. Burrau, E.U. Condon, W. Heitler, and F. London.\n\nThese new ideas had applications to many aspects of chemistry. The applications included the nature of square, tetrahedral, and octahedral coordination complexes of metals; the stability of aromatic substances as determined by the resonance energy; the planarity of resonating and conjugated systems of single and double bonds; the secondary structures of proteins and the importance of the hydrogen bond in proteins, polynucleotides, and other substances; and the nature of interatomic forces in metals\" [18].",

They described the interaction between the positron and the target by means of a potential V s (r) + V p (r), where V s (r) is the full electrostatic potential of the ground-state molecule, and V p (r) is a CPP. This potential has the correct form V p (r) ≃ −α d /2r 4 at large distances. Solving the Schrödinger equation for the positron wave function ϕ k (r) yields the scattering amplitude and cross section, and ϕ k (r) is then used in Eq. (20) to calculate Z eff . Jain and Thompson (1983) showed that it is important to go beyond this approximation and include the effect of distortion of the electron density by the positron. This led to an increase of Z eff values for CH 4 by a factor of two. Their final result for CH 4 , Z eff = 99.5 at ε = 0.025 eV, is reasonably close to, but still smaller than the experimental room-temperature value Z eff = 142 ± 1 (Wright et al., 1983). They concluded that the remaining discrepancy could be removed in a better positron-molecule calculation. More significantly, they also concluded that the somewhat large, measured Z eff value was not the result of the formation of a positron-molecule complex. As discussed in Sec. II.D, this is in complete agreement with the current understanding of the way in which positron-molecule virtual states can enhance low-energy Z eff values.",

Research on the alkanes and similar molecules since that time [2,3,4] uncovered a rapid growth of Z eff with the size of the molecule and very strong chemical sensitivity of Z eff .

Annihilation basics\n\nThe process of electron-positron annihilation is described by quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the nonrelativistic Born approximation, the cross section for annihilation into two photons averaged over the electron and positron spins is (Berestetskii et al., 1982) \nσ 2γ = πr 2 0 c v ,(4)\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the two particles. This cross section obeys the 1/v threshold law which describes inelastic collisions with fast particles in the final state (Landau and Lifshitz, 1977). The two-photon annihilation described by Eq. (4) is allowed only when the total spin S of the electron-positron pair is zero. For S = 1 the smallest possible number of annihilation photons is three. The corresponding spinaveraged cross section is (Berestetskii et al., 1982) \nσ 3γ = 4 3 (π 2 − 9)αr 2 0 c v ,(5)\nwhere α = e 2 / c (in cgs units) is the fine structure constant, α ≈ 1/137. Since σ 3γ is 400 times smaller than σ 2γ , positron annihilation in many-electron systems is dominated by the two-gamma process. Numerically, the cross section in Eq. (4) is σ 2γ ∼ 10 −8 c/v a.u. 5 Hence the annihilation rate is usually much smaller than the rates for other atomic collision processes, even at low positron velocities (e.g., thermal, v ∼ 0.05 a.u. at 300 K). When a fast positron, such as that emitted in a β + decay, moves through matter, it loses energy quickly through collisions, first by direct ionization, positronium formation and electronic excitation, and then by vibrational excitation and elastic collisions. As a result, the positrons typically slow to thermal energies (i.e., ∼ 25 meV for T = 300 K) before annihilation.",

See text for details. analysis, not presently understood, is that the relative magnitudes of the high-energy and lower-energy peaks in the alkanes remain the same over a factor of 3 in molecular size and a factor of 10 3 in the magnitude of Z eff . The resulting self-similar spectra shift downward with increasing molecular size as the positron binding energy increases. As discussed in Sec. VII, this has the consequence that the Z eff spectrum, measured with thermal positrons, can be assigned to the vibrational modes populated through the corresponding VFRs in the thermal energy range.

Firstly, we do the electronic-structure calculation without considering the perturbation by positron to obtain the ground-state electronic density n e− ( r) and Coulomb potential V Coul ( r) sensed by positron. Then, the positron density is determined by solving the Kohn-Sham Eq.:\n[− 1 2 ∇ r +V Coul ( r) +V corr ( r)]ψ + = ε + ψ + , n e+ ( r) = |ψ + ( r)| 2 ,(1)\nwhere V corr ( r) is the correlation potential between electron and positron. Finally, the positron lifetime can be obtained by the inverse of the annihilation rate, which is proportional to the product of positron density and electron density accompanied by the so-called enhancement factor arising from the correlation energy between a positron and electrons [21]. The equations are written as follows:\nτ e+ = 1 λ , λ = πr 2 0 c d rn e− ( r)n e+ ( r)γ(n e− ),(2)\nwhere r 0 is the classical electron radius, c is the speed of light, and γ(n e− ) is the enhancement factor of the electron density at the position r. The positron affinity can be calculated by adding electron and positron chemical potentials together:\nA + = µ − + µ + .(3)\nThe positron chemical potential µ + is determined by the positron ground-state energy. The electron chemical potential µ − is derived from the Fermi energy (top energy of the valence band) in the case of a metal (a semiconductor). This scheme is still accurate for a perfect lattice, as in this case the positron density is delocalized and vanishingly small at every point thus does not affect the bulk electronic-structure [6,21]. In practice of this work, each enhancement factor is applied identically to all electrons as suggested by K. O. Jensen [22]. These enhancement factors can be divided into two categories: the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and parameterized by the following equation,",

In this scheme the (Z + 1)-particle wave function is expanded in a Cartesian Gaussian basis set, with the functions centered on the atomic nuclei and on additional centers outside the molecule. The latter are important for representing electron-positron correlation effects. This method has been applied to H 2 (Lino et al., 1998), N 2 (de Carvalho et al., 2000), C 2 H 4 (da Silva et al., 1996), and C 2 H 2 (de Carvalho et al., 2003). In all cases the differential and total elas-tic scattering cross sections are in good agreement with the experimental data. In contrast, the calculated Z eff values for room-temperature positron energies (do N. Varella et al., 2002) are well below the measured thermal data, namely, Z eff = 7.3 vs 14.8 for H 2 (McNutt et al., 1979), 9.3 vs 30.5 for N 2 (Heyland et al., 1982), 73 vs 1200 for C 2 H 4 (Iwata et al., 1994), and 145 vs 3160 for C 2 H 2 (Iwata et al., 1997a). 17 The discrepancy for H 2 and N 2 is most likely due to a lack of basis functions that describe short-range electron-positron correlations. The much larger gap between the theory and experiment for ethylene and acetylene has a different origin. As discussed in Sec. IV.C, the energy-resolved Z eff data for both molecules show large contributions of resonant annihilation that cannot be described by a fixednuclei calculation.",

(45) over the initial target states using the Boltzmann factors exp(−E v /k B T ), and the Maxwellian positron energy distribution. For alkanes with 3-8 carbons such a fit gives the binding energies ε b = 22, 42, 65, 90, 103 and 122 meV, respectively. These values are in good agreement with those measured in the positron-beam experiments (cf . Table V). However, the dependence of Z eff on the positron energy predicted by Eq. (45) is in striking disagreement with the measured energy-resolved Z eff , as shown in Fig. 5 for butane and octane. The Z eff values from Eq. (45) decrease monotonically, the increase in N (ε+E v ) being faster than that of the density ρ. In contrast, the experimental Z eff spectra show resonant peaks corresponding to the vibrational fundamentals (downshifted by ε b , cf. Fig. 1), and the peak Z eff values exceed the predictions of Eq. (45) by a factor of ∼ 50. Thus the model that assumes complete statistical mixing with all vibrational excitations coupled to the positron continuum, does not explain either the resonant structure or the large values of Z eff that are observed.",

Where possible, for each species, comparison is made between the present results and those from earlier measurements and calculations. The agreement between the present and earlier experimental results, within the overall uncertainties on the data, is typically satisfactory for energies greater than about 8 eV, but is only marginal at lower positron impact energies. While N 2 , CO and C 2 H 2 possess 14 electrons each, we find significant differences in the magnitudes of their respective TCSs and subtle differences in the energy dependence of these TCSs. These details are discussed in depth in this paper.\n\nIntroduction",

The corresponding peak in Z eff occurs at 330 meV, as compared with the vibrational mode frequency of 365 meV, indicating that ε b = 35 meV.

They can be separated into two classes. There is a class of stable molecular anions with large electron affinities ∼ 1-3 eV (Rienstra-Kiracofe et al., 2002). In these anions, the excess electron occupies an unfilled orbital in the valence shell of the molecule, and they have no positron analog.\n\nA second arguably less well-studied class of negative ions is closely related to the positron-molecule complexes discussed here (Abdoul-Carime and Desfrançois, 1998;Abdoul-Carime et al., 2002;Desfrançois et al., 1994Desfrançois et al., , 2004. In these \"dipole-bound anions,\" the electron is only weakly bound to the target by a combination of dipolar, quadrapolar, and polarization forces (Abdoul-Carime and Desfrançois, 1998;Gutowski et al., 1998). Because of the small binding energy, the wave function of the excess electron is diffuse, residing predominantly outside the molecule due to the Pauli exclusion principle. In the positron-molecule case, the analogous short-range repulsion is due to the positive charges of atomic cores. The minimum dipole moment required for the formation of stable anions of common closed-shell molecules has been determined experimentally to be 2-2.5 D (Desfrançois et al., 1994), in qualitative agreement with the critical dipole moment of 3.6 D, predicted by Eq.

It neglects the coupling V between the electron-positron and nuclear (vibrational) degrees of freedom.\n\nThe second term describes positron capture into the vibrational Feshbach resonances. It is present for molecules that can bind the positron. These resonances correspond to vibrationally-excited states Ψ ν of the positronmolecule complex, embedded in the positron continuum. They occur when the positron energy ε = k 2 /2 is close to ε ν = E ν −ε b , where ε b is the positron binding energy, and E ν is the vibrational excitation energy of the positronmolecule complex. Equation (21) has the appearance of a standard perturbation-theory formula, but the energies of the positron-molecule quasibound states Ψ ν in the de-\nnominator are complex, ε ν − i 2 Γ ν , where Γ ν = Γ a ν +Γ e ν +Γ i ν\nis the total width of the resonance. In atomic units Γ ν is equal to the decay rate of the resonant state. It contains contributions of positron annihilation and elastic escape, Γ a ν and Γ e ν , respectively, and possibly also the inelastic escape rate Γ i ν .

It is enhanced at small positron momenta by the presence of a weakly bound (or virtual) state [11,30].\n\nIn a recent paper [1], measurements of Z eff for CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br using a cold trap-based positron beam have been reported. The energy dependence of Z eff for these molecules (and CH 3 F measured earlier [22]) shows peaks close to the vibrational mode energies. This points to an important contribution of resonant annihilation in all three molecules, although the maximum Z eff value for CH 3 F (250) is much lower than those for CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br (1600 and 2000, respectively).\n\nThese molecules have C 3v symmetry, and all six of their vibrational modes are infrared active (see Table I for CH 3 Cl). Methyl halides are also relatively small, which means that IVR may not take place [31]. This makes them ideal for application of our theory. Equatons (4), (7), and (8) allow one to calculate the contribution of all VFR to Z res eff , and the only free parameter of the theory, i.e., the positron binding energy, can be chosen by comparison with experimental Z eff .",

Figure 33 shows positron binding energies for molecules as a function of α d . Also shown are the theoretical values for three atoms, Be, Zn, and Cd . This figure suggests an approximately linear relationship between ε b and α d for groups of homologous species. Based on this, the analysis of Danielson et al. (2009) began with a linear fit of ε b to α d for alkanes. However, as seen in Fig. 33, this fit generally underestimates the binding energies for other classes of molecules, most notably those with permanent dipole moments and aromatic molecules. This motivated the inclusion of two additional parameters in the analysis, namely the molecular dipole moment µ and the number of π bonds N π for aromatic molecules. Such use of the bonds is similar to the approach used by Miller (1990) to parametrize the molecular polarizability.",

While for ethane its energy is close to the mode energy of C-H stretch vibrations (0.37 eV), for heavier alkanes the resonances appear at an energy ∼ 20 meV lower for each carbon added. This downward shift provides evidence of positron binding to molecules. The binding energies observed increase from about 14 meV in C 3 H 8 to 205 meV in C 12 H 26 .

For example, the valence electron configuration of 2p 2 for the carbon atom gives rise to three terms: 3 P < 1 P < 1 D. Spin-orbit interaction between L and S then causes relatively small intervals of each term for different possible values of J.\n\nFor example, the lowest-energy term for the carbon atom can have three possible J values, with the energy-level ordering: 3 P 0 < 3 P 1 < 3 P 2 . It is clear, with this scheme, each electronic state is defined by quantum numbers L, S, and J.",

For brevity the notation does not emphasize that the noninteracting states also depend on W (interacting quantities, of course, do not depend on W ). Finally note an important point: in the expressions above, we have also used the fact that given a singletstate (ss) and three triplet states (ts −1 , ts 0 and ts 1 ) involving any pair of single-particle orbitals, we can write (in short-hand) 1 4 |ss ss| + sz |ts sz ts sz | = 1 4 σ,σ ∈↑,↓ |σσ σσ |, where the latter are the four Sldets formed on the same set of spin-restricted spatial orbitals. Working with such averaged states is acceptable here, because we are interested in excitations behaviours between different spatial Irreps, rather than excitation behaviours between different spin states.",

Spectra of acetylenex 2 bend n 7 y 2 bend L = |l| line list is relatively small in comparison to other polyatomic molecules of this size, largely due to the fact that the K = L condition limits the number of allowed rotational substates in a vibrational band. As vibrational states go up quickly in energy with increasing n bend , their energy will also rise quickly with increasing values of L. We therefore do not expect high values of L to contribute until much higher energies. TROVE uses a multi-step contraction scheme. At step 1, the stretching primitive basis functions φn 1 (ξ1), φn 2 (ξ2) and φn 3 (ξ3) are generated using the Numerov-Cooley approach (Yurchenko et al. 2007;Noumerov 1924;Cooley 1961) as eigenfunctions of the corresponding 1D reduced stretching Hamiltonian operatorsĤ (1D) i , obtained by freezing all other degrees of freedom at their equilibrium values in the J = 0 Hamiltonian. For the bending basis functions, φn 4 (ξ4), . . . , φn 7 (ξ7), 1D harmonic oscillators are used. These seven 1D basis sets are then combined into three subgroups\nφ (1D) n 1 (ξ1) = φn 1 (ξ1),(3)φ (2D) n 2 n 3 (ξ2, ξ3) = φn 2 (ξ2)φn 3 (ξ3),(4)\nφ (4D) n 4 n 5 n 6 n 7 (ξ4, ξ5, ξ6, ξ7) = φn 4 (ξ4)φn 5 (ξ5)φn 6 (ξ6)φn 7 (ξ7)",

We have also included some increments that are suitable for alkynes (Ct carbons), that Benson did not originally define.

This fact is due to the symmetry of the degenerate bending mode with respect to the plane perpendicular to the plane of vibration. We can also note an interesting property of high order force constants containing the bending coordinates, coming from the equivalence of the two bending vibration planes:\nF 2 a ,2 a ,2 a ,2 a = F 2 b ,2 b ,2 b ,2 b = F 2 a ,2 a ,2 b ,2 b /3.\nThe pure vibrational energy levels relative to the ground-state energy level are listed in Tables 3-5 for the molecules HCN, OCS, and HCP, respectively. In these tables the fundamental energy levels as well as some overtones are presented. Three approximations have been used in these tables: harmonic (Approximation 0), and Approximations 1 and 2 differing in the way in which the V operator was truncated, cf. Section 6. The results are compared with the experimental data when available. The experimental data for the energies and rotational constants were taken from Ref. [30] for HCN, Refs. [36,79,80] for OCS, and Refs. [52,53] for HCP. Additionally, Figures 1-3 show selected energy levels for lowest few bending modes of HCN, HCP, and OCS calculated via all three methods and compared with the experiment. Differences between the theoretical and the experimental results are also reported for better readability of the tables.",

According to the TROVE symmetrization approach these combinations must be processed together, which makes this process extremely slow. In order to facilitate this step we first transform the 4D bending sets (Equation (26)) to become eigenfunctions of the vibrational angular momentum operator,L\nz = ∑ λ,λ ξ λ ζ z λ,λ p λ(28)\nwhere p λ is a vibrational momentum operator and ζ z λ,λ are Coriolis coefficients [39] as described in Ref.

This explains the astonishment shown by the detection of 'abnormally' long bonds, as in the case of single C-C [8] and C-O [9,10] bonds. In fact, the elongated sg eq R of 1.647 Å, 1.659 Å, and 1.704 Å for C-C bond [8] as well as of 1.54 Å [9] and 1.622 Å [10] for C-O bond fall in the first quarter of the bond sg W cov regions as follows from Table 1 and Fig. 4 and is far from the bond dissociation. A few other examples will be given below. The choice was quite subjective, however, the author would like to believe that it highlights the problem under consideration full enough.\n\n\nChemically stretched covalent bonds\n\n\nSingle bonds\n\nThe existence of a region of elongated bonds, characterized by sg W cov , is the manifestation of a freedom that is given to atoms to adapt to different environments formed by surrounding atoms and bonds as well as to provide molecule's photoexcitation and ionization while keeping its integrity. The chemical environment greatly influences the formation of new chemical bonds and the best way to highlight this effect is to trace a consequent polyderivatization of complex molecules. In contrast to practical chemistry, for which any particular polyderivative of, say, fullerene C 60 , is not always completely successful hard work, quantum chemistry may deal with a large family of possible polyderivatives much more easily, when, particularly, additional support is provided by a specific algorithm of polyderivative models construction. Quantum molecular theory of fullerenes suggests such an algorithm, which allows tracing the stepwise polyderivatization of the molecules quite successfully [31]. In particular, fullerene C 60 showed itself as an excellent platform to reveal changes in its geometry in due course of various polyderivation reactions. Moreover, it afforded ground for separate observations of the changes occurred with double-bond carbon core and single-bond additions.\n\nPolyderivatives of fullerene C 60 .",

We calculated the linear density of electronic moment of inertia for cumulene molecule using density functional theory with B3LYP hybrid functional and standard 6-31(d, p) basis set, as implemented in a Gaussian 09 software package 35 . The electron density as a function of coordinates is extracted with the uniform grid of 0.1 Bohr radius (0.0529Å), the symmetric limits in X-Y plane (the plane perpendicular to the prime axis) were chosen ±6.5 Bohr radius (±3.44Å). Either doubling of the limits or decrease of the grid by the same factor change the result by less than 1%.\n\nTo estimate the accuracy of the numerical result we tested the same approach on the hydrogen atom. The theoretical value of the moment of inertia of hydrogen electron cloud in the ground state can be calculated using the electron wave-function 36 as J 0 = 2m e a 2 0 , where m e is electron mass and a 0 is the Bohr radius. The result of numerical calculations obtained using the same method as for cumulene is J num = 1.90m e a 2 0 , which is within 5% accuracy.\n\nIn Figure 3 we show dependence j e (z) obtained from DFT-calculations for H 2 C 11 H 2 . One can see that j e (z) is a smooth function weakly deviating from its average J e /L (∼ 5%), so for simplicity coordinate dependent moment of inertia density j e (z) can be replaced with the constant j e J e /L 1.73 m e ·Å (0.95 · 10 −3 u·Å).

[12] It is not of a fundamental nature: a simple clipped harmonic potential energy function, which can be solved analytically, falls well into the gap. As such, a numerical optimization technique, which varies the potential energy function in a way that maximizes the intrinsic hyperpolarizability, was introduced to yield a better understanding of the nature of what makes a large hyperpolarizability. [13] In that work, Zhou and coworkers found that an oscillating wavefunction serves to localize the wavefunctions in a way that forces the system to have only two dominant excited states that interact with the ground state. [13] This result showed how the three-level ansatz is a natural way for optimizing the intrinsic hyperpolarizability. Based on this observation, Zhou and coworkers proposed that molecules with modulation of conjugation, i.e. with wiggly wavefunctions, may be a new paradigm for making molecules with exceptionally large hyperpolarizabilities.\n\nPérez Moreno and coworkers reported on a series of molecules with varying degrees of modulation in the conjugated bridge between the donor and acceptor ends of these quasi-one-dimensional molecules. [14] Molecules with uneven aromaticity in the bridge, as suggested by Zhou's work, were measured to have larger intrinsic hyperpolarizability than those with a smoother bridge. The best molecule was reported to have a world's record intrinsic hyperpolarizability -50% better than the previous best.\n\nZhou and coworkers continued to study various ways of optimizing the potential energy function and found that modulated conjugation was but one way of getting near the limit. [15] Depending on the starting potential given to the optimization program, the optimized potential can be wiggly or smooth; the wavefunctions for the optimized potential can be strongly overlapping or well separated; and only a few states or many can contribute. In all cases, however, the numerical value of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability is just below 0.71 -about 30% below the fundamental limit. Thus, there appears to be a large number of distinct potential energy functions that yield the same maximum hyperpolarizability.",

A common and versatile approach is simply to compute energies for the components of an isodesmic or homodesmotic reaction using electronic structure theory. Another approach is to use computational methods to obtain an enthalpy of formation, which can then be compared to strain-free estimates generated by Franklin's or Benson's methods [29]. A still more direct approach, however, is to use computational group equivalents: that is, to develop group increments that permit the estimation of a strain-free electronic energy, that can then be directly compared to the result of an actual electronic structure calculation for the compound of interest. The intermediate step of predicting an enthalpy of formation is thus avoided. Wiberg [30,31] first used such an approach in 1984, when HF/6-31G(d) represented a fairly high level of calculation, and Schleyer [32] further elaborated the scheme.\n\nThis direct computational technique offers several advantages. First, once the group increments for a given calculational level are available, only one electronic structure calculation is required to obtain a strain energy for a new molecule of interest: a calculation of that molecule. That stands in contrast to the isodesmic/homodesmotic approach, in which all components of the reaction must be computed. Perhaps more importantly, the approach is conceptually more direct; it removes the unnecessary intermediate step of estimating an experimental heat of formation from an electronic structure calculation, as well as the additional labor and potential sources of error thereby introduced. Finally, one might argue that chemists are most interested, conceptually speaking, in the strain as defined in the pure essence of an electronic energy, without the complications of thermodynamic factors that affect enthalpies at 298K. In such a sense, the ability to define strain energies in terms of energy/enthalpy at absolute zero (with only the zero-point energy as a thermodynamic correction), and in the absence of medium effects, is perhaps a conceptual advantage.",

According to the exponential relaxation observed for many phenomena, this distribution is known to approach the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at high temperature. Indeed, the probability that a white stretch contains precisely ε ‡ beads follows a geometric law plus 1, such that the (ε ‡ + 1)th bead to be drawn should be black. Hence, Fig.2 and whose maxima are precisely obtained when ε = ε ‡ . This simple probability distribution indeed approaches the Boltzmann's one when ε is large enough.

Hence, there is more than an analogy between the Boltzmann and geometric treatments for the infinitesimal probabilities of large systems. For small systems, the simple geometric plus 1 law of Eq.(15) is preferable. The value of the rate constant of Eq.(13) obtained using the simple necklace toy model, is also very similar to the transition-state rate derived from a Hamiltonian, described for example in [5].",

The experiment was carried out in Frankfurt in 1920 by Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach, and was arranged as follows: In a small electrically heated furnace, was bored a tiny hole, through which the vapor flowed into a high vacuum so as to form thereby an extremely thin beam of vapor. The molecules in this so-called atomic or molecular beam all fly forwards in the same direction without any appreciable collisions with one another, and they were registered by means of a detector, the design of which there is unfortunately no time to describe here. On its way between the furnace and the detector the beam is affected by a non-homogeneous magnetic field, so that the atoms-if they really are magnetic-become unlinked in one direction or another, according to the position which their magnetic axes may assume in relation to the field. The classical conception was that the thin and clear-cut beam would consequently expand into a diffuse beam, but in actual fact the opposite proved to be the case. The two experimenters found that the beam divided up into a number of relatively still sharply defined beams, each corresponding to one of the just mentioned discrete positional directions of the atoms in relation to the field. This confirmed the space-quantization hypothesis. Moreover, the experiment rendered it possible to estimate the magnetic factors of the electron, which proved to be in close accord with the univer-sal magnetic unit, the so-called \"Bohr's magneton\". (Sw-RSAS) (www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1943/press.html) Due to the historic significance of the SGE the old physics building in Frankfurt, where the SGE was performed, was chosen by the European Physical Society in 2014 as an \"Historic Site\" in science, another great honor for Stern and Gerlach. Furthermore, the German Physical Society named its highest award for experimental physicists the \"Stern-Gerlach-Medaille\".\nOtto",

We will consider a variety of shapes of potential and boundary conditions. A hard-wall boundary condition is one where the wavefunction vanishes identically, and nothing exists beyond the wall. An asymptotically bound potential is one where the potential diverges as x → ∞, so that the system has only discrete states. Hard walls are a subset of these. Finally, there is the situation that is closer to realistic, where the potential is asymptotically free, i.e., tends to a finite constant. We assume v(x) has a minimum which we choose to be at the origin, and set the constant to make v(0) = 0.

This is usually done system by system. A natural question to ask is if there is a one-to-one correspondence between unit vectors and physical states, meaning that if every unit vector corresponds to a physical system. This is resolved by the following corollary that is a primary ingredient for quantum computation theory (see Ref. [22] Chapter 7).\n\nCorollary 1 All unit vectors of a finite Hilbert space correspond to possible physical states of a system.\n\nUnit vectors are also called pure states. If we know the pure state of a system, we have all physical information about it, and we can calculate the probabilistic outcomes of any potential measurement (see the next postulate). This is a very improbable situation as experimental settings are not perfect, and in most cases, we have only imperfect information about the state. Most generally, we may know that a quantum system can be in one state of a set {|ψ i } with probabilities p i . Therefore, our knowledge of the system is given by an ensemble of pure states described by the set {|ψ i , p i }. If more than one p i is different from zero the state is not pure anymore, and it is called a mixed state. The mathematical tool that describes our knowledge of the system, in this case, is the density operator (or density matrix).\nρ ≡ i p i |ψ i ψ i |.(1)\nDensity matrices are bounded operators that fulfil two mathematical conditions 1. A density matrix ρ has unit trace (Tr[ρ] = 1).\n\n\n2.\n\nA density matrix is a positive matrix ρ > 0.\n\nAny operator fulfilling these two properties is considered a density operator.

In order to fix the notations, we begin with the basics of the two-dimensional electron gas in a magnetic field. The dynamics of the two-dimensional electron gas is described by the Schrödinger equation with the vector potential (−By, 0) and the confining potential V (y) shown schematically in Fig. 3. We can express the eigenfunction in the form of variable separation: Ψ(x, y) = e ikx χ k (y)/ √ L, where k = 2πj/L with an integer j. The transverse part χ k (y) is an eigenfunction of the equation\nH k χ k (y) = Eχ k (y), where H k ≡ p 2 y 2m + mω 2 c 2 (y − y k ) 2 + V (y)(3)\nwith ω c ≡ |e|B/m and y k ≡ k/(|e|B). We label the discrete eigenfunctions with an integer n. The whole solution is then given by Ψ n,k (x, y) = e ikx χ n,k (y)/ √ L with E = E(n, k). As is schematically shown in Fig. 3, the eigenvalue E(n, k) in fact scarcely depends on k in the bulk, where the confining potential V (y) is flat [5,8].\n\nThe Hamiltonian (3) shows that an eigenfunction with the x component of the momentum, k, is centered around y = y k ∝ k. In other words, the state in the upper half of the Hall bar has a current in the positive x direction, while the one in the lower half has a current in the negative x direction. The velocity of the electron in the state Ψ n,k is v (n, k) = 1 ∂E(n, k) ∂k ,\n\nwhich remains finite only near the upper and lower edges. These are the edge currents.\n\n\nElectric and heat currents",

Confined atoms: He and Ne\n\nIn this section we show results for the HOMO energy and the static polarizability as a function of the box radius for two many-electron atoms, He and Ne. In Fig. 2 we show the change in HOMO energy with the wall radius for both He and Ne. The HOMO KS orbital decays exponentially and the wall will therefore have some influence up to ∞ and the free atom value is approached asymptotically. From the figure it is clear that the HOMO energies are already very close to the corresponding free atom values around 4 bohr. We obtain 95% of the free atom He HOMO energy at a radius of 3.06 bohr. For Ne, the radius where 95% of the HOMO energy is obtained is at 3.50 bohr.\n\nIn the region where the HOMO energies are practically leveled off, i.e. after 4 bohr, the difference between the HF and SAOP values is almost constant. For He we find a free atom value of -0.8165 a.u., the HF reference value is -0.9174. For Ne our SAOP free atom energy is -0.7585 a.u. and the reference HF value is -0.8511 a.u.. The differences are a result of the difference between the HF potential and our SAOP potential. The free atom value of He is equal to the HF value when the exact xc-potential is used, but as mentioned in the previous section, this potential is not valid when the atom is enclosed in a box of finite radius. We can try to correct for the shift by vertically shifting the SAOP curves with the free atom energy difference. We show the result in Fig. 3. The shifted He and Ne results are almost on top of the HF results.",

Rutherford on the Photon, Atomic Energy, and the Laws of Nature 11.1. The Photon In a letter dated January 26, 1917, Rutherford nominates Charles Barkla (1877-1944 to the Nobel Prize in Physics. Arriving late, this nomination is taken to be valid for 1918. This is the only nomination Barkla ever receives and is sufficient to earn him, in 1918, the Nobel Prize for 1917, which had not yet been awarded. Barkla's \"competitors\" on the Nobel scene, Einstein and Planck, have each had six nominations in 1918; in 1919, Planck receives the 1918 Prize in Physics. Rutherford nominates Barkla for:\n\n\"his important original contributions to our knowledge of the nature of X-rays, and particularly for his discovery of the characteristic X-radiations of the elements.\n\nThe proof that each element under certain conditions emits an X-radiation of the element is a contribution that, in my opinion, ranks only second in importance to the subsequent discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by Laue. ...\" (Max von Laue had already been awarded the 1914 Nobel Prize.)\n\nIn praising Barkla, at the end of his nomination, Rutherford adds a surprising statement:\n\n\"Professor Barkla was throughout a staunch adherent of the view that X-rays were a type of wave motion, and championed this with vigour when a more materialistic hypothesis appeared to be gaining ground.\"\n\nThis means that, in 1917, neither Barkla nor Rutherford believe in Einstein's photon of 1905! However, a nomination letter by Rutherford in 1929, proposing Richardson to the Prize, suggests that he (perhaps) accepts the photon.\n\nHow fortunate he was not to know about atomic bombs! 11.3.

A profound question is whether there exists a very short program that can calculate the entire history and future of any systems and yield not only the known physical laws but also every single seemingly random elementary event in the systems. For efficiency and practicality, truncating the gradient through the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach may be the way to go by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units 196 .The present paper shows the statistical nature of entropy from the quantum scale in terms of electrons and phonons to the scale of black holes. Yet the second law of thermodynamics is deterministic in dictating the positive entropy production of any internal processes, while the entropy of a system can either increase or decrease depending on the interaction between the system and its surroundings. For example, a system under internal statistical equilibrium has all its macroscopic properties well-defined, while the properties of individual atoms inside the system are truly statistical due to Brownian motion which is also governed by the second law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, one may ask what if the system includes the whole universe or all universes[193][194][195] . Unfortunately, this question could not be answered because there would be no surroundings of the system, thus no observers.This probably reflects the foundational value of the nested formula of the zentropy theory, i.e., coarse graining at the scales below observation and truncating in terms of the current limits of our knowledge of physics and the infinite number of possible configurations. Our current knowledge of quantum systems is limited by quantum mechanics which is statistical in nature and can only predict the probabilities of various possible electron distributions. However, by coarse graining of all electrons, DFT prescribes that there is one unique electron density distribution for the ground state of a given system at zero K, which further determines all observables of the system at scales higher than electrons. This coarse graining process results in a deterministic outcome from probabilistic lower-level information. By varying temperature and pressure, probabilities of metastable non-ground-state configurations become non-zero, and their statistical mixture with the ground-state configuration results in measurable deterministic outcomes though with certain uncertainty due to fluctuations of individual configurations, which is Eq. 73 proposed by Bekenstein166 . In some systems, it can produce one or more critical points with singularity, and when such a critical point is close to zero K, one has a quantum critical point. In addition to pressure, singularity can be induced",

Moreover, vision is only one of the several sensory perceptions humans possess. A blind person can construct a mental image of an object by running his fingers along the contours of the object.

A protein crystal has a periodic array of identical atoms. The X-rays re-radiated by these atoms interfere construc-tively in some directions whereas they interfere destructively in all the other directions. Therefore, the detectors record a \"pattern\" in the intensity of X-ray scattered by the protein crystal sample. But, such a \"diffraction pattern\" provides an indirect, and static, image of a molecular machine. However, microscopes (optical as well as electron) have some advantages over the X-ray scattering technique: microscopes produce the images directly in real space whereas X-ray diffraction requires Fourier transform from momentum space to real space.",

Derivation of the Lindblad Equation from microscopic dynamics\n\nThe most common derivation of the Lindblad master equation is based on Open Quantum Theory. The Lindblad equation is then an effective motion equation for a subsystem that belongs to a more complicated system. This derivation can be found in several textbooks like Breuer and Petruccione's [2] as well as Gardiner and Zoller's [1]. Here, we follow the derivation presented in Ref. [26]. Our initial point is displayed in Figure 3. A total system belonging to a Hilbert space H T is divided into our system of interest, belonging to a Hilbert space H, and the environment living in H E .\n\nThe evolution of the total system is given by the von Neumann equation (13).\nρ T (t) = −i [H T , ρ T (t)] .(33)\nAs we are interested in the dynamics of the system, without the environment, we trace over the environment degrees of freedom to obtain the reduced density matrix of the system ρ(t) = Tr E [ρ T ]. To separate the effect of the total hamiltonian in the system and the environment we divide it in the form H T = H S ⊗ 1 E + 1 S ⊗ H E + αH I , with H ∈ H, H E ∈ H E , and H I ∈ H T , and being α a measure of the strength of the system-environment interaction. Therefore, we have a part acting on the system, a part acting on the environment, and the interaction term. Without losing any generality, the interaction term can be decomposed in the following way\nH I = i S i ⊗ E i ,(34)with S i ∈ B(H) and E i ∈ B(H E ) 3 .\nTo better describe the dynamics of the system, it is useful to work in the interaction picture (see Ref. [24] for a detailed explanation about Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and interaction pictures). In the interaction picture, density matrices evolve with time due to the interaction Hamiltonian, while operators evolve with the system and environment",

H þ 2 is a problem of a particle moving in a potential V(r). Isolating two wells (the two nuclei) is necessary for chemical analyses, but alien to the physics of the problem. Let us consider a textbook one-dimensional particle moving in a box of length L resulting from the interpenetration of two smaller left and right boxes of length 2/3L, which we label a and b (see Fig. 2). After eliminating the right-a and left-b constraining walls (dashed lines at 2L/3 and L/3, respectively), we build an approximation to the solutions of the larger box in terms of those of the original a and b problems. With the sinusoidal ground states ϕ a , ϕ b of the initial boxes we can approximate the ground state of the final system as Ψ = N(ϕ a + ϕ b ). The ground state of the large box can be recast as the constructive combination of two symmetric, deformed solutions of the a, b boxes. For an observer unaware of our gedanken small boxes, using the solutions of these two hidden ancillary systems is a completely arbitrary process, as it is assigning any physical sense to the constructive interference of ϕ a and ϕ b . This internal bias soaks the standard model of chemical bonding. As V = 0 inside the box, E = T, and it suffices to considerT ¼ Àð1=2Þd 2 =dx 2 .

[8] The later development of the dipole-free SOS expression for calculating the hypoerpolarizability [10] lead to a more rigorous argument of why the original calculations, which appeared to truncate the sum rules, did not violate the higher-level sum rules. [11] A more important concern was the use of the three-level ansatz, which states that the fundamental limits can be calculated by assuming that only two excited states contribute. Given that the sum rules allow transition moments between excited states to be large, and potentially many states can contribute, one might expect that the calculations of the fundamental limit would underestimate the upper bounds. This is clearly not the case. While a system with only two dominant excited states yields the fundamental limit when the ratio of the oscillator strengths to each of the two excited states is chosen appropriately, systems in which many excited states contribute can also reach the fundamental limit. The implication is that all of the large contributions from transitions between excited states cancel.\n\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that when assigning transition moment matrix elements and energies randomly, but under the constraint of the sum rules, values of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability approach unity. This is in contrast to the intrinsic hyperpolarizability, which when calculated from an optimized potential energy function, falls bellow 0.71. The distribution of the values of β IN T is found to be well approximated by a cycloid-like function. When the energy-level spacing is weighted in a way that forces the lower energy states to have more closely-spaced energies, the distribution falls below the cycloid function, suggesting that more sparse energy-level spacing of the lower levels yields a larger intrinsic hyperpolarizabilityan observation consistent with past analytical studies.",

We only use −2 ≤ j ≤ 2 in this article. These sum rules have simple relations to physical properties, such as the ground-state density, polarizability, and kinetic energy, and thus they are easily calculated or determined from experiment. The specific relations we use are:\nS −2 = α(0), S −1 = 2 3 | j r j | 2 0 , S 0 = N, S 1 = 2 3 | j p j | 2 0 , S 2 = 4 3 πZn(0),(14)\nwhere Z is the nuclear charge. Eqn. (13) and Eqns.

These equations also suggest the possibility of a fit which takes general physical properties as input and is able to generate the entire spectrum for the H atom. As shown in Eqn. (13), sum rules of the bound region of the spectrum are calculated by a summation of the discrete Rydberg states, and there is no trivial formula for calculating the energies of these states in multi-electron atoms. In order to characterize these energies for the summation, we use quantum defect theory [14]. In quantum defect theory, the energy of the orbital with principle quantum number n in a multi-electron atom is expressed thus:\nE n = − 1 2(n − µ n ) 2 .(15)\nThis expression is used in calculating the bound part of sum rules if the formula for µ is known.

[9] Using a new dipole-free form of the sum-over-states expression for the hyperpolarizability, [10] Kuzyk showed rigourously that the three-level ansatz does not demand the sum rules to be truncated. [11] Furthermore, the three-level ansatz with the new dipole free expression was used to calculate the more general fundamental limits of the dispersion of the real and imaginary parts of the hyperpolarizability. [11] This result can be used to study any phenomena that is based on a second-order response. More importantly, since the fundamental limit can be determined at any wavelength, it can be used as an absolute standard for comparing hyperpolarizabilities. In particular, the ratio of the measured hyperpolarizability to the fundamental limit, called the intrinsic hyperpolarizability, can be used to compare the efficacy of any two molecules, independent of their size.",

The potentials that we discovered with the largest intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities resembled simple monotonically increasing half potentials. This motivated us to evaluate power law potentials, with positive exponent, which are found to fall just short of the apparent limit of 0.709 when the power vanishes. It is interesting that varying just one parameter yields an intrinsic hyperpolarizability that nearly spans the full range that is possible.\n\nThough the approach that we developed here is a useful tool for determining a potential energy function from transition dipole moments and energy spectrum, it is telling us that regimes where this technique breaks down are those that obey the TRK sum rules but not the threelevel ansatz.

We report three distinct results. For k → ∞, where k is the spring constant, the density becomes large, and E XC → E X . All energies and integrals scale as ω 1/2 , where ω = √ k. The first line of Table II shows the results, which are analogous to those of the two-electron ions (with different constants). The order of the bounds remains the same as in Table I. In the next line, we report actual energies for the largest value of k for which there exists an analytic solution, k = 1/4. Again we see the same behavior.\n\nThe most interesting case is the low-density limit, k → 0. In this limit, the kinetic energy becomes negligible, and the electrons arrange themselves to minimize the potential energy, on opposite sides of the center. This regime provides a system where correlation energy becomes comparable to exchange energy. The third line of Table II shows that none of the bounds is tight in this limit (the XC energy vanishes relative to any of them) and that the LL bounds diverge relative to the LO bound.  \n\n\nIV.

He assumes them to behave like hydrogen-like electrons with a total quantum number of 2, and a nuclear charge equal to (Z -4-14)g. This assumption for the L electrons is much less accurate than the corresponding assumption for the K electrons. Even so it gives moderate agreement with the observed absorption for certain elements, for wave-lengths small compared with the wave-length at the L edge. However, for moderately heavy elements, such as copper, and wave-lengths near the L edge-a case not considered by Stobbe-the values calculated on this basis differ considerably from the actual values. Data for the latter are available through recent work by Jonsson (loc. cit.) on the absorption of long wave-length X-rays.

For a typical excited state energy of 2 eV and width 100 meV , the onset is about 50 meV from the peak, leading to a fractional error of 2.5 %. For functions that vary as the fifth power of the energy, this contributes an error of less than 15 %the low end for the experimental uncertainty of the more accurate nonlinear-optical measurements. So, in using the peak values to obtain the energies, our calculations have an uncertainty of about 15 %; and, the positions of the peaks in our dispersion plots could be off by about 50 meV .\n\n\nA. Influence of the number of electrons\n\nA simple consequence of the Thomas-Khun sum-rules is that the two-photon cross-section of a molecule depends quadratically on the effective number of electrons.

This is a general result that applies to molecules with any number of levels. Eq. 32 together with Eq. 1 predict a quadratic dependence on the effective number of electrons for the TPA cross-section: Fig. 9 shows a plot of the TPA cross-sections of the different molecules as a function of N 2 ef f . The data follow an approximately linear relationship, indicating that even though the performance of a molecule is dictated by many factors, it correlates with the square of the effective electrons.

This involves passing cathode rays through a uniform electric field (E), measuring the radius (r) of the circular path they take, and then using a uniform magnetic field (B) at right angles to annul the deflection of the beam. Under the first conditions, the electric force on each electron (Eq) is equal to the particle's rate of change of momentum (mv 2 /r); under the second, the electric force is balanced by the magnetic force (Bvq). The second relation gives\nv ¼ E =Bð3Þ\nFrom this and the first relation\nm=q ¼ B 2 r=Eð4Þ\nExperiments with cathode rays of low energy give m/q = -5.69 9 10 -9 g C -1 . Combining this with the charge on an electron (q = -1.602 9 10 -19 C) gives m = 9.11 9 10 -28 g. However, when experiments like this are repeated with cathode rays of high energy, the values of m are found to increase with speed (calculated from Eq. 3). This was investigated by Kaufmann (1901) before Einstein put forward his theory of relativity (see Miller 1997). His results, along with some of those obtained later by Bucherer (1909), are plotted in Fig. 1 (Shankland 1960: Chap. 2, Sect. 4). These show that m rises increasingly rapidly with v, and apparently approaches a limit equal to the speed of light (c = 2.998 9 10 8 m s -1 ). The limits (m = m 0 at v = 0, m = ? at v = c) suggest changing the variables to a = m/m 0 and b = v/c. The variable a then varies from one to infinity as b varies from zero to one.",

The typical range of E for many organic molecules is also shown. From the plot, it is obvious that the approximation that Im(γ res ) dominates γ T K3 I is not a good one for most values of E; and, in the range of typical E, γ I is smaller than Im(γ res ) by as much as a factor of 3. Clearly, there are big differences between the two at various values of E. For example, while γ T K3 I remains well behaved and goes to zero at E → 1, Im(γ res ) diverges. Furthermore, while γ T K3 I = 0 at E = 1/2, Im(γ res ) ≈ −4×10 −43 cm 6 eV −1 . We conclude that γ T K3 I can not be approximated on or near double resonance by Im(γ res ).

By consequence ln χ(t) is analytic in the lower half-plane and vanishes on a large semi-circle there. This ensures the validity of the reciprocal relations shown in equation (12) and equation (13) . We illustrate the use of the reciprocal relations in Figure 2. The curve shown by full lines is obtained by calculating the argument indirectly, from the modulus through equation (12) . The broken line curve, shown for comparison and displaced by a tiny amount for clarity, is computed directly from the expression in equation (11) .

Now there is a problem here because in Bohr theory when an electron comes in from infinity it has to radiate half its energy to enter into orbit.There was no evidence for any such radiation and the electron would have needed to have twice the energy to start with.However, there were some theorists including Sommerfeld who had an explanation that the electron could be captured if it had a velocity equal to what it was going to have in orbit.\n\nThere were other disturbing facts.The peaks were 0.01 V wide; the fields in the tube were not that accurate.In addition, scanning the entire voltage range in such small steps would take a long time.Well, Davis and Barnes explained, they didn't quite do it that way: they found by some preliminary work that they did check with the Bohr orbit velocities, so they knew where to look.Sometimes they weren't quite in the right place, so they explored around and found them.Their precision was so good they were sure they could get a better value for the Rydberg constant (known then to 1 part in 10 8 ).\n\nThen Langmuir visited Columbia.The way the experiment was done was that an assistant named Hull sat opposite to Barnes in front of a voltmeter, that had a scale that went from 1 to a thousand volts and on that scale he was reading 0.01 V.The room was dark, to see the scintillations, and there was a light on the voltmeter and on the dial of the clock that Barnes used to time his measurements.",

In this case e~kiY will be small compared l o with e~klY for all values of V from 0 to oo . The experiments will not detect a small low energy emission because it will never contribute anything appreciable to iji0. Its maximum relative contribution is near V = 0 where the absolute error of the measurements is greatest, and this will increase the difficulty of detecting this type of emission.\n\nFor the more energetic reactions, for which c ~ 2, the log i/i0 vs. V plots will still be able to detect a small admixture with higher average energy than that of the main group, but no simple quantitative treatment, similar to the above, is possible for these electron spectra. Instead of a straight line the l°g ifio vs-V plot will give a curve, convex towards the origin (V = 0), the slope of which continuously increases as log iji0 increases. A small high energy group of electrons will make itself evident by the fact that at high enough values of V the systematic increase in the curvature will become less rapid and may even become negative.

However, the spin-orbit interactions in these two methods are somewhat different. In the L-S coupling scheme, for the whole system, the orbital angular momentum vector (with quantum number L) interacts with the spin angular momentum vector (with quantum number S), yielding the total angular momentum vector (with quantum number J), and these three quantum numbers define the electronic states of an atom. On the other hand, in the j-j coupling scheme, each electron's  and s first combined to give j, i.e., j =  -½ and  + ½. Then th e j values of individual electrons are combined to yield total angular momentum quantum number J. Here we follow the convention of using the upper-case letters to denote the properties of the whole atom and lower-case letters for the properties of individual electrons. Clearly, in the j-j scheme, L and S are no longer \"good\" quantum numbers and only J retains its validity. That is to say, with the j-j coupling scheme, each atomic electronic state is defined by J alone.",

II E 1 that makes a combined use of both the AutoCAS functionality described in Sec. II F 2 in order to rationalize the selected active orbital space and the SINGLE_ANISO approach described above to calculate magnetic properties. In particular, we consider the magnetic properties of a hexakisamidouranium(V) complex, [U(NH 2 ) 6 ] -1 , which serves as a model complex for a unique, pseudo-octahedral hexakisamidouranium(V) complex synthesized and experimentally characterized by Meyer et al. 124 The active orbital space consisting of seven electrons distributed in 10 active orbitals, CAS (7,10), is sufficiently small to facilitate a direct comparison of the DMRG-SCF/MPSSI data with the corresponding results obtained from CASSCF/CASSI calculations. Dynamical correlation effects in the MPSSI (CASSI) calculations were taken into account by standard multi-state CASPT2 calculations for the seven lowest-lying electronic states of [U(NH 2 ) 6 ] -1 , which also define the ensemble of states for the preceding stateaveraged DMRG-SCF (CASSCF) calculations. Accordingly, the number of renormalized block states m that determines the accuracy of the DMRG-SCF calculations was chosen such as to exactly reproduce the corresponding CASSCF calculations for each of the active orbital spaces considered in this example. Figure 4 illustrates the state-averaged orbital entanglement diagram obtained by means of the AUTOCAS program based on of Chemical Physics DMRG-SCF calculations with CAS(7,10). Here, orbital Nos. 4-10 correspond to predominantly 5f orbitals of the U central ion while orbital Nos. 1-3 exhibit mainly U 6p character with little contributions from each of the N center of the (NH 2 ) -1 amido ligands. Interestingly, orbital No. 8 (of U 5f δ character), which displays a seemingly small orbital entanglement, will be automatically included by the automatic selection protocol because it is singly occupied in the electronic ground state. The latter finding is in perfect agreement with conclusions drawn from scalar relativistic DFT calculations for the same model complex. 124 The situation is, however, less clear for orbital",

[6][7][8][9] Although some properties of these systems can be modeled with reasonable accuracy using classical force fields, 10,11 quantum mechanical methods are still essential for many chemically important properties, including excited states and electron transfer. Semiempirical quantum mechanical methods (SEQMs) have experienced a resurgence in recent years because of their capacity to address these challenges at accessible computational costs. 1,[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] SEQMs use low-cost Hamiltonians simplified from Hartree-Fock. The introduction of parameters fit to experimental and high-level computational results has enabled high enough accuracy to provide understanding of chemical properties including thermochemistry, 13,21,22 noncovalent interactions, 13,21,23 excited states, 24,25 pK a , 14,19 magnetism, 26 solvatochromism, 27 and electrochemical formal potentials. 28 The Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model is a semiempirical-like model based on a Hamiltonian simplified from Density Functional Theory (DFT) and has many capabilities similar to those of Hartree-Fock-based SEQMs [29][30][31] ; this work focuses exclusively on SEQMs derived from Hartree-Fock.",

All-electron and pseudopotential calculations are available. Initial VB wave functions can be read from the software XMVB [51]. The parameters in the JVB wave functions are then simultaneously optimized with the linear optimization method in VMC, using an accelerated Metropolis algorithm [52,53]. Once the trial wave function has been optimized, a DMC calculation can be performed within the short-time and FN approximations, using an efficient DMC algorithm featuring very small time-step errors [54]. Typically, we use an imaginary time step of τ = 0.01 Hartree −1 .\n\n\nIII. BENCHMARKING THE VALENCE-BOND QUANTUM MONTE CARLO METHOD\n\nA. Proof of concept: Bond dissociation energy of acetylene One of the first published studies to use ab initio VB trial wave functions in QMC was the study of the C-H bond dissociation of acetylene [55]. While there were earlier QMC studies that used geminals [56] and resonating VB wave functions [57], the study of the bond dissociation of acetylene in Ref. 55 examined the use of chemically interpretable VB trial functions, namely BOVB, in QMC for calculating molecular bond dissociation energies. It was already well known that the accuracy of QMC results could be improved by using multideterminant trial wave functions [58] rather than single-determinant trial wave functions, unfortunately the commonly used complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) and configuration-interaction (CI) expansions usually become unwieldy large for molecules containing more than a few atoms. The localized nature and non-orthogonality of VB orbitals usually allow for wave functions with significantly fewer Slater determinants than CASSCF or CI expansions while providing easy to interpret description of the qualitative nature of the covalent bonds present within the molecules.\n\nThe equilibrium molecular geometries and scaled harmonic zero-point vibrational energies",

It is also quite competitive with a state-of-the-art density functional, ωB97M-V, which is a priori expected to be accurate for the class of systems studied here. These conclusions are summarized in Fig. 5. We thus recommend AFQMC with a simple SD trial for calculations where DFT is expected to struggle (either due to self-interaction error or due to strong correlation) and CCSD(T) is too expensive.\n\n\nB. Non-covalent interaction benchmark (A24)\n\nA24 is a high-quality non-covalent interaction benchmark set composed of 24 small, non-covalently bound complexes. 86 All molecules in the set should be well described by RHF wave functions. For this set we employ RHF wave functions for both CC and AFQMC methods. We also used the counterpoise correction to eliminate the basis set superposition error. The energy scale in this set is quite small, with interaction energies ranging from 1.115 kcal/mol to -6.493 kcal/mol. In Fig. 6, we present the RMSD values of MP2, CCSD, CCSD(T), ωB97M-V, and AFQMC for this set. MP2 has the largest RMSD (1.12 kcal/mol), while CCSD and CCSD(T) are nearly exact (RMSD = 0.05 kcal/mol). ωB97M-V is also very accurate with an RMSD of 0.09 kcal/mol. AFQMC exhibits more sizable errors than do the CC methods, with an RMSD of 0.32(7) kcal/mol. This is about a factor of 4 larger error than ωB97M-V, although still within chemical accuracy.",

As we explained above, our formalism is not so different from LAPW/PAW formalisms shown in [4,5] except in the augmentation(projection) proce-dure. The atomic forces are calculated [8,10] in the same manner as in PAW [5]. For deep cores, we usually use a frozen core approximation which allows the extension of core densities outside of MT (but no augmentation) [7]. Further, we use the local orbital (lo) method [11] in some cases; for example, to treat 3d semicore for Ga (denoted as Ga(3d[lo]) below), or to reproduce high-lying bands for Cu by Cu(4d[lo]).

[40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48] Novel concepts and features emerged from these studies including the regional positron affinities, 41 the positronic bond, 48 and the positive/negative muon's capability/incapability to shape its own atomic basin. 43,45,46 Also, when applied to the purely electronic systems, the MC-QTAIM analysis recovers the results of the QTAIM analysis, demonstrating that the former encompasses the latter just as a special case. 32 In the second and third sections of this chapter, a comparative analysis is also done on the formulation of the QTAIM and the MC-QTAIM and the basic ideas behind these methodologies are articulated. In this articulation a new theoretical ingredient of the QTAIM, i.e. property fluctuation of AIM, is introduced which goes beyond the well-established formalism of the usual particle number fluctuation of AIM. 14,49,50 At the next step this new ingredient will be extended within the context of the MC-QTAIM. Particularly, the original idea of Bader that AIM are somehow \"open\" entities amenable to particle and property exchange, 14 is quantified by this new ingredient in a firm manner. Finally, in the fourth section some future opportunities for theoretical developments of the MC-QTAIM and even beyond are briefly discussed.\n\n\nII.

We consider here a set of 328 ES, that has been divided into three relatively equivalent subsets of 1-3 non-hydrogen atoms (106 ES), 4 non-hydrogen atoms (89 ES) and 5-6 non-hydrogen atoms (134 ES). From these data, it is quite clear that CC3 delivers astonishingly accurate transition energies with MAE below or equal to 0.03 eV for each subset, and no deviation exceeding ±0.20 eV. This is inline with several previous benchmarks. 14,18,25,[32][33][34][35] Again, consistently with previous analyses and theoretical considerations (see above), the ADC(2) and CC2 performances are very similar and these second-order methods deliver a global MAE smaller than 0.2 eV, together with negligible MSE for all subsets. This confirms that ADC(2) is indeed a very interesting computational tool thanks to its attractive accuracy/cost ratio. Nevertheless, in par with the above-described conclusions, we found that the performance of ADC(3) is rather average with a significant underestimation (MSE of −0.11 eV for the full set) and a MAE around 0.20 eV for each subset. Overall, ADC(3) underestimates transition energies and provides an average deviation of the same order of magnitude as ADC(2) and CC2. Strikingly, the MAE of ADC(3) is basically one order of magnitude larger than the MAE of CC3.",

Here again, it is the bonding between the empty metal atoms and the HOMO of the ligand which determines if a tilting of the ligand is energetically favorable or not. In the reported titanium compounds an additional dmpe ligand forces the titanium into octahedral coordination and hence distorts the structure of the complex enough for two empty metal orbitals to switch places enabling an effective interaction with the HOMO of the CH 3 ligand. The same compound without the additional dmpe ligand has a tetrahedral mode of coordination where the CH 3 ligand gains nothing by tilting towards the metal. Note here that the agostic geometry occurs in the sterically more crowded complex while it is absent in the sterically less crowded complex which highlights the electronic origin of agostic interaction as opposed to steric influences. A result that has also been obtained somewhat more thoroughly from the comparison of QM/MM and DFT calculations [21,22] Such studies are carried out with essentially the same results but different analytical tools and more sophisticated computational models to this date. Some authors go as far as arguing for a replacement of the term agostic interaction with agostic geometry to emphasize the fact that the structural change in those compounds does not stem from a direct interaction of the metal atom and the carbon-hydrogen bond [23,24].",

Bright Wilson, Jr. (Wilson 1962). Wilson asks the rhetorical question, \"Does there exist some procedure for calculating n(r) [for an N -electron system] which avoids altogether the use of 3N dimensional space?\" He then uses a device mentioned earlier (see Section IV) and defines n(r, λ) to be the exact ground state electron density of a many-electron system where the charge of every electron is taken to be λe rather than e. Using just a few lines of calculation, Wilson shows that the total energy E in Eq. (10) can be written as an integral from λ = 0 to λ = 1 of the sum of the classical Coulomb potentials produced by n(r, λ) at the positions of all the nuclei. [110] From the foregoing, I conclude that no scientists before Walter Kohn in 1963 were even vaguely thinking about using the ground state charge density as a fundamental quantity from which to build an exact theory of a manyelectron system. The idea was not \"in the air\" and all eyes were riveted either on the many-electron wave function, the first-and second-order density matrices, or the Green functions of many-body field theory. The zeitgeist of electronic structure theory was simply not moving in the direction of the electron density function for some particulary well-prepared scientist to exploit and earn the accolades of discovery.",

It is possible to obtain ε α (N − 1/2) without explicitly removing half an electron from the molecule. This is achieved by evaluating the following inner product: 11,12 \nε α (N − 1/2) = φ α − ∇ 2 2 + v ext + v H + v XC − V S φ α .(2)\nHere, we denote the HOMO wavefunction of a system with N electrons as φ α , while the external (v ext ), Hartree (v H ) and exchange-correlation (v XC ) potentials are the contributions to the KS potential. The term V S , called self-energy potential due to its similarity to its electrostatic counterpart, carries the information about the half-ionization. 20 It can be expressed as the difference between the KS potentials of the N and N − 1/2 electron systems, respectively. 11,12 Conceptually, V S is the potential needed to create half a hole in the HOMO. 11,12 A good approximation to V S is to consider it as a sum of the self-energy potentials of its atoms, 12\nV S (compound) ∼ = i V S (f i , atom i ),(3)\nwhere f i is the fractional charge removed from the i-th atom. Each self-energy potential V S (f i , atom i ) is then obtained in a separate calculation, as a difference between the KS potential of the atom and its corresponding ion with charge f i . f i should reflect how much each atom contributes to the HOMO of the actual system. To create the half hole, the total degree of ionization must satisfy i f i = 1/2. Equation (3) enables us to easily obtain the self-energy potential of a system, without half-ionizing it, as just the constituent atoms need to be ionized separately.",

The transitions γ(3, 4) band measured by 97DaDoKe are consistent with the transitions in γ(3, 0) band measured by Cheung et al. (02ChLoLe) 58 . Furthermore, use of Heath band potential provides a closed loop or cycle by following γ(0, 0)-Heath(0, 0)-δ(0, 0). The measurements of 97DaDoKe gave consistency in this cycle, within the stated uncertainties of the various measurements, but 20VeFe did not. Analyzing the ground state data and 20VeFe individually, we observed an average 0.43 cm −1 shift for the lower three vibrational levels of the A 2 Σ + state; these energy differences are plotted in Fig. 6.

The C8 and C10 are used for the smooth connection at Rout. For the others we introduce values to be consistent with ab initio results and the asymptotic atom pair correlation. The rovibrational level for the desired quantum state v', N'=J' +/ − 1/2 and F 2/1 is calculated by solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for such a potential. The eigen energy replaces the one of the Dunham description in the matrix in Table 1. Using in total 9 potential parameters instead of 11 Dunham parameters we obtain a good fit with a standard deviation of σ=0.012 cm −1 which is equal to the one with the pure Dunham approach. The differences of the two rovibrational ladders as function of N' undulate around zero with an amplitude of about 0.01 cm −1 but increase to larger values for high N', which is probably related to the high order centrifugal distortion function constructed by the Dunham approach. We should mention that the other molecular parameters are also slightly changed by the simultaneous fit of all parameters directing to the correlation between all parameters which is different in both approaches. The parameters from the potential approach are given in the appendix.",

It is possible to obtain ε α (N − 1/2) without explicitly removing half an electron from the molecule. This is achieved by evaluating the following inner product: 11,12 \nε α (N − 1/2) = φ α − ∇ 2 2 + v ext + v H + v XC − V S φ α .(2)\nHere, we denote the HOMO wavefunction of a system with N electrons as φ α , while the external (v ext ), Hartree (v H ) and exchange-correlation (v XC ) potentials are the contributions to the KS potential. The term V S , called self-energy potential due to its similarity to its electrostatic counterpart, carries the information about the half-ionization. 20 It can be expressed as the difference between the KS potentials of the N and N − 1/2 electron systems, respectively. 11,12 Conceptually, V S is the potential needed to create half a hole in the HOMO. 11,12 A good approximation to V S is to consider it as a sum of the self-energy potentials of its atoms, 12\nV S (compound) ∼ = i V S (f i , atom i ),(3)\nwhere f i is the fractional charge removed from the i-th atom. Each self-energy potential V S (f i , atom i ) is then obtained in a separate calculation, as a difference between the KS potential of the atom and its corresponding ion with charge f i . f i should reflect how much each atom contributes to the HOMO of the actual system. To create the half hole, the total degree of ionization must satisfy i f i = 1/2. Equation (3) enables us to easily obtain the self-energy potential of a system, without half-ionizing it, as just the constituent atoms need to be ionized separately.",

After it is published, it will be found at\nThe Mean Spherical Approximation (MSA) is a commonly-used thermodynamic theory for computing the energetics of ions in the primitive model (i.e., charged hard-sphere ions in a background dielectric). For the excess chemical potential, however, the early MSA formulations (which were widely adopted) only included the terms needed to compute the mean excess chemical potential (or the mean activity coefficient). Other terms for the chemical potential µ i of individual species i were not included because they sum to 0 in the mean chemical potential. Here, we derive these terms to give a complete MSA formulation of the chemical potential. The result is a simple additive term for µ i that we show is a qualitative improvement over the previous MSA version. In addition, our derivation shows that the MSA's assumption of global charge neutrality is not strictly necessary, so that the MSA is also valid for systems close to neutrality. neglected in Ref. 7. The remaining terms, except for another z i · const. term in its Eq. (A20), of its Eq. (44) (which computes β µ i − β u i ) were included in their µ MSA i . This latter z i · const. term, like z i δ * of Eq. (58), exactly compensates the last sum of Eq. (61), from which Eq. (63) follows.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION",

However, in an approximate sense, both functions are equivalent. In fact, the screened potential between the centered cation 1 and neighboring anion 2 locating at an appropriate distance, is expressed in terms of the form of direct interacting potential multiplied by the inverse dielectric function 1/(q). The factor 1/(q) is evidently given by the force acting on the centered cation from all other neighboring ions represented by 3.

The most important feature in this section is the introduction of the steric potential to the classical Nernst-Planck equation. Electric and steric potentials describe the dynamic charge/space competition between ions and water. We also show that the PNPB model reduces to the 4PBik equation at equilibrium. Section 6 presents a generalized Debye-Hückel theory from the 4PBik equation for thermodynamic modeling. The theory yields an equation of state that analytically models ion activities in all types of binary and multi-component electrolyte solutions over wide ranges of concentration, temperature, and pressure. It is also useful to study the size, correlation, dielectric, and polarization effects in a clear comparison with those ignoring these effects. Section 7 discusses numerical methods for solving the PNPB model that is highly nonlinear and complex when coupled with the electrical field generated by protein charges in ion channels, for example. It is very challenging to numerically solve the model with tolerable accuracy in 3D protein structures that generate extremely large electric field, e.g., 0.1 V in 1 Angstrom, in parts of the molecule of great biological importance where crowded charges directly control biological function, in the same sense that a gas pedal controls the speed of a car. Section 8 demonstrates the usefulness of the PNPB theory for a wide range of biological and chemical systems, where the steric and correlation effects are of importance. We choose a few examples of these systems, namely electric double layers, ion activities, and biological ion channels.\n\nSection 9 summarizes this review with some concluding remarks.\n\n\nFermi Distributions and Steric Potential",

From the data in Ref. 33, the TC method yields a maximum ξ = 0.64 for the 18-site two-dimensional Hubbard model. We find that the values of ξ for atomic and molecular systems are not dissimilar from this; see Table II.  Having established the more compact nature of the CI wave function with the TC Hamiltonian, we deem appropriate to run the TC-FCIQMC calculations using between 10 6 and 10 7 walkers for the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ bases, and between 10 6 and 2 × 10 7 walkers with the cc-pVQZ basis. In Fig. 9 we plot the resulting TC-FCIQMC energy relative to its corresponding FCI limit, i.e., the initiator error, as a function of n −1/3 w for each of the molecules and basis sets considered. As anticipated, the initiator error is to a good approximation pro- portional to n −1/3 w , and we expect the extrapolated FCI limits to incur errors no larger than 0.4 mHa as in the non-TC case.\n\n\nNeglecting three-body excitations",

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe now analyze the accuracy of the TC method with tailored Jastrow factors by comparing the convergence of the results as a function of basis set size with non-TC results and with benchmark complete basis-set limit (CBS) values from Refs. 49-51.\n\nIn Table VI we list the total energies that we obtain for each system and basis set. We find the TC total energies to be remarkably accurate already at the cc-pVQZ basis set level, differing by less than 2 mHa per atom from benchmark CBS values, while the non-TC total energies still miss the benchmarks by 25-30 mHa per atom with the cc-pV5Z basis set, and 20 mHa per atom at the cc-pV6Z level. The TC total energies exhibit slight non-variational convergence, with the atomic energies reaching values 0.5 mHa below the benchmark before increasing again towards it for larger basis-set sizes. While non-variationality is not a desirable feature in a method, the amount by which the TC results dip below the basis-set limit is sufficiently tiny for this issue to be entirely ignored in practice.\n\nFrom a chemical perspective, relative energies are more important than total energies. The atomization energies of the C 2 , CN, N 2 , and O 2 molecules obtained from the total energies in Table VI are given in Table VII and plotted in Fig. 10. Again, we find that the TC results exhibit much faster convergence with basis-set size than their non-TC counterparts, with TC atomization energies being chemically accurate with respect to the CBS benchmarks already at the cc-pVTZ basis-set level, matching the accuracy of non-TC atomization energies obtained using the cc-pV5Z basis set. The TC method therefore provides an advantage of about two cardinal numbers for the computation of relative energies.\n\nThe application of the TC method to quantum chemical methods in general could be presumed to be problematic because any theoretical guarantee of cancellation of errors in energy differences disappears with the introduction of separately-optimized Jastrow factors for each system. However, the fact that in our results the relative energy converges at smaller basis-set sizes than the total energy implies that substantial error cancellation is at play in practice. We take this as evidence that the TC method with tailored Jastrow factors does not fully suppress advantageous error cancellation from the underlying methodology.",

In addition, results of the FCCR method are included, which in its most recent incarnation may too be used in combination with either MP or EN perturbation theory for correcting for operations outside a primary CC excitation manifold. 322 The left panel of Figure 1 shows the convergence of both the variational (dashed lines) and perturbatively corrected (solid lines) SCI results with an increase of the primary correlation space. On the basis of these results, it is observed how the profiles of the variational CIPSI, ASCI, and SHCI results all resemble each other, while the corresponding iCI results differ somewhat from this trend. Upon adding the PT2 correction, however, the four sets of results start to coincide. The differences (or lack hereof) in-between the methods are further accentuated in the right panel of Figure 1, which further illustrates one of the key premises on which modern SCI operate, namely, the empirical observation that the total energy often changes with the magnitude of the perturbative correction (i.e., upon reductions to the sec-   Figure 2 as only a limited number (4) of FCCR data points have been published to date. 322 We next turn to stochastic rather than deterministic approaches to FCI. In FCIQMC theory, the FCI wave function is sampled by a QMC propagation of the wave function in the many-electron Hilbert space, with an aim at projecting out the FCI ground state. The wave function coefficients are then simulated by a set of walkers which are allowed to evolve over imaginary time. Its initiator (i-FCIQMC) and adaptive shift 324 (AS-FCIQMC) formulations are these days used to mitigate the fermionic sign problem, albeit at the expense of an initiator bias in the wave function propagation, and most recently extensions have further been proposed to take advantage of perturbation theory, 325,326 akin to what was discussed in the context of SCI and FCCR above. On par with SCI, FCIQMC may predominantly be classified as a method intended for performing a focussed sampling of the FCI wave function.\n\nHowever, a fundamental conceptual distinction exists between these two classes of methods.",

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn certain regions of molecular potential energy surfaces, electronic states can cross each other or have low gaps, like in the case of avoided crossing regions or at the bond-dissociation limit.In these cases, the interactions between states should be considered simultaneously.Consequently, the use of single determinant based methods is challenging.",

This enabled us to apply the random integration method, as well as an inversion solver for the BSEtype equations [98,103]. To build the BSE-type kernels, we used 56 valence bands and 20 conduction bands for CsCu 2 Cl 3 . The corresponding numbers of valence and conduction bands are 44 and 10 for CsCu 2 Br 3 and 18 and 14 for CsCu 2 I 3 . A broadening of 0.1 eV was used to calculate the optical spectra.\n\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nA. Band Structures and band gaps\n\nWe begin by comparing the band structures of the Cs-Cu halides calculated with different approaches, namely, Kohn-Sham band structures from LDA and PBE, and single-shot GW band structures on top of LDA and PBE (G 0 W 0 @LDA and G 0 W 0 @PBE).  Figure 2 shows the band structures of CsCu 2 X 3 obtained by LDA and G 0 W 0 @LDA. As expected, there are important differences, most notably a pronounced opening up of the band gaps caused by the QP corrections. Along with the enlarged band gaps, the conduction bands in all three materials are significantly altered in G 0 W 0 , especially around the X point. In addition, the valence bands are strongly affected as well: for the case of CsCu 2 I 3 , this is most apparent for the highest occupied valence bands between the Γ and Z points, as well as for the valence bands around the S point. Overall, these differences in the band structures suggest that a simple scissors operator approach (which would not change the shape of the LDA bands, just shift them rigidly) is not sufficiently accurate for calculating the optical properties in these materials.",

The results of iteration 9 from panel (a) are chosen as representative, which are seen in panel (b) to take about 10 seconds to generate (per geometry). Visually, the results from iteration 9 match the FCI results for all bond lengths, whereas, the results from CC theory do not quite accomplish the same. The CCSD results are off by some margin at equilibrium, but the errors grow substantially as the bond is stretched, finally giving a spurious peak in the PES near the dissociation limit. The unphysical peak is a consequence of the refer-ence Hartree-Fock (HF) determinant being generated by an restricted HF (RHF) calculation in a situation where the dissociation products are two radicals. Accordingly, panel (c) also shows the CCSD result when the calculation is based upon an unrestricted (spin-polarized) HF (UHF) solution, in which case the correct dissociation limit is reached, but the errors in the bond-breaking region (and at equilibrium) remain. To investigate the remaining error, Psi4 was run at the higher CC3 level of theory. With an RHF reference, CC3 gave results in good visual agreement with FCI at equilibrium and through the bond-breaking region (and in agreement with 9 iterations of the present approach) but, as with CCSD, it gave spurious results near dissociation. Running CC3 based on a UHF reference again cured the problem at dissociation, but it caused a slight worsening of the result in the bond-breaking region, as can be seen from visual inspection panel (c).",

The mean position takes on a simple form in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation [18,20],\nr M = r.(6)\nLoosely speaking,r M can be thought of as the kinetic position in the electron's rest frame, actively boosted with appropriate velocity [16,21,29,30].

The 'mean' terminology introduced in [18] forr M and other quantities is something of a misnomer -it isr q rather thanr M that embodies the electron's 'average' position [24]. The components of the velocityv q = dr q /dt = cα α α of charge [32,33] support discrete eigenvalues of ±c whilst the kinetic velocityv q = dr q /dt = βc 2 p/E p [23] and mean velocityv M = dr M /dt = βc 2 p/E p [18] vary continuously with p and are equal.

We work to order 1/c 2 and assume that the leading-order contribution to A is of order 1/c 2 .

However, if we limit ourselves to quantum mechanics, we can proceed as follows.\n\nThe starting point of discussion of the N particle system is definition analogous to Eq. (1) r j = r j ρ(r 1 , . . . , r N , t)dV 1 . . . dV N , j = 1, . . . , N,\n\nwhere ρ is the many particle probability density and r j are the coordinates of the j-th particle. Then, discussion can be performed analogously to that given above and the probability amplitude, uncertainty and commutation relations, momentum operators and density currents for all particles can be introduced. The scalar and vector potentials U (r 1 , . . . , r N , t) and A(r 1 , . . . , r N , t) and antiparticles can be also discussed. Equations of motion for N free particles can be found from generalization of the relativistic invariant (43) \n\nwhere ψ(r 1 , . . . , r N , t) is the N particle probability amplitude and m j denotes the rest mass of the particle. Using similar approach as above, we can then obtain the N particle Schrödinger equation\n− N j=1 2 2m j ∆ j ψ = i ∂ψ ∂t(64)\nand the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\n∂S ∂t + N j=1 (∇ j S) 2 2m j = 0.(65)\nFor a system of identical particles, the probability density ρ must be symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two particles i and j. Hence, the probability amplitude ψ must be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to such exchanges.\n\nNon-locality of quantum mechanics is related to the many particle character of the probability density ρ and the corresponding probability amplitude ψ.\n\nIt is seen that probabilistic description of measurements and its relativistic invariance yields also the basic mathematical structure of the many particle quantum mechanics.\n\n\nX.

This is in spirit similar to the weighted density approximation in density functional theory. 15 The use of a continuous and smooth weight function that vanishes at the cutoff distance, r c , ensures a smooth sampling of the environment of each particle, avoiding spurious jumps. There is no a priori reason to choose w(r) equal to any of the other weight functions, although the particular case of a constant weight function constitutes a pathological limit-in this case the conservative force will only act when one particle enters or leaves the interaction range. The dependence of the energy of a particular configuration on the particles' positions enters implicitly through the weighted densities. For densities of the form given by Eq. ͑6͒, the conservative force acting on particle i can be rewritten as\nF i ϭϪ ͚ jϭ1 N ‫͑ץ‬n j ͒ ‫ץ‬r i ϭϪ ͚ j ͑ i Јϩ j Ј͒ w i j Ј ͓w͔ e i j ϵ ͚ j F i j , ͑7͒\nwhere we have introduced the notation, i ϵ ex (n i ), and where the primes denote derivatives with respect to the corresponding variables. Although the free energy of each particle depends on the local density, and leads in general to many-body effective forces, for the particular local density introduced in Eq. ͑6͒, the forces between DPD particles can still be written down as additive pairwise forces-a computational advantage.\n\nThe fact that the forces depend on the positions of many particles through their corresponding local weighted densities suggests that, in general, the local structure of the fluid phase will be smoother than in the case in which forces are derived from a pair-potential. This is an attractive feature of the present model; the local structure in a fluid should only be related to its microscopic structure, and should be smeared out at mesoscopic, coarse-grained, scales. In this respect, the density-dependent interactions of these DPD models enforce an appropriate length scale separation. In the next sections, we will analyze these properties in detail.",

The particular expression for the forces will then depend both on the specific form of the free energy and on the choice of the local density n i .

INTRODUCTION\n\nParticle simulation techniques are now over 50 years old 1 and have become a vital tool in exploring natural processes at all scales.Molecular dynamics, granular dynamics 2 , dissipative particle dynamics, and even smooth particle hydrodynamics 3 algorithms are all fundamentally identical.They each attempt to solve classical equations of motion for a large number of particles.In such models, conservative interactions between particles are typically defined through a pairwise additive inter-particle potential Φ(r), where r is the distance between the particles.The force F ij acting on particle i due to particle j is given by\nF ij = − ∂ ∂r i Φ(|r i − r j |)\nwhere r i is the position of particle i, and r j is the position of particle j.\n\nThere are two broad categories of inter-particle potentials: continuous and discrete.For continuous potentials, the interaction energy is a continuous function of the particle positions.The Lennard-Jones potential is a classic example of a continuous potential:\nΦ LJ (r) = 4 ε σ r 12 − σ r 6\nwhere r is the distance between the two particles, ε is the minimum interaction energy, and σ is the separation distance corresponding to zero interaction energy.In discontinuous (also known as \"stepped\" or \"terraced\" 4 ) potentials, the interaction potential changes only at discrete locations and a functional definition is difficult.An illustration of the two forms of the Lennard-Jones potential is given in Fig. 1.\n\nContinuous potentials are popular as the finite-difference algorithms used to simulate them are well-known 5 and it is straightforward to implement physical scaling laws into the model potential.For example, the r −6 term in the Lennard-Jones potential was selected to match the known scaling of molecular dispersion forces.Discontinuous potentials on the other hand are typically reported as a table of discontinuity locations and energies 6 .",

This parameter is related to the viscosity of the DPD fluid.

As long as the force is sufficiently weak that it does not induce appreciable inhomogeneities in the density around a DPD particle, it can only lead to an equation of state with a quadratic dependence in the density, irrespective of the precise choice for the weight function ͑see the following͒. One consequence is that phase separation between disordered phases cannot occur in a pure system; at least a binary mixture of different kinds of particles is needed. 14 We will first consider the general form that the free energy of a DPD system can have, in order to elucidate the generic shape of consistent conservative forces. In agreement with the idea that the DPD particles refer to lumps of fluid, it seems natural to assume that the relevant energy associated to their configurations is a free energy, rather than a strictly ''mechanical'' potential energy.

The scalar and vector potentials U (r 1 , . . . , r N , t) and A(r 1 , . . . , r N , t) and antiparticles can be also discussed. Equations of motion for N free particles can be found from generalization of the relativistic invariant (43) \n\nwhere ψ(r 1 , . . . , r N , t) is the N particle probability amplitude and m j denotes the rest mass of the particle.

These forces are analogous to the ones derived from semiempirical potentials 16 in MD, used to effectively model the many-body interactions in condensed systems. However, we have started from the macroscopic properties of the system, i.e., its free energy, rather than ensuring microscopic consistency.

This procedure is reminiscent of an approach used in other mesoscopic simulation techniques that deal with generic nonideal fluids. 17 Given that the free energy has been defined as a functional of a certain local density, local variations in such a density are responsible for the effective forces among the DPD particles. The particular expression for the forces will then depend both on the specific form of the free energy and on the choice of the local density n i .

This is indicative of subtle changes in couplings between the ZOSs in the proximity $400 cm À1 and those at $847 cm À1 .\n\nWe note that the D 14 m ¼ 6(À) level was deduced in earlier work 38 to be interacting with the 2D 14 level, but it was incorrectly deduced that this led to two levels lying about 35 cm À1 apart, with one lying under the $400 cm À1 feature and one lying to lower wavenumber. This deduction arose from the appearance of a ZEKE band when exciting at 364 cm À1 that appeared to be consistent with its having 14 1 m 6(À) character, from the observation of a band which was at the same wavenumber as a feature seen when exciting close to 400 cm À1 . We have now recorded 2D-LIF spectra over this region (not shown) that indicate that the lower wavenumber assignment is incorrect. However, those 2D-LIF spectra do conrm that that the D 14 m ¼ 6(À) level does indeed lie underneath the band at $400 cm À1 , consistent with our ZEKE study. 38 Since this level is totally symmetric (a 2 0 Â a 2 0 ¼ a 1 0 ) it can potentially interact with the D 11 and 2D 14 levels;\n\nhowever, this effect appears to be extremely small. The slices of the 2D-LIF spectra in Fig. 6 also demonstrate that there is likely a rotational dependence of the coupling between each of these ZOSs; examining the $847 cm À1 region with higher resolution will likely aid interpretation of the complicated couplings in this energetic region.",

Molecules with cancelation between hyperfine structure and rotational intervals\n\nConsider diatomic molecules with the unpaired electron and the 2 Σ ground state. Examples of such molecules include LaS, LaO, LuS, LuO, and YbF [73]. The hyperfine interval ∆ hfs is proportional to α 2 ZF rel (αZ)µg nuc , where F rel is an additional relativistic (Casimir) factor [75]. The rotational interval ∆ rot ∝ µ is roughly independent on α. If we find a molecule with ∆ hfs ≈ ∆ rot , the splitting ω between hyperfine and rotational levels will depend on the following combination ω ∝ µ α 2 F rel (αZ) g nuc − const .\n\nRelative variation is then given by\nδω ω ≈ ∆ hfs ω (2 + K) δα α + δg nuc g nuc + δµ µ ,(40)\nwhere the factor K comes from variation of F rel (αZ), and for Z ∼ 50, K ≈ 1. As long as ∆ hfs /ω 1, we can neglect the last term in Eq. (40).\n\nThe data on hyperfine structure of diatomics are sparse and usually not very accurate. This hampers the search for molecules with strong cancelation of the types, discussed here. Using data from [73] one can find that ω = (0.002 ± 0.01) cm −1 for 139 La 32 S [45]. Note that for ω = 0.002 cm −1 the relative frequency shift is:\nδω ω ≈ 600 δα α .(41)\nWith new data on molecular hyperfine constants appearing regularly, it is likely that other molecular candidates for such experiments will appear soon.\n\n\nB.

Although one might derive directly J (J + 1) from such an empirical analysis of rotational spectra (Monagan and Ogilvie, 1987), in fact J 2 + J + n is compatible with such an analysis, with n taking an arbitrary numerical value; the only two values of n worth considering are 0 and ¼.

Kaledin et al. 22 also reported a band head for the 1−0 band of system VIII at 15946.7 cm −1 (627.09 nm). The system VIII 0−0 band was observed in the present work, and the fitted molecular constants were in good agreement with the literature values. However, the band at 15946.7 cm −1 was not present in our data for the jet-cooled molecule. Instead, we found an Ω′ = 6 − Ω″ = 5 band at 15924.23 cm −1 with upper and lower state The uncertainties in parentheses are those obtained from the rotational line fitting. The absolute uncertainties are 0.1 cm −1 .  In their SEVI study, Babin et al. 16 found 10 bands of NdO with internal energies above 10,000 cm −1 that could be correlated with transitions observed by means of optical spectroscopy.

A striking feature of this calculation is the fact that there are very few states at energies that could be the upper levels for transitions emitting in the green spectral range. The predicted states are mostly clustered below 17,000 (588.2 nm) or above 20,500 cm −1 (487.80 nm) (see Tables 1 and 3 of ref 27.

Accordingly, for lines in a pure-rotational spectrum in absorption or emission within one vibrational state with selection rule ΔJ = +1, implying branch R, the wavenumbers of the lines conform to this formula.\n\nFor purposes of linear regression to evaluate spectral coefficients B, D,..., each with its associated standard deviation, this form is practical.\n\nFor lines in the pure-rotational spectrum within one vibratioinal state recorded as Raman scattering according to selection rule ΔJ = +2, implying branch S, the wavenumbers of the lines conform to this formula.\n\nFor the same purpose of separate evaluation of each spectral coefficient, the following formula is applicable.",

Because the selection rule of g2, when g2 is a good quantum number, states that Ag2 -1, 0, 1, only the 3A1 1E + sub-band is an allowed transition.Since g2 1 is the lowest value for a 3A state, J cannot be less than unity.As J increases, the rules for Hund's case (a) are no longer strictly valid since is no longer well defined.In this regime Hund's case (b) applies and transitions to the d3A 2,3 states are also allowed.\n\nThe peaks, as labeled in Figure 2, illustrate that only the rotational levels up to J 2 are appreciably populated in the ground state.The rotational temperature can be determined by comparing the relative intensities of the different J levels and assuming a Boltzmann distribution with line strengths determined by H6nl-London coefficients.28 The predicted intensities are indicated by the line heights for the labeled transitions.As is expected the Q and R branches are much stronger than the P branch.",

Since the individual C]C bond transition dipoles add, the 1 1 B u ) 1 1 A g transition is seen to be strongly allowed.   The question naturally beckons as to whether there is an excitation described by the out-of-phase excitation of the two double bonds. In trans-butadiene, such a transition would be forbidden, since the transition dipoles of the two double bonds cancel.\n\nAt the present level of theory this transition was found to be the 3 1 A g ) 1 1 A g transition. The corresponding electron vibration is illustrated in Fig. 5. It stands to reason that this state would lie higher in energy than the bright state, since its opposing dipoles lie end-to-end, analogous to a molecular exciton (J-aggregate). 27 This is not the 2 1 A g ) 1 1 A g transition, as one might expect, because the 2 1 A g state is the dark triplet-pair state mentioned above. The exact nature of the 2 1 A g state is a subject of ongoing investigation. 22,28 Like in trans-butadiene, the lowest excited state of trans,trans-hexatriene is described as a dark, doubly excited triplet pair. 29 The next lowest-energy states calculated are 1 1 B u , 2 1 A g and 2 1 B u . The electron vibrations corresponding to excitations to these states from mixing CAS-CI wavefunctions are illustrated in Fig. 6. The lowest-energy bright state is 1 1 B u , and the electron vibration is the in-phase combination of double-bond oscillations.

Of note are other signicant bands at 509 cm À1 , 933 cm À1 , 950 cm À1 and 1209 cm À1 , with various other bands in the ranges 850-955 cm À1 and 1000-1200 cm À1 . To higher wavenumber, we also see repeats of the main structure that lies within the 850-1220 cm À1 range, which are assigned to the same transitions, but with each upper level being in combination with the D 11 , D 9 and D 7 totally symmetric vibrations, as indicated in Fig. 2. As a consequence, in the discussion below we shall focus on the 509 cm À1 band, and key features in the D(v,m) ¼ 0 region (850-1220 cm À1 ). These regions are also the primary focus of the 2D-LIF spectra reported below.\n\n\nAssignment of ZEKE spectra",

It is clear that B e ∼ µ, but α e has an additional dependence on µ via the vibrational wave function and, hence, scales as µ 3/2 .

As a result, B 0 scales as δB 0 /B 0 = Q r µ δµ/µ, with Q r µ ≈ 1.

                    "contents": "Hydrogen Atom and One-Electron Molecular Systems in a Strong Magnetic Field: Are All of Them AlikeIt is well known that studies in a strong magnetic field are very complicated for several reasons. Perhaps, the most serious, conceptual reason is related to the fact that the bound states are of a weakly-bound-state nature (the binding energies are much smaller than the total ones). The perturbation theory in powers of B is fast divergent and thus cannot be used. Asymptotic expansions at B = ∞ have extremely complicated form but, usually, have no domain of applicability inside non-relativistic considerations. For example, it can be easily checked that at an extremely strong magnetic field near the edge of applicability of non-relativistic approximation B = 10000 a.u.(= 2.35 × 10 13 G) [27], the ionization energy E b calculated numerically differs by 300% (!) from the value obtained using the leading term in asymptotic expansion\nE asymp b = 1 2 log 2 B ,\nwhere E b is given in atomic units as well as B (see [6]). Another example is given by the ratio of the binding energies of H + 2 and H ++ 3 . Asymptotically, for B tending to infinity, this ratio should be 1/2.25 . However, the numerical results at B = 3 × 10 13 G [5] give ≈ 1 for this ratio. Therefore the only methods which can be used are either numerical or variational. For B 10 11 G, to the best our knowledge, the numerical methods were used for the hydrogen atom only (see, for example, the excellent early review [7], the book [8] and recent review articles [9,10]). Usually, these methods are very slow-convergent and extremely difficult to implement. The most popular method to study one-electron molecular systems is the variational method (for review, see [11]). However, the use of the variational method is associated with a difficult procedure of minimization and, sometimes, with numerical calculation of multidimensional integrals with high accuracy, which can also be quite cumbersome. In any case, the calculations are made for some particular values of magnetic field. It seems natural to create some approximate expressions valid for all magnetic fields, even having not high accuracy, in order to make at least rough estimates.",

This interaction can, in principle, be treated perturbationally. However, the main contribution to this interaction comes from those space regions where r ∼ R, so that the perturbation series converges extremely slowly. Consequently, we shall account for its main effect in another way. Analyzing its expression given by (7) we see easily that V has a minimum value at r = R and Ω = π; this value is given by V = −1/2r. We shall assume, therefore, that the ground-state wavefunction given above is slightly distorted in such a way as to allow the second electron to take full advantage of this minimum of energy. This amounts to correcting E (0) 0 by V = −1/2r 0 , where r 0 is the average value of the electron distances to the nucleus r 1 = r 2 = r 0 over the hydrogen-like configuration (100) × (100) given above.

Negative frequency shifts are expected, as shown inTable I: non-adiabatic effects perturbing the ground-state dynamics tend to induce excitations of the light particles, and the energy necessary for the transition is \"removed\" from the heavy particles. Comparison with the literature[8], when available, shows that the theory is capable to predict accurate non-adiabatic corrections, even if working within the harmonic approximation and with the generalized gradient approximation to density functional theory. What the approach developed in this study contributes to the field is the possibility of easily extending the numerical applications beyond di-and tri-atomic molecules. To prove this, we provide the first predictions to the non-adiabatic corrections of vibrational frequencies of NH 3 and H 3 O + . It can be seen that the shifts of the N-H stretch frequencies of NH 3 are larger than those of the O-H stretch frequencies of H 3 O + , due to the fact that the N-H bonds are less ionic and as a result the mass carried along by the protons are larger in NH 3 than in H 3 O + .molecule \nH 2 \nH 2 [8] \nH 2 O \nH 2 O [8] \nNH 3 \nH 3 O +",

This has important implications. It shows that even for the fairly simple system of water in water second-order perturbation or, equivalently, assumption of Gaussian-fluctuation statistics, allow only crude descriptions of the actual thermodynamics. This also affects the potential usefulness of linear continuum models of electrostatics, 2,9,[27][28][29][30] which by design do not go beyond a quadratic behavior. However, when calculating free-energy differences, continuum models usually compare approximate representations of physical states rather than performing an expansion around a single state. This can explain their success of giving at least approximately correct free-energy values even in the presence of strongly non-linear dependencies in a corresponding system of atomic resolution. 9 In addition to the failure of the simple Gaussian model, expansions around only a single state using higher-order cumulants are expected to fail. 31 Increasing the order of the perturbation requires accurate information about the poorly sampled tails of distributions. This merely reflects the difficulty to extrapolate to states that strongly differ in their structure and fluctuation statistics. Interpolation on the other hand is in general a much simpler task and allows more accurate predictions. In this work we effectively combine the information of two states to derive a polynomial expression for the chemical potential.\n\nAn important point concerns the treatment of electrostatic interactions in computer simulations of systems under periodic boundary conditions. With respect to system-size dependence and electrostatic model, we obtain consistent results using Ewald summation and a generalized reaction-field model. But consistency is only achieved if self-interactions are included. These self-interactions arise naturally when effective potentials are used for the Coulomb interactions. We made similar observations in previous studies of the chemical potential of ions. 3,10 Adding self-terms to the energies acts as an effective correction for effects of a finite system size. Neglecting them can result in significant deviations for small systems of a few hundred particles.",

This result suggests that the error associated with the PES might be greater than a few hundred cm −1 .We highlight here the methodological advantage: while 64 3 single-point calculations were necessary to approximate the hydrogen PES in the field of fixed Helium atoms on a threedimensional grid, 44 a single NEHF-DMRG calculation approximates the proton electron wave function. Conversely, the downside of nuclear-electronic methods is the need for large basis sets that increases the computational cost of nuclear-electronic post-SCF methods.",

If the two protons are infinitely separated β = 0 and the system has total energy N α, where N is the total number of electrons. H + 2 has only one electron, which, in the ground state, will occupy the bonding orbital, and so H + 2 has a binding energy of β. H 2 has two electrons; in the ground state these electrons have opposite spin and therefore can both occupy the bonding orbital. Thus H 2 has a binding energy of 2β. H − 2 has three electrons, so while two can occupy the bonding state one must be in the antibonding state, therefore the binding energy is only β. Finally, H 2− 2 has four electrons so one finds two in the each molecular orbital. Therefore the bonding energy is zero: the molecule is predicted to be unstable. Thus the Hückel model makes several predictions: neutral H 2 is predicted to be significantly more stable than any of the ionic states; the two singly ionic species are predicted to be equally stable; the doubly cationic species is predicted to be unstable. Further, the lowest optical absorption is expected to correspond to the transition between the bonding orbital and the antibonding orbital. The energy gap for this transition is 2|β|. Therefore, the lowest optical absorption is predicted to be the same in the neutral species and the singly cationic species. Further, this absorption is predicted to occur at a frequency with the same energy as the heat of formation for the neutral species. While these predictions do capture qualitatively what is observed experimentally, they are certainly not within chemical accuracy (i.e. within k B T ∼ 1 kcal mol −1 ∼ 0.03 eV for T = 300 K).

Although the classical and quantum ensembles match closely at more negative values of the coordinate, as one approaches zero, corresponding to a highly shared proton, the quantum distribution exhibits significantly higher probability density. This increase in proton sharing, observed in a number of previous studies 28,29,33,63,64 , is vital in this case, as it solely determines the amount of CT.

The atomic ionization radii are 1.50 bohr for He and 1.89 bohr for Ne, these values correspond well with the 1.41 bohr and 1.83 bohr of Ref. [7]. In Ref. [35] a DFT result for the ionization radius of Ne was obtained with the PW potential using total energy differences, they obtained a value of 1.83 bohr.

All previous works on many electron atoms used the HF approximation and obtained the polarizabilities using finite field methods. We use the SAOP potential in the ground state and the ALDA kernel for the response calculation of the polarizability. We show our results for He and Ne in Fig. 4. For small wall radii we see that the polarizability approaches zero. This is consistent with the findings that for one-electron systems, the results of which are expected to at least qualitatively apply to many-electron systems, the polarizability increases from R = 0 as ∼ R 4 [36].

In Fig. 2 we show the change in HOMO energy with the wall radius for both He and Ne. The HOMO KS orbital decays exponentially and the wall will therefore have some influence up to ∞ and the free atom value is approached asymptotically. From the figure it is clear that the HOMO energies are already very close to the corresponding free atom values around 4 bohr. We obtain 95% of the free atom He HOMO energy at a radius of 3.06 bohr. For Ne, the radius where 95% of the HOMO energy is obtained is at 3.50 bohr.\n\nIn the region where the HOMO energies are practically leveled off, i.e. after 4 bohr, the difference between the HF and SAOP values is almost constant. For He we find a free atom value of -0.8165 a.u., the HF reference value is -0.9174. For Ne our SAOP free atom energy is -0.7585 a.u. and the reference HF value is -0.8511 a.u.. The differences are a result of the difference between the HF potential and our SAOP potential. The free atom value of He is equal to the HF value when the exact xc-potential is used, but as mentioned in the previous section, this potential is not valid when the atom is enclosed in a box of finite radius. We can try to correct for the shift by vertically shifting the SAOP curves with the free atom energy difference. We show the result in Fig. 3.

We emphasize thatF +D is the key quantity that determines the stability and working efficiency of the water wheel, see[41]for further discussions.InFig 2,we also simulate the energy transfer between electrons and nuclei after a vertical excitation to an excited electronic state in a two-level model diatomic molecule (details can be found in the supplemental material[41]).

This is related to the early stage of a bond-breaking process [42], particularly the reaction pathways of small molecules [43], or the redistribution of energy of DNA and RNA [3,4]. Here we idealize the two BO surfaces as harmonic potentials with an avoided crossing in the region R = 0.5 − 1 Bohr. As illustrated in Fig 2(a), after vertical excitation from the equilibrium position of the lower surface, the nuclear wave packet χ starts propagating on the upper one. If we neglect the coupling of the two surfaces, χ undergoes perfect harmonic oscillations around R = 0.5 Bohr with a time period T 0 = 13.6 fs. However, because of the coupling of the surfaces, the nuclear wave packet splits into two branches as it goes through the avoided crossing. One branch stays on the upper surface while the other transfers to the lower one accompanied by energy transfer from electrons to nuclear kinetic energy. This process also breaks the time periodicity because the split wave packets feel the gradients (forces) of two different BO potentials. This is also reflected in Fig 2(c), where the rate of change of T n,marg and T n as functions of t deviate from periodic behavior when t > T0 2 . Here we focus on two points, t = T0 8 and t = 5T0 8 , roughly corresponding to the first two maxima. As shown, there is a significant decrease in dT n,marg /dt from t = T0 8 to t = 5T0 8 . To understand this change, we use our identity (19) and rewrite it as\ndT n,marg dt = ∫ |χ(R, t)| 2 F (R, t)v(R, t)dR,(25)",

For the above values of the error in determining the polarizability, dipole moment, and collisional diameter (Δα = 0.02 Å 3 , Δμ = 0.02 D, and Δσ ii = 0.2 Å), the sought-for error ΔD ij does not exceed 5% for the entire set of collisional partners in the temperature range from 273 to 6000 K. However, as shown below, for many combinations of collision partners, the change in the diffusion coefficient as a result of electronic excitation of the molecule can be about or even less than 5% and, thus, the calculation of the absolute values of the diffusion coefficients for such electronically excited molecules using the proposed methodology is meaningless. However, it is known that modern experimental and theoretical approaches enable an evaluation of the change in the electrical properties of molecules as a result of electronic excitation with greater accuracy than for the value of the electrical property itself [53]. For example, while the polarizability of the O 2 molecule is known with an accuracy of 0.02 Å 3 (1.2%), the accuracy in determining the ratio of the polarizability O 2 (b 1 ) to the polarizability O 2 (X 3 ) is only 0.6% [17].\n\nIn this regard, it is reasonable to present the obtained results in the form of a ratio of the binary-diffusion coefficient of the ith molecule in the electronically excited state in the jth buffer gas to the analogous coefficient for the ground state . This ratio is approximated in the temperature range T = 273-6000 K according to [52] in the form (5) where i is the component for which electronic excitation is considered, and j is the diluent gas (N 2 , O 2 , H 2 O or Ar).

From the figure, we can identify two major features. First, T n,geo is small and T n,marg ≈ T n . This allows us to use our Ehrenfest identity to approximately quantify the rate of change of T n . However, it is worth remarking that in the intermediate or nonadiabatic regimes (for example when α = 10 Bohr −1 or larger), T n,geo is not negligible (figure not shown). Second, as one can see, during time evolution T n essentially goes through periodic oscillations. In fact, if we turn off the adiabatic coupling,",

As a nonstationary Ψ evolves, these expectation values change in time due to the coupling to the electronic subsystem.It has been shown that Ψ(r, R, t) can be factorized into a marginal nuclear wave function χ(R, t) and a conditional electronic wave function Φ R (r, t).[24-27] Furthermore, Φ R satisfies a complicated electronic equation while χ satisfies a simple nuclear TDSE, [26, 27]   i∂ t χ =Ĥ n χ, whereĤ n = ∑ Nn µ=1 1 2Mµ (−i∇ Rµ + A µ ) 2 + ϵ. Here ϵ(R, t) is the scalar potential originating from the electronic equation, and A µ (R, t) = ⟨Φ R | − i∇ Rµ |Φ R ⟩ r are nucleus-dependent vector potentials.

Comparing Eqs. (5)-(7)with Eqs.(2)-(4), one can easily recognize their formal resemblance. The equivalence of Eq. (6) and Eq.(3) implies that the Ehrenfest equation for the momentum of the nuclei can be evaluated by considering either the full system or the nuclear subsystem alone, as shown in Ref. [29]. In replacing the full wave function Ψ by the marginal subsystem wave function χ and the corresponding integration domain, we obtain additional terms with vector potentials A µ",

CONCLUSIONS\n\nThere are several conclusions to take out of the challenge.We start by the most obvious lessons.Some of the composite methods suggested in the past need to be revised, with the underlying optimization procedures brought up to date.The CBS-QB3 structures showed large deviations from the remaining sets, more than likely due to the lack of dispersion corrections in the optimization step.This brings us to the second, rather clear observation, that the dispersion-corrected density functionals show a remarkable performance in structure optimizations.These include B3LYP-D3, ωB97xD, and PBE0-D3 which have much lower computational costs than other alternatives but only a marginal effect on the relative energies (see Fig. 5).This, of course, only holds if the final energies are computed at a suitable theory level.Most submissions applied CCSD(T) or approximations/variations thereof.Whereas there is a satisfactory convergence for relative electronic energies using such CCSD(T)-based methods and also for harmonic ZPVE corrections, attempts to treat the ZPVE beyond the harmonic approximation lead to surprisingly large deviations.This either points at important and challenging anharmonic effects for the investigated systems or else may indicate a limited robustness of such attempts.\n\nVibrational spectroscopy alone was not enough to characterize the OH-O dimer.Considering the uncertainty in the conformational temperature and the integration of the measured absorption bands ratio, it was not even absolutely clear whether an OH-O dimer would be more stable than an OH-π structure.However, it did provide from the start a rather strict test.Across the series, the energy difference between OH-O and OH-π dimers should be lower than 1.5 kJ/mol.Most of the entries combining at least hybrid functionals with dispersion corrections for the optimization and a CCSD(T) energy estimate were able to meet this criterion.Even when crossing anharmonic vibrational frequencies with the measured data, the structure assignment was not totally clear.However, it was possible to further reduce the energy window.The criteria could be further tightened if the correct OH-O conformer were to be identified, e.g., by microwave spectroscopy. 13Experimentally, it should also be possible (given enough time) to further reduce the error bar in the measured intensities.",

( 1) and (2).This leads to no change in the case of MFu but slightly smaller energy spans in the other cases.The revised values are 0.6 ± 0.6, 0.5 ± 0.8, and 0.5 ± 0.3 kJ/mol, for Fu, MFu, and DMFu, respectively.The new criteria do not change our analysis of the theoretical results (Table II) greatly, but the only entries consistent for all three systems are reduced to C, I, J, K, and L.",

The breakdown of the mean absolute deviations for B3LYP with G4MP2 as a function of size of the molecule and type of molecule is given in ESI Fig. 1. † The error increases slightly with size of molecule. In addition, the B3LYP results in this gure indicate that the molecules containing uorine have much larger deviations with G4MP2 than those not containing uorine.\n\nThe database of G4MP2 enthalpies of formation provides a source of data for the derivation of accurate energies of millions of reactions involving organic molecules up to nine heavy atoms. To illustrate this we have calculated some energies for ve different types of reactions from the G4MP2 energies and tabulate them in Table 3. These include (1) alcohol oxidation, (2) alkane oxidation, (3) ether hydrolysis, (4) hydrogenolysis, and (5) carbonyl reduction. Energies for all of these types of reactions are expected to be accurate to about 1 kcal mol À1 based on the accuracy of the G4MP2 energies. In addition to the reaction energies that can be derived, the large database of enthalpies of formation also provides a basis on which to assess existing or newly measured enthalpies of formation. The method by which the enthalpies of formation can be obtained from the database of G4MP2 energies 33 is described in the ESI. †\n\n\nV. Conclusions\n\nEnergies for the $133 000 molecules in the GDB-9 database, containing organic molecules having nine or less atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and uorine as well as hydrogen atoms, have been calculated at the G4MP2 level of theory.

In this example, 50 calculation output files (25 Gaussian geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations with 25 corresponding ORCA single point calculations) are used to create the data in Table 1 and graphed in Figure 2. All raw data was taken from a 2018 study 14 , and is freely accessible through a Zenodo repository 15 . Each point in Figure 2 represents a unique conformer's Gibbs energy. The Boltzmann-weighted values are shown as dashes connected by the curved profiles. Optimizations were done with ωB97X-D/6-31+G(d) 16 implemented in Gaussian using an \"ultrafine\" pruned (99,590) integration grid. Considering solvent effects of the reaction, calculations were run with the SMD solvation model 17 using ethanol, and the concentration of each substance was set to 1.0 M for further thermochemical calculation. GoodVibes allows for solvent media corrections to entropy based on select solvent standard state concentration 18 , which was applied to ethanol in this case.\n\nThermochemistry is evaluated at a temperature of 80°C (353.15 K) in accordance with experimental conditions (the temperature assumed in the original calculations does not influence the results from GoodVibes). These values are corrected using the quasi-harmonic approximation proposed by Grimme. One conformer of intermediate II in the 'Py' pathway has a small imaginary frequency of 2.9 cm -1 , which was \"inverted\" to a real value 2.9 cm -1 , as done in previous works to small imaginary frequencies, typically under >i50 cm -114,19 .",

[187][188][189] Again, the SI includes short tutorials for installing and using the CREST code, which employs xtb to carry out conformational searches of molecules. 188 The six conformers found by CREST are then reoptimized in Psi4 using the PBE0/def2- The data in table 1 leads us to the following insights. First, even the minimal basis sets successfully predict the energy ordering of the conformers: although MINAO flips the order of conformers 5 and 6, it still predicts conformer 1 to be the lowest in energy. Note that this comparison is restricted to the use of fixed geometries; relaxing the geometries in each basis  might change the conclusion somewhat. The good performance of the minimal basis sets for this application shows that conformational energies enjoy an excellent degree of error cancellation, which is one of the main motivations for using atomic basis sets in the first place. 177 The shortcomings of minimal basis sets are showcased by the large differences between the results obtained with the MINAO and STO-nG basis sets. MINAO is derived from atomic calculations only, and is thereby fully biased towards atoms. In contrast, the Slatertype orbital basis used by Hehre et al. 172 is optimized for an average molecular environment, which is reflected in the slightly improved results in table 1.",

At temperatures around or below room temperature the case for using path integral sampling is particularly compelling. Figure 5, shows the dramatic change in the computed radial distribution functions of different phases of solid hydrogen, using DFT combined with the PI+GLE method [131]. Quantum fluctuations substantially smooth out structural correlations, and it is clear that only a simulation that includes them will be able to be in agreement with the experimental structural and thermodynamic properties. The use of colored-noise thermostats combined with PIMD have made it possible to reach an accurate description of these fluctuations with a reasonable computational effort, without having to compromise on the accuracy of the underlying potential energy surface. The possibility of directly using ab initio potentials, and even to couple quantum Monte Carlo and PIMD [? ], is particularly appealing in applications to exotic states of matter, for which the development of empirical potentials that can span multiple phases is particularly challenging.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning a few recent studies that have used PIMD without utilizing acceleration schemes, as they underscore the urgency of making quantum simulations of nuclear degrees of freedom more affordable. For example, PI simulations have been crucial in determining the impact of NQEs on the delocalization of H atoms and their diffusivity in proton conducting media such as triflic acid hydrates [134] and concentrated phosphoric acid [135,136], as well as in perovskite oxides [137] and metals such as iron [138], and on Ni surfaces [139]. Simulations of crystals in high-pressure conditions, such as the high-temperature superconducting SH 3 phase of hydrogen sulfide [140,141], is another field in which accessible and accurate modelling of NQEs will increase significantly the predictive power of atomistic simulations.\n\n\nOUTLOOK AND ONGOING CHALLENGES",

However, this also implies that the system sizes included in such an extrapolation have to be large enough to sample sufficiently short wavevectors in reciprocal space where the structure factor approaches q → 0 linearly.The extrapolation of the (cT) correlation energy contribution for lithium shown in the main article, employs an (N atoms ) −2/3 fit and system sizes of 128 and 208 atoms.We note, however, that the (cT) correlation energies obtained for smaller systems deviate from the employed extrapolation law.To estimate the remaining uncertainty in the thermodynamic limit extrapolation of the (cT) energy we have performed the following analysis based on the UEG.Fig. 4 depicts the (cT) correlation energies of the UEG for a range of electron numbers at a density corresponding to r s =3.2.This density and the employed basis set sizes are identical to the calculations for lithium.Our findings indicate that the difference between thermodynamic limit extrapolations employing the (N ) −2/3 fits and system sizes corresponding to",

It can be shown that the above form of the wavefunction is obtained using perturbation theory from the high density limit and we expect that its accuracy improves for decreasing r s . We first perform a number of optimizations of the trial wave function. Beside the RPA e-p Jastrow, we consider an extra 2 body (e-p) gaussian term with two variational parameters (λ e and w e ). In table 4 we report the values of the variational parameters obtained minimizing a linear combination of the local energy and its variance over a set of different protons and electrons configurations. Typically 1000 configurations have been used, by saving a configuration after 10 or 20 protonic steps during a previous run. We also studied the relative importance of the different terms in the trial wavefunction by performing calculations with partially improved wave functions. In Figure 6 we compare the pair correlation functions for the various calculations in table 4. No significant difference is observed in the electron-electron and in the proton-proton pair correlation functions among different forms of the trial function. We can see that the cooperative effects of the optimized Jastrow factor and the backflow term are responsible of an enhancing of electron-proton correlation as seen in the g ep (r). Inclusion of three-body terms lowers the energy but does not change the pair correlations. Table 4. rs = 1, T = 5000 K, Np = Ne = 16.

Although SCI approaches initially appeared 17 almost 50 years ago with the method of CI by perturbative selective iteration (CIPSI), 17,18 there has been a resurgence of interest 19 in recent years, in part, spurred by the intervening development and success of FCIQMC, which has resulted in various different flavors of SCI-for instance, the original CIPSI, but also stochastic heat-bath CI (SHCI), [20][21][22][23] adaptive CI (ACI), 24 adaptive sampling CI (ASCI), 25 , iterative CI with selection (iCI) 26,27 (a relative of the previous iterative CI (ICI) 28,29 ), and probably many other variations.\n\nThe crux of SCI is performing first the aforementioned selection step of choosing important determinants, followed by a second step of forming the matrix of the Hamiltonian in this space of selected determinants and diagonalizing it, typically using a standard approach (such as, again, the Davidson method). These steps, determinant selection followed by large-matrix diagonalization, are then repeated until the resulting SCI energy (and/or wavefunction) converges to within some threshold, though that convergence is not necessarily monotonic. SCI methods, therefore, perform many steps of explicit large matrix formation and diagonalization, though the matrix is orders of magnitude smaller than the FCI matrix. This is an important distinction between SCI and the work of Rolik et al. along with the work of this paper: here there is no explicit large matrix diagonalization.",

The static correlation in active spaces up to this size can hence be resolved, while dynamic correlation has to be treated a posteriori. Luckily, QC-DMRG allows for an efficient extraction of the two-body RDM (2-RDM) [122,124]. The 2-RDM is not only required to calculate analytic nuclear gradients [102,151], but also to compute the gradient and the Hessian in CASSCF [53]. It is therefore natural to introduce a CASSCF variant with DMRG as active space solver, DMRG-CASSCF or DMRG-SCF [123,124,126]. Static correlation can be treated with DMRG-SCF. To add dynamic correlation as well, three methods have been introduced. With a little more effort, the 3-RDM and some specific contracted 4-RDMs can be extracted from DMRG as well. These are required to apply second-order perturbation theory to a CASSCF wavefunction, called CASPT2, in internally contracted form. The DMRG variant is called DMRG-CASPT2 [138,149,151].\n\nBased on a CASSCF wavefunction, a configuration interaction expansion can be introduced, called MRCI. Recently, an internally contracted MRCI variant was proposed, which only requires the 4-RDM [150]. By approximating the 4-RDM with a cumulant reconstruction from lower-rank RDMs, DMRG-MRCI was made possible [150].\n\nYet another way is to perform a canonical transformation (CT) on top of an MR wavefunction, in internally contracted form. When an MPS is used as MR wavefunction, the method is called DMRG-CT [129,130,143].\n\n\nExcited states",

The CEIMC distribution has more molecules and they are more tightly bound. The discrepancy between CEIMC and LDA in the intramolecular portion of the curve has several possible causes. On the CEIMC side, it may be due to lack of convergence or to the molecular nature of the wave function, which does not allow dissociation. The shift of the molecular bond length peak can be accounted for because LDA is known to overestimate the bond length of a free hydrogen molecule [40] which would account for the shifted location of the bond length peak.

We see in Figure 9 that, although MCCI does much better than CISDT for a similar number of determinants, we cannot reach CI(4) accuracy now that the FCI space is very large even with this smaller cutoff. We contrast this with the results for the smaller basis in Figure 7 where an accuracy slightly higher than that for CI(4) could be achieved by MCCI with a cutoff of 10 −4 . It is worth noting that the CI(4) calculation for cc-pVDZ has become large with 2.8 million determinants, which, together with not much multireference character, suggests that the better performance of CI(4) should be expected here.\n\nWe also compare the use of CSFs with SDs.

If ω = 0.2 for example, the turnover distance to full exchange is sufficiently large that significant densitydriven errors would occur, just as in global hybrids. But already at ω = 0.4, the default value used in LC-ωBLYP [57], ∆ED and the deviation of the IAO charge from the reference are small. iv. Can one see that the HF density is more accurate than the self-consistent density by studying density plots? Typically, it is hopeless.\n\nThere is a long history of studying density differences and density error plots in DFT, in both physics and chemistry, with the aim of improving approximations. Comparison is not only related to the difference between HF and self-consistent DFT approximations, but also for the density of other methods such as MPn and CASSCF. [58] Very little insight can be gained for improving functionals from such plots, due to the complexities of the relation between densities and potentials, as well as that between potentials and energy functionals. Because most good XC energy approximations yield good densities in most calculations, despite their very poor approximate potentials, it is very difficult to trace the effects of a good energy approximation in the (often) tiny differences in densities. Even in cases where we know a better density is yielding better energetics, it is often not possible to say which aspects are relevant. (See Fig. 4 of Ref. [9].)\n\nThe clearest case is that of small anions. For atomic anions, the  [52]. See Table S2 for other RMSD information.  [55].",

Scaling of the method\n\nIn order to test the numerical effort spent with DMRG we performed several tests on the HHeH singlet state at a distance of 1.25Å, either using different basis sets (varying K at constant m) or keeping the basis set (varying m at constant K). The aim of these calculations was twofold. First, to test the scaling of DMRG [4] and second, to demonstrate its superiority with respect to standard post-HF approaches (full CI, QCISD or QCISD(T)). The main disadvantage of post-HF solutions (apart from their scaling) is the lack of at least one of the main feature of DMRG: size consistency and variational character. The only theoretical approach which fulfills all these requirements is presently full CI. For example, CID or QCISD methods are variational but not size consistent. On the other hand, all perturbative techniques (MPn), whose scaling are comparable with the one of DMRG, are not variational and practically feasible only up to n = 4 (inclusion of quadruple excitations).",

For a balanced treatment, in atomic calculations only N eigen /2 eigenvalues are included.The obtained binding energies of the N 2 molecule for different N eigen are also presented in Table I.We see that when N eigen is increased from 900 to 1000, the absolute RPA correlation energies of N 2 and N changes by 0.15 and 0.08 meV, respectively; the binding energy is only changed by 0.001 meV.We note that such a convergence pattern does not change with M max .",

Panel (a) plots the error-i.e., the deviation from the exact FCI result-as a function of runtime for three different choices of the δ-threshold parameter, as described in reference to Figs. 3 and 4. For all three choices, the figure shows smooth monotonic convergence to chemical accuracy, and then to an order-of-magnitude or two beyond chemical accuracy for the smaller δs.\n\nOf course, the main focus of this work is on doing the minimal amount possible to just achieve chemical accuracy and panel (a) of Fig. 6 illustrates that this is indeed accomplished in 1 second for this system. These calculations were performed on an Intel Core i7-11800H laptop processor with 8 cores running at a base clock of 2.3 GHz. In comparison, the calculation for H 2 O from Ref. 8 took around 450 seconds. This was in 2008 on a server-grade AMD Opteron processor with a single core probably running at2.4 GHz. Given the similar clock speeds, the timing difference is obviously not attributable solely to the different processors, despite having 8 cores in the newer model.\n\nLikewise, Fig. 1 has already shown the timings and memory footprint of a state-of-the-art, but conventional, FCI calculation for this system (H 2 O, 19 orbitals). It was run on the same consumer-grade Intel Core i7 model using the Psi4 quantum chemistry program, 35 giving a runtime of about 210 seconds per iteration. With conventional FCI, however, chemical accuracy is reached in only 3 iterations, so at about 630 seconds of runtime, see Fig. 1, this is probably comparable to Ref. 8's method but still several orders of magnitude more expensive than the truncated Davidson method presented here, even when, for this simple system, memory-constraints are not an issue.",

There are typically n=2 or 3 projectors (index k in Eq. 32) for each angular momentum l. This leads to improved scattering properties and transferability, similar to augmented planewave (PAW), ultrasoft (US) [42], and multiple-projector norm-conserving Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials [43]. The parameters B k l j and β k l j were fit to reference data consisting of all-electron 4-component, multi-configurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) total energy calculations for about 100 relativistic states with the Breit interaction included perturbatively. The accuracy of the fit was reported as 10 −2 eV, with maximum deviations of 5 × 10 −2 eV [39]. As improved all-electron relativistic treatments are developed, emerging new energy-consistent PPs [44] can be easily incorporated into the same framework.\n\nThese small core PPs correspond to large active valence spaces. For the Bi atom, for example, the PP treats 23 valence electrons. For the initial applications of the method in this paper, we used a frozen-core transformation in the target systems to effectively transform these to large-core PPs, similar to previous scalar relativistic only CCSD(T) calculations which also used Stuttgart PPs [37,38,40]. Only the valence s and p electrons are explicitly treated at the many-body level, while all semi-core electrons are frozen at the scalar relativistic HF/DFT level of theory.

For the cc-pVDZ results (columns 2 and 7), we compare with results from CCSDTQ [78]. These comparisons are necessarily indirect, since different geometries were used between the two sets of results, and the ASCI results are all electron. However the difference in geometries are not so large. Surveying the full set of molecules, we find less than 1 kcal differences between atomization energies. For the cc-pVTZ results (columns 4 and 9), we compare to benchmark complete basis set (CBS) frozen core results [78,79]. Again the comparison is not direct, but it is clear that the atomization energies are trending in the right direction in comparison to the CBS limit. To demonstrate the similarity of geometries between the different calculations, in Table XIII we present results of ASCI with perturbation corrections for selected molecules using the geometries from Feller et. al.

These can be compared with the corresponding energies from Table IX and X to estimate the energy difference between the two sets of geometries and confirm the similarity.\n\nIt is also interesting to compare with recent auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo results (AFQMC) that are now able to calculate the G1 set [42]. AFQMC is accurate on many of these systems, but loses accuracy in certain situations such as for ionic systems like LiF and NaCl. This is likely due to deficiencies in the current trial wave functions used in AFQMC. See Ref. [42] for more details. Further comparisons between these methods will be interesting in the future. We also note that recent work on DMRG has also added perturbative corrections to that methodology [86,87], although it is not clear whether the largest simulations required for the G1 set are feasible with DMRG, even with perturbation theory improvements.

Core excitation energies\n\nTo examine if our SLC hybrid functionals also improve upon the other functionals for core excitation energies, we take the 38 core excitation energies of 13 molecules from Ref. [114], containing a total of 15 core→valence and 23 core→Rydberg excitation energies for the firstand second-row nuclei (from the 1s core orbitals). In conventional TDDFT, the calculations of core excited states can be prohibitively expensive, owing to the large number of roots required to obtain the high energy core excited states. Following Besley et al. [114], we perform TDDFT calculations using the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) [137] within a reduced single excitation space (which includes only excitations from the core orbitals of interest) [140], to reduce the computational costs of core excitation energies. The calculations are performed with the 6-311(2+,2+)G** basis set and EML(100,302) grid.\n\nFor the core excitation energies (see Table IV), PBE, LC-ωPBE, and ωB97 perform very poorly, while ωB97X, ωB97X-D, and ωB97X-D3 only have minor improvement, due to the small fraction of HF exchange in the SR region. By contrast, SLC-PBE-D3 and SLC-B97-D3 perform comparably, slightly improve upon SLC-LDA-D3, and significantly outperform PBE, LC-ωPBE, the ωB97 series, and perhaps, other LC hybrid functionals adopting a small fraction of HF exchange in the SR region. For the core excitation energies, the statistical errors associated with SLC-PBE-D3 and SLC-B97-D3 are about one order of magnitude smaller than those associated with PBE, LC-ωPBE, and the ωB97 series! Therefore, the inclusion of a very large fraction of HF exchange at small interelectronic distances is also important for accurately describing core excitation energies. While we do not consider the relativistic corrections here, our comments remain similar for the core excitation energies with the relativistic corrections [130].\n\n\nC. Noncovalent interactions",

MOPAC2016 includes more advanced SCF algorithms than are available in the CNDO/INDO code. By incorporating INDO into MOPAC2016 in a way that harnesses these algorithms, I have enabled SCF convergence for systems much larger than were feasible within CNDO/INDO. 2.

Despite the fact that the three states lie in close proximity of each other, MBE-FCI succeeds in distinguishing between them. In relation to the troublesome dipole moment for the first excited state, this is also the result in Fig. 2 for which the largest discrepancy with respect to i-FCIQMC is observed. In order to determine a more accurate value of µ 1 , more walkers would need be employed in i-FCIQMC and a more conservative screening protocol would need be used in the context of MBE-FCI (as for LiH in Fig. S3 of the SI). Finally, consumed core hours are presented in Table 2. As for LiH, these results once again convincingly illustrate the efficacy of the MBE-FCI method as well as the low penalty associated with computing dipole moments over correlation and excitation energies. In summary, we have reported on a new extension of MBE-FCI theory to molecular firstorder properties, valid for both ground and excited states. The performance of the resulting implementation has been verified through calculations on the first three roots of the LiH and MgO diatomics by comparing our results to state-of-the-art i-FCIQMC. On the basis of the proven accuracy and efficacy, we foresee that MBE-FCI has the potential to act as a new near-exact benchmark method for first-order properties of small-to modest-sized molecular systems in the years to come. Although the theory depends on a choice of reference space that necessarily encompasses the main determinant(s) of the target state, we are currently working on automatic selection procedures that will allow for the black-box division of a system's total set of MOs into optimal reference and expansion spaces. \n\n\nSupporting Information",

Improving the trial wave function as discussed in the previous subsection worsen the agreement. The opposite behavior is observed at T=5000 K where the better agreement between PIMC and CEIMC is observed with the improved wave function (SJE3B in the Figure). We interpret this behaviour as follows: at lower temperature the improved trial wave function (18) provides the \"correct\" electron-proton correlation (through the combined effect of the optimized Jastrow and the electron-proton backflow, see the discussion relative to Figure 6 in the previous subsection). At this temperature the electronic thermal effects on the electron-proton correlation are quite small and the electronic ground state as provided by CEIMC is quite accurate. Instead at higher temperatures electron-proton scattering is influenced by excited electronic states which are not considered in the CEIMC method. As a result the electron-proton pair correlation function shows a weaker correlation near the origin and it is in better agreement with the CEIMC result with the Slater-Jastrow trial function rather than with the CEIMC result for the improved trial function.\n\n\nHydrogen equation of state and solid-liquid phase transition of the protons\n\nWe present in this subsection, results for the equation of state (EOS) of hydrogen in the metallic phase including the solid-liquid transition of protons.

First, we start with a Hartree-Fock based DMFT Hamiltonian which avoids the double counting problems of the commonly employed DFT-DMFT scheme. Second, we have investigated the truncated configuration interaction (CISD) as an impurity solver. The CI hierarchy avoids the sign problem inherent to Monte Carlo solvers in DMFT, and allows a systematically improvable approach to the exact solution. Conversely, the DMFT framework enables even truncated CI to be extended to the infinite crystal. In the simple but challenging cubic hydrogen model we find that CI at the singles and doubles level already reproduces the structure of the density of states in the various electronic regimes with near perfect accuracy. Finally, we have carried out an investigation of some numerical aspects of the DMFT procedure, including convergence of the self-consistent cycle and convergence of properties with respect to the bath discretisation. We find that modest bath sizes, easily accessible to the CI solver, already produce converged results.\n\nThese investigations should be viewed as first steps and there are many avenues to develop these ideas. For example, the Hartree-Fock starting point in DMFT treats long-range Coulomb interactions at only the mean-field level, neglecting long-range screening. Quantum chemical perturbation techniques may be useful in treating these additional interactions and may prove complementary to current Green's function treatments of screening [8,31]. Also, there is a wealth of quantum chemical wavefunction approximations that could be combined with the DMFT framework, the most obvious example being coupled cluster theory, which should prove advantageous over configuration interaction as the number of impurity orbitals increases.\n\nAdditionally, the main ideas in this work, in particular, the use of quantum chemical Hamiltonians and solvers, are not limited to the single orbital DMFT that we have used to study cubic hydrogen. Their combination with multi-orbital and cluster versions of DMFT [17,[49][50][51] should be investigated. Finally, the possibility of using DMFT in finite systems, either within the standard DMFT formalism [52,53] or through a true finite DMFT formalism [21], or the use of DMFT ideas with quantum variables other than the Greens function are further intriguing possibilities for the future.\n\n\nVI.

In its Kohn-Sham (KS) version, the non-idempotent 1-matrix γ 1 is the sum of an idempotent part γ KS 1 , corresponding to a non-interacting system with the kinetic energy T KS [ρ 1 ], and a remainder, such that (i) Dγ KS 1 = occ κ |ψ κ (1)| 2 (these KS orbitals ψ κ are not natural orbitals!) gives the correct GS density ρ 1 of the interacting system (although γ KS its solution gives (together with the aufbau principle) the density ρ 1 (1) and the total energy E. Besides Lagrange multipliers ε κ appear, which surprisingly approximate the quasi-particle band structure of sp metals as (from a conceptional point of view) illegitimate children of the KS-DFT (W. Kohn). But for semiconductors their KS-DFT band gaps are too small and for heavy-fermion systems the experimental effective masses are much larger than the KS-DFT ones. DFT goes beyond the correlation neglecting Hartree-Fock approximation. It is well-tried and widely used for both finite and extended (metallic and semiconducting/insulating) systems, cf. e.g. [4]. The interconnections between DFT and CC theory are studied (R.J. Bartlett at [18]). Activities are going on trying to remove deficiencies and failures of this method (e.g. the van-der-Waals interaction [68], the problems listed under (d), the asymptotic behavior of the XC potential [69]), and to generalize it, e.g. DFT for MR cases (A. Savin at [18]), time-dependent DFT [70] and its relation to QPT [71], DFT for excited states [72], DFT for transport properties [73]. In particular the originally used LDA [based on the HEG and being the Thomas-Fermi approximation on a higher level] is modified (i) by climbing the 'Jacob's ladder' via GGA and Meta-GGA up to Hyper-GGA, which are non-empirical approximations for E XC [ρ 1 ] designed for molecules and solids [74], (ii)",

The underlying method of CI+MBPT treats the valence-valence electron correlations using CI and incorporates core-valence interactions using MBPT. Recently the particle-hole CI+MBPT formalism has allowed important hole-excitations to be treated using CI [9], however there are computational constraints on its implementation. The size of the Hamiltonian matrix generated in the CI routine increases dramatically with the addition of more electrons which in turn places heavier demands on computational recourses. Moreover, accurate spectra calculations require the CI basis set to be large enough for saturation of the CI wavefunction. Consequently, the time and memory needed to diagonalise the CI matrix can exceed the supercomputer capacities typically available to atomic physicists before saturation is achieved. This paper presents a way of minimising the computational resources needed for CI calculations. The \"emu CI\" method (Sec. II B) can be implemented directly within existing CI+MBPT programs without sacrificing accuracy of results. We have tested the convergence of the method on the 5-valence-electron system tantalum with atomic number Z = 73, and compared our results with usual CI+MBPT and existing experimental data. We then calculate the spectra and isotope shift constants for tantalum's superheavy analogue dubnium (Z = 105) and estimated uncertainties. The method we present may allow for more accurate structure calculations in atoms with many valence electrons without the need for major modifications to existing code.\n\nTo date, it has been assumed that increasing the CI basis set will result in the calculated atomic spectra converging to a value close to the experimental data. Due to computational limits, the assumption that CI converges at large basis sets has not been tested. The emu CI modification allows for the CI basis set to be increased to very large sizes.",

The results of iteration 9 from panel (a) are chosen as representative, which are seen in panel (b) to take about 10 seconds to generate (per geometry). Visually, the results from iteration 9 match the FCI results for all bond lengths, whereas, the results from CC theory do not quite accomplish the same. The CCSD results are off by some margin at equilibrium, but the errors grow substantially as the bond is stretched, finally giving a spurious peak in the PES near the dissociation limit. The unphysical peak is a consequence of the refer-ence Hartree-Fock (HF) determinant being generated by an restricted HF (RHF) calculation in a situation where the dissociation products are two radicals. Accordingly, panel (c) also shows the CCSD result when the calculation is based upon an unrestricted (spin-polarized) HF (UHF) solution, in which case the correct dissociation limit is reached, but the errors in the bond-breaking region (and at equilibrium) remain. To investigate the remaining error, Psi4 was run at the higher CC3 level of theory. With an RHF reference, CC3 gave results in good visual agreement with FCI at equilibrium and through the bond-breaking region (and in agreement with 9 iterations of the present approach) but, as with CCSD, it gave spurious results near dissociation. Running CC3 based on a UHF reference again cured the problem at dissociation, but it caused a slight worsening of the result in the bond-breaking region, as can be seen from visual inspection panel (c).",

It is, at this stage, important to understand that probability and chance only referred to limited human knowledge. The world itself was deterministic. Given the initial constraints were known, all future development was thought to be predictable. On this basis, Laplace analyzed the seemingly odd behavior of the planets Jupiter and Saturn [19], thereby not only illustrating the stability of the solar system but also introducing new mathematical concepts (e.g. the term ''potential'' and the Laplace operator). His treatise on probability [20] became a cornerstone of probability theory. Before Laplace, probability theory was solely concerned with mathematical analysis of games of chance. Laplace applied probabilistic ideas to many scientific and practical problems.

Belief, probability, frequency, and statistics: decision making in a floating worldFor metrologists, the period between 1760 and 1810 is of special significance. Laplace, like Lavoisier, was a member of the Metrological Commission founded in 1791 to establish unified standards for weight and measures. The foundations of what today has developed into the SI were laid in these times. From these times also came the recognition that chance follows laws. For one, the mortality tables proved the constancy of female and male birth rates and Gauss [21] gave an elegant proof of Eq. (3), nowadays known as the Gaussian distribution. In between, the expeditions sent out to measure the Paris meridian [22] accomplished their goal [23] and, eventually, established internationally recognized references like the meter, the kilogram, and the second. Even though probability theory and science went separately, the laws of chance and probability were developed in parallel to the extremely deterministic natural laws of Galilei and Newton. In the nineteenth century scientists were searching for laws, causality, and prediction. Probability theory, however, did not provide a sufficient basis for any conclusion about individual events. While one faction of the 19th centuries probabilists focused on the mean values of their observations (e.g. crime, marriages, suicides, birth, death) thereby discovering surprising stability, the other faction studied variation revealing fluctuation incompatible with pure chance. Still, measurement data did not play a role in probability theory. The leaders in probability theory in the nineteenth century concentrated on eugenics [24]. Eugenics deals with interference to improve the human gene pool. Galton invented the term ''eugenics'' and wrote the first book on the subject [25]. Galton also invented linear regression and pioneered the use of the Gaussian distribution, Eq. (3), to interpret histograms of collected data. Galton's successor was Karl Pearson. Pearson is a cofounder of psychology and biometry. His contributions on statistics should be known to almost all scientists-he is the originator of the correlation coefficient [26], the v 2 goodness-of-fit test [27], and the method of moments [28] \n\n\nPearson, Neyman and Fisher",

As of September 4, 2003, the conjecture has been verified for all positive integers up to 224 × 2 50 ≈ 2.52 × 10 17 (Roosendaal, 2003+). Furthermore, one can give a heuristic probabilistic argument (Crandall, 1978) that since every iterate of the function T decreases on average by a multiplicative factor of about ( 3 2 ) 1/2 ( 1 2 ) 1/2 = ( 3 4 ) 1/2 , all iterates will eventually converge into the infinite cycle {1, 2, 1, 2, ...}, assuming that each T (i) sufficiently mixes up n as if each T (i) (n) mod 2 were drawn at random from the set {0, 1}. However, the Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture has never been formally proven. In this paper, we show that the Collatz 3n + 1 Conjecture can, in fact, never be formally proven, even though there is a lot of evidence for its truth:\n\nTheorem 1: For m, n ∈ N, the value of T (m) (n) mod 2 is not uniquely determined by the values of (n, T (1) (n), ..., T (m−1) (n)) mod 2.",

Typical studies asked for the effect of some substance on biomass production. Which fertilizer is better? What croprotation system works better for what kind of soil? Such questions were highly relevant economically. But how to address them? Fisher's answer was randomization, analysis of variance (ANOVA), maximum likelihood, and the theoretical concepts of efficiency and sufficiency. Here is no space to fully appreciate the contribution of Fisher who, in addition to his statistical work, continued to contribute to eugenics and genetics. It is, however, almost impossible to overestimate Fisher's impact: ''Fisher was a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science ….''

It satisfies: K ≥ 0 for any distributions ρ (1) i , ρ (2) i . It is a measure which quantifies the distinguishability (or distance) of ρ (1) i from ρ (2) i , employing a well-known concept in standard information theory. In other words it describes how close is ρ\n(1) i to ρ (2) i\nby carrying out observations or coin tossing, namely trials L (in the sense described in [32]). However, the distance K does not satisfy the triangle inequality and in addition is i) not symmetric ii) unbounded and iii) not always well defined [32]. To avoid these difficulties Rao and Lin [33,34] introduced a symmetrized version of K [32], the Jensen-Shannon divergence\nJ(ρ (1) , ρ (2) ) = H ρ (1) + ρ (2) 2 − 1 2 H(ρ (1) ) − 1 2 H(ρ (2) )(23)\nwhere H(ρ) = − i ρ i ln ρ i stands for Shannon's entropy. J is minimum for ρ (1) = ρ (2) and maximum when ρ (1) and ρ (2) are two distinct distributions, when J = ln 2. In our case J can be easily generalized for continuous density distributions. For J minimum the two states represented by ρ (1) and ρ (2) are completely indistinguishable, while for J maximum they are completely distinguishable. The amount of distinguishability can be further examined by using Wooters' criterion [32]. Two probability distributions ρ (1) and ρ (2) are distinguishable",

For any string x ∈ {0, 1} * , the Kolmogorov complexity of\nx relative to M is K M (x) = min{ |p| | p ∈ {0, 1} * & M (p) = x},\nwhere |p| denotes the length of string p. It is well known that for a universal Turing machine U and any other machine M there is a constant c M such that for all strings x, K U (x) ≤ K M (x) + c M . For the rest of the paper we will fix some universal Turing machine U and we will measure Kolmogrov complexity relative to that U . Thus, we will not write the subscript U explicitly. We define K t (x) = min{ |p| | U (p) = x and U (p) uses at most t(|x|) steps}. Unlike traditional computational complexity the time bound is a function of the length of the output of U .",

Belief, probability, frequency, and statistics: decision making in a floating worldwhere events A and B have probabilities of P(A) and P(B), respectively. A 0 is the complementary event of A. The symbol P(A|B) denotes a conditional probability, that is a probability that event A occurs provided event B occurred. The importance of the theorem can be appreciated from both the terms P(A|B) and P(B|A). If the conditional probability P(B|A) is known but P(A|B) is required, Eq. (4) provides a way to obtain it. Bayes' theorem, despite its importance, often remains obscure to people for several reasons. First the concept of ''conditional probability'' is unknown to most chemists. Further, it is clear that in case of independent (unconditional) events the probability of observing the two events A with probability P(A) and B with probability P(B) is P(A)P(B) but ''conditional probability'' is less clear. Therefore, a brief example may illustrate its importance. Consider an immunoassay. The immunoassay will be positive in presence of a doping substance in 99% of cases. Only in 1% of the cases where no drug is present the immunoassay will be positive (so-called false-positive result). The percentage of samples to the laboratory actually contaminated with the drug is, say, 1%. The question of interest is: if the immunoassay indicates contamination with doping drug, what will be the probability that the sample is actually contaminated? This is a simple example because only two possibilities exist. The probability P(A) that a sample holds the doping drug is 0.01. The probability that the immunoassay is positive if the sample is contaminated is 0.99. The probability P(A 0 ) that the sample is not contaminated is (1 -P(A)) = 0.99. The probability P(B|A 0 ) that the immunoassay is positive despite the fact the sample is clean is 0.01. Hence we have\nPðAjBÞ ¼ 0:01 Á 0:99 = ðð0:01 Á 0:99Þ þ ð0:99 Á 0:01ÞÞ ¼ 0:5:ð5Þ",

Belief, probability, frequency, and statistics: decision making in a floating worldpV ¼ Eð1Þ\nwhere p is the probability of the event, V its outcome value, and E the expectation (note: this is a historic definition of expectation). If the probability p of obtaining an outcome of V = 100 € is 0.1, then the expectation E is 10 €. In relationship expressed by Eq. (1) probability has changed from a term expressing personal belief into a (dimensionless) quantity. It may, therefore, not be surprising that the first text offering a mathematical formulation for probability was in terms of what players in a game should get. Huygens' ''De ratiociniis in ludo aleae'' [11] was published briefly after Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat exchanged letters over a question nowadays known as the ''problem of points''. The question was posed by A. Gombaud Chevalier de Méré: two players P1 and P2 agree to play a series of fair games until one of them has won a specified number N of games. The play is suddenly interrupted. P1 has won N 1 games and P2 N 2 games. How should the stakes be divided? A series of publications on probabilities was initiated, from Graunt's ''Observations on the Bills of Mortality'' [12] to Bernoulli's ''Ars Conjectandi'' [13]. Graunt's work on mortality tables, together with Halley's similar work using data of the City of Breslau, reminds us that probability was seen as a subject of science but not primarily as a tool for science. The ''Ars Conjectandi'' was published posthumously in 1713 and contains, in addition to an annotated version of Huygens' treatise, a proof of Newton's binomial theorem,\nð1 þ xÞ n ¼ X n i¼0 n i x i ;ð2Þ",

Belief, probability, frequency, and statistics: decision making in a floating worldAll the previous discussions would be of limited importance to metrologists if the situation concerning the fundamentals of science had not changed radically at the beginning of the twentieth century. One reason for that is quantum theory. Kolmogorov, like Fisher, was a frequentist. To a frequentist the probability of an event is equal to its relative occurrence in a larger number of repetitions of an experiment. Thus, the repeatability of an experiment is an essential element in the application of statistical tools. As co-worker at the agricultural station at Rothamstead and in his eugenic studies, Fisher had access to a large number of data. It was clear, especially after the contributions of Gosset [44], that the law of large numbers required a larger number of repetitions of an experiment if the power of a significance test was not to be compromised. In the social sciences, also, the sample size was usually larger than about 30. Fisher insisted on the use of frequencies because these were based on actually observed/measured data. These data formed the closest connection with reality available. And reality was, still, deterministic. Thus, compared with the subjective probabilities of Laplace, the frequentist approach appeared to be a major progress in the direction of objectivity. During the 19th century, Laplace was the authority on the use of probability: ''It is remarkable that a science which began with the consideration of games of chance has become the most important object of human knowledge'' [20]. He suggested a subjective interpretation of probability along Bayes' theorem. His famous quote: ''Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation'' is an account to this position. It is also worth noting that the major statistical tool in the 19th century, the least-squares method, was not a subject of dispute, because it can be derived by sampling theory approaches, on the basis of maximum likelihood, and by Bayesian inference with the same final result. The dispute between subjectivists and frequentists is, nevertheless, still vivid [45].",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter. Y/n. This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

In a letter in 1911 to Otto Hahn (with whom Rutherford corresponded frequently), Rutherford writes: \"I have been working recently on scattering of alpha and beta particles and have devised a new atom to explain the results, and also a special theory of scattering. Geiger is examining this experimentally, and finds so far it is in good agreement with the facts. I am publishing a paper on the subject to appear shortly.\"\n\nThis alludes to the famous Rutherford model of the atom, with a compact nucleus inside, and to his scattering formula.\n\nDuring his Manchester period, Rutherford makes another striking discovery. On bombarding nitrogen with his beloved alpha particles, he discovers a new particle, which he calls the proton. He publishes this epiphany just before leaving Manchester in 1919. , 1919 -1937 In 1919, Rutherford returns to Cambridge. Now a Super-Celebrity, he has been appointed to succeed J.J. as Director of the Cavendish Laboratory. He continues his work on protons by shooting alpha particles at light atoms. His technical assistant, G. R. Crowe, has witnessed Rutherford's active engagement in the experiments and his sense of humour.

We tried to repeat his conditions but were unable to obtain such a low velocity. Whether Geiger's result may prove correct or not there must be some very radical change accompanying the absorption of the a-particles when their velocity falls to 0*41 of the initial velocity (radium C). We now turn to the discussion of the figures given in the first section of the paper for the velocity curves in the various materials. For the airvelocity curve Geiger deduced from his results the formula V3 = aR, where V is the velocity, a a constant and R the range of the a-particles emerging from the absorbing foil. Putting in the value 6'94 for the total range at 15° and 76 cm. Hg, the values given in Column 6 of Table II were deduced and it will be seen that except for velocities less than 0*41 they show a good agreement with the experimental values. With regard to the velocity curves in other materials the formula does not hold, the curve approaching more nearly to that expressed by V2 = &R for substances of increasing atomic weight. This is indicated by the energy curve for gold shown in fig. 1. Darwin (loc. cit.) first attempted to deduce expressions for the velocity curve in various materials, the assumption being that the a-particle loses energy by setting in motion the electrons in the atoms of the absorbing substance. To avoid, as far as possible, any hypotheses as to the structure of atoms Darwin also assumed that an a-particle only acts on the electrons in an atom when it actually passes through the atom. Bohr has extended Darwin's results and removed the objection of limiting the action of the a-particle. Bohr arrives at a formula which may be reduced to",

First of all, the energy dependence of the parameters C, α, and β is minor: in the shown energy range in Tab.\n1 (5 MeV ≤ E lab ≤ 40 MeV)\nthe parameters C, α, and β do not vary by more than about 5 %; the energy range of the scattering experiments in this study is much smaller. Second, the parameter C scales the total strength of the interaction; any arbitrary choice of the parameter C will be compensated during the fitting procedure by the adjustment of the potential strength parameter λ . The parameters α and β have some influence on the shape of the folding potential; however, this is at least partly compensated by fitting the potential width parameter w. Instead of discussing the parameters λ and w it is recommended to discuss the real volume integrals J R and rootmean-square radii r R,rms of the fitted real potential because these parameters are practically independent of the chosen parameters C, α, and β of the density dependence.",

In particular from a consideration of the scattering of a-partieles it has been found that the atom consists essentially of a very concentrated charge at the centre of the atom* surrounded by electricity of the opposite sign, probably electrons, distributed throughout the remainder of the atom. Further, Darwinf and BohrJ have attempted to obtain information as to the number and distribution of electrons in the atom by a consideration of the absorption or loss of velocity of the a-partides in passing through matter. The only data for this purpose so far obtainable are provided by the velocity curves, or relations between velocity and thickness of matter traversed, in aluminium as determined by Rutherford, § and in mica as determined by Geiger.|| It seemed, therefore, of interest to make a more complete investigation of the velocity curves in various substances, more particularly as the earlier observations are subject to slight errors due to the assumption that equal thicknesses of matter have the same air equivalent at different parts of|the range of a-particles.\n\nIn the present experiments the velocity curves in gold, copper, aluminium, mica and air have been determined, using as source the a-particles of radium C as in the experiments of Rutherford and of Geiger. The velocities of the a-particles before and after passing through sheets of matter of various thicknesses were measured by the deflection of the a-particles in a known magnetic field, The apparatus used is shown in fig. 1. It consists essentially of a source of radiation D, a series of absorption foils T, a slit L, to form a pencil of the a-particles, and a zinc sulphide screen M on which the position of the pencil could be observed, the whole being enclosed in an evacuated chamber C between the poles of a large electromagnet.\n\n\n( DnaDDOODnnnn",

Three foils of mica, equivalent to 6*5, 6*6, and 6*8 cm. of air, were employed successively and placed directly over the source with a separate evacuation for each experiment. The resultant double deflections were 3*35, 3*33 and 3*25 mm. respectively, and the double deflec tion for the bare wire was 1*40 mm. These values are constant within the limits of experimental error due to the extreme faintness of the bands, the mean value of the velocity being 0*42 of the velocity with the source uncovered. The cross wire in the microscope was set in each case on the centre of the band of scintillations. Owing to the faintness of the bands there was some difficulty in estimating any possible unhomogeneity in velocity. However, the deflected band appeared narrower for the greater thicknesses. For the mica equivalent to 6*5 cm. the measurements indicated that a-particles of 39 to 47 per cent, of the initial velocity were present. However, a lower limit of velocity was not at all evident even with the thicker micas.\n\n\nDiscussion of Results.\n\nIt will be more convenient first to discuss the results of the last section. It is possible that in the beam of a-particles after passing through 6'5 cm. air-equivalent, the velocities are distributed within the limits 39 to 47 per cent., just mentioned. With further absorption the particles of higher velocities may become degraded in velocity. However, we are faced with the difficulty of accounting for the absence of a-particles of lower velocities. It is possible that they no longer produce scintillations. This point was investigated with different zinc sulphide screens but with negative results. But even if they no longer produce scintillations then it is probable that they also no longer ionise, for the ranges of a-particles determined by the scintillation method are the same as those determined by the ionisation method.",

The dominant complexity is involved in the squares and multiplications in the inequality test, and the amplitude amplification only gives a multiplicative factor, for a total complexity of O(log N log(N/ )) Toffolis. When calculating the Hamiltonian and the force operators of the water clusters, shown in Fig. 8, in STO-3G, we recognize that the matricized two-body coefficients M (pq),(rs) have degenereted eigenspaces. The resulting eigenvectors are thus only defined up to some gauge. While this is not a practical issue for applying any of the methods, repeated calculations will lead to slightly different lambdas. To avoid this ambiguity, we break the symmetry by shifting the positions of the atoms, x i → x i + N (0, σ) with σ = 10 −6 .",

Transient Electron Localization\n\nThe importance of nonadiabatic electron behavior has become increasingly obvious with time-resolved examination of electron dynamics occurring in the CREI regime, where the quasi-static description of electron behavior has proven incomplete [38].In fact, time-resolved studies of ionization in H 2 and electron behavior therein demonstrated not only that ionization was enhanced but also that the timing of peak ionization could be changed: at laser parameters supporting nonadiabatic behavior, ionization no longer occurred with maximum amplitude near the electric field peak.Instead, several discrete bursts of ionization occurred throughout each half-cycle of the driving laser field (see Fig. 5, [39]).\n\nAnalysis of the time-dependent electron density distribution in H 2 illustrates that bursts of ionization are accompanied by a transient electron localization upon alternating nuclear centers several times per half-field cycle of the driving laser field [38][39][40][41].This dynamic drives population toward the uphill potential well, from which it can be efficiently and rapidly ionized.This dynamic is highly sensitive to the strength and frequency of the electric field used.Different wavelengths or field strengths result in different numbers of localizations during each half-laser cycle, so that selection of the appropriate wavelength enables the localization of the wavefunction counterintuitively and predominantly on the uphill well, reminiscent of the modulated charge distribution described in [22].",

Other parameters are the same as used above. When subjected to a slow bath (γ = 10 cm −1 ), the oscillation persists as long as almost 1.5 ps. Nevertheless, if we gradually tune γ upwards till 220 cm −1 , the oscillation amplitude is correspondingly damped with a larger extent. Along with this reduction is the loss of dynamical localization effect which could be thought of as the non-Markovian features. The stationary equilibration is achieved roughly at T = 500 fs when γ = 220 cm −1 , which is nearly in resonance with the excitonic energy gap ∆ gap . More interestingly, if we keep driving γ out of the resonance region to reach another limit, γ = 1000 cm −1 , as shown in Fig. 6 (b), the oscillation amplitudes grow back.

Nonstandard initial conditions result when the bath does not have sufficient time to equilibrate to the electron created in the donor state. An example of an experiment in which this may occur is the one depicted in Fig. 1(b) and considered in Sect. II B. Following the photoinjection of an electron into the donor state in Fig. 1(b), the bath may not have enough time to equilibrate to the electron if the subsequent ET rate is rapid.

We can express the eigenfunction in the form of variable separation: Ψ(x, y) = e ikx χ k (y)/ √ L, where k = 2πj/L with an integer j. The transverse part χ k (y) is an eigenfunction of the equation\nH k χ k (y) = Eχ k (y), where H k ≡ p 2 y 2m + mω 2 c 2 (y − y k ) 2 + V (y)(3)\nwith ω c ≡ |e|B/m and y k ≡ k/(|e|B).

This further highlights the subtle balance that must be accomplished between the non-interacting and the interelectronic (angular) parts (denoted here χ and Ψ, respectively) of the wave function [see Eq. (12)] and this can help us rationalizing why the 3 P states are TUEGs. The 3 P non-interacting angular wave function, χ3 P , defined in Eq. (11a) has the natural tendency to pull apart same-spin electrons in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle, creating in the process a so-called Fermi hole. 57,58 The same physical effect can, independently, result from repulsion: In the case µ 0, two strongly repulsive electrons localize (or \"crystallize\") on opposite sides of the sphere to minimize their repulsion and they form a Wigner crystal. 59 Oppositely, when µ 0, the two electrons are strongly attracted to each other, forming a tightly bound pair that moves freely on the sphere. 31,56 For certain values µ < 0, the attractive force seems to exactly compensate the \"repulsive\" effect of the Pauli exclusion principle, thus making the total electron density uniform, hence producing TUEGs. In higher-energy excited states, the same-spin electrons are further away as compared to the ground state due to the larger number of nodes in the excited-state wave functions. Therefore, a compensating attraction must be larger, corresponding to larger negative values of µ.",

This technique had been introduced in [119,120]. A detailed discussion of the method and extension to strong laser fields is found in [121]. We summarize it here briefly. To explain the computation of PES, we first confine the considerations to 1D in order to keep things simple and extend it finally to the general 3D case. The measuring point is thus denoted for a while z M . Starting point is the solution of the Schrödinger equation for one electron in a laser field in velocitygauge, see Eq. (4) in section 1.2.1.

For then, a time to frequency Fourier transformation of ϕ (v) , namely dt e iωt ϕ (v) (z M , t), produces in the right-hand side of Eq.

This is related to the early stage of a bond-breaking process [42], particularly the reaction pathways of small molecules [43], or the redistribution of energy of DNA and RNA [3,4]. Here we idealize the two BO surfaces as harmonic potentials with an avoided crossing in the region R = 0.5 − 1 Bohr. As illustrated in Fig 2(a), after vertical excitation from the equilibrium position of the lower surface, the nuclear wave packet χ starts propagating on the upper one. If we neglect the coupling of the two surfaces, χ undergoes perfect harmonic oscillations around R = 0.5 Bohr with a time period T 0 = 13.6 fs. However, because of the coupling of the surfaces, the nuclear wave packet splits into two branches as it goes through the avoided crossing. One branch stays on the upper surface while the other transfers to the lower one accompanied by energy transfer from electrons to nuclear kinetic energy. This process also breaks the time periodicity because the split wave packets feel the gradients (forces) of two different BO potentials. This is also reflected in Fig 2(c), where the rate of change of T n,marg and T n as functions of t deviate from periodic behavior when t > T0 2 . Here we focus on two points, t = T0 8 and t = 5T0 8 , roughly corresponding to the first two maxima. As shown, there is a significant decrease in dT n,marg /dt from t = T0 8 to t = 5T0 8 . To understand this change, we use our identity (19) and rewrite it as\ndT n,marg dt = ∫ |χ(R, t)| 2 F (R, t)v(R, t)dR,(25)",

It is for example not normalizable, but the above example shows that it is characterized by strong localization. This is in contrast to a continuum state, but resembles the situation for a bound state. The resonant state has a well defined life-time due to the coupling to the continuum, and mathematically it can be described as a complex pole of the S-matrix. With a long life-time, compared to e.g. the classical orbiting time, the resonance is \"almost\" bound and behaves as such a state, but there are also very short lived resonances whose life-time is of the same order of magnitude as the orbiting time. To understand the role resonances play in atomic processes the localization is very important. It provides a much better overlap with bound states than obtained with continuum electrons, increasing the probability of transitions. The long life-time also leads to a longer interaction time, compared to a non-resonant electron that just passes by. It is interesting to note that a time-dependent calculation of the process of dielectronic recombination of He + [6] shows a situation very similar to that depicted in figure 2; when an incoming electron is on resonance a wave packet builds up in the vicinity of the nucleus, and it stays localized in this region for a time that is very long compared to that of a non-resonant electron with a nearby energy.\n\n\nRecombination -when structure matters\n\nAs an example of a process where resonances are truly important we will now discuss electron-ion recombination.

When the Rabi frequency ( , x axis) is much smaller than the dipole-dipole coupling (v dd , the vertical magenta line), all semiclassical approaches predict similar steady-state population for the singles (y axis) as compared to the LAME. However, when we investigate the population of the double excitation [see Fig. 7(b)], conventional semiclassical approaches fail even when v dd . On the one hand, Hamiltonian no. II always greatly underestimates the population of the double. If we restrict ourselves to the weak-coupling limit ( k FGR ), such an underestimation is not very problematic because the population is so small as to have minimal effect on any physical observable. On the other hand, Hamiltonian no. I FCI always overestimates the population for the double, leading to a nonphysically large electronic energy; see Fig. 7(c). One may therefore hypothesize that the inclusion of the doubly excited state represents an important but risky proposal for semiclassical electrodynamics; overestimation of the double population is strongly correlated to the overestimation of the total electronic energy. Interestingly, the hybrid Hamiltonian does interpolate between Hamiltonian no. I and Hamiltonian no. II, but there is minimal gain in accuracy when k FGR . We can now answer the question above: why does FCI fail and predict an exorbitant accumulation of energy for the TLSs under a driving force? The root of this problem is the classical EM field. Note that, for a single TLS, due to the use of a classical EM field, Ehrenfest dynamics predicts a decay rate proportional to the ground-state population [15,16,19]:\nk Eh = ρ gg k FGR .(23)",

According to Loschmidt, since the microscopic laws of mechanics are invariant under time reversal, there must a lso exist entropy-decreasing evolutions, in apparent violation of the second law. The FTs show how macroscopic irreversibility arises from time reversible microscopic equations of motion: time-reversed trajectories do occur, but with increasing system size they become vanishingly rare, and the second law in its conventional form emerges. In his celebrated monograph \"What is life?\" (21), Schroedinger emphasized the importance of inverted motion saying: \"The true physical picture includes the possibility that even a regularly going clock should all at once invert its motion and, working backward, rewind its own spring -at the expense of the heat of the environment-.\" At least 6 other FTs have been reported, and differ by the details of the system's dynamics (stochastic vs. deterministic), nature of the thermostat, and initial conditions (equilibrium or nonequilibrium steady state) (22). A parallel development began in 1997 with the report of a nonequilibrium work relation by C. Jarzynski (23), called the Jarzynski equality (hereafter referred to as JE). Consider a system kept in contact with a bath at who derived the corresponding FT for the case of a system, initially in thermal equilibrium, that is driven out of equilibrium by the action of an external agent (BoxRef-c).

Let us now consider the reverse process were the system starts at equilibrium in state B and ends in a non equilibrium state at A. The nonequilibrium protocol for the reverse process xR(s) is time-reversed respect to the forward one, xR(s) = xF(t-s) so both processes last for the same time t. Let PF(W) and PR(-W) stand for the work probability distributions along the forward and reversed processes respectively. In such conditions the Crooks FT (CFT) applies,",

This is usually done system by system. A natural question to ask is if there is a one-to-one correspondence between unit vectors and physical states, meaning that if every unit vector corresponds to a physical system. This is resolved by the following corollary that is a primary ingredient for quantum computation theory (see Ref. [22] Chapter 7).\n\nCorollary 1 All unit vectors of a finite Hilbert space correspond to possible physical states of a system.\n\nUnit vectors are also called pure states. If we know the pure state of a system, we have all physical information about it, and we can calculate the probabilistic outcomes of any potential measurement (see the next postulate). This is a very improbable situation as experimental settings are not perfect, and in most cases, we have only imperfect information about the state. Most generally, we may know that a quantum system can be in one state of a set {|ψ i } with probabilities p i . Therefore, our knowledge of the system is given by an ensemble of pure states described by the set {|ψ i , p i }. If more than one p i is different from zero the state is not pure anymore, and it is called a mixed state. The mathematical tool that describes our knowledge of the system, in this case, is the density operator (or density matrix).\nρ ≡ i p i |ψ i ψ i |.(1)\nDensity matrices are bounded operators that fulfil two mathematical conditions 1.

Of course, this is NOT a full quantum mechanics course. If a reader has no background in this field, just reading this chapter would be insufficient to understand the remaining of this tutorial. Therefore, if the reader is unsure of his/her capacities, we recommend to go first through a quantum mechanics course or to read an introductory book carefully. There are many great quantum mechanics books in the market. For beginners, we recommend Sakurai's book [23] or Nielsen and Chuang's Quantum Computing book [22]. For more advanced students, looking for a solid mathematical description of quantum mechanics methods, we recommend Galindo and Pascual [24]. Finally, for a more philosophical discussion, you should go to Peres' book [25].\n\nWe start stating the quantum mechanics postulates that we need to understand the derivation and application of the Lindblad Master Equation. The first postulate is related to the concept of a quantum state.\n\nPostulate 1 Associated to any isolated physical system, there is a complex Hilbert space H, known as the state space of the system. The state of the system is entirely described by a state vector, which is a unit vector of the Hilbert space (|ψ ∈ H).",

All these events result from a transfer of energy provided by either radiation or previous motions and ulti-mately from a strong initial impulsion spreading in the universe. Dynamic modeling of all molecular systems, from enzymology to systems biology, is grounded on the generalized use of kinetic rates, usually written \"k \" in traditional biochemistry. Molecular events cover a wide range of phenomena including motion, covalent modifications or interactions. Although they are associated to all these events, kinetic rates are subtle enough. Their physical meaning is generally ignored by biochemists, who need only using the famous equation of Arrhenius [1] as a general relationship for the temperature dependence of rates of reaction. According to this equation, derived from the thermodynamic study of van't Hoff [2], the logarithm of the rate constant is negatively proportional to the inverse of temperature. Beside this macroscopic thermodynamic approach, microscopic rate theories have then been developed, for example based on the probability of occurrence of a transition state theory [3] or the diffusion out of an energy well [4]. For complete reviews on the subject, see [5,6,7]. Very atomistic models will not be considered here but the simplified version of the transition state theory most widespread in biochemistry textbooks will be shown to suffer from several drawbacks. The present study is aimed at recovering formally the Arrhenius law and establishing a simple definition of kinetic constants, expurgated from mechanistic considerations, using minimalist hypotheses and simple statistical tools.\n\n2 Modeling the events 2.1 The classical \"mass action\" approach to molecular events.",

Specifically, the laws of quantum mechanics that involve only wave functions or projectors are incomplete because they apply only to processes that are unitary in time, and therefore are reversible. But not all reversible phenomena are unitary, and not all phenomena are reversible. We have addressed this issue by developing a nonstatistical unified quantum theory of mechanics and thermodynamics [18] that completes the \"laws of physics\", and that includes a nonlinear equation of motion [19,20]. In the unified theory, Feynman's laws of physics are a special case, zero entropy physics, and the Onsager reciprocity and dispersiondissipation relations are derived without resort to statistical physics, and microscopic reversibility [21].\n\nIn sharp contrast to what is presented in practically every textbook on physics and/or thermodynamics, our second regularization of physical phenomena consists of a novel, non-quantal exposition of thermodynamics as a nonstatistical science that applies to all systems (both macroscopic, and microscopic, including systems that consist of either only one structureless particle,or only one spin), and to all states (both thermodynamic or stable equilibrium, and not stable equilibrium) [22]. An important proven theorem (not law) of this nonstatistical exposition is the existence of entropy as a well defined (without ambiguities, circular arguments, and the concepts of heat and temperature) intrinsic, nonstatistical property of any system, in any state, at any instant in time. A brief summary of this novel exposition is given in the Appendix.\n\nOn the basis of the novel exposition, which does not involve statistics, fluctuations, and microscopic reversibility, in what follows we derive the reciprocal relations by using the same flow processes, the same linear approximations, and the same experimental results as all previous investigators, and the fact that a well behaved analytic function ) ,..., , ( f r 2 1 a a a satisfies the identity ∂ 2 f /∂a i ∂a j ≡ ∂ 2 f /∂a j ∂a i for i, j = 1, 2, …, r.\n\n\nRECIPROCAL RELATIONS FOR SYSTEMS WITHOUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS\n\n\nGeneral remarks",

It is interesting to note that the particle-wave duality principle indicates that the wavelength of electromagnetic energy that corresponds to the biological energy quantum △E can, therefore, be estimated as:\nλ = hc/∆E = 9 × 10 −6 m (2)\nwhich is very closely related to the average size of a living cell (micrometer range). Assuming that metabolic processes propagate in a wave-like fashion, and using the relationship between the wavelength, λ, propagation velocity, v, and frequency, f, we have λ = v/f, with v on the order of 1 µm/s and f = 1000 Hz. Thus, we find that λ is on the order of 1 nm. This is consistent with the value of proton displacement in electric fields of mitochondrial membranes. It is also intriguing to find an approximate value of the Debye temperature for the so-called biological energy quantum. We assume that enzymatic reactions in the metabolic cycle involving ATP generation occur periodically but are correlated spatially since they occur on a lattice with mitochondria as its nodes, which is reminiscent of the Debye solid. We then find that TD = △E/kB = 3x 10 3 K and since the physiological temperature is T0 = 300 K, it follows that T0/TD < 1. This then indicates that cellular metabolism operates in the quantum regime consistent with the tenets of Quantum Metabolism in the statistical sense.\n\n\nEmerging quantum science framework",

In macroscopic systems the observed behavior is reproducible and fluctuations (deviations from the typically observed or average behavior) are small. It is only in some special conditions that thermal fluctuations can produce readily detectable consequences: the opalescence of light in a fluid at the critical point is a prominent example. The importance of thermal fluctuations is determined by the law of large numbers. Let us first discuss fluctuations in equilibrium systems (3).\n\nIn an ideal gas containing N particles, the velocity distribution of each individual particle is described by the Maxwell distribution. The average total energy of the macroscopic system is a random quantity that is Gaussian distributed with average (3/2) Nk B T and variance (3/2)(k B T) 2 N. Therefore, the size of the fluctuations in the total energy, relative to its average value, are of order N -1/2 , i.e. comparable for an individual particle (N = 1) but extremely small in macroscopic samples (where the number of particles is of the order of Avogadro's number, ~10 23 ). This simple argument shows the importance of large fluctuations for small systems when N~O (1) or when the total energy of the system is few times the fundamental energy unit k B T. In such small systems, thermal fluctuations can lead to observable large deviations from their average behavior and, therefore, these systems are not well described by classical macroscopic thermodynamics.",

For a macroscopic system driven from state 1 to state 2 at absolute temperature T , the Clausius version of the second law relates the external work done on the system, W , to the free energy difference between the two states, ∆F , as W ≥ ∆F [1] . If the system is driven infinitely slowly so that it always remains at equilibrium with the thermal bath, the process is reversible and the second law holds in its equality form, i.e. W = ∆F . Instead, its inequality form, i.e. W > ∆F , holds for irreversible processes [1][2][3][4][5][6]. For a microscopic system, the presence of thermal fluctuations allows the violation of the second law for single realizations of the process, but nevertheless the second law still holds on average [16], i.e. W i ≥ ∆F with W i = ∆F if the process is infinitely slow, where W i is the work done during the i-th realization of the process and the angular brackets represent the ensemble average. The macroscopic relation is recovered because statistical fluctuations around the average become insignificant and can be dismissed for large systems as a consequence of the law of large numbers [17].\n\nA major advance in stochastic thermodynamics has been the realization that, instead of just averaging the fluctuations out, it is possible to make use of the information they store in order to recover equilibrium information even from nonequilibrium measurements [18,19].",

COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR\n\nFrom the spectacular aerial displays of flocking birds down to the beautiful choreography of cell movements in a developing embryo, many of life's most striking phenomena emerge from interactions among hundreds if not thousands or even millions of components.The enormous success of statistical physics in describing emergent phenomena in equilibrium systems has led many people to hope that it could provide a useful language for describing emergence in biological systems as well.In the past decade or so, my colleagues and I have been excited by the use of maximum entropy methods to build statistical physics models for variety of biological systems that are grounded in real data. 18 In a small window of time, a single neuron either generates an action potential or remains silent, and thus the states of a network of neurons are described naturally by binary vectors.We have tried to approximate the probability distribution of these binary vectors by maximum entropy distributions that are consistent with the mean spike probability for each cell, and with the matrix of pairwise correlations among cells.These models are Ising models, and since correlations have both signs, the interactions among \"spins\" in the model have both signs-they are a sort of spin glass, not unlike the model 18 The Boltzmann distribution is the maximum entropy distribution consistent with knowing the mean energy, and this sometimes leads to confusion about maximum entropy methods as being equivalent to some sort of equilibrium assumption (which would be obviously wrong).But we can build maximum entropy models that hold many different expectation values fixed, and it is only when we fix the expectation value of the Hamiltonian that we are describing thermal equilibrium.What is useful is that maximum entropy models are equivalent to the Boltzmann distribution for some hypothetical system, and often this is a source of both intuition and calculational tools.",

Exploring, theoretically, black body radiation he effectively introduced the novelty that light was quantized (in units now called photons) (Planck, 1899). A single photon carries the energy E = hν, where ν is the frequency of the oscillating photon field and h, or = h/2π, 3 is a universal constant with the dimension of action or angular momentum. Planck did not yet recognize in 1900 the importance of for the inner dynamical structure of atoms. Albert Einstein (1879Einstein ( -1955 postulated that photon absorption and emission is also a quantized process where one electron absorbs one photon and vice versa (Einstein, 1905). His simple collision model between photons and electrons delivered thus from the kinematics of the emitted electrons an experimental approach to determine , and explained the physics of the photoelectric effect. In 1911, Otto Sackur (1880-1914 and Hugo Tetrode (1895Tetrode ( -1931 discovered, independently from each other, a further important property of (Sackur, 1911(Sackur, , 1913Tetrode, 1912a,b). Defining as the unit of order in dynamical quantum systems they could calculate the entropy of an ideal gas in an absolute way. In 1913, Niels Bohr (1885-1962 gave a new dynamical meaning, when he postulated his famous model on the structure of atoms, 4 in which he determined the electronic orbitals in units of the quantized angular momentum l z = m. Beginning with the Bohr model, played a crucial role in the forthcoming atomic models. However, the hypothesis of quantization in terms of was until 1922 only indirectly supported by theory.",

Derivation of the Lindblad Equation from microscopic dynamics\n\nThe most common derivation of the Lindblad master equation is based on Open Quantum Theory. The Lindblad equation is then an effective motion equation for a subsystem that belongs to a more complicated system. This derivation can be found in several textbooks like Breuer and Petruccione's [2] as well as Gardiner and Zoller's [1]. Here, we follow the derivation presented in Ref. [26]. Our initial point is displayed in Figure 3. A total system belonging to a Hilbert space H T is divided into our system of interest, belonging to a Hilbert space H, and the environment living in H E .\n\nThe evolution of the total system is given by the von Neumann equation (13).\nρ T (t) = −i [H T , ρ T (t)] .(33)\nAs we are interested in the dynamics of the system, without the environment, we trace over the environment degrees of freedom to obtain the reduced density matrix of the system ρ(t) = Tr E [ρ T ]. To separate the effect of the total hamiltonian in the system and the environment we divide it in the form H T = H S ⊗ 1 E + 1 S ⊗ H E + αH I , with H ∈ H, H E ∈ H E , and H I ∈ H T , and being α a measure of the strength of the system-environment interaction. Therefore, we have a part acting on the system, a part acting on the environment, and the interaction term. Without losing any generality, the interaction term can be decomposed in the following way\nH I = i S i ⊗ E i ,(34)with S i ∈ B(H) and E i ∈ B(H E ) 3 .\nTo better describe the dynamics of the system, it is useful to work in the interaction picture (see Ref. [24] for a detailed explanation about Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and interaction pictures). In the interaction picture, density matrices evolve with time due to the interaction Hamiltonian, while operators evolve with the system and environment",

More details can be found on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server https://www.cryst.ehu.es/. We see that degeneracies occur at the Γ point and A, and the rest of the bands are split. We now build a short ranged tight-binding model from these orbitals. We will primarily discuss the para-magnetic (spin-unpolarized) DFT results which provide a single-particle band structure. Including Coulomb repulsion favors a ferromagnetic groundstate which is expected due to the flat bands obtained in the tight-binding models.",

The rovibrational level for the desired quantum state v', N'=J' +/ − 1/2 and F 2/1 is calculated by solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for such a potential. The eigen energy replaces the one of the Dunham description in the matrix in Table 1.

The differences of the two rovibrational ladders as function of N' undulate around zero with an amplitude of about 0.01 cm −1 but increase to larger values for high N', which is probably related to the high order centrifugal distortion function constructed by the Dunham approach. We should mention that the other molecular parameters are also slightly changed by the simultaneous fit of all parameters directing to the correlation between all parameters which is different in both approaches.

(7)), can help to remove the large J-dependence. The fit quality was worse and the resulting rotational coupling parameters were not physically convincing in their variation between different pairs of vΣ and vΠ. Table 3. Spin-orbit parameters of state (1) 2 Π and ratio of rotational to spin-orbit coupling of the (2) 2 Σ + -(1) 2 Π system. The spin-orbit coupling of 2 Σ + -2 Π 1/2 is contained in the effective overlap integrals given in Table 4. For the uncertainty of the parameters see the discussion in the text.  -",

At the CASSCF and MRCI+Q levels of theory, the computed ionization energies of N 2 are 16.33 eV and 15.52 eV, respectively, whereas those of atomic nitrogen are 13.37 eV and 14.45 eV. Thus, MRCI+Q yields ionization energies in good agreement with experiment whereas CASSCF does not.For stretched N 2 with r = 3.0 a 0 the charge transfer reaction energy of N + +N 2 → N+N + 2 is 0.84 eV and -0.38 eV at the CASSCF and MRCI+Q level of theory, respectively. Therefore, the triplet ground state may become the charge transfer state associated with the N+N + 2 dissociation limit. Even though these are rather high-energy regions of the PES, this aspect has to be monitored, as the CASSCF algorithm will converge to different solutions depending on the initial orbital guess if the natural orbitals between which the charge transfer occurs are spatially sufficiently separated and can therefore not mix.Figure 7illustrates such a case: at r = 3 a 0 two different CASSCF solutions for the lowest 3 A state are obtained depending on the initial orbital guess for values of R above ≈ 6 a 0 . The natural orbital pairs of the charge transfer are shown as inset and their slight difference in spatial extent stems of the neutral or cationic character of the moieties.",

In a nutshell, the 2PT approach for rigid polyatomic molecules 22 describes decompositions of the translational and rotational VDoS of a liquid into two separate additive contributions, I trans/rot HS (ν) and I trans/rot HO (ν). These describe the VDoS of slow diffusive and fast vibrational degrees of freedom, respectively. The former are modeled in terms of a hard sphere (HS) fluid model constructed from the particle density and diffusion coefficient observed in the liquid (the zero frequency response of the VDoS). The VDoS of the HS model can be described by an analytical function, which includes structural relaxation processes also at nonzero frequencies. This analytic HS-model VDoS is then subtracted from the total VDoS of the liquid, leaving a remaining partial VDoS with no diffusive contributions at zero frequencies, which is then modeled analytically as a continuous set of harmonic oscillators (HO). In this approach, the HS model thus effectively describes diffusive motion and anharmonic effects that would not be included in a purely harmonic treatment.\n\nThe partition function and entropy of (1) the HS model for diffusive translational degrees of freedom and (2) the HO model for vibrations can both be expressed analytically. To express the entropy of diffusive rotational degrees of freedom, the hard sphere model is replaced by a rigid rotor (RR) expression. 22 This leads to a molecular entropy expression in terms of a sum of weighted integrals of the VDoS for the distinct degrees of freedom",

As for the ground state eigenfunction, it is evident that the anharmonic corrections are minor and the harmonic approximation already provides a realistic guess. However, it fails in locating the maximum of the wavefunction, which shifts from the harmonic estimate ( Q = 0) to Q ∼ 3 a.u. in mass-scaled coordinates or about 0.05 Å in cartesian coordinates in the direction of bond cleavage when the anharmonicity of the potential is properly accounted for. Interestingly, this effect is already correctly described when truncating the harmonic basis set at the level of the first excited state. The corresponding coefficient (C 0,1 in our notation) has an amplitude of ∼ 0.1 and the sign of this coefficient gives the direction of the shift.

An analogous mathematical approach used in thermodynamics to develop equation (5) will be used later on. In this work, all these equivalent mathematical relations will be derived for a molecular system where the fundamental equation is the potential energy of the molecule and the independent variables are the nuclear normal coordinates and the elements of an external uniform electric (or magnetic) field vector. Similar equalities are formulated from mixed third-order partial derivatives of the energy and other Legendre representations. The obtained relations carry practical uses in alternative and faster ways of computing properties used in vibrational spectroscopy and electrodynamics such as the Stark and Zeeman Tuning Rates, permanent dipolar moments and polarizabilities. In most cases, these parameters can be obtained by means of these novel relations without the application of an external electric or magnetic field during their computation, thus reducing the cost of the calculation.

A similar level of accuracy was obtained byKaledin and Miller    propagating coherent states.35 This result confirms the quality of theMC-SCIVR approximation independently of the particular reference state (harmonic or coherent)propagated.For a general N v -dimensional system, the size of the (truncated) harmonic basis set, obtained considering all the possible N v -dimensional direct products of 1dimensional harmonic eigenstates up to the quantum number k max , is (k max + 1) Nv , and hence it grows exponentially with the number of vibrational degrees of freedom. This issue makes the description of vibrational wavefunctions of medium-size or larger molecular systems (i.e. when N v ∼ 10 or bigger) virtually undoable because the dimension of the basis set would be too large to be stored in a computer. This is not the case for the water molecule (N v = 3) and hence, expanding the eigenfunctions in terms of the first 11 harmonic states (k max = 10) the total number of states in the basis set adds up to just 11 3 = 1331. Even if such a calculation for water is feasible, in view of future applications of this method to molecules of higher dimensionality we reduced the amount of data to be stored by setting all coefficients with amplitude smaller than 0.01 to zero. The surviving coefficients were refined by enforcing orthonormality by means of the GS algorithm. In this way, the ground state eigenfunction was decomposed on just five harmonic states, while excited states required to increase the basis set size up to about 10 elements.The eigenfunctions are plotted in three different cuts of the configurational space inFig. 3where they are also compared with their reference DVR estimate. The accuracy obtained is very high for all cases and the effect of the truncation of the basis set is barely visible on the nodal planes where the SC wavefunctions are slightly overstructured. In perspective, this procedure can help overcome the curse of dimensionality given by the exponential growth of the size of the harmonic basis as a function of the system dimensionality. In fact, in order to moderate the number of harmonic states to generate, a polynomial growth can be enforced",

[7].The formalism we use allows for extension beyond the constant non-adiabatic coupling case and can be applied to any molecule once the set of ν p , Γ p , s p are known.The scaling law can be cast as an infinite asymptotic expansion\nγ AE nr = Re ∞ k=0 C 2 (iω 0 ) k+1 B k (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x k ),(1)\nwhich employs the set of complete Bell polynomials with arguments x j , solely involving the set of ν p , Γ p , s p and the dephasing rate γ d .Crucial quantities are sums weighted by the Huang-Rhys factors, such as for example the collective Stokes shift ⟨ν⟩ = N p=1 s p ν p arXiv:2405.08718v1 [quant-ph] 14 May 2024\n\n(appearing in x 1 ) or higher order terms of the form ⟨νΓ⟩ = N p=1 s p ν p Γ p (appearing in x 2 ) and so on.We find that γ nr is proportional to ⟨Γ⟩ = N p=1 s p Γ p , at cryogenic temperatures and to γ d at room temperature (reaching values at the order of a few THz), owing to the high thermal occupancies of the low-frequency bulk phonon modes.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nEnergy transfer (relaxation) phenomena are ubiquitous in nature. At a macroscopic level, the phenomenological theory of heat (Fourier law) successfully describes heat transfer and energy flow. However, its microscopic origin is still under debate. This is because the phenomena can contain many-body, multi-scale, nonequilibrium, and even quantum mechanical aspects, which present significant challenges to theories addressing energy transfer phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology [1]. For example, heat generation and transfer in nano-devices is a critical problem in the design of nanotechnology. In molecular physics, it is well known that vibrational energy relaxation (VER) is an essential aspect of any quantitative description of chemical reactions [2]. In the celebrated RRKM theory of an absolute reaction rate for isolated molecules, it is assumed that the intramolecular vibrational energy relaxation (IVR) is much faster than the reaction itself. Under certain statistical assumptions, the reaction rate can be derived [3]. For chemical reactions in solutions, the transition state theory and its extension such as Kramer's theory and the Grote-Hynes theory have been developed [4,5] and applied to a variety of chemical systems including biomolecular systems [6]. However, one cannot always assume that separation of timescales. It has been shown that a conformational transition (or reaction) rate can be modulated by the IVR rate [7]. As this brief survey demonstrates, a detailed understanding of IVR or VER is essential to study the chemical reaction and conformation change of molecules.",

The obtained partition functions and populations can be used in further calculations.

However, if we limit ourselves to quantum mechanics, we can proceed as follows.\n\nThe starting point of discussion of the N particle system is definition analogous to Eq. (1) r j = r j ρ(r 1 , . . . , r N , t)dV 1 . . . dV N , j = 1, . . . , N,\n\nwhere ρ is the many particle probability density and r j are the coordinates of the j-th particle. Then, discussion can be performed analogously to that given above and the probability amplitude, uncertainty and commutation relations, momentum operators and density currents for all particles can be introduced. The scalar and vector potentials U (r 1 , . . . , r N , t) and A(r 1 , . . . , r N , t) and antiparticles can be also discussed. Equations of motion for N free particles can be found from generalization of the relativistic invariant (43) \n\nwhere ψ(r 1 , . . . , r N , t) is the N particle probability amplitude and m j denotes the rest mass of the particle. Using similar approach as above, we can then obtain the N particle Schrödinger equation\n− N j=1 2 2m j ∆ j ψ = i ∂ψ ∂t(64)\nand the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\n∂S ∂t + N j=1 (∇ j S) 2 2m j = 0.(65)\nFor a system of identical particles, the probability density ρ must be symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two particles i and j. Hence, the probability amplitude ψ must be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to such exchanges.\n\nNon-locality of quantum mechanics is related to the many particle character of the probability density ρ and the corresponding probability amplitude ψ.\n\nIt is seen that probabilistic description of measurements and its relativistic invariance yields also the basic mathematical structure of the many particle quantum mechanics.\n\n\nX.

Attempts were made by Born and his assistants to discuss the stationary state energy levels of 'simple' non-trivial systems such as He, H + 2 , H 2 , H 2 O. The molecular species were tackled as problems in electronic structure, that is, as requiring the calculation of the energy levels for the electron(s) in the field of fixed nuclei as a calculation separate from the rotation-vibration of the molecule as a whole. Pauli gave a lengthy qualitative discussion of the possible Bohr orbits for the single electron moving in the field of two fixed protons in H + 2 but could not obtain the correct stationary states [32]. Nordheim investigated the forces between two hydrogen atoms as they approach each other adiabatically 6 in various orientations consistent with the quantum conditions. Before the atoms get close enough for the attractive and repulsive forces to balance out, a sudden discontinuous change in the electron orbits takes place and the electrons cease to revolve solely round their parent nuclei. Nordheim was unable to find an interatomic distance at which the energy of the combined system was less than that of the separated atoms; this led to the conclusion that the use of classical mechanics to discuss the stationary states of the molecular electrons had broken down comprehensively [33], [34]. This negative result was true of all the molecular calculations attempted within the Old Quantum Theory framework which was simply incapable of accounting for covalent bonding [35].",

However, the eigenstates can again be represented (approximately at least) by one-particle wave functions. But the correlation function (4) is modified into\nG(λ, x 1 , x 2 ) = ζ mn f n f m F mn (λ, x 1 , x 2 ).(22)\nHere f n = 1 1 + ζe −βEn and ζ = e βµ (23) where µ is the chemical potential.

With (22) it immediately follows that the expression for the polarizability as given by expression (8) can be kept if p n for fermions is redefined to be p n = f n ζe −βEn = ζe −βEn 1 + ζe −βEn (24) which is the probability for level n to be occupied by a particle.

Then assume there is a mutual perturbing interaction between these particles given by\nΦ = ψq 2 x a x b(14)\nwhere ψ = ψ(r) is a quantity that depends upon spatial separation while x a and x b are internal coordinates of the two separate binding potentials. Interaction (14) is similar to the dipole-dipole interaction where qx a and qx b correspond to dipole moments restricted to the x-direction. We will use the one dimensional interaction (14) instead of the full dipolar interaction to simplify the derivations below a bit. The purpose is to transform the statistical mechanical free energy expression to a form that can be identified with second order perturbation theory. The free energy change ∆F due to the interaction can be found from [2]\n∆F = 1 2β K ln(1 − (αψ) 2 ) ≈ − 1 2β K (αψ) 2(15)\nto second order in α = α(K). For K = 0 expression (15) is just the classical expression for the free energy change due to a pair of classical harmonic oscillators that interact. This is Eq. (3.4) of Ref. [2]. In the quantum mechanical case one has to sum over the Matsubara frequencies K = 2πn/β (n is integer) as follows from the path integral. More generally the interaction can be time-dependent like the radiating dipole interaction. Then the Fourier transformψ(K) with K = ihω is needed. However, to enable comparison with standard quantum mechanical perturbation theory the statistical mechanical expression should be restricted to the static case, i.e. ψ =ψ(0) for all K.",

Summary of Green's function formalism\n\nTo keep our discussion self-contained and to establish notation, we begin by recalling some of the basic results from the theory of Green's functions. More detailed exposition of Green's functions can be found, for example, in [22]. Given a Hamiltonian H and chemical potential µ, at zero-temperature the Green's function G(ω) is defined as\nG ij (ω) = Ψ 0 |a i 1 ω + µ − (H − E 0 ) + i0 a † j |Ψ 0 + Ψ 0 |a † j 1 ω + µ + (H − E 0 ) − i0 a i |Ψ 0(1)\nwhere i, j label the orthogonal one-particle basis, and Ψ 0 and E 0 are the ground-state eigenfunction and eigenvalue of H, respectively. G(ω) explicitly determines many of the interesting properties of the system. For example the single-particle density matrix P, electronic energy E, and spectral function (density of states) A(ω) are given respectively by\nP = −i ∞ −∞ e iω0+ G(ω)dω (2) E = − 1 2 i ∞ −∞ e iω0+ Tr[(h + ω)G(ω)]dω (3) A(ω) = − 1 π ℑG(ω + i0 + )(4)\nIn general, ω is a complex variable. Real ω corresponds to physical frequencies, and for example, the density of states (4) is defined on the real axis. However, it is often more convenient to work away from the real axis. For example, expectation values such as Eqs. (2), (3), should be evaluated on contours away from the real axis to avoid singularities in the numerical integration.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe chemical potential µ, of a fluid measures the tendency of particles to diffuse as a function of spatial position and sets a characteristic energy scale: that needed to add a single particle to the system at constant temperature. As an intensive thermodynamic quantity, it is most directly defined as an energy difference:\nµ (N, T ) ≡ F (N + 1, T ) − F (N, T ) ,(1)\nwhere F (N, T ) is the Helmholtz free energy of a Nparticle system at temperature T . A spatial gradient in the chemical potential can be established via a pressure (∆P ) or temperature (∆T ) difference as defined by the Gibbs-Duhem relation:\n∆µ = V N ∆P − S N ∆T (2)\nwhere V is the volume and S the entropy. Particles will diffuse to the region of low chemical potential and an equilibrium mass current can be established. In this way, the chemical potential is the analog of the electrical potential for neutral particles. Unlike other intensive thermodynamic quantities such as temperature or pressure, µ is often not directly fixed or measured experimentally, and thus a complete understanding of its nature may provide new insights when fluids are in equilibrium with other phases. Additionally, µ determines the locations of first order phase transitions, as well as the nature of mixtures when impurities are present in the fluid. At low temperature, even in the absence of interactions, µ is a sensitive probe of quantum mechanical behavior. For example, an ideal Bose gas at T = 0 has µ = 0, indicating the presence of a zero momentum Bose-Einstein condensate, while for free fermions, µ = ε F showcasing the existence of a Fermi surface where single particle states are filled up to an energy ε F .",

The same is true of the exact kinetic energy T [n] and the exact electron-electron potential energy U [n]. Therefore, if\nF [n] = T [n] + U [n](16)\nis the sum of these two, the total energy in Eq. (10) is\nE[n] = n(r) v(r) dr + F [n].(17)\nNow let n T (r) ≥ 0 be a trial density which produces the correct total number of electrons, N = n T (r) dr. By Kohn's theorem, this density determines its own external potential, Hamiltonian, and ground state wave function ψ T . In that case, the usual wave function variational principle expressed by Eq. (1) tells us that\nψ T |Ĥ|ψ T = n T (r) v(r) dr + F [n T ] = E[n T ] ≥ E[n].(18)\nThe variational principle in Eq. (18) establishes that the energy in Eq. (17) evaluated with the true ground state density is minimal with respect to all other density functions for the same number of particles. The proofs given just above appear early in Hohenberg and Kohn (1964), the first foundational paper of density functional theory. In connection with Eq. (18), Hohenberg and Kohn (HK) use a footnote to warn the reader of a possible 'v-representability problem' because \"we cannot prove whether an arbitrary positive definite distribution n(r) which satisfies n(r) dr = N can be realized for some external potential.\" They express con-fidence that all \"except some pathological distributions\" will have this property but the mere fact that they draw attention to this point demonstrates how carefully the authors looked for holes in their arguments. [99] HK make a point to remark that the functional F [n] in Eq. (16) is \"universal\" in the sense that it is valid for any number of particles and any external potential. Even more significant for later work, they define yet another functional G[n] by extracting from F [n] the classical Coulomb energy of a system with charge density en(r). Doing this renders Eq. (17) in the form",

For GaAs quantum-wells a ⋆ B ≈ 100Å and experimentally realized electron densities are of the order of 10 11 cm −2 which corresponds to r s ≈ 1−2, and T F ≈ 40−100 K. We take the charge density in the second layer with reference to the drive layer; n 2 = αn 1 , so that the quantities for the second layer scale as, k\n(2) F = √ αk F , r(2)s = r s / √ α, T (2) F = αT F .",

[1]:\"If there are a large number of degrees of freedom coupled to the electron, then its ground-state energy and the genuine binding energy function should exhibit a Gaussian distribution by the central limit theorem of statistics\". The central limit theorem states that given a sufficiently large set of identically distributed independent random variables, their averages will be distributed normally. This argument cannot be directly applied to the photoelectron spectrum of the hydrated electron. It would paint the picture of the hydrated electron as a structureless entity coupling randomly to a surrounding nearequilibrium bulk liquid. In reality, the hydrated electron consists of the electron itself and the cavity where it resides. From all we know, the vertically ionized state of the hydrated electron, i.e. the empty cavity, is far from any equilibrium structure of the liquid. This could easily give rise to a pronounced vibrational progression in the (genuine) binding energy spectrum of the hydrated electron, especially in the OH-stretch vibration of the water molecules coupling most strongly to it. The central limit theorem describes the inhomogeneous broadening of a transition within a certain limit, but not such homogeneous structures of a transition. Therefore, the central limit theorem cannot predict whether the genuine band shape for excitation in the UV is Gaussian or not.\n\nThe recent work of Suzuki and coworkers [3,4] shows experimentally that the genuine binding energy spectrum for excitations in the XUV (27.9 and 29.45 eV [3]) is indeed Gaussian. The genuine binding energy spectrum, however, depends on both the initial and the final state of the photoionization transition. Therefore, the observation of a Gaussian band shape for XUV excitation cannot predict the band shape for UV excitation. Note that the \"retrieval method\" in refs. [3,4] does not allow to deduce the genuine band shape either. It just makes the ad-hoc assumption that the band shape is independent of the excitation energy. Thus, it is clear that for UV excitation there is so far no demonstration and no firm argument of a single Gaussian genuine band shape -contrary to ref. [1].",

Consistent with this, the kinetic energy implied by Eq. (24) is correct only for independent and non-interacting electrons. This was the key to progress because the Hohenberg-Kohn analysis implied that the kinetic energy of a strictly noninteracting system of electrons is also a functional of the density. If we call this functional T S [n], ordinary quantum mechanics specifies that [103] \nT S [n] = N k=1 φ * k (r) − 2 2m ∇ 2 φ k (r) dr.(27)\nThe path was now open for Sham to derive the Hartree equations from a density functional point of view (Kohn 2001a). He chose the approximate total energy functional\nE H [n] = T S [n] + v(r) n(r) dr + e 2 2 n(r) n(r ′ ) |r − r ′ | dr dr ′ ,(28)\nand minimized it with respect to a density assumed to have the form in Eq.

(28) is straightforward and the final result is exactly the Hartree equations (24) and (25). Kohn and Sham (KS) now knew how to move forward with the general many-electron problem. Motivated by Eq.

The former use models that are well-tested in the bulk of electrolyte solutions; the electronic response of the electrode surface is usually neglected. The latter suffer from the disadvantages of DFT simulations: small ensemble size, short times for statistical sampling, and the uncertainties of DFT such as the charge delocalization error[3]. Having watched so-called ab initio simulations from the sidelines, I was bemused how the prescriptions to treat water by DFT changed over time.Nevertheless, there are a few things which we have learnt:There is an extended boundary layer at the interface, where particle densities and the electrostatic potential oscillate. The water bilayer, known from water adsorption on metals in ultrahigh vacuum, is not stable in electrochemical systems at ambient temperatures.Simple geometrical models based on concepts like the inner or outer Helmholtz plane or the Stern layer have no scientific basis. They should be buried in the cemetery of discarded electrochemical concepts with the hydrogen in status nascendi.The concept of an effective dielectric constant which varies rapidly in the boundary layer is ill-defined. Of course, it can be used for fitting results,",

We proceed in the following manner. First of all we fix an electric field value corresponding to some negative electric charge concentration n in the well 1. Then we evaluate the hole tunneling rate and give a starting value to the electron tunneling rate (for instance that obtained for n 1 = n) so we can deduce some charge concentrations by Eq. (8). From these concentrations we evaluate a new electron tunneling rate by Eq. (6) and from that new charge concentrations. After few iterations, the electron tunneling rate and the charge concentrations converge to the solution corresponding to the value of the electric field fixed at the beginning.

How could knowledge of the electron density, which is a function of three Cartesian variables, be sufficient to compute the total energy when the last two terms in Eq. (10) depend explicitly on the many-electron wave function, which is a function of 3N Cartesian variables? Looking for support, Walter asked himself if he knew any examples where complete knowledge of n(r) implied complete knowledge of v(r) (Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham 1990). One such example was the elementary Schrödinger equation,\n− 2 2m ∇ 2 ψ + [v(r) − E] ψ(r) = 0.(11)\nOne can always choose ψ(r) real for this equation.

(11) applies only to a one-particle system and thus does not shed any light on the manybody problem. A more relevant example known to Kohn was the Thomas-Fermi method, a semi-classical but selfconsistent approximation to the quantum theory of a many-electron system with a non-uniform density n(r) (March 1975, Zangwill 2013.

Attempts were made by Born and his assistants to discuss the stationary state energy levels of 'simple' non-trivial systems such as He, H + 2 , H 2 , H 2 O. The molecular species were tackled as problems in electronic structure, that is, as requiring the calculation of the energy levels for the electron(s) in the field of fixed nuclei as a calculation separate from the rotation-vibration of the molecule as a whole. Pauli gave a lengthy qualitative discussion of the possible Bohr orbits for the single electron moving in the field of two fixed protons in H + 2 but could not obtain the correct stationary states [32]. Nordheim investigated the forces between two hydrogen atoms as they approach each other adiabatically 6 in various orientations consistent with the quantum conditions. Before the atoms get close enough for the attractive and repulsive forces to balance out, a sudden discontinuous change in the electron orbits takes place and the electrons cease to revolve solely round their parent nuclei. Nordheim was unable to find an interatomic distance at which the energy of the combined system was less than that of the separated atoms; this led to the conclusion that the use of classical mechanics to discuss the stationary states of the molecular electrons had broken down comprehensively [33], [34]. This negative result was true of all the molecular calculations attempted within the Old Quantum Theory framework which was simply incapable of accounting for covalent bonding [35].",

There are two more possible explanations for the observed asymmetric (\"bimodal\") genuine band shape for UV excitation to be clarified in the future: (i) Either the genuine band shape in the UV is indeed bimodal and thus different from that in the XUV [3], or (ii) there are measurement artefacts in the experimental UV spectra used in in ref.

Note that new measurements in the UV would require photon energies clearly above 4.6eV to be able to probe a possible bimodal component in the genuine spectrum. We agree with the author of ref.

In the limit of complete ionization, these humps become more and more steplike, reaching an asymptotic constant value corresponding to the intrinsic derivative discontinuity of the XC potential as the particle number passes through an integer value. Here we study an analogous situation, letting electrons escape from a semiconductor quantum well. to one third of the initial value. In other words, we consider a sudden switching process which reduces the quantum well depth by 66%, but keeps the square well shape otherwise intact (see upper panel of Fig. 1). Such a process is, of course, highly idealized and would be difficult to realize experimentally. In practice, a static electric field could be used to suppress the quantum well barrier on one side.\n\nApplying an absorbing boundary condition, we then let the system evolve such that the electrons in the second subband are almost completely ionized, and focus our attention on the behavior of the LDA and SIC potentials. We limit ourselves in the following to the exchange-only LDA, v LDA xc,σ [n σ , nσ](z, t) = − [6/π n σ (z, t)] 1/3 , applying the TDKLI/PZSIC and TDKLI/LESIC approaches.

For sufficiently large separation between the atoms of this molecule, the additional electron completely localizes to one of the atoms, say the left. This left atom experiences a local shift (a plateau) by its xc derivative discontinuity, ∆ N0 L , which may differ to that of the whole molecule, ∆ N0 . In conjunction a plateau with height ∆ N0 localizes to the right atom; depicted in Fig. 3 in Sec. II.\n\nAs the amount of additional electron is increased to 1, the plateau localized to the left atom, to which the additional electron localizes, shrinks while the plateau localized to the right atom has a fixed height of ∆ N0 ; shown in Sec. II. As a result, within the (N 0 +1)-electron system the right atom's xc potential is elevated by ∆ N0 which means a step with height ∆ N0 is present in the xc potential between the atoms. I present three distinct example diatomic molecules that consist of a variety of open-and closed-shell atoms. In each case the height of the interatomic step, S = ∆ N0 . Two of my example systems require a step in the xc potential to 'reorder' the KS single-particle energies so that the KS density equals the many-body density (one of which is the well-known thought experiment of Almbladh and von Barth [29]). Without the step, the KS electron density would experience a large delocalization error [37]. I demonstrate that the required reordering of the KS single-particle states is achieved completely by the interatomic step of height ∆ N0 ; see Eq. (6), which is verified numerically in Fig. 8 (bottom). I show that in the case of two open-shell atoms S = ∆ N0 is consistent with Almbladh and von Barth's result; see Eq. (7).",

ELECTRON TRAJECTORIES\n\nWith these equations, trajectories can be calculated for electrons leaving the atom. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, where trajectories are shown for different starting angles β for E exc = 5, 15, and 25 meV, together with the corresponding potential landscape. The trajectories are transformed from the r-z-plane to the x-z-plane, so the electron trajectory is continuous in case of a z-axis crossing. The electron trajectory corresponding to β just below β c touches the equipotential line U CS H + E F = E exc (in SI units); electrons with β ≥ β c do not have enough energy to cross that equipotential line and are bound. From the trajectories it can be seen that electrons that are leaving the atom experience a force towards the z-axis because of the shape of the potential, which acts as a bottleneck near the saddle-point at z = −sgn(F )/ |F |. This reduces the transverse velocity of the electrons; as σ vr is also reduced, this leads to a lower electron temperature compared to the simple model based on equipartition, given by T = 2/(3k)E exc (in SI units). The simple model would apply for electrons following ballistic (parabolic) trajectories, which happens when the Coulomb interaction is left out (see Appendix A). For low excess energies, electrons are leaving the atom from a small cone, as seen far from the atom. By increasing the excess energy, the size of the bottleneck is increased; this leads to a larger cone of escaping electrons and thus a higher electron source temperature.\n\n\nIV.

Bright Wilson, Jr. (Wilson 1962). Wilson asks the rhetorical question, \"Does there exist some procedure for calculating n(r) [for an N -electron system] which avoids altogether the use of 3N dimensional space?\" He then uses a device mentioned earlier (see Section IV) and defines n(r, λ) to be the exact ground state electron density of a many-electron system where the charge of every electron is taken to be λe rather than e. Using just a few lines of calculation, Wilson shows that the total energy E in Eq. (10) can be written as an integral from λ = 0 to λ = 1 of the sum of the classical Coulomb potentials produced by n(r, λ) at the positions of all the nuclei. [110] From the foregoing, I conclude that no scientists before Walter Kohn in 1963 were even vaguely thinking about using the ground state charge density as a fundamental quantity from which to build an exact theory of a manyelectron system. The idea was not \"in the air\" and all eyes were riveted either on the many-electron wave function, the first-and second-order density matrices, or the Green functions of many-body field theory. The zeitgeist of electronic structure theory was simply not moving in the direction of the electron density function for some particulary well-prepared scientist to exploit and earn the accolades of discovery.",

In KS DFT the variational relationship is between the energy and the KS orbitals. In HK DFT, it is between the energy and the density. In all cases, when fitting introduced, it seems computationally advantageous to define the energy is such a way that its variational properties are preserved. Doing so both simplifies the EE potential (and thus the calculation) and preserves its variational relationship with the energy. We call approximations that preserve the variational principle variational fitting [8].\n\nUnder very special circumstances, the difference between EE energy evaluated using only fitted charge distributions and the variationally fitted energy that involves both fitted and exact charge distributions is numerically zero [9]. Even for that special case, if the fit is constrained to generate reasonable long-range interaction energies, then the variational fitted energy is different. Motivating our work is the fact the difference in energy using constrained and unconstrained Coulomb fits with reasonable fitting basis sets is very large in calculations on heavy atoms [10], but variational fitting through the CoV largely zeros that difference [4]. It also largely zeros the energy difference if the entire EE interaction energy is fitted, as we will show.",

In the fourth column, we evaluate Q, which is the sum of all three weighted errors with uniform weights rather than ⍀:\nQϭ750ϫ ͚ m n E ͑ E m exact ϪE m KϪS ͒ 2 ϩ500ϫ ͚ l,X n G ͩ ‫ץ‬E l KϪS ‫ץ‬X ͪ 2 ϩ ͚ j, n v ͵ ͑ v j, ZM P ϩk j, Ϫv j, KϪS ͒ 2 j, 2/3 dr. ͑5͒\nSince all three contributions are important and the GGA functionals have been fit to a value similar to Q, it is probably the most important diagnostic. Nevertheless, as only the first two sums are directly apparent from the energy calculations, we also evaluate Q 1 , which excludes the potential:\nQ 1 ϭ750ϫ ͚ m n E ͑ E m exact ϪE m KϪS ͒ 2 ϩ500ϫ ͚ l,X n G ͩ ‫ץ‬E l KϪS ‫ץ‬X ͪ 2 .\n\n͑6͒",
