Using two variants of the laser photoelectron attachment method with a thermal gas target (T(G) = 300 K), we measured the energy dependent yield for Br- formation over the range E = 3-1200 meV with resolutions of about 3 meV (E &lt; 200 meV) and 35 meV. At the onsets for excitation of one and two quanta for the C-Br stretching mode nu3, downward cusps are detected. With reference to the recommended thermal (300 K) attachment rate coefficient k(A)(CF3Br) = 1.4 x 10(-8) cm3 s(-1), absolute cross sections have been determined for Br- formation. In addition, we studied Br- and (CF3Br)Br- formations with a seeded supersonic target beam (10% CF3Br in helium carrier gas, with a stagnation pressure of 1-4 bars and nozzle temperatures of 300 and 600 K) and found prominent structure in the anion yields due to cluster formation. Using the microwave pulse radiolysis swarm technique, allowing for controlled variation of the electron temperature by microwave heating, we studied the dependence of the absolute DEA rate coefficient on the mean electron energy E over the range of 0.04-2 eV at gas temperatures T(G) ranging from 173 to 600 K. For comparison with the experimental results, semiempirical resonance R-matrix calculations have been carried out. The input for the theory includes the known energetic and structural parameters of the neutral molecule and its anion; the parameters of the resonant anion curves are chosen with reference to the known thermal rate coefficient for the DEA process. For the gas temperature T(G) = 300 K, good overall agreement of the theoretical DEA cross section with the experimental results is observed; moreover, rate coefficients for Br- formation due to Rydberg electron transfer, calculated with both the experimental and the theoretical DEA cross sections, are found to agree with the previously reported absolute experimental values. At T(G) = 300 K, satisfactory agreement is also found between the calculated and experimental attachment rate coefficients for mean electron energies E = 0.04-2 eV. The strong increase of the measured rate coefficients with rising gas temperature, however, could be only partially recovered by the R-matrix results. The differences may result from the influence of thermal excitations of other vibrational modes not included in the theory.",

The following diagonal self-energy methods are optimal: opposite-spin non-Dyson second order (os-nD-D2), approximately renormalized partial third order (P3+), approximately renormalized quasiparticle third order (Q3+), and non-Dyson approximately renormalized linear third order version B (nD-L3+B).

For a cw electric field, the time dependent probability of staying at the product state, P1(t), is shown to be strongly dependent on the field intensity parameter a: P1(a,t) approximately (Gamma(m(1),m(2))t)(-E(rf)/E(rs)) or P1(a,t) approximately (Gamma(m(0))t)(-E(rf)/E(rs)), double or single resonances, respectively.

The correlation between the de Broglie wavelength related to the thermal motion and the potential barrier width and height is reported. The stochastic jumps of light atoms (hydrogen, deuterium) between two equilibrium sites A and B (identical geometry) occur via different pathways; one pathway is over the barrier (classical dynamics), and the other one is through the barrier (tunneling). On the over-the-barrier pathway, there are no obstacles for the de Broglie waves, and this pathway exists from high to low temperatures up to 0 K because the thermal energy is subjected to the Maxwell distribution and a certain number of particles owns enough energy for the hopping over the barrier. On the tunneling pathway, the particles pass through the barrier, or they are reflected from the barrier. Only particles with the energy lower than barrier heights are able to perform a tunneling hopping. The de Broglie waves related to these energies are longer than the barrier width. The Schrödinger equation is applied to calculate the rate constant of tunneling dynamics. The Maxwell distribution of the thermal energy has been taken into account to calculate the tunneling rate constant. The equations for the total spectral density of complex motion derived earlier by us together with the expression for the tunneling rate constant, derived in the present paper, are used in analysis of the temperature dependence of deuteron spin-lattice relaxation of the ammonium ion in the deuterated analogue of ammonium hexachloroplumbate ((ND4)2PbCl6). It has been established that the equation CpTtun = EH (thermal energy equals activation energy), where Cp is the molar heat capacity (temperature-dependent, known from literature), determines directly the low temperature Ttun at which the de Broglie wavelength, lambdadeBroglie, related to the thermal energy, CpT, is equal to the potential barrier width, L. Above Ttun, the lambdadeBroglie wavelength related to the CpT energy is shorter than the potential barrier width and not able to overcome the barrier. The activation energy EH equals 7.5 kJ/mol, and therefore, the Ttun temperature for deuterons in ((ND4)2PbCl6 is 55.7 K. The agreement between the potential barrier width following from the simple geometrical calculations (L = 0.722 A) and de Broglie wavelength at Ttun (L = 0.752 A) is good. The temperature plots of the deuteron correlation times for (ND4)2PbCl6 reveal comparable values of the correlation times of the tunneling, (tau(T)), and over-the-barrier jumps (tau(H)) near 34.8 K. Matsuo, on the basis of the molar heat capacity study, found the first-order phase transition at this temperature.",

Sensitivity to symmetry and spin forbidden transitions as well as correlations to the triplet states of benzene make it possible to ascribe the main features, below 7 eV in the electronic part of the EEL spectrum, to triplet transitions. The lowest EEL feature with an energy onset at 3.5 eV is attributed to a transition to the (3)B(1)(n--&gt;pi(*)) valence electronic state and the next triplet n--&gt;pi(*) transition to a (3)A(2) state located around 4.5 eV.

The Klein-Gordon heat equation is solved via the Zhukovsky \"state-of-the-art\" mathematical techniques. Our study can be regarded as an initial approximation of attosecond laser-particle interaction when the prevalent phenomenon is photon-electron interaction. The electrons interact with the laser beam, which means that the nucleus does not play a significant role in temperature distribution. The particle is supposed to be homogenous with respect to thermophysical properties. This theoretical approach could prove useful for the study of metallic nano-/micro-particles interacting with attosecond laser pulses. Specific applications for Au \"nano\" particles with a 50 nm radius and \"micro\" particles with 110, 130, 150, and 1000 nm radii under 100 attosecond laser pulse irradiation are considered. First, the cross-section is supposed to be proportional to the area of the particle, which is assumed to be a perfect sphere of radius R or a rotation ellipsoid. Second, the absorption coefficient is calculated using a semiclassical approach, taking into account the number of atoms per unit volume, the classical electron radius, the laser wavelength, and the atomic scattering factor (10 in case of Au), which cover all the basic aspects for the interaction between the attosecond laser and a nanoparticle. The model is applicable within the 100-2000 nm range. The main conclusion of the model is that for a range inferior to 1000 nm, a competition between ballistic and thermal phenomena occurs. For values in excess of 1000 nm, our study suggests that the thermal phenomena are dominant. Contrastingly, during the irradiation with fs pulses, this value is of the order of 100 nm. This theoretical model's predictions could be soon confirmed with the new EU-ELI facilities in progress, which will generate pulses of 100 as at a 30 nm wavelength.",

We find the mean sum energy, the maximum of the distributions as well as the high-energy tail of the scaled (to the ponderomotive energy) spectra increase with decreasing intensity below the recollision threshold (BRT). At higher intensities the spectra collapse into a single distribution. This behavior can be well explained within a semiclassical model providing clear evidence of the importance of multiple recollisions in the BRT regime.

Optical absorption spectra of solvated electrons (esolv-) in Gl were recorded as a function of temperature (381&lt;or=T&lt;or=505 K). The observed redshift of the absorption maximum, homegamax, yields a temperature coefficient d(homegamax)/dT=-(2.67+/-0.07)x10(-3) eV K-1. For solutions with a concentration c(I-) approximately 10(-3)M, the absorbance of esolv- at homegamax increases by a factor of about 65 when the temperature is raised from 329 to 536 K. This effect can be partially explained by a temperature-dependent redshift of the CTTS spectrum of I- in Gl with respect to the laser wavelength. The main contribution to the increasing yield of esolv- is determined by diffusion controlled escape dynamics of the electron in the contact pair (I:e-)solv which is formed very fast during the detachment process. At room temperature no absorption of esolv- (absorbance&lt;1.0x10(-3)) could be observed which is probably a result of an extremely small self-diffusion coefficient of Gl (a factor of 1250 lower than that of water at 298 K).

The expression is cubic in energy and requires as input parameters the total stopping power, So, the ratio of the scattering power and the total specific stopping power, T0/epsilon0, both taken at 10 MeV, and the radiation length for the material involved, X0. In addition to these parameters, five of the derived parameters are used to 'fine tune' the equation and minimize the mean square deviation from experimental and/or Monte Carlo data by means of non-linear regression. In the present study only Monte Carlo data determined with the new ITS.3 code have been employed. The standard deviations of the mean deviation from the Monte Carlo data at any energy are about 0.10, 0.12, 0.04, 0.11, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02 mm for Be, C, H2O, Al, Cu, Ag and U, respectively, and the relative standard deviation of the mean is about 0.5% for all materials. The fitting program gives some priority to water-equivalent materials, which explains the low standard deviation for water. A small error in the fall-off slope can give a different value for Rp. We describe a new method which reduces the uncertainty in the Rp determination, by fitting an odd function to the descending portion of the depth-dose curve in order to accurately determine the tangent at the inflection point, and thereby the practical range. An approximate inverse relation is given expressing the most probable energy of an electron beam as a function of the practical range.

Transient absorption kinetics of the hydrated electron, e(aq) (-), have been observed, from a few hundred femtoseconds out to 600 ps, and studied as function of hydroxide concentration and temperature. The geminate decay kinetics are bimodal, with a fast exponential component ( approximately 13 ps) and a slower power \"tail\" due to the diffusional escape of the electrons. For the biphotonic excitation, the extrapolated fraction of escaped electrons is 1.8 times higher than for the monophotonic 200 nm excitation (31% versus 17.5% at 25 degrees C, respectively), due to the broadening of the electron distribution. The biphotonic electron detachment is very inefficient; the corresponding absorption coefficient at 400 nm is &lt;4 cm TW(-1) M(-1) (assuming unity quantum efficiency for the photodetachment). For [OH(-)] between 10 mM and 10 M, almost no concentration dependence of the time profiles of solvated electron kinetics was observed.

Ab initio multireference configuration interaction calculations were performed on both barrierless PESs (where the minimum energy path involves the insertion of the O atom into the middle of the H2(+) bond), and suitable analytical expressions were developed for the first time and used in quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations. k(1) ≈ 3k(2) independent of the isotopic variant, k(H2(+)) &gt; k(HD(+)) &gt; k(D2(+)) for , and the intermolecular and intramolecular isotopic effects are essentially independent of T.

The larger value of σ(1(2)A'') with respect to σ(1(2)A') arises from the larger value of bmax(1(2)A'') with respect to bmax(1(2)A'), and this results from the more attractive character of the former PES. Besides, the reaction probabilities are quite large [0.78-0.98 (1(2)A'') and 0.78-0.93 (1(2)A')], and the decreasing trend of both cross-sections as Ecol increases arises from the barrierless character of both PESs. We expect that these results (in particular, the competition between proton transfer and hydrogen atom transfer) will encourage experimentalists to carry out investigations on this interesting reaction.

Here, to design low work function materials, we perform first-principles calculations on selected materials of transition metal dichalcogenide as substrates and alkali metals as adsorbates.

Expressed as a function of E(F), Fermi energy, and varphi, work function of the components of interest, equations of spectral, ( partial differentialdelta/ partial differentialE(k)), and angular, ( partial differentialdelta/ partial differentialalpha) distributions of the emitted SEs permit to evaluate k(alpha) and k(varphi) for Au and Si.

For simple geometries in the vacuum gap, similar investigations show that parameter k(phi) is also larger for gold than for n-doped Si as well as for p-doped Si with respect to n-doped Si.

In a dark state, the hydroxyl group of the chromophore is deprotonated and forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr42 and Glu46. Either removal of a hydrogen bond with Tyr42 or addition of chaotropes such as thiocyanate produces a blue-shifted species called an intermediate wavelength form, in which absorption maximum ranges from 355 to 400 nm. To examine the structural origin of the intermediate wavelength form, we have performed resonance Raman investigations of wild-type PYP and some mutants (Tyr42 --&gt; Ala, Tyr42 --&gt; Phe, Glu46 --&gt; Gln, and Thr50 --&gt; Val) in the presence or absence of potassium thiocyanate. These studies show that the chromophore of the intermediate wavelength form is protonated, implying an increase in a pK(a) of the chromophore. Hence, the removal of the hydrogen bond between Tyr42 and chromophore or partial protein denaturation in the presence of thiocyanate results in a spectral blue-shift.

These are populated thermally via an activated transition from the highly radiative metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer states that are initially populated due to intersystem crossing following the radiative or electronic excitation of the phosphor. We apply transition state theory to quantitatively calculate the non-radiative decay rate of a family of Ir(iii) complexes containing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. We compare the, computationally inexpensive, one-dimensional theory with the, more accurate, multi-dimensional theory. Both methods find a non-radiative rate with an Arrhenius form (knr = kae-ΔE/kBT). The pre-exponential factors, ka, and activation energies, ΔE, are evaluated via density functional theory (DFT). The multi-dimensional theory shows that there is an order of magnitude variation in ka within this family of materials (between 3 × 1011 s-1 and 3 × 1012 s-1). This is not captured by the one-dimensional theory, which predicts very uniform rate constants in the middle of this range (∼1012 s-1). Nevertheless, the activated process involved, and the linear relationship between ka and knr, mean that ka plays a subtle role in determining knr. Consistent with this we find that both methods capture the trend observed experimentally in the non-radiative rates. Furthermore, the magnitude of the calculated knr is similar in both methods and in good agreement with experimental values [except for one complex with a very shallow activation barrier (&lt;0.1 eV)]. It has previously been demonstrated that radiative decay rates can be accurately calculated from DFT. Combined with our results for the non-radiative rates, this implies that DFT methods can accurately predict the emission efficiency in Ir(iii) phosphors. Therefore, DFT calculations are both fast and accurate enough to play a significant role in the design of new deep blue Ir(iii) phosphors with high emission efficiency. Even the one-dimensional theory provides reasonable agreement with experiment. This suggests that a funneling approach - where only the best performing molecules, according to the one-dimensional theory, are studied in the more laborious multi-dimensional framework - could be a powerful strategy for designing active materials for phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) from first principles.",

A second narrowband tunable cw Ti:Sapphirelaser (PROBE) is then scanned, while 3(1)Pi --&gt; 1(X)1Sigma+ violet fluorescence is monitored. The Doppler-free signals accurately map the 3(1)Pi(v, J) ro-vibrational energy levels. These energy levels are then fit to a Dunham expansion to provide a set of molecular constants. The Dunham constants, in turn, are used to construct an RKR potential curve. Resolved 3(1)Pi(v, J) --&gt; 1(X)1Sigma+(v\", J\") fluorescence scans are also recorded with both PUMP and PROBE laser frequencies fixed. Comparison between observed and calculated Franck-Condon factors is used to determine the absolute vibrational numbering of the 3(1)Pi state levels and to determine the variation of the 3(1)Pi --&gt; 1(X)1Sigma+ transitiondipole moment with internuclear separation. The recent theoretical calculation of the NaK 3(1)Pi state potential reported by Magnier and Millié (1996, Phys. Rev. A 54, 204) is in excellent agreement with the present experimental RKR curve.

Their activation results from the complex synergy between the transmembrane voltage sensors and a large (&gt;300 kDa) C-terminal, cytoplasmic complex (the \"gating ring\"), which confers sensitivity to intracellular Ca(2+) and other ligands. However, the molecular and biophysical operation of the gating ring remains unclear. We have used spectroscopic and particle-scale optical approaches to probe the metal-sensing properties of the human BK gating ring under physiologically relevant conditions. This functional molecular sensor undergoes Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-dependent conformational changes at physiologically relevant concentrations, detected by time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. The lack of detectable Ba(2+)-evoked structural changes defined the metal selectivity of the gating ring. Neutralization of a high-affinity Ca(2+)-binding site (the \"calcium bowl\") reduced the Ca(2+) and abolished the Mg(2+) dependence of structural rearrangements. In congruence with electrophysiological investigations, these findings provide biochemical evidence that the gating ring possesses an additional high-affinity Ca(2+)-binding site and that Mg(2+) can bind to the calcium bowl with less affinity than Ca(2+). Dynamic light scattering analysis revealed a reversible Ca(2+)-dependent decrease of the hydrodynamic radius of the gating ring, consistent with a more compact overall shape.

MnXe exhibits only a single thermally stable site whose emission at 620 nm is similar to the broad a 6D bands produced with blue-site excitation in Ar and Kr. Thus in Ar(Kr), excitation of the red site at 393 (400) nm produces narrow line emissions at 427.5 (427.8) and 590 (585.7) nm. From their spectral positions, linewidths, and long decay times, these emission bands are assigned to the a 4D72 and a 6D92 states, respectively. Excitation of the blue site at 380 (385.5) nm produces broad emission at 413 (416) nm which, because of its nanosecond radiative lifetime, is assigned to resonance z 6P --&gt; a 6S fluorescence. Emission bands at 438 (440) and 625 (626.8) nm, also produced with blue-site excitation, are broader than their red-site equivalents at 427.5 and 590 nm (427.8 and 585.7 nm in Kr) but from their millisecond and microsecond decay times are assigned to the a 4D and a 6D states. The line features observed in high resolution scans of the red-site emission at 427.5 and 427.8 nm in MnAr and MnKr, respectively, have been analyzed with the W(p) optical line shape function and identified as resolved phonon structure originating from very weak (S=0.4) electron-phonon coupling. The presence of considerable hot-phonon emission (even in 12 K spectra) and the existence of crystal field splittings of 35 and 45 cm(-1) on the excited a 4D72 level in Ar and Kr matrices have been identified in W(p) line shape fits.

Potential energies have been calculated over a large range of R up to 75a(0) for the 88 Omega(g,u)(+/-) states dissociating adiabatically into the limits up to K(4p (2)P(3/2))+K(4p (2)P(3/2)). Equilibrium distances, transition energies, harmonic frequencies, as well as depths for wells and heights for barriers are reported for all of the bound Omega(g,u)(+/-) states.

The approach involves solving the corresponding Dirichlet problem H(R)Psi(R)=E(R)Psi(R) on a finite interval [-R,R] by the Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory (RSPT). The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k). The summation of the latter series with large lambda for the octic case is considered as an extremely challenging summation problem, in part, since it was rigorously proven that the Padé approximants cannot converge and the two-point Padé approximants, which combine information of the renormalized weak coupling and strong coupling expansions, give relatively good results. The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Padé approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda. The coefficients E((k))(R) are calculated with the eigenvalue series of an operator H(Rn), whose resolvent converges to that of H(R) as n--&gt; infinity. The Padé approximants of the RSPT eigenfunction series Psi(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)psi((k))(R)lambda(k) also provide accurate results for the octic oscillator.",

The occasional maxima of the ratios S(n)/S(n) are surprisingly large and the problem is to estimate the extent of their probable fluctuations.Specifically, let S(n) (*) = (S(n) - b(n))/a(n), where {a(n)} and {b(n)}, two numerical sequences.

No assumptions concerning the under-lying distributions are made; the criteria explain structurally which features of {X(n)} affect the fluctuations, but for concrete results something about P{S(n)&gt;a(n)} must be known.

We apply these concepts to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) system and show how the IE approach can give rise to local existence proofs. In this approach, the global existence problem in three-dimensional NS systems, for specific initial condition and viscosity, becomes a problem of asymptotics in the variable p (dual to 1/t or some positive power of 1/t). Furthermore, the errors in numerical computations in the associated IE can be controlled rigorously, which is very important for nonlinear PDEs such as NS when solutions are not known to exist globally.Moreover, computation of the solution of the IE over an interval [0,p0] provides sharper control of its p--&gt;infinity behaviour.

Focusing on the system's space of satisfiable configurations, we carry out extensive population dynamics simulations using the technique of importance sampling, and we obtain the entropy density s(r) and complexity Sigma(r) of zero-energy clusters at different r values. We demonstrate that the population dynamics may reach different fixed points with different types of initial conditions. By knowing the trends of s(r) and Sigma(r) with r , we can judge whether a certain type of initial condition is appropriate at a given r value. This work complements and confirms the results of several other very recent theoretical studies.",

The sum of the initial terms of the asymptotic series up to, and including, the least term often furnishes a fair approximation to the desired value of the function being evaluated. It was early observed by computers that if the terms of the asymptotic series alternate in sign, this approximation was often improved by replacing the least term by its half. The factor by which the least term of the asymptotic series must be multiplied so that the true value of the function being evaluated is obtained by addition of this modified least term to the remaining initial terms of the asymptotic series is known as the converging factor for the asymptotic series. The converging factor for the asymptotic series involved in the calculation of the exponential integral, for large negative values of the argument, was given as a power series in the reciprocal of the argument by Airey; the first term of this series is (1/2).

The formula for the triplet and quartet invariant that we obtain in this way reduces to the well known classical formula for the case of a uniform density of the atomic position vectors. For the case of complete knowledge of the atomic vectors it reduces to first order to the exact probability density of the triplet (quartet) phase invariant. Applying this formula to the most general j.p.d. of the atomic vectors we obtain a statistical interpretation of Hauptman's algebraic B(3,0) and B(4,0) formulas. We also give a heuristic derivation of the SAD method. Another method that we shall discuss uses a method called linearization of the invariants that also produces formulas for the triplet phase invariant. This method is based on previous work and is also more laborious to calculate with than the SAD method. It can also give a statistical interpretation of the B(3,0) formula. We show that the formula obtained for the triplet resembles the formula obtained with SAD.",

The average autocorrelation of multiple realizations of fGn converges to the theoretically expected autocorrelation. Two methods commonly used to generate fractal time series, an approximate spectral synthesis (SSM) method and the successive random addition (SRA) method, do not give the correct correlation structures and should be abandoned. Time series from fGp were used to test how well several versions of rescaled range analysis (R/S) and dispersional analysis (Disp) estimate the Hurst coefficient (0 &lt; H &lt; 1.0). Disp is unbiased for H &lt; 0.9 and series length N ≥ 1024, but underestimates H when H &gt; 0.9. R/S-detrended overestimates H for time series with H &lt; 0.7 and underestimates H for H &gt; 0.7.

We show that the order of the fractional derivative depends on the age of the process under study. If the system is infinitely old, the order of the fractional derivative, o , is given by o=3-mu . A brand new system is characterized by the degree o=mu-2 . If the system is prepared at time - t(a) &lt;0 and the observation begins at time t=0 , we derive the following scenario. For times 0&lt;t&lt;&lt; t(a) the system is satisfactorily described by the fractional derivative with o=3-mu . Upon time increase the system undergoes a rejuvenation process that in the time limit t&gt;&gt; t(a) yields o=mu-2 .

Acta Cryst. A58, 265-269] which reformulates the quantum-mechanical problem of solving a Schrödinger (S) equation in a crystallographic context has been upgraded and tested for many aspects of convergence. The upgraded algorithm in reciprocal space aims at determining a wavefunction Phi(H) such that (a) Phi(H) fulfils the S equation within certain precision and (b) Phi(H) minimizes by least squares the differences between the calculated structure factors from the wavefunction and the observed ones. Calculations have been made with three molecules (11, 41 and 110 non-H atoms in the asymmetric unit) for different numbers of initially given phases. Three main questions have been addressed: (I) Does the iterative calculation of the wavefunction converge? (II) Do the calculated wavefunctions converge to a unique set of Phi(H) values independent of the initial random set of Phi(H)? (III) Is the calculated Phi(H) set a good approximation of a wavefunction able to produce within certain errors the correct values of the phases of the structure factors? Concerning questions (I) and (II), our results give a strong hint about fast convergence to a unique wavefunction independent of the arbitrary starting wavefunction. This is an essential prerequisite for practical applications. For question (III) in the case closer to the ab initio situation, the final mean phase error, respectively, for the three structures is 3, 26 and 28 degrees. The combination of (a) and (b) in the upgraded algorithm has been proved crucial especially for the results concerning the larger structures.",

This involves the choice of the parameter b and the choice of the operators I(3) (the third component of the weak left-handed isospin) and U (the weak hypercharge). These must commute, and are related to the electric charge by the usual formula Q = I(3) + (1/2)U. In particular, taking I(3) to be in its standard form in su(2) subset sl(5) subset sl(5/1) and requiring that U commute with color su(3) subset sl(5) subset sl(5/1) leaves three free parameters, two for the choice of U and one for the choice of b. We show that there are just two possible choices of these parameters yielding exactly all 32 quark and lepton charges: the Georgi-Glashow U in su(5), corresponding to U(1,-(2/3)) and arbitrary b and U(0,(1/3)) negated set membership su(5), with b = 2.

It is therefore desirable to find simple approximations based on the exact result that may be more accurate than the familiar Cochran approximation or its extensions. One such approximation, presented here, has the same functional form as the Cochran approximation but with a modified parameter in place of that appearing in Cochran's distribution.

The sum of the initial terms of the asymptotic series up to, and including, the least term often furnishes a fair approximation to the desired value of the function being evaluated. It was early observed by computers that if the terms of the asymptotic series alternate in sign, this approximation was often improved by replacing the least term by its half. The factor by which the least term of the asymptotic series must be multiplied so that the true value of the function being evaluated is obtained by addition of this modified least term to the remaining initial terms of the asymptotic series is known as the converging factor for the asymptotic series. The converging factor for the asymptotic series involved in the calculation of the exponential integral, for large negative values of the argument, was given as a power series in the reciprocal of the argument by Airey; the first term of this series is (1/2).

The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k). The summation of the latter series with large lambda for the octic case is considered as an extremely challenging summation problem, in part, since it was rigorously proven that the Padé approximants cannot converge and the two-point Padé approximants, which combine information of the renormalized weak coupling and strong coupling expansions, give relatively good results. The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Padé approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda. The coefficients E((k))(R) are calculated with the eigenvalue series of an operator H(Rn), whose resolvent converges to that of H(R) as n--&gt; infinity.

The occasional maxima of the ratios S(n)/S(n) are surprisingly large and the problem is to estimate the extent of their probable fluctuations.Specifically, let S(n) (*) = (S(n) - b(n))/a(n), where {a(n)} and {b(n)}, two numerical sequences. For any interval I, denote by p(I) the probability that the event S(n) (*) epsilon I occurs for infinitely many n. Under mild conditions on {a(n)} and {b(n)}, it is shown that p(I) equals 0 or 1 according as a certain series converges or diverges. To obtain the upper limit of S(n)/a(n), one has to set b(n) = +/- epsilon a(n), but finer results are obtained with smaller b(n). No assumptions concerning the under-lying distributions are made; the criteria explain structurally which features of {X(n)} affect the fluctuations, but for concrete results something about P{S(n)&gt;a(n)} must be known. For example, a complete solution is possible when the X(n) are normal, replacing the classical law of the iterated logarithm. Further concrete estimates may be obtained by combining the new criteria with some recently developed limit theorems.",

By combining these methods, the B origin of 2PY at 0(0) (0)+98 cm(-1) and the bands at +218 and +252 cm(-1) are identified as overtones of the S(1) state out-of-plane vibrations nu(1) (') and nu(2) ('), as are the analogous bands of d-2PY. Anharmonic double-minimum potentials are derived for the respective out-of-plane coordinates that predict further nu(1) (') and nu(2) (') overtones and combinations, reproducing approximately 80% of the vibronic bands up to 600 cm(-1) above the 0(0) (0) band. The fluorescence spectra excited at the electronic origins and the nu(1) (') and nu(2) (') out-of-plane overtone levels confirm these assignments. The S(1) nonplanar minima and S(1)&lt;--S(0) out-of-plane progressions are in agreement with the determination of nonplanar vibrationally averaged geometries for the 0(0) (0) and 0(0) (0)+98 cm(-1) upper states by Held et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 95, 8732 (1991)]. The fluorescence lifetimes of the S(1) state vibrations show strong mode dependence: Those of the out-of-plane levels decrease rapidly above 200 cm(-1) excess vibrational energy, while the in-plane vibrations nu(5) ('), nu(8) ('), and nu(9) (') have longer lifetimes, although they are above or interspersed with the \"dark\" out-of-plane states. This is interpreted in terms of an S(1) (') state reaction with a low barrier towards a conical intersection with a prefulvenic geometry. Out-of-plane vibrational states can directly surmount this barrier, whereas in-plane vibrations are much less efficient in this respect. Analysis of the fluorescence spectra allows to identify nine in-plane S(0) (') state fundamentals, overtones of the S(0) state nu(1) (\") and nu(2) (\") out-of-plane vibrations, and &gt;30 other overtones and combination bands. The B3LYP6-311++G(d,p) calculated anharmonic wave numbers are in very good agreement with the observed fundamentals, overtones, and combinations, with a deviation Delta(rms)=1.3%.",

Here [Formula: see text] is a composite time-series constructed by averaging the concurrent time-series ([Formula: see text]) sampled at N spatially distributed Eulerian points. The N  =  1 case has been extensively studied for velocity fluctuations (m  =  1) and to a lesser extent for m  &gt;  1. The averaging method in case of N  &gt;  1 diverges from the Kolmogorov framework and has not been studied because fluctuations in [Formula: see text] are expected to smooth with increasing N leaving behind uninteresting large-scale mean flow information, but we find this is not so. We report the evolution of scaling exponents [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text] in going from a single (N  =  1) to a spatial average over several Eulerian points ([Formula: see text]). Our 3D experiments in a tank with rotating jets at the floor show [Formula: see text] for all m-values in agreement with prior results and evolves to an asymptotic value of [Formula: see text]. The evolution of [Formula: see text] follows the functional form [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] points is the only fit parameter representing the convergence rate constant. Results for the 2D experiments conducted in a gravity assisted soap film in the enstrophy cascade regime are in sharp contrast with their 3D counterparts.

The starkly different convergence forms (exponential in 3D versus logarithmic in 2D) may be interpreted as a signature of inter-scale couplings in the respective turbulent flows by decomposing the two-point correlator for [Formula: see text] into a self-correlation and cross-correlation term. In addition to aiding in the theoretical development, the results may also have implications for determination of resolution in 2D turbulence experiments and simulations, wind energy and atmospheric boundary layer turbulence.",

However, this method has a poor anti-noise capability and is computationally intensive. The aims of this study were to develop a new method based on the 2nd-order B-spline wavelet for calculating AIx, and to compare it with numerical differentiation and Savitzky-Golay digital differentiator (SGDD). All the three methods were applied to pulse waveforms derived from 60 healthy subjects. There was a significantly high correlation between the proposed method and numerical differentiation (r=0.998 for carotid pulses, and r=0.997 for radial pulses), as well as between the proposed method and the SGDD (r=0.995 for carotid pulses, and r=0.993 for radial pulses). In addition, the anti-noise capability of the proposed method was evaluated by adding simulated noise (&gt;10Hz) on pulse waveforms. The results showed that the proposed method was advantageous in noise tolerance than the other two methods. These findings indicate that the proposed method can quickly and accurately calculate AIx with a good anti-noise capability. ",

Analytical closed-form equations for all auxiliary quantities have already been known but they suffer from large digital erosion when some of the parameters are large or small. We derive two differential equations which are obeyed by the most difficult basic integrals. Taking them as a starting point, useful series expansions for small parameter values or asymptotic expansions for large parameter values are systematically derived. The resulting expansions replace the corresponding analytical expressions when the latter introduce significant cancellations. Additionally, we reconsider numerical integration of some necessary quantities and present a new way to calculate the integrand with a controlled precision. All proposed methods are combined to lead to a general, stable algorithm. We perform extensive numerical tests of the introduced expressions to verify their validity and usefulness.

Starting from the general SOS method, several simplified SOS formulae are derived. In particular, within the so-called independent mode displaced harmonic oscillator model, it is shown that including the vibronic structure in the absorption and RR spectra only requires the calculation of FC overlap integrals of the type θg0|θev, where g, e, and v stand for the electronic ground state, excited state, and vibrational quantum number, respectively. Additionally, an approximation of the latter approach is introduced, referred as the simplified Φe method, in which the FC factors are neglected. This method is advantageous from the computational point of view and it is demonstrated that it reproduces the main characteristics of the more involved approaches. The merits and drawbacks of the different methods are discussed by applying them to the prototypical compound of Rhodamine 6G.

At this regime measurements are sensitive to internal dynamics, and we focus on vibrational dynamics of folded proteins. Exploiting the analogy between proteins and fractals, we perform a general analytic calculation of the displacement two-point correlation functions, &lt;[u(−&gt;)(i)(t)-u(−&gt;)(j)(0)](2)&gt;. We confront the derived expressions with numerical evaluations that are based on protein data bank (PDB) structures and the Gaussian network model (GNM) for a few proteins and for the Sierpinski gasket as a controlled check. We use these calculations to evaluate S(k,t) with arrested rotational and translational degrees of freedom, and show that the decay of S(k,t) is dominated by the spatially averaged mean-square displacement of an amino acid. The latter has been previously shown to evolve subdiffusively in time, &lt;[u(−&gt;)(i)(t)-u(−&gt;)(i)(0)](2)&gt; ~t(ν), where ν is the anomalous diffusion exponent that depends on the spectral dimension d(s) and fractal dimension d(f). As a result, for wave numbers obeying k(2)&lt;u(−&gt;)(2)&gt;≳1, S(k,t) effectively decays as a stretched exponential S(k,t)≃S(k)e(-(Γ(k)t)(β)) with β≃ν, where the relaxation rate is Γ(k)~(k(B)T/mω(o)(2))(1/β)k(2/β), T is the temperature, and mω(o)(2) the GNM effective spring constant describing the interaction between neighboring amino acids. The static structure factor is dominated by the fractal character of the native fold, S(k)~k(-d(f)), with negligible to marginal influence of vibrations. The analytical expressions are first confronted with numerically based calculations on the Sierpinski gasket, and very good agreement is found between simulations and theory. We then perform PDB-GNM-based numerical calculations for a few proteins, and an effective stretched exponential decay of the dynamic structure factor is found, albeit their relatively small size. However, when rotational and translational diffusion are added, we find that their contribution is never negligible due to finite size effects. While we can still attribute an effective stretching exponent β to the relaxation profile, this exponent is significantly larger than the anomalous diffusion exponent ν. We compare our theory with recent neutron spin-echo studies of myoglobin and hemoglobin and conclude that experiments in which the rotational and translational degrees of freedom are arrested, e.g., by anchoring the proteins to a surface, will improve the detection of internal vibrational dynamics.",

We apply new theoretical developments (since 2001) in nearside-farside (NF) theory to provide insights into intricate oscillatory structures in its DCS. It is shown that a simple physically-meaningful parameterization of the scattering (S) matrix, using a background Gaussian term plus a single Regge pole and a quadratic phase, can reproduce, in the forward and sideward directions, the intricate angular scattering obtained from numerical S matrix elements computed from a quantum Born-Oppenheimer-Centrifugal-Sudden scattering technique. This encouraging result suggests that many S matrix elements obtained from computer-intensive calculations can be parameterized in a similar physically-meaningful way. The manner in which the full and NF DCSs change when the Regge pole becomes progressively less important compared to the Gaussian term is also investigated. We report the first application to reactive scattering of the Hatchell NF decomposition, including resummations of the Legendre partial wave series for the scattering amplitude. The Hatchell NF resummed DCSs are compared with the corresponding Fuller NF resummed DCSs for resummation orders of r = 0, 1, 2 and 3. We find that the Fuller NF decomposition always provides a better physical interpretation of the angular scattering. Resummation usually cleans the NF DCSs of unphysical oscillations, especially in the farside (F) DCSs, with the greatest cleaning effect on going from no resummation (r = 0) to first order resummation (r = 1). Identities are derived which relate the Fuller and Hatchell NF subamplitudes for resummation orders, r &gt; 0, to the NF unresummed subamplitudes, r = 0. These identities help us understand the origin of unexpected peaks, which sometimes appear in NF resummed DCSs, together with a simple procedure to remove them. We report Local Angular Momentum (LAM) and DCS x LAM (CLAM) analyses of the angular scattering for r = 0 and r = 1 using the Fuller NF decomposition. The LAM and CLAM analyses provide complementary (yet consistent) information to that obtained from the NF resummed DCSs. It is shown that the \"l window representation\", as used to analyse elastic scattering in the presence of strong absorption, is a special case of the general resummation theory developed in this paper.",

This benchmark has been used to evaluate the performance of 31 popular density functionals, covering local-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). The ab initio benchmark has been obtained by exploring the PESs using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [up to CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of Gaussian-type basis sets (up to aug-cc-pVQZ). Our best CCSD(T) estimates show that the overall barriers for the various pathways increase in the order anti-E2 (X = F) &lt; SN2 (X = F) &lt; SN2 (X = Cl) ∼ syn-E2 (X = F) &lt; anti-E2 (X = Cl) &lt; syn-E2 (X = Cl). Thus, anti-E2 dominates for F(-) + CH3CH2F, and SN2 dominates for Cl(-) + CH3CH2Cl, while syn-E2 is in all cases the least favorable pathway. Best overall agreement with our ab initio benchmark is obtained by representatives from each of the three categories of functionals, GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid DFT, with mean absolute errors in, for example, central barriers of 4.3 (OPBE), 2.2 (M06-L), and 2.0 kcal/mol (M06), respectively.

OLYP and B3LYP have somewhat higher mean absolute errors in central barriers (5.6 and 4.8 kcal/mol, respectively), but the error distribution is somewhat more uniform, and as a consequence, the correct trends are reproduced.

Pulled fronts are fronts that propagate into an unstable state, and the asymptotic front speed is equal to the linear spreading speed v(*) of small linear perturbations about the unstable state. In this paper, we study the front propagation in a simple stochastic lattice model. A detailed analysis of the microscopic picture of the front dynamics shows that for the description of the far tip of the front, one has to abandon the idea of a uniformly translating front solution. The lattice and finite particle effects lead to a \"stop-and-go\" type dynamics at the far tip of the front, while the average front behind it \"crosses over\" to a uniformly translating solution. In this formulation, the effect of stochasticity on the asymptotic front speed is coded in the probability distribution of the times required for the advancement of the \"foremost bin.\" We derive expressions of these probability distributions by matching the solution of the far tip with the uniformly translating solution behind. This matching includes various correlation effects in a mean-field type approximation. Our results for the probability distributions compare well to the results of stochastic numerical simulations. This approach also allows us to deal with much smaller values of N than it is required to have the ln(-2)N asymptotics to be valid. Furthermore, we show that if one insists on using a uniformly translating solution for the entire front ignoring its breakdown at the far tip, then one can obtain a simple expression for the corrections to the front speed for finite values of N, in which various subdominant contributions have a clear physical interpretation.",

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies.

For sigma&gt;1, the force is asymptotically irrelevant (with respect to the noise), and the asymptotics of P0(t) are those of a free random walker. For sigma&lt;1, the noise is (dangerously) irrelevant and the asymptotics of P0(t) can be extracted from a weak noise limit within a path-integral formalism employing the Onsager-Machlup functional. The case sigma=1, corresponding to a logarithmic potential, is most interesting because the noise is exactly marginal. In this case, P0(t) decays as a power law, P0(t) approximately t(-straight theta) with an exponent straight theta that depends continuously on the ratio of the strength of the potential to the strength of the noise. This case, with d=2, is relevant to the annihilation dynamics of a vortex-antivortex pair in the two-dimensional XY model. Although the noise is multiplicative in the latter case, the relevant Langevin equation can be transformed to the standard form discussed in the first part of the paper. The mean annihilation time for a pair initially separated by r is given by t(r) approximately r(2) ln(r/a) where a is a microscopic cutoff (the vortex core size). Implications for the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the system are discussed and compared to numerical simulation results.",

The WP-EQM calculations include all total angular momenta up to J(max) = 50, and therefore the various dynamical observables are converged up to 0.6 eV. It has been found that it is necessary to include all Coriolis couplings to obtain reliable converged results. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods are thoroughly compared as a function of the total energy for a series of J values. Comparisons are also made of total reaction cross sections as function of the collision energy, and rate constants. In addition, opacity functions, integral cross sections (ICS) and differential cross sections (DCS) are presented at 102 meV, 201.3 meV and 524.6 meV collision energy. The agreement between the three sets of results is only qualitative. The QCT calculations fail to describe the overall reactivity and most of the dynamical observables correctly. At low collision energies, the QCT method is plagued by the lack of conservation of zero point energy, whilst at higher collision energies and/or total angular momenta, the appearance of an effective repulsive potential associated with the centrifugal motion \"over\" the well causes a substantial decrease of the reactivity. In turn, the statistical models overestimate the reactivity over the whole range of collision energies as compared with the WP-EQM method. Specifically, at sufficiently high collision energies the reaction cannot be deemed to be statistical and important dynamical effects seem to be present. In general the WP-EQM results lie in between those obtained using the QCT and SQCT methods. One of the main, unexpected, conclusions of this work is that an accurate description of the reaction and of its various dynamical features requires a computationally expensive, accurate quantum mechanical treatment.",

In these systems, the variable θ presents values much higher than those of typical room temperatures T, so that the thermal noise can be neglected (T/θ≃0). The whole procedure was developed for an equilibrium state obtained after a sufficiently long-time evolution, associated with a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and approached due to a confining external harmonic potential, ϕ(x)=αx^{2}/2 (α&gt;0).

The manipulations make full use of the internal symmetries of the reduced two-electron Hamiltonians such that the asymptotic behaviors of the wave functions emerge naturally. The results show that, at the coalescence point of two electrons, the wave functions of the DCG Hamiltonian are regular, while those of the DC and DCB Hamiltonians have weak singularities of the type r(12)(ν) with ν being negative and of O(α(2)). The behaviors of the MDC wave functions are related to the original ones in a simple manner, while the spin-free counterparts are somewhat different due to the complicated electron-electron interaction. The behaviors of the ZORA wave functions depend on the chosen potential in the kinetic energy operator. In the case of the nuclear attraction, the behaviors of the ZORA wave functions are very similar to those of the nonrelativistic ones, just with an additional correction of O(α(2)) to the nonrelativistic cusp condition. However, if the Coulomb interaction is also included, the ZORA wave functions become close to the large-large components of the DC wave functions. Note that such asymptotic expansions of the relativistic wave functions are only valid within an extremely small convergence radius R(c) of O(α(2)). Beyond this radius, the behaviors of the relativistic wave functions are still dominated by the nonrelativistic limit, as can be seen in terms of direct perturbation theory (DPT) of relativity. However, as the two limits α → 0 and r(12) → 0 do not commute, DPT is doomed to fail due to incorrect descriptions of the small-small component Ψ(SS) of the DC wave function for r(12) &lt; R(c). Another deduction from the possible divergence of Ψ(SS) at r(12) = R(c) is that the DC Hamiltonian has no bound electronic states, although the last word cannot be said. These findings enrich our understandings of relativistic wave functions. On the practical side, it is shown that, under the no-pair approximation, relativistic explicitly correlated wave function methods can be made completely parallel to the nonrelativistic counterparts, as demonstrated explicitly for MP2-F12. Yet, this can only be achieved by using an extended no-pair projector.",

Its derivative at contact agrees very well with our simulations for D=2 . For jammed states, the expression predicts that the number of exact contacts is equal to 2D, in agreement with established simulations. When the particles are wetted, they interact by the formation and rupture of liquid capillary bridges. Since formation and rupture events of capillary bonds are well separated in configuration space, the interaction is hysteretic with a characteristic energy loss Ecb. The pair correlation is strongly affected by this capillary interaction depending on the liquid-bond status of neighboring particles. A theory is derived for the nonequilibrium probability currents of the capillary interaction which determines the pair correlation function near contact. This finally yields an analytic expression for the equation of state, P=P(N/V,T), of wet granular matter for D=2, valid in the complete density range from gas to jamming. Driven wet granular matter exhibits a van der Waals-like unstable branch at granular temperatures T&lt;Tc corresponding to a first order segregation transition of clusters. For the realistic rupture length of the liquid bridge, scrit=0.07d, the critical point is located at Tc=0.274Ecb. While the critical temperature weakly depends on the rupture length, the critical density phic is shown to scale with scrit according to scrit=4d(sqrt[phiJ/phic]-1). The segregation transition is closely related to the precipitation of granular droplets reported for the free cooling of one-dimensional wet granular matter [A. Fingerle and S. Herminghaus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 078001 (2006)], and extends the effect to higher dimensional systems. Since the limiting case of sticky bonds, Ecb&gt;&gt;T, is of relevance for aggregation in general, simulations have been performed which show very good agreement with the theoretically predicted coordination K of capillary bonds as a function of the bond length scrit. This result implies that particles that stick at the surface, scrit=0, form isostatic clusters. An extension of the theory in which the bridge coordination number K plays the role of a self-consistent mean-field is proposed.",

In the case of four-dimensional space, we show the bounce action is generically larger than 24/λ_{cr}, where λ_{cr}≡max[-4V(ϕ)/|ϕ|^{4}] with the false vacuum being at ϕ=0 and V(0)=0. We derive this bound on the bounce action without solving the equation of motion explicitly. Our bound is derived by a quite simple discussion, and it provides useful information even if it is difficult to obtain the explicit form of the bounce solution. Our bound offers a sufficient condition for the stability of a false vacuum, and it is useful as a quick check on the vacuum stability for given models.

Still, a common problem is the interaction between particles and fields due to their different formal description. Particle interactions are discrete, pointlike events while field dynamics is described with continuous partial-differential equations of motion. A workaround is the use of effective theories like the Langevin equation with the drawback of energy conservation violation. We present a method, which allows us to model noncontinuous interactions between particles and scalar fields, allowing us to simulate scattering-like interactions which exchange discrete \"quanta\" of energy and momentum between fields and particles while obeying energy and momentum conservation and allowing control over interaction strengths and times. In this paper we apply this method to different model systems, starting with a simple harmonic oscillator, which is damped by losing discrete energy quanta. The second and third system consists of an oscillator and a one-dimensional field, which are damped via discrete energy loss and are coupled to a stochastic force, leading to equilibrium states which correspond to statistical Langevin-like systems. The last example is a scalar field in (1 + 3) space-time dimensions, which is coupled to a microcanonical ensemble of particles by incorporating particle production and annihilation processes. Obeying the detailed-balance principle, the system equilibrates to thermal and chemical equilibrium with dynamical fluctuations on the fields, generated dynamically by the discrete interactions. ",

For this model, it is known that P(t) follows a power-law decay with time, P(t) approximately t(-theta(q)), where theta(q) is the q-dependent persistence exponent. We study the spatial structure of the persistent region within the MMFA. We show that the persistent site pair correlation function P2(r,t) has the scaling form P2(r,t)=P(t)(2)f(r/t(1/2)) for all values of the persistence exponent theta(q).

However, this assumption may not always hold, particularly in human MRI where the diffusion-encoding gradient duration delta is typically of the same order of magnitude as the time offset Delta between encoding gradients. In this case, finite-delta effects complicate the interpretation of displacement probabilities measured in q-space MRI, and the form by which the signal intensity relates to them. By considering the displacement-specific dephasing, &lt;r/eiphi&gt;, of a set of spins accumulating a constant displacement vector r in the total time Delta+delta during which diffusion is encoded, the probability recovered by a finite-delta q-space experiment can be interpreted. It is shown theoretically that a data analysis using a modified q-space index q=gammadeltaetag, with gamma the gyromagnetic ratio and eta=square root (Delta-delta/3)/(Delta+delta), recovers the correct displacement probability distribution if diffusion is multi-Gaussian free diffusion. With this analysis, we show that the displacement distribution P(r,texp) is measured at the experimental diffusion-encoding time texp=Delta+delta, and not at the reduced diffusion time tr=Delta-delta/3 as is generally assumed in the NMR and MRI literature. It is also shown that, by defining a probability P(y,Delta) that a time t&lt;delta exists such that a displacement y occurs from time t to t+Delta, it is possible to describe the physical significance of the result obtained when we use the q-space formalism valid for infinitesimal delta when delta is not infinitesimal. These deductions were confirmed by simulations for homogeneous Gaussian diffusion and for heterogeneous diffusion in permeable microscopic Gaussian domains that are homogeneous on the microm scale. The results also hold for diffusion inside restricted spherical reflecting domains, but only if the radius of the domain is larger than a critical size. The simulations of the displacement-specific dephasing obtain that if delta&gt;deltac then eta is not equal to square root (Delta-delta/3)/(Delta+delta) which implies that we can no longer obtain the correct displacement probability from the displacement distribution. In the case that /g/=18 mT/m and Delta-delta=5 ms, the parameter deltac in ms is given by \"deltac=0.49a2+0.24\" where a is the sphere's radius expressed in microm. Simulation of q-space restricted diffusion MRI experiments indicate that if eta=square root (Delta-delta/3)/(Delta+delta), the recovered displacement probability is always better than the Gaussian approximation, and the measured diffusion coefficient matches the diffusion coefficient at time texp=Delta+delta better than it matches the diffusion coefficient at time tr=Delta-delta/3. These results indicate that q-space MRI measurements of displacement probability distributions are theoretically possible in biological tissues using finite-duration diffusion-encoding gradients provided certain compartment size and diffusion encoding gradient duration constraints are met.",

Applied here, it shows proton behavior consistent with ab initio calculations and empirical models specifically designed to describe proton transport. Both Eigen and Zundel complexes are observed in the simulations showing the Eigen-Zundel-Eigen-type mechanism. In addition to reproducing the short-time rattling of the excess proton between the two oxygens of Zundel complexes, a picosecond-scale lifetime was also found. These longer-lived H3O(+) ions are caused by the rapid conversion of the local solvation structure around the transferring proton from a Zundel-like form to an Eigen-like form following the transfer, effectively severing the path along which the proton can rattle. The migration of H(+) over long times (&gt;100 ps) deviates from the conventional short-time multiexponentially decaying lifetime autocorrelation model and follows the t(-3/2) power-law behavior.

This paper provides absolute intensity measurements, quantum efficiencies and signal-to-blackbody radiation ratios at peak emission wavelengths, at various temperatures (20-1400°C), for Y(2)O(3):Eu, YAG:Tb and YAG:Tm thermographic phosphors under 266 and 355 nm excitation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These terms are beneficial in a number of ways for engineers wanting to use a phosphor thermometry solution at high temperatures. They may also provide additional insight to the physical luminescence processes of phosphors at high temperatures. The phosphor signal:blackbody radiation ratio is useful because it combines the effects of blackbody radiation and phosphor emission intensities at various temperatures, providing a valuable quantitative evaluation that can be used as a design aid for phosphor selection. A figure of merit is the temperature when the blackbody radiation equals the phosphor emission (ratio = 1); this is the cross-over temperature at which the blackbody radiation rapidly starts to overtake and mask out phosphor emissions. To the best of our knowledge no such work exists previously. The results presented show a variation in phosphor intensity with increasing temperature, and although the intensity and quantum efficiencies for Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb were much greater than YAG:Tm at low temperatures, YAG:Tm was found to be the most efficient phosphor investigated at higher temperatures (&gt;900°C). With a peak emission wavelength of 458 nm, YAG:Tm experienced the lowest proportion of blackbody radiation therefore its advantage at higher temperatures was further amplified and was found to offer an advantage of approximately +350°C and +250°C increased upper temperature capability compared to Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb phosphors, respectively.",

These hot plasmas were obtained by additional electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), at the frequency of 140 Ghz, during the current ramp-up phase of the discharge. Injecting 400 kW on axis and 800 kW slightly off axis, the peak central electron temperature reached 8.0 and 7.0 keV, respectively, for a time much longer than the ionization equilibrium time of the molybdenum ions. X-ray emissions from rarely observed high charge states, Mo30+ to Mo39+, have been studied with moderate spectral resolution (lambda/delta lambda approximately 150) and a time resolution of 5 ms. A sophisticated collisional-radiative model for the study of molybdenum ions in plasmas with electron temperature in the range 4-20 keV is presented. The sensitivity of the x-ray emission to the temperature and to impurity transport processes is discussed. This model has been then used to investigate two different plasma scenarios. In the first regime the ECRH heating occurs on axis during the current ramp up phase, when the magnetic shear is evolving from negative to zero up to the half radius. The spectrum is well reproduced with the molybdenum ions in coronal equilibrium and with a central impurity peaking. In the second regime, at the beginning of the current flat top when magnetic shear is monotonic and sawtoothing activity is appearing, the lowest charge states (Mo33+ to Mo30+), populated off axis, are affected by anomalous transport and the total molybdenum profile is found to be flat up to the half radius.

The QDE at the lambda approximately 68-A peak is associated with a d-f resonant absorption feature of RbBr. QDE contributions of the photocathode material inside the channels, and on the interchannel web, have been determined. Measurements of the angular variation of the QDE from 0 degrees to 35 degrees to the channel axis are also presented. We describe a simple QDE model and show that its predictions are in accord with the QDE measurements. Preliminary assessment of the stability of RbBr indicates that no QDE degradation occurs after limited exposure (20 h) to air at low humidity (&lt;30%). Examination of the photocathode structure with an electron microscope reveals a rough surface with a scale of the order of 0.5 microm.",

However, special challenges arise when trying to design nanophotonic materials with precisely tailored optical properties that can operate at high-temperatures (&gt; 1,100 K). These include proper material selection and purity to prevent melting, evaporation, or chemical reactions; severe minimization of any material interfaces to prevent thermomechanical problems such as delamination; robust performance in the presence of surface diffusion; and long-range geometric precision over large areas with severe minimization of very small feature sizes to maintain structural stability. Here we report an approach for high-temperature nanophotonics that surmounts all of these difficulties. It consists of an analytical and computationally guided design involving high-purity tungsten in a precisely fabricated photonic crystal slab geometry (specifically chosen to eliminate interfaces arising from layer-by-layer fabrication) optimized for high performance and robustness in the presence of roughness, fabrication errors, and surface diffusion. It offers near-ultimate short-wavelength emittance and low, ultra-broadband long-wavelength emittance, along with a sharp cutoff offering 41 emittance contrast over 10% wavelength separation. This is achieved via Q-matching, whereby the absorptive and radiative rates of the photonic crystal's cavity resonances are matched. Strong angular emission selectivity is also observed, with short-wavelength emission suppressed by 50% at 75° compared to normal incidence. Finally, a precise high-temperature measurement technique is developed to confirm that emission at 1,225 K can be primarily confined to wavelengths shorter than the cutoff wavelength.",

However, the actual temperature distribution in the blackbody cavity is always nonisothermal; the emissivity calculated based on the isothermal model may not accurately present the radiation characteristic of the blackbody. In this study, the actual temperature distributions of two blackbodies (one has an extended cone shape, and the other a 65-mm diameter cylindrical shape) are measured, and the emissivities are calculated accordingly based on the nonisothermal model at a certain temperature (873 K). The results show there are different tendencies of temperature distributions in the two blackbodies. When compared with the isothermal model, the emissivities in the 873 K temperature and 2.0-20.0 µm wavelength condition are about 1.75% and 0.18% lower at the nonisothermal model for the extended cone shape and cylindrical blackbodies, respectively. To improve the emissivity, different types of apertures are customized for the two blackbodies. For the extended cone-shaped blackbody, the emissivity in the 873 K temperature and 2.0-20.0 µm wavelength condition increases by 1.12% when using a ring-shaped graphite aperture in the cavity, whereas for the cylindrical-shaped blackbody, the emissivity in the same condition increases by 0.09% when using a high-reflective aperture in front of the cavity opening.

These factors provide clear guidelines to the choice of source frequency and applicator geometry that are favorable for intrinsic control of thermal runaway.

The thermal broadening of the bands are interpreted, in both cases, as a homogeneous component, due to the presence of linear electron-phonon coupling, plus an inhomogeneous component, due to both statistical energy fluctuations at each pigment site and heterogeneity of the sample itself. Sub-bands analysis, in which eight major components are identified, yields a reorganization energy 9 cm(-1) &lt; or = Svm &lt; or = 14 cm(-1) and an inhomogeneous contribution in the range 120-170 cm(-1). In all cases the bands are substantially symmetrical in the 70-300 K temperature range.

Analysis of the total absorption band yields Svm approximately 70 cm(-1); however, this high value is reduced to Svm approximately 11-20 cm(-1) when the red-most sub-band, with maximum at 684 nm, is eliminated at all temperatures.

The approach involves solving the corresponding Dirichlet problem H(R)Psi(R)=E(R)Psi(R) on a finite interval [-R,R] by the Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory (RSPT). The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k). The summation of the latter series with large lambda for the octic case is considered as an extremely challenging summation problem, in part, since it was rigorously proven that the Padé approximants cannot converge and the two-point Padé approximants, which combine information of the renormalized weak coupling and strong coupling expansions, give relatively good results. The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Padé approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda. The coefficients E((k))(R) are calculated with the eigenvalue series of an operator H(Rn), whose resolvent converges to that of H(R) as n--&gt; infinity. The Padé approximants of the RSPT eigenfunction series Psi(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)psi((k))(R)lambda(k) also provide accurate results for the octic oscillator.",

The sum of the initial terms of the asymptotic series up to, and including, the least term often furnishes a fair approximation to the desired value of the function being evaluated. It was early observed by computers that if the terms of the asymptotic series alternate in sign, this approximation was often improved by replacing the least term by its half. The factor by which the least term of the asymptotic series must be multiplied so that the true value of the function being evaluated is obtained by addition of this modified least term to the remaining initial terms of the asymptotic series is known as the converging factor for the asymptotic series. The converging factor for the asymptotic series involved in the calculation of the exponential integral, for large negative values of the argument, was given as a power series in the reciprocal of the argument by Airey; the first term of this series is (1/2).

The occasional maxima of the ratios S(n)/S(n) are surprisingly large and the problem is to estimate the extent of their probable fluctuations.Specifically, let S(n) (*) = (S(n) - b(n))/a(n), where {a(n)} and {b(n)}, two numerical sequences.

No assumptions concerning the under-lying distributions are made; the criteria explain structurally which features of {X(n)} affect the fluctuations, but for concrete results something about P{S(n)&gt;a(n)} must be known.

The N  =  1 case has been extensively studied for velocity fluctuations (m  =  1) and to a lesser extent for m  &gt;  1. The averaging method in case of N  &gt;  1 diverges from the Kolmogorov framework and has not been studied because fluctuations in [Formula: see text] are expected to smooth with increasing N leaving behind uninteresting large-scale mean flow information, but we find this is not so. We report the evolution of scaling exponents [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text] in going from a single (N  =  1) to a spatial average over several Eulerian points ([Formula: see text]). Our 3D experiments in a tank with rotating jets at the floor show [Formula: see text] for all m-values in agreement with prior results and evolves to an asymptotic value of [Formula: see text].

Our 24 squares identity leads to a different formula for Ramanujan's tau function tau(n), when n is odd. These results arise in the setting of Jacobi elliptic functions, Jacobi continued fractions, Hankel or Turánian determinants, Fourier series, Lambert series, inclusion/exclusion, Laplace expansion formula for determinants, and Schur functions. We have also obtained many additional infinite families of identities in this same setting that are analogous to the eta-function identities in appendix I of Macdonald's work [Macdonald, I. G. (1972) Invent. Math. 15, 91-143]. A special case of our methods yields a proof of the two conjectured [Kac, V. G. and Wakimoto, M. (1994) in Progress in Mathematics, eds. Brylinski, J.-L., Brylinski, R., Guillemin, V. &amp; Kac, V.

Our 16 and 24 squares identities were originally obtained via multiple basic hypergeometric series, Gustafson's C(l) nonterminating (6)phi(5) summation theorem, and Andrews' basic hypergeometric series proof of Jacobi's 4 and 8 squares identities. We have (elsewhere) applied symmetry and Schur function techniques to this original approach to prove the existence of similar infinite families of sums of squares identities for n(2) or n(n + 1) squares, respectively. Our sums of more than 8 squares identities are not the same as the formulas of Mathews (1895), Glaisher (1907), Ramanujan (1916), Mordell (1917, 1919), Hardy (1918, 1920), Kac and Wakimoto, and many others.",

E 76, 051202 (2007)] to obtain the exact solution of the Percus-Yevick equation for a fluid of hard spheres in (odd) d dimensions is used to investigate the convergence properties of the resulting virial series. This is done both for the virial and compressibility routes, in which the virial coefficients B(j) are expressed in terms of the solution of a set of (d-1)/2 coupled algebraic equations which become nonlinear for d&gt;/=5. Results have been derived up to d=13. A confirmation of the alternating character of the series for d&gt;/=5, due to the existence of a branch point on the negative real axis, is found and the radius of convergence is explicitly determined for each dimension. The resulting scaled density per dimension 2eta(1/d), where eta is the packing fraction, is wholly consistent with the limiting value of 1 for d--&gt;infinity. Finally, the values for B(j) predicted by the virial and compressibility routes in the Percus-Yevick approximation are compared with the known exact values [N. Clisby and B. M. McCoy, J. Stat.

We demonstrate that z is equal to the ratio of two consecutive Mean Y (the estimation of the steady state oxygen production based on local properties) found by three sigma analysis. The quantity z is useful for computing double-hits, and for showing the inactivation/activation processes of PS II complexes. Three sigma analysis assumes z=1 exactly; since this is not verified, it is argued that four sigma analysis is closer to the real workings of the water oxidizing complex. Oxygen evolution can then be interpreted in the frame of a modified Kok's model where the sum of the probabilities equals z. We therefore suggest that the closer fitting of four sigma analysis to oxygen production data is not simply due to an extra, unnecessary variable, but to the fact that PS II complexes can be inactivated and reactivated under flashing light. Finally, in order to facilitate the use of four sigma analysis, a computer program is made available upon request. ",

In particular, we investigated the effect of the relative size of the subtrahend on performance in both formats. We found a significant interaction between format, the magnitude of the subtrahend (S) compared to the difference (D) (S&gt;D vs. S&lt;D), and the numerical distance between subtrahend and difference. When the subtrahend was larger than the difference and S and D were far from each other (e.g., 12-9=.), problems were solved faster in the addition than in the subtraction format; when the subtrahend was smaller than the difference and S and D were far from each other (e.g., 12-3=.), problems were solved faster in the subtraction than in the addition format. However, when the subtrahend and the difference were close to each other (e.g., 13-7=.), there were no significant reaction time differences between both formats. These results suggest that adults do not rely exclusively and routinely on addition to solve large single-digit subtractions, but select either addition-based or subtraction-based strategies depending on the relative size of the subtrahend.",

The commonly used method for extracting the shoulder point is to calculate the fourth derivative of the pulse waveform by numerical differentiation. However, this method has a poor anti-noise capability and is computationally intensive. The aims of this study were to develop a new method based on the 2nd-order B-spline wavelet for calculating AIx, and to compare it with numerical differentiation and Savitzky-Golay digital differentiator (SGDD). All the three methods were applied to pulse waveforms derived from 60 healthy subjects. There was a significantly high correlation between the proposed method and numerical differentiation (r=0.998 for carotid pulses, and r=0.997 for radial pulses), as well as between the proposed method and the SGDD (r=0.995 for carotid pulses, and r=0.993 for radial pulses). In addition, the anti-noise capability of the proposed method was evaluated by adding simulated noise (&gt;10Hz) on pulse waveforms. The results showed that the proposed method was advantageous in noise tolerance than the other two methods. These findings indicate that the proposed method can quickly and accurately calculate AIx with a good anti-noise capability. ",

The model yields an exact closure equation for the four-point correlation Ψ{4} of ψ, which may be casted into the form of an eigenvalue problem in the similarity range. The analysis of the eigenvalue problem gives not only the scale dependence of Ψ{4} , but also the dependence on the configuration of the four points. The numerical analysis gives S4(R)∝R{ζ{4}} in the similarity range in which S2(R)∝R{ζ{2}} , where S_{N} is the structure function defined by S{N}(R)≡⟨[ψ(x+R)-ψ(x)]{N} and ζ{4}≠2ζ{2} . The estimate of ζ_{4} by the numerical analysis of the eigenvalue problem is in good agreement with numerical simulations so far reported. The agreement supports the idea of universality of the exponent ζ{4} in the sense that ζ_{4} is insensitive to conditions of ψ outside the similarity range. The numerical analysis also shows that the correlation C(R,r)≡[ψ(x+R)-ψ(x)]{2}[ψ(x+r)-ψ(x)]{2}&gt; is stronger than that given by the joint-normal approximation, and scales like C(R,r)∝(r/R){χ} for r/R&lt;&lt;1 with R and r in the similarity range, where χ is a constant depending on the angle between R and r .",

The z-multiplier is typically chosen at the 95% probability level, being 1.96 in the absence of SE is of considerable magnitude (one-sided 95% probability). Up to now, no SE/RE ratio dependent z-values have been considered. Here, we present z-values for SE/RE ratios ranging from 0 to 1. The z-multiplier (95% probability level) was empirically obtained by modulation of the standard normal distribution with the EXCEL NORMDIST function (Microsoft EXCEL 2002). In total, five distributions representing SE/RE ratios between 0 and 1 were calculated, so that the total probability outside a TE boundary +/- 1.96 sigma was in the order of 5.013%. For distributions with SE/RE ratios ranging from 0 to 1 that satisfy the aforementioned total probability outside a TE boundary +/- 1.96 sigma, we found that the associated z-multipliers exhibit values from 1.96 (SE/RE = 0), 1.769 (SE/RE = 0.25), 1.68 (SE/RE = 0.5), 1.651 (SE/RE = 0.75) TO 1.645 (SE/RE = 1).

The results show that at SE/RE ratios &gt; 0.75 the one-sided 95% probability level is practically reached.

In particular, we focus on the effects due to the sudden disappearance of the image potential in the neutralization process. From the analysis, we found that the neutralization probability is given by [Formula: see text], where D and Γ are the band width and the gamma function. The factor α = 2δ/π-(δ/π)(2) is given by the phase shift (δ: phase shift on Fermi surface), and the energy difference between the initial and final states, Δ, includes the kinetic energy of the ion and various other phenomenological factors. The singularity caused from the sudden disappearance of the image potential enhances or reduces the neutralization probability depending on the symmetry of atomic orbital of the ion. When the ion velocity is too fast to form an image potential, the neutralization process would proceed without the creation of an image potential, accompanying an excitation of a surface plasmon; as a result of plasmon excitation the ion velocity becomes slower than the plasma frequency because of screening effects.

We show evidence of an anomaly to the behaviour of the proton's electric generalized polarizability that contradicts the predictions of nuclear theory and derive its signature in the spatial distribution of the induced polarization in the proton. The reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear theory.",

Ground and Photoactive States of the Proton-Wire in the Green Fluorescent Protein.\nIn this paper an EVB-based method to describe the energetics of operation of arbitrary-length heterogeneous proton-wires is described. The method keeps the number of fittable parameters low by exploiting the idea of \"protonation states\". The method is applied to describe the 3-proton proton-wire described in Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and two sets of parameters have been obtained, one for the electronic ground state and another for the photoactive excited electronic state, of a chemical model including the groups supporting the proton-wire and based on CASPT2//CASSCF quality reference energies. The fitted EVB functions are analyzed in static terms. In this way, it is seen that only a minimum exists in S0 while two exist in S1: one for the photoproduct and one for the reactant in the excited state, even though consideration of the Franck-Condon excitation energy predicts an effective barrier under 1 kcal mol(-1). Topological analysis of the transition state structure reveals a concerted but asynchronous motion of the protons, where the chromophore's proton lags behind, and the final proton of the wire that goes from Ser205 to Glu222 leads the process. Inclusion of nuclear dynamic efects causes this small effective barrier to vanish and predicts an essentially barrierless process in the excited state. ",

While originally developed for gas-phase molecules and bulk liquid water, the potential is transferrable to nanoconfinement and interface scenarios. Applied here, it shows proton behavior consistent with ab initio calculations and empirical models specifically designed to describe proton transport. Both Eigen and Zundel complexes are observed in the simulations showing the Eigen-Zundel-Eigen-type mechanism. In addition to reproducing the short-time rattling of the excess proton between the two oxygens of Zundel complexes, a picosecond-scale lifetime was also found. These longer-lived H3O(+) ions are caused by the rapid conversion of the local solvation structure around the transferring proton from a Zundel-like form to an Eigen-like form following the transfer, effectively severing the path along which the proton can rattle. The migration of H(+) over long times (&gt;100 ps) deviates from the conventional short-time multiexponentially decaying lifetime autocorrelation model and follows the t(-3/2) power-law behavior. The potential function employed here matches many of the features of proton transport observed in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations as well as the highly developed empirical valence bond models, yet is computationally very efficient, enabling longer time and larger systems to be studied.",

We propose the concise terms core for the primary beam, halo (see Pedroni et al 2005 Phys. Med. Biol. 50 541-61) for the low dose region from charged secondaries, aura for the low dose region from neutrals, and spray for beam contamination. We have measured the dose distribution in a water tank at 177 MeV under conditions where spray, therefore radial asymmetry, is negligible. We used an ADCL calibrated thimble chamber and a Faraday cup calibrated integral beam monitor so as to obtain immediately the absolute dose per proton. We took depth scans at fixed distances from the beam centroid rather than radial scans at fixed depths. That minimizes the signal range for each scan and better reveals the structure of the core and halo. Transitions from core to halo to aura are already discernible in the raw data. The halo has components attributable to coherent and incoherent nuclear reactions. Due to elastic and inelastic scattering by the nuclear force, the Bragg peak persists to radii larger than can be accounted for by Molière single scattering. The radius of the incoherent component, a dose bump around midrange, agrees with the kinematics of knockout reactions. We have fitted the data in two ways. The first is algebraic or model dependent (MD) as far as possible, and has 25 parameters. The second, using 2D cubic spline regression, is model independent. Optimal parameterization for treatment planning will probably be a hybrid of the two, and will of course require measurements at several incident energies. The MD fit to the core term resembles that of the PSI group (Pedroni et al 2005), which has been widely emulated. However, we replace their T(w), a mass stopping power which mixes electromagnetic (EM) and nuclear effects, with one that is purely EM, arguing that protons that do not undergo hard single scatters continue to lose energy according to the Beth-Bloch formula. If that is correct, it is no longer necessary to measure T(w), and the dominant role played by the 'Bragg peak chamber' vanishes.

Second, to show that the SSC requires that T(x) be nonlocal: Besides material properties and energy at the point of interest, it must depend in some fashion on how much multiple scattering has already taken place. Third, after reviewing five previous formulas (three local and two nonlocal), to derive an improved \"differential Molière\" formula T(dM). Last, to investigate, by studying some practical cases, when an accurate formula for T is actually needed. We first take the numerical derivative of the Molière/Fano/Hanson (theta2) in order to find the true SSC. We simplify the formula for T(IC) (ICRU Report 35) for protons, introducing a new material dependent property, the \"scattering length\" X(s), analogous to radiation length X(0). We then use T(IC) as a basis for T(dM) by including a nonlocal correction factor fdM which, by virtue of the Øverås approximation, parametrizes the single scattering correction. The improved scattering power is T(dM)[triple band]f(dM)(pv,p1v1) x (E(s)/pv)(2)1/X(s) where fdM 0.5244+0.1975 lg(1-(pv/p1v1)2)+0.2320 lg(pv)-0.0098 lg(pv)lg(1-(pv/p1v1)2), P1v1 (MeV) is the initial product of proton momentum and speed, pv is the same at the point of interest, and E(s) = 15.0 MeV. T(dM) is easily computed and generalizes readily to mixed slabs because fdM is not material dependent. Whether an accurate formula for T is required depends very much on the problem at hand. For beam spreading in water, five of the six formulas for T give almost identical results, suggesting that patient dose calculations are insensitive to T. That is not true, however, of beam spreading in Pb. At the opposite extreme, the projected rms beam width at the end of a Pb/Lexan/air stack, analogous to the upstream modulator in a passive beam spreading system, is sensitive to T. In this case a simple experiment would discriminate between all but two of the six formulas discussed. Scattering power applies as much to Monte Carlo as to deterministic transport calculations. Using T in any of its forms will avoid step size dependence. Using the best available T could be important in general purpose Monte Carlo codes, which are expected to give the correct answer to many different problems.",

Both one- and many-body contributions to the nuclear current operator are included. The former retain for the first time, besides the 1/m leading order contribution (m is the nucleon mass), also the next-to-leading order term, proportional to 1/m^{3}. The many-body currents are constructed in order to satisfy the current conservation relation with the adopted Hamiltonian model. The hyperspherical harmonics technique is applied to solve the A=3 bound and scattering states. Particular attention is paid in this second case in order to obtain, in the energy range of BBN, an uncertainty on the astrophysical S factor of the order or below ∼1%. Then, in this energy range, the S factor is found to be ∼10% larger than the currently adopted values. Part of this increase (1%-3%) is due to the 1/m^{3} one-body operator, while the remaining is due to the new more accurate scattering wave functions. We have studied the implication of this new determination for the d(p,γ)^{3}He S factor on the deuterium primordial abundance. We find that the predicted theoretical value for ^{2}H/H is in excellent agreement with its experimental determination, using the most recent determination of the baryon density of the Planck experiment, and with a standard number of relativistic degrees of freedom N_{eff}=3.046 during primordial nucleosynthesis.

We explore the asymptotic limits of long-range and short-range potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical model to explain the general and asymptotic limits for the probability distribution in both real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering potential much larger than the probe size cause the bright field (BF) disk to deflect uniformly, while features much smaller than the probe size, instead of a deflection, cause a redistribution of intensity within the BF disk.

The shape profiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging are dominated by the shape of the probe gradient and not the highly singular atomic potentials or their local fields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic number sensitivity, whose precise dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence angles, the contrast oscillates with increasing atomic number, similar to BF imaging.

During the ionization process, neutral clusters suffer little fragmentation because almost all excess energy above the vertical ionization energy is taken away by the photoelectron, leaving only a small part of the photon energy deposited into the (HCOOH)n+1+ cluster. The vertical ionization energy minus the adiabatic ionization energy is enough excess energy in the clusters to surmount the proton transfer energy barrier and induce the reaction (HCOOH)n+1+--&gt;(HCOOH)nH+ +HCOO making the protonated (HCOOH)nH+ series dominant in all data obtained. The distribution of pure (HCOOH)nH+ clusters is dependent on experimental conditions. Under certain conditions, a magic number is found at n=5. Metastable dissociation rate constants of (HCOOH)nH+ are measured in the range (0.1-0.8)x10(4) s(-1) for cluster sizes 4&lt;n&lt;9. The rate constants display an odd/even alternating behavior between monomer and dimer loss that can be attributed to the structure of the cluster.

In the experimental part, isolated adenine ions have been formed by electro-spray ionisation, stored, mass-selected and cooled in a Paul trap and dissociated by resonant photoexcitation with ns UV laser pulses. The S(0)-S1 spectrum of protonated adenine recorded by fragment ion detection lies in a similar energy range as the first pipi* transition of neutral 9H-adenine. It shows a flat onset with a broad substructure, indicating a large S(0)-S1 geometry shift and an ultra-short lifetime. In the theoretical part, relative energies of the ground and the excited states of the most important tautomers have been calculated by means of a combined density functional theory and multi-reference configuration interaction approach. Protonation at the nitrogen in position 1 of the neutral 9H-adenine tautomer yields the most stable protonated adenine species, 1H-9H-A+. The 3H-7H-A+ and the 3H-9H-A+ tautomers, formed by protonation of 7H- and 9H-adenine in 3-position, are higher in energy by 162 cm(-1) and 688 cm(-1), respectively. Other tautomers lie at considerably higher energies. Calculated vertical absorption spectra are reported for all investigated tautomers whereas geometry optimisations of excited states have been carried out only for the most interesting ones. The S1 state energies and geometries are found to depend on the protonation site. The theoretical data match best with the experimental onset of the spectrum for the 1H-9H-A+ tautomer although we cannot definitely exclude contributions to the experimental spectrum from the 3H-7H-A+ tautomer at higher energies. The vertical S(0)--&gt; S1 excitation energy is similar to the one in neutral 9H-adenine.

The WP-EQM calculations include all total angular momenta up to J(max) = 50, and therefore the various dynamical observables are converged up to 0.6 eV. It has been found that it is necessary to include all Coriolis couplings to obtain reliable converged results. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods are thoroughly compared as a function of the total energy for a series of J values. Comparisons are also made of total reaction cross sections as function of the collision energy, and rate constants. In addition, opacity functions, integral cross sections (ICS) and differential cross sections (DCS) are presented at 102 meV, 201.3 meV and 524.6 meV collision energy. The agreement between the three sets of results is only qualitative. The QCT calculations fail to describe the overall reactivity and most of the dynamical observables correctly. At low collision energies, the QCT method is plagued by the lack of conservation of zero point energy, whilst at higher collision energies and/or total angular momenta, the appearance of an effective repulsive potential associated with the centrifugal motion \"over\" the well causes a substantial decrease of the reactivity. In turn, the statistical models overestimate the reactivity over the whole range of collision energies as compared with the WP-EQM method. Specifically, at sufficiently high collision energies the reaction cannot be deemed to be statistical and important dynamical effects seem to be present. In general the WP-EQM results lie in between those obtained using the QCT and SQCT methods. One of the main, unexpected, conclusions of this work is that an accurate description of the reaction and of its various dynamical features requires a computationally expensive, accurate quantum mechanical treatment.",

In this method, the absolute binding free energy of a ligand is estimated as deltaGbind = alpha&lt;Vel(bound) - Vel(free)&gt; + beta&lt;Vvdw(bound) - Vvdw(free)&gt;, where Vel(bound) and Vvdw(bound) are the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies between the ligand and the solvated protein from an molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory with ligand bound to protein and Vel(free) and Vel(free) and Vvdw(free) are the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies between the ligand and the water from an MD trajectory with the ligand in water. A set of values, alpha = 0.5 and beta = 0.16, was found to give results in good agreement with experimental data. Later, however, different optimal values of beta were found in studies of compounds binding to P450cam and avidin. The present work investigates how the optimal value of beta depends on the nature of binding sites for different protein-ligand interactions. By examining seven ligands interacting with five proteins, we have discovered a linear correlation between the value of beta and the weighted non-polar desolvation ratio (WNDR), with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. We have also examined the ability of this correlation to predict optimal values of beta for different ligands binding to a single protein. We studied twelve neutral compounds bound to avidin. In this case, the WNDR approach gave a better estimate of the absolute binding free energies than results obtained using the fixed value of beta found for biotin-avidin. In terms of reproducing the relative binding free energy to biotin, the fixed-beta value gave better results for compounds similar to biotin, but for compounds less similar to biotin, the WNDR approach led to better relative binding free energies.",

Vibronic coupling parameters were calculated and compared with those of the coordination number (CN) 3. Inspecting the correlation between the chemical hardness and the vibronic coupling energy (hardness rule), it is found that the tendency to distort decreases with increasing CN. While all considered molecules AX(3) (A(III) = P to Bi; X(-) = F to I) undergo lone pair deformations (D(3h)---&gt; C(3v)), only part of the AX(4)(-) and BX(4) species (B(IV) = S to Po) do so (T(d)---&gt; C(2v)-and even less the ones with CN = 5 (D(3h)---&gt; C(2v) (congruent with C(4v)), AX(5)(2-), BX(5)(-), and CF(5) (C(V); Cl to I).

A further symmetry lowering to C(s) occurs, if the central ion becomes too small with respect to the ligands (ionic size influence, PCl(Br)(4)(-), PCl(5)(2-)), with the tendency to reduce the CN toward 3 + 1 and 4 + 1, respectively. For CN = 4 the various stationary points of, for example, compressed and elongated C(3v), C(4v), etc. in the multidimensional ground-state potential surface have been characterized. Though of higher energy than the absolute C(2v) minimum, they are shown to govern the dynamics and reactivity of the CN = 4 species to a large extent. To simulate the chemical environment (positively charged counterions, polar solvents), the DFT calculations were performed using the polarizable continuum model COSMO (conductor-like screening model). Though the electronic energy gain upon distortion is not significantly affected by the solvent, the total stabilization energy is distinctly enhanced, frequently leading to lone pair deformations of otherwise electronically stable species.

This applies for VIF pictures as one-electron Hamiltonian operators as well as VIF pictures as one-electron density operators that constitute a new implementation of the VIF method simpler in its application and more accurate in its results than previous approaches. A procedure for estimating elements of the effective charge density-bond order matrix, Pmunu, from electron configurations in atoms is presented, and it is shown how these lead to loop and line constants in the VIF picture. From these structural formulas, one finds the number of singly, doubly, and unoccupied molecular orbitals, as well as the number of molecular orbitals with energy lower, equal, and higher than -1/2Eh, the negative of the hydrogen atom's ionization energy. The VIF results for water are in qualitative agreement with MP2/6311++G3df3pd, MO energy levels where the simple VIF for water presented in the earlier literature does not agree with computed energy levels. The method presented here gives the simplest accurate VIF pictures for hydrocarbons. It is shown how VIF can be used to predict thermal barriers to chemical reactions. Insertion of singlet carbene into H2 is given as an example. VIF pictures as one-electron density operators describe the ground-state multiplicities of B2, N2, and O2 molecules and as one-electron Hamiltonian operators give the correct electronegativity trend across period two. Previous implementations of VIF do not indicate singly occupied molecular orbitals directly from the pictorial VIF rules for these examples. The direct comparison between structural formulas that represent electron density and those that represent energy is supported by comparison of a simple electronegativity scale, chiD=N/n2, with well-known electronegativity scales of Pauling, Mulliken, and Allen. This scale comes from the method used to calculate Pmumu for sp3 hybridized period-two elements and is comparable to electronegativity because it has the same form as &lt;1/r&gt; for hydrogenic orbitals. It therefore provides a physical basis for the representation of one electron density and Hamiltonian operators by the same VIF picture.",

The X(1)Σ(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 Å), whereas the A(1)Π state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 Å). The X(1)Σ(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;μ&gt;(υ), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)Π.

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface. Rate constants calculated with the CVBMM surface agree with the MPW54 rate constants within 12% for 534-2000 K and within 23% for 200-491 K.

For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant.

By taking care of both the unique structural features and the catalytic activity of human caspase-2, the critical enzyme residues (E217, R378, N379, T380, and Y420) with the peptide inhibitor are treated at QM level (the Self-Consistent-Charge Density-Functional Tight-Binding method with the Dispersion correction (SCC-DFTB-D)), while the remaining part of the complex is treated at MM level (AMBER force field). The QM/MM binding free energies (BFEs) are well-correlated with the experimental observations and indicate that caspase-2 uniquely prefers a penta-peptide such as VDVAD. The sequence of VDVAD is varied in a systematic fashion by considering the physicochemical properties of every constitutive amino acid and its substituent, and the corresponding BFE with the inhibition constant (Ki) is evaluated. The values of Ki for several caspase-2:peptide complexes are found to be within the experimental range (between 0.01 nM and 1 ?M).

The estimated values of kcat/KM, being within the experimentally established range (between 10-4 and 10-1 ?M-1 s-1), indicate that VELAD and VDVAD are most specific to caspase-2.

Acetylcholine was chosen as the object of study given its interesting molecular structure and major biological significance. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in the vacuum (10 ns), water (5 ns), methanol (5 ns), and octanol (1.5 ns). Seven clusters of conformers were identified, namely, +g+g, -g-g, +gt, -gt, t+g, t-g, and tt, where the gauche and trans labels refer to the dihedral angles tau(2) and tau(3), respectively. As expected, the relative proportion of these conformational clusters was highly solvent-dependent and corresponded to a progressive loss of conformational freedom with increasing molecular weight of the solvent. More importantly, the conformational clusters were used to calculate instantaneous and median angular velocity (omega and omega(M), respectively) and instantaneous and median angular acceleration (alpha and alpha(M), respectively). Angular velocity and angular acceleration were both found to decrease markedly with increasing molecular weight of the solvent, i.e., vacuum (epsilon = 1) &gt; water &gt; methanol &gt; octanol. The decrease from the vacuum to octanol was approximately 40% for tau(2) and approximately 60% for tau(3).

For the concentration-dependent micelle-to-vesicle transition in the didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB)/water system, in the region of coexistent micelles and vesicles, less than 3 mM, the beta values increased significantly with DDAB concentration: beta (0.07 mM)=0.35 and beta (3 mM)=0.93. In the coexistent region, activities of the bromide ion, a(Br), were almost independent of the DDAB concentration, suggesting the pseudo-phase nature of both micelles and vesicles. In the concentration-dependent vesicle-to-lamellar transition region above 5 mM, where multilamellar vesicles were prevailing, on the other hand, the beta values were only little affected by this transition. This suggests that the increase in the layer number of DDAB multilamellar vesicles scarcely affects the beta values. This was also supported by the fact that the destruction of multilamellar vesicles by ultrasonication did not change the beta values. These results strongly suggest that the inner and outer monolayers of DDAB multilamellar vesicles are characterized by similar beta values. The second system, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/DDAB mixtures, showed composition-dependent transitions depending on the mole fraction of DDAB X(DDAB): spherical micelles (0&lt;X(DDAB)&lt;0.2)--&gt;rodlike micelles (0.2&lt;X(DDAB)&lt;0.4)--&gt;vesicles (0.6&lt;X(DDAB)&lt;1).

The increase in the beta value was larger for the latter than for the former transition. Little effects of ultrasonication on beta was also observed for the multilamellar vesicles of CTAB/DDAB mixtures. In the third system of the mixtures of two single chain surfactants, protonated and non-protonated of oleyldimethylamine oxide, the dependence of beta on the degree of ionization (alpha) can be well described with a theoretical curve, derived on the basis of the linear relation between the surface charge density and the alpha value, despite the occurrence of the micelle-to-vesicle transition.",

Frequently, it is assumed to be linear in the solvent-accessible surface area, with a positive surface tension (γ) that is independent of the properties of the molecule.

For the intermolecular VRT levels we used a 6 + 6d model in which the fast intramolecular vibrations are adiabatically separated from the much slower intermolecular vibrations, tunneling motions, and overall rotations. We also tested two six-dimensional (6d) rigid monomer models in which the monomers were frozen either at their equilibrium geometry or at their ground state vibrationally averaged geometry. All the results from the 6 + 6d model agree well with the large amount of detailed experimental data available from high-resolution spectroscopy. For most of the parameters characterizing the spectra the results of the two 6d rigid monomer models do not significantly differ from the 6 + 6d results. An exception is the relatively large acceptor tunneling splitting, which was the only quantity for which the 6d model with the monomers frozen at their equilibrium geometry was not in good agreement with the experimental data. The 6d model with monomers at their vibrationally averaged geometry performs considerably better, and the full 6 + 6d results agree with the measurements also for this quantity. For the excited intramolecular vibrations we tested two 6 + 6d models. In the first model the excitation was assumed to be either on the donor in the hydrogen bond or on the acceptor, and to hop from one monomer to the other upon donor-acceptor interchange. In the second model the monomer excitation remains localized on a given monomer for all dimer geometries. Almost the same frequencies of the intramolecular vibrations were found for the two models. The calculations show considerable variations in the frequencies of the intramolecular modes for transitions involving different tunneling levels and different values of the rotational quantum number K. For K = 0 --&gt; 0 transitions these variations largely cancel, however. A comparison with experimental data is difficult, except for the acceptor asymmetric stretch mode observed in high-resolution spectra, because it is not clear how much the different transitions contribute to the (unresolved) peaks in most of the experimental spectra. The large red shift of the donor bound OH stretch mode is correctly predicted, but the value calculated for this red shift is too small by more than 20%. Also in the smaller shifts of the other modes we find relatively large errors. It is useful, however, that our detailed calculations including all ground and excited state tunneling levels provide an explanation for the splitting of the acceptor asymmetric stretch band observed in He nanodroplet spectra, as well as for the fact that the other bands in these spectra show much smaller or no splittings.",

A higher-resolution ensemble, with all backbone atom and all heavy atom r.m.s.d.s. to the mean coordinates of 0.54 (+/- 0.08) A and 0.98 (+/- 0.12) A, respectively, was obtained by X-PLOR simulated annealing refinement of the 15 energy-minimized DIANA structures. A detailed analysis of the original ensemble of 15 energy-minimized DIANA structures is presented, as this ensemble retains a broader, and possibly more realistic, sampling of conformation space. The backbone atom and all heavy atom r.m.s.d.s between the mean energy-minimized DIANA structure and the X-ray derived coordinates of the VL domain within the Fab/digoxin complex are 1.05 A and 1.56 A, respectively. Subtle differences between the solution and X-ray structures occur primarily in CDR2, CDR3, beta-strands A, F and G, and localized regions of hydrophobic packing. Overall, these results demonstrate that the 26-10 VL domain conformation is determined primarily by intradomain interactions, and that quaternary VL-VH association induces relatively minor conformational adjustments.",

These complementary NMR-molecular mechanics studies helped us to define the torsion angles inside the NMR-defined conformational hyperspace. Atom-centered monopole charges were derived for molecular mechanics calculations by fitting the molecular electrostatic potential on freely optimized geometries of 5 and 6 using HF/3-21G level of theory by GAUSSIAN 92 program. The conformation of 5 and 6 can be summarized as follows: (i) the pseudorotational analyses showed that the North conformer is predominant in both 5 (&gt; 70%) and 6 (97%). While the molecular mechanics could correctly predict the energetic preference of North over South type puckered sugar moiety for 5 and 6 it could not provide any clue to the fact that the 1'-CN group in CNT (6) drives the pseudorotational equilibrium more effectively towards North than 1'-CH2OH in HMT (5). (ii). The NMR-observed preference of anti over syn conformation across the glycosyl bond in 5 and 6 was correctly shown by the energetic preference of anti conformers by approx. 10 kJ/mol. (iii) The populations of the staggered rotamers across C4'-C5' (gamma +, gamma t and gamma -) calculated from 3J4'5' and 3J4'5\" coupling constants from NMR spectroscopy show that gamma + and gamma t rotamers are preferred. Molecular mechanics calculations are also in an excellent agreement here with the results of solution studies: in 5 gamma + and gamma t rotamers are equally populated and a small energy difference in potential energy is established, while in 6 the larger energy difference in potential energy is found which reflects a higher preference for gamma + rotamer in solution. The energetic preferences found among the lowest energy conformers of 5 (North-gamma +/gamma t-anti-epsilon t1) and 6 (North-gamma +/gamma t-anti) in molecular mechanics calculations are in an excellent agreement with the preferences of the major conformers found by NMR spectroscopy in solution.",

The results indicated that for transformations involving small structural changes, a simulation length of 860 ps is sufficient to obtain satisfactory convergence.

The force associated with this potential is discontinuous at angles close to 180°, which can lead to numeric instabilities. Angle bending of linear groups, such as alkynes or nitriles, or linear molecules, such as carbon dioxide, can be treated by a simple harmonic potential if we describe the fluctuations as a deviation from a reference position of the central atom, the position of which is determined by the flanking atoms. The force constant for the linear angle potential can be derived analytically from the corresponding force constant in the traditional potential. The new potential is tested on the properties of alkynes, nitriles, and carbon dioxide. We find that the angles of the linear groups remain about 2° closer to 180° using the new potential. The bond and angle force constants for carbon dioxide were tuned to reproduce the experimentally determined frequencies. An interesting finding was that simulations of liquid carbon dioxide under pressure with the new flexible model were stable only when explicitly modeling the long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions due to the very long-range nature of the LJ interactions (&gt;1.7 nm). In the other tested liquids, we find that a Lennard-Jones cutoff of 1.1 nm yields similar results as the particle mesh Ewald algorithm for LJ interactions. Algorithmic factors influencing the stability of liquid simulations are discussed as well.

The oxidation of methanol dehydrogenase by the cytochrome was studied as a function of ionic strength using stopped-flow spectroscopy. The dissociation constant (Kd) for complex formation decreased 2-fold with increasing ionic strength from 0.21 to 1.3 M and increased at higher ionic strengths. The rate constant for the electron transfer reaction (kET) increased 2-fold with increasing ionic strength from 0.21 to 1.3 M and decreased at higher ionic strengths. The variation of Kd and kET over this range of ionic strengths was described by Van Leeuwen theory, which takes into account monopole-dipole and dipole-dipole forces, in addition to the monopole-monopole force, to predict the interactions between large molecules. Analysis of the kinetic results in terms of these electrostatic interactions indicated the probable orientations for protein-protein binding and electron transfer. To explain the ionic strength dependence of the observed kET, a model is presented in which the true kET is reduced by a factor Kc, an equilibrium constant that describes some rearrangement of the proteins after a nonoptimal collision to produce the most efficient orientation for electron transfer. This model is consistent with the notion that the large reorganizational energy obtained from temperature-dependence studies of this electron transfer reaction [Harris, T. K., &amp; Davidson, V. L.

Solutions are described with molecular dynamics simulations in combination with the OPLS-aa force field for solvents and customized force field for solutes. V(i) is determined with the direct method, while the composition of V(i) is studied with Kirkwood-Buff integrals (KBIs). Subsequently, the amount of unoccupied space and size of pre-formed cavities in pure solvents is determined. Additionally, the shape of individual solvent cages is analyzed. Calculated V(i) deviate only 3.4 cm(3) mol(-1) (7.1%) from experimental literature values. Experimental V(i) variations across solutions are reproduced qualitatively and also quantitatively in most cases. The KBI analysis identifies differences in solute induced solvent reorganization in the immediate vicinity of H2 (&lt;0.7 nm) and solvent reorganization up to the third solvation shell of CO and CO2 (&lt;1.6 nm) as the origin of V(i) variations. In all solutions, larger V(i) are found in solvents that exhibit weak internal interactions, low cohesive energy density and large compressibility. Weak internal interactions facilitate solvent displacement by thermal solute movement, which enhances the size of solvent cages and thus V(i). Additionally, attractive electrostatic interactions of CO2 and the solvents, which do not depend on internal solvent interactions only, partially reversed the V(i) trends observed in H2 and CO solutions where electrostatic interactions with the solvents are absent. More empty space and larger pre-formed cavities are found in solvents with weak internal interactions, however, no evidence is found that solutes in any considered solvent are accommodated in pre-formed cavities. Individual solvent cages are found to be elongated in the negative direction of solute movement. This wake behind the moving solute is more pronounced in case of mobile H2 and in solvents with weaker internal interactions. However, deviations from a spherical solvent cage shape do not influence solute-solvent radial distribution functions after averaging over all solvent cage orientations and hence do not change V(i). Overall, the applied methodology reproduces V(i) and its variations reliably and the used V(i) decompositions identify the underlying reasons behind observed V(i) variations.",

KD for D38N.2 is pH-dependent, with values of 6 nM at pH 6.9, 51 nM at pH 5.8, and 59 nM at pH 5.2.

The theoretical prediction of rate coefficients and product distributions for such reactions is complicated by the fact that the initial complex-formation steps and some dissociation steps are barrierless. In this paper direct variable reaction coordinate transition state theory (VRC-TST) is used to predict accurately the association rate constants for the self and cross reactions of propargyl and allyl radicals. For each reaction, a set of multifaceted dividing surfaces is used to account for the multiple possible addition channels. Because of their resonant nature the geometric relaxation of the radicals is important. Here, the effect of this relaxation is explicitly calculated with the UB3LYP/cc-pvdz method for each mutual orientation encountered in the configurational integrals over the transition state dividing surfaces. The final energies are obtained from CASPT2/cc-pvdz calculations with all pi-orbitals in the active space. Evaluations along the minimum energy path suggest that basis set corrections are negligible. The VRC-TST approach was also used to calculate the association rate constant and the corresponding number of states for the C(6)H(5) + H --&gt; C(6)H(6) exit channel of the C(3)H(3) + C(3)H(3) reaction, which is also barrierless.

For the C(3)H(3) + C(3)H(3) reaction, the VRC-TST results for the energy and angular momentum resolved numbers of states in the entrance channels and in the C(6)H(5) + H exit channel are incorporated in a master equation simulation to determine the temperature and pressure dependence of the phenomenological rate coefficients. The rate constants for the C(3)H(3) + C(3)H(3) and C(3)H(5) + C(3)H(5) self-reactions compare favorably with the available experimental data.

A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

These levels were observed by double resonance, using 1+1' two-color pulsed-field ionization zero-kinetic-energy photoelectron spectroscopy. The intermediate states were single rovibrational levels chosen from the A1Au, 4nu3 (K = 1-2), 5nu3 (K = 1), nu2+4nu3 (K = 0), and 47,206 cm(-1) (K = 1) levels of C2H2. Seven of the trans-bending levels of C2H2+ (upsilon4 = 0-3, K = 0-2) had been reported previously by Pratt et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 99, 6233 (1993)]; our results for these levels agree well with theirs. A full analysis has been carried out, including the Renner-Teller effect and the vibrational anharmonicity for both the trans- and cis-bending vibrations. The rotational structure of the lowest 16 vibronic levels (consisting of the complete set of levels with upsilon4 + upsilon5 &lt; or = 2, except for the unobserved upper (2Pi u component of the 2nu4 overtone) could be fitted by least squares using 16 parameters to give an rms deviation of 0.21 cm(-1). The vibronic coupling parameter epsilon5 (about whose magnitude there has been controversy) was determined to be -0.0273(7). For the higher vibronic levels, an additional parameter, r45, was needed to allow for the Darling-Dennison resonance between the two bending manifolds. Almost all the observed levels of the upsilon4 + upsilon5 = 3 and 4 polyads (about half of the predicted number) could then be assigned. In a final fit to 39 vibronic levels with upsilon4 + upsilon5 &lt; or = 5, an rms deviation of 0.34 cm(-1) was obtained using 20 parameters. An interesting finding is that Hund's spin-coupling cases (a) and (b) both occur in the Sigmau components of the nu4 + 2nu5 combination level. The ionization potential of C2H2 (from the lowest rotational level of the ground state to the lowest rotational level of the cation) is found to be 91,953.77 +/- 0.09 cm(-1) (3sigma).",

The third virial coefficient of epsilon is considered as a series over dipolar parameter lambda=m(2)d(3)kT. The terms up to O(lambda(11)) are calculated analytically providing a correct description of the third virial coefficient for small and intermediate values of lambda (0&lt;or=lambda&lt;or=4).

Realization of the renormalization procedure permits to enlarge the range of applicability of the virial series. In this way, the new expression for the dielectric constant as a function of two dipolar parameters, lambda and y=4 pi nm(2)9kT, has been found explicitly.

The model is treated in the Bethe-Guggenheim approximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution properties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With h(11)(r), h(12)(r), and h(22)(r) the three pair correlation functions as functions of the separation r (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and solute, respectively), we find for r &gt; or = 2 lattice steps that h(22)(r)/h(12)(r) is identical with h(12)(r)/h(11)(r). This illustrates a general theorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite r. The three correlation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation length), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the decay of h(22)(r) is much greater than that of h(12)(r), which in turn is much greater than that of h(11)(r). As a consequence the amplitude of the decay of h(22)(r) is enormously greater than that of h(11)(r). The effective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at which the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in similar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial coefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the solvent-mediated part W(r) of the potential of mean force between solutes, evaluated at contact, r = 1, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy of solvation at fixed pressure, DeltaG(p)(*), by (Z/2)W(1) + DeltaG(p)(*) is identical with pv(0), where Z is the coordination number of the lattice, p is the pressure, and v(0) is the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A large, positive DeltaG(p)(*) associated with the low solubility is thus reflected in a strong attraction (large negative W at contact), which is the major contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the low solubility (large positive DeltaG(p)(*)) is due partly to an unfavorable enthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in the hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high solubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.",

The membrane conductance (G(m)) induced by PV in either Na(+) or K(+) medium is proportional to the concentration of PV in the aqueous phase. The PV concentration required to produce a comparable increase in G(m) in K(+) medium is about 10(4) times greater than for its analogue, valinomycin (val). Although the selectivity sequence for PV and val is similar, K(+) greater, similar Rb(+) &gt; Cs(+) &gt; NH(4) (+) &gt; TI(+) &gt; Na(+) &gt; Li(+); the ratio of GGm in K(+) to that in Na(+) is about 10 for PV compared to &gt; 10(3) for val. When equal concentrations of PV are added to both sides of a bilayer, the membrane current approaches a maximum value independent of voltage when the membrane potential exceeds 100 mV. When PV is added to only one side of a bilayer separating identical salt solutions of either Na(+) or K(+) salts, rectification occurs such that the positive current flows more easily away rather than toward the side containing the carrier. Under these conditions, a large, stable, zero-current potential (VVm) is also observed, with the side containing PV being negative. The magnitude of this VVm is about 90 mV and relatively independent of PV concentration when the latter is larger than 2 Times; 10(-5) M. From a model which assumes that V(m) equals the equilibrium potential for the PV-cation complexes (MS(+)) and that the reaction between PV and cations is at equilibrium on the two membrane surfaces, we compute the permeability of the membrane to free PV to be about 10(-5) cm s(-1), which is about 10(-7) times the permeability of similar membranes to free val. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the observed values of V(m) are in agreement with the calculated equilibrium potential for MS(+) over a wide range of ratios of concentrations of total PV in the two bathing solutions, if the unstirred layers are taken into account in computing the MS(+) concentrations at the membrane surfaces.",

Large-scale computational studies using coarse-grained (CG) simulations are becoming popular. However, most CG model parameters have not fully been calibrated with respect to lateral interactions of TM peptide segments. Here, we compare the potential of mean forces (PMFs) of dimerization of TM helices obtained using a MARTINI CG model and an atomistic (AT) Berger lipids-OPLS/AA model (AT(OPLS)). For helical, tryptophan-flanked, leucine-rich peptides (WL15 and WALP15) embedded in a parallel configuration in an octane slab, the AT(OPLS) PMF profiles showed a shallow minimum (with a depth of approximately 3 kJ/mol; i.e., a weak tendency to dimerize). A similar analysis using the CHARMM36 all-atom model (AT(CHARMM)) showed comparable results. In contrast, the CG analysis generally showed steep PMF curves with depths of approximately 16-22 kJ/mol, suggesting a stronger tendency to dimerize compared to the AT model. This CG &gt; AT discrepancy in the propensity for dimerization was also seen for dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC)-embedded peptides. For a WL15 (and WALP15)/DLPC bilayer system, AT(OPLS) PMF showed a repulsive mean force for a wide range of interhelical distances, in contrast to the attractive forces observed in the octane system. The change from the octane slab to the DLPC bilayer also mitigated the dimerization propensity in the CG system. The dimerization energies of CG (AALALAA)3 peptides in DLPC and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers were in good agreement with previous experimental data. The lipid headgroup, but not the length of the lipid tails, was a key causative factor contributing to the differences between octane and DLPC. Furthermore, the CG model, but not the AT model, showed high sensitivity to changes in amino acid residues located near the lipid-water interface and hydrophobic mismatch between the peptides and membrane. These findings may help interpret CG and AT simulation results on membrane proteins. ",

For the semi-empirical descriptors, logistic regression models have been developed and validated against the dataset based on the semi-empirical and quantum chemical descriptors. Logistic regression models, based on the Debye dipole moment (mu), the hydration energy (DeltaHhyd), and van der Waals volume (VvdW), resulted in a maximal explained variation in the data of 74%.

In addition to these pseudohexapeptides, conformational analysis was also carried out on three pseudotetrapeptides and three pseudooctapeptides. The target of the conformation analysis reported herein was to determine whether the ring stress of the above beta-turn models has an influence on their conformational properties. Quantitative nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements yielded interproton distances. The conformational average distances so obtained were interpreted utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to yield the conformational percentages. These conformational ratios were correlated with the conformational weights obtained by quantitative CD analysis of the same compounds. The pure component CD curves of type I and type II beta-turns were also obtained, using a recently developed algorithm (Perczel, A., Tusnády, G., Hollósi, M., &amp; Fasman, G.D., 1991b, Protein Eng. 4(6), 669-679). For the first time the results of a CD deconvolution, based on the CD spectra of 14 beta-turn models, were assigned by quantitative NOE results.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists.

In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects.

Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

Sensitivity to symmetry and spin forbidden transitions as well as correlations to the triplet states of benzene make it possible to ascribe the main features, below 7 eV in the electronic part of the EEL spectrum, to triplet transitions. The lowest EEL feature with an energy onset at 3.5 eV is attributed to a transition to the (3)B(1)(n--&gt;pi(*)) valence electronic state and the next triplet n--&gt;pi(*) transition to a (3)A(2) state located around 4.5 eV.

The noise equivalent absorption of the recordings is on the order of α(min)≈ 5 × 10(-11) cm(-1) allowing for the detection of the O(5) transition with an intensity of 1.1 × 10(-30) cm per molecule, the smallest intensity value measured so far for an H(2) absorption line. A Galatry profile was used to reproduce the measured line shape and derive the line strengths. The pressure shift of the O(2) and O(3) lines was accurately determined from a series of recordings with pressure ranging between 10 and 700 Torr. From an exhaustive review of the literature data, the list of H(2) absorption lines detected so far has been constructed. It includes a total of 39 transitions ranging from the S(0) pure rotational line near 354 cm(-1) up to the S(1) transition of the (5-0) band near 18,908 cm(-1). These experimental values are compared to a highly accurate theoretical line list constructed for pure H(2) at 296 K (0-35,000 cm(-1), intensity cut off of 1 × 10(-34) cm per molecule). The energy levels and transition moments were computed from high level quantum mechanics calculations. The overall agreement between the theoretical and experimental values is found to be very good for the line positions. Some deviations for the intensities of the high overtone bands (V &gt; 2) are discussed in relation with possible pressure effects affecting the retrieved intensity values.

The pulsed operation of the laser can produce a cyclic variation in the emission intensities of the sample atoms whereas the plasma gas species emit the radiation continuously. The salient feature of the proposed technique is the selective detection of the laser modulation signal from the rest of the continuous background emissions, which can be achieved with the phase sensitive detection of the lock-in amplifier. The arrangement may be used to estimate the emission intensity of the laser ablated atom, free from the interference of other species present in the plasma. The experiments were conducted with a 13.56 MHz radio-frequency (rf) generator operated at 80 W power to produce plasma and the laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm (pulse duration:34 ns, repetition rate:7 kHz and average pulse energy of about 0.36 mJ) was employed for sample ablation. The measurements resulted in almost complete removal of nitrogen molecular bands (N(2)(+) 391.44 nm). Considerable reduction (about 75%) in the emission intensity of a carbon atomic line (C I 193.03 nm) was also observed.",

No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 ± 5.7(stat) ± 1.5(syst)) × 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| &lt; 10.5 × 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence.

Quantum theory dictates that uncertainties on the position and energy-momentum four-vectors of radiation quanta obey Heisenberg's uncertainty relation; however, these uncertainties are neglected in \"classical\" MC simulations of radiation transport in which position and momentum are known precisely. Using the quantum uncertainty relation and electron mean free path, the magnitudes of uncertainties on electron position and momentum are calculated for different kinetic energies; a validity bound on the classical simulation of electron transport is derived. In order to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, uncertainties of 5% must be assigned to position and momentum for 1 keV electrons in water; at 100 eV, these uncertainties are 17 to 20% and are even larger at lower energies. In gaseous media such as air, these uncertainties are much smaller (less than 1% for electrons with energy 20 eV or greater). The classical Monte Carlo transport treatment is questionable for sub-1 keV electrons in condensed water as uncertainties on position and momentum must be large (relative to electron momentum and mean free path) to satisfy the quantum uncertainty principle. Simulations which do not account for these uncertainties are not faithful representations of the physical processes, calling into question the results of MC track structure codes simulating sub-1 keV electron transport. Further, the large difference in the scale at which quantum effects are important in gaseous and condensed media suggests that track structure measurements in gases are not necessarily representative of track structure in condensed materials on a micrometer or a nanometer scale.",

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

The semiclassical function from mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and frozen Gaussian wave packets is computed for the electronic transition of an excited state excess electron to the ground state in liquid methanol. The decoherence function decays on a 10 fs time scale that is qualitatively similar to the aqueous case. We demonstrate that it is the motion of the hydrogen atom, and, in particular, the hydrogen rotation around the oxygen-methyl bond which is predominantly responsible for destroying the quantum correlations between alternative states. Multiple time scales due to the slower diffusive nuclear modes, which dominate the solvation response of methanol, do not contribute to the coherence loss. The choice of the coordinate representation is investigated in detail and concluded to be irrelevant to the decay. Changes in both nuclear momenta and positions on the two alternative potential surfaces are found to contribute to decoherence, the former dominating at short times (t &lt; 5 fs), the latter controlling the decay at longer times. Various short-time approximations to the full dynamics for the decoherence function are tested for the first time. The present treatment rigorously develops the short-time description and establishes its range of validity. Whereas the lowest-order short-time approximation proves to be a very good approximation up to about 5 fs, we also find that it bounds the decay of the decoherence function. After 5 fs, the coherence decay in fact becomes faster than the single Gaussian predicted in the lowest-order short-time limit. This decay is well reflected by an enhanced low-order approximation, which is also easily computed from equilibrium classical forces.",

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

For the first time, electric dipole moments are also computed in the approach, including SO coupling for transitions to the states responsible for the first absorption continuum (A-band) of ArH(+). On this basis, the partial and total absorption spectra in this energy range are obtained. It is shown that absorption in the A-band is dominated by the parallel A(1)Sigma(+)&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) transition.

The ET dependencies of the integral cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v=0-4)+He collisions in the ET range of 0-3 eV have also been measured using the VUV photoionization guided ion beam mass spectrometric technique, in which vibrationally selected HD+(v) reactant ions were prepared via excitation of selected autoionization resonances of HD. At low total energies, a pronounced isotope effect is observed in absolute integral cross sections for the HeH++D and HeD++H channels with significant favoring of the deuteron transfer channel. As v is increased in the range of v=0-9, the integral cross sections of the HeH++D channel are found to approach those of HeD++H. The observed velocity distributions of products HeD+ and HeH+ are consistent with an impulsive or spectator-stripping mechanism. Detailed quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations are also presented for HD+(v,j=1)+He collisions at the same energies of the experiment. The QCT calculations were performed on the most accurate ab initio potential energy surface available. If the zero-point energy of the reaction products is taken into account, the QCT cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v)+He are found to be significantly lower than the experimental results at ET values near the reaction thresholds. The agreement between the experimental and QCT cross sections improves with translational energy. Except for prethreshold reactivity, QCT calculations ignoring the zero-point energy in the products are generally in good agreement with experimental absolute cross sections. The experimental HeH+/HeD+ branching ratios for the HD+(v=0-9)+He collisions are generally consistent with QCT predictions.

Despite the various approximations involved in the different methods and PESs, an excellent agreement is obtained in a subset of three models: the ACCSA method with PME-SO or ab initio PESs and the QCT method with the latter PES. This suggests that the reaction takes place once the system enters the deep valley of products. In that case, the errors due to these approximate methods and PESs are small and, consequently, the rate constants are accurately calculated.

The importance of including the CC quantum scattering calculation has been revealed by the comparison between the CC calculation and the previous coupled state (CS) calculation. The CC total cross sections for the v = 2, 4, and 6 states show collision energy-dependent behaviors different from those based on the CS calculation. Furthermore, the collision energy dependence of the total cross sections obtained in the present CC calculation only exhibits minor oscillations, indicating that the chance is slim for reactive resonances in total cross sections to survive through the partial-wave averaging. The magnitude and profile of the CC total cross sections for v = 0-2 in the collision energy range of 0.0-2.5 eV are found to be consistent with experimental cross sections obtained recently by Tang et al.

These investigations are based on nonadiabatic classical Monte Carlo trajectory (CMCT) simulations on a ground and an excited state potential energy surface, including up to all six adsorbate degrees of freedom. The focus is on the hot-electron mediated energy transfer from the surface to the molecule and back, and the energy partitioning between the different degrees of freedom of the desorbing molecules. We first validate for a two-mode model comprising the desorption mode and the internal vibrational coordinate, the classical Monte Carlo trajectory method by comparing with Monte Carlo wavepacket (MCWP) calculations arising from a fully quantum mechanical open-system density matrix treatment. We then proceed by extending the CMCT calculations to include all six nuclear degrees of freedom of the desorbing molecule. This allows for a detailed comparison between theory and experiment concerning isotope effects, energy partitioning (translational, vibrational, and rotational energies and their distributions), and the dependence of these properties on the laser fluence. The most important findings are as follows. (i) CMCT agrees qualitative with the MCWP scheme.

That interval of energies does not have, in principle, any physical reason to be so well defined, and gives a large amount of the total contribution to sigmad, e.g., close to 98% of it. Then a further study is given in this article, where we show some of the main characteristics of that interval of energy, such as its universal appearance and basis set independence. Our main result is the finding that sigmad is completely described by that interval of excitation energies, i.e., there is no contribution arising from outside of it. Most of the contributions belonging to that interval arise from virtual electronic energies larger than -3mc2. For heavier atoms, there are few contributions from states with virtual negative energies smaller than -3mc2.

Five mixed quantum/classical methods are tested: one mean-field approach (the coherent switching with decay of mixing method), two surface-hopping methods [the fewest switches with time uncertainty (FSTU) and FSTU with stochastic decay (FSTU/SD) methods], and two surface-hopping methods with zero-point energy (ZPE) maintenance [the FSTUSD+trajectory projection onto ZPE orbit (TRAPZ) and FSTUSD+minimal TRAPZ (mTRAPZ) methods]. We found a qualitative difference between final NH(2) internal energy distributions obtained for n(2)=0 and n(2)&gt;1, as observed in experiments. Distributions obtained for n(2)=1 present an intermediate behavior between distributions obtained for smaller and larger n(2) values. The dynamics is found to be highly electronically nonadiabatic with all these methods. NH(2) internal energy distributions may have a negative energy tail when the ZPE is not maintained throughout the dynamics. The original TRAPZ method was designed to maintain ZPE in classical trajectories, but we find that it leads to unphysically high internal vibrational energies. The mTRAPZ method, which is new in this work and provides a general method for maintaining ZPE in either single-surface or multisurface trajectories, does not lead to unphysical results and is much less time consuming. The effect of maintaining ZPE in mixed quantum/classical dynamics is discussed in terms of agreement with experimental findings. The dynamics for n(2)=0 and n(2)=6 are also analyzed to reveal details not available from experiment, in particular, the time required for quenching of electronic excitation and the adiabatic energy gap and geometry at the time of quenching.",

For a fixed total angular momentum J, the energy dependence of reaction probabilities exhibits quantum resonance structure. The resonances are more pronounced for low J values and for the HeH(+) + D channel than for the HeD(+) + H channel and are particularly prominent near threshold. The quantum effects are no longer discernable in the integral cross sections, which compare closely to quasiclassical trajectory calculations conducted on the same potential energy surface.

Classical impulsive dynamics and steric arguments can account for the significant isotope effect in favor of the deuteron transfer channel observed for HD(+)(v&lt;3) and low translational energies. At higher reactant energies, angular momentum constraints favor the proton-transfer channel, and isotopic differences in the integral cross sections are no longer significant.

Although this conclusion is true in the center of mass frame, it is not true in the laboratory frame, where the translation has to be considered. In this theoretical work, the analytic formulas for the ring current densities, electric ring currents, mean ring current radii, and induced magnetic fields at the ring center, depending on the translational wavepacket widths, are derived. It shows that the ring currents and the corresponding induced magnetic fields in the laboratory frame persist on shorter timecales due to spreading of translational wavepackets. The electronic ring currents in 2p(±) orbitals of the hydrogen-like systems decay on the femtosecond time scale, but the corresponding nuclear ring currents with giant induced magnetic fields (for example up to 0.54 MT for (7)Li(2+)) and very small mean ring current radii on the femtometer scale decay on the very short, zeptosecond time scale, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The theory is also applied to ring currents in many-electron atoms and ions as well as to nuclear ring currents in pseudorotating molecules. For example, in the first triply degenerate pseudorotational states |v(1)l(±1)&gt; of the tetrahedral molecule OsH(4), the ring currents of the heavy central nucleus Os decay on the attosecond time scale.",

The first-order interaction energy and the bulk of the second-order contribution were obtained using Gaussian geminal basis sets and are converged to about 0.1 mK near the minimum and for larger R. The remaining second-order contributions available in the SAPT suite of codes were computed using very large orbital basis sets, up to septuple-zeta quality, augmented by diffuse and midbond functions. The accuracy reached at this level was better than 1 mK in the same region. All the remaining components of the interaction energy were computed using the full configuration interaction method in bases up to sextuple-zeta quality. The latter components, although contributing only 1% near the minimum, have the largest uncertainty of about 10 mK in this region. The total interaction energy at R=5.6 bohrs is -11.000+/-0.011 K. For R&lt; or =6.5 bohrs, the supermolecular (SM) interaction energies computed by us recently turned out to be slightly more accurate. Therefore, we have combined the SM results for R&lt; or =6.5 bohrs with the SAPT results from 7.0 to 12 bohrs to fit analytic functions for the potential and for its error bars.

Formation, occupied state distributions, free energy, and kinetic control.\nIt has been suggested that Rydberg gas atoms are involved in conducting electricity through a steady state flowing afterglow (FAG) discharge plasma (R. S. Mason, D. J. Mitchell and P. M. Dickinson, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, DOI: ). From known properties of Rydberg atoms, a statistical model is developed here to find the distribution of levels (principal quantum number n) occupied in such a hypothetical Rydberg gas. It behaves non-ideally at positive column plasma densities, predicting 30 &lt; n &lt; 150, peaking at n approximately = 85. These values depend on assumptions concerning the power of n dependency of 'pressure ionization' and the free charge density. The occupied states are very long-lived and almost completely separated from the low n states by the low probability of intermediate levels. The effects of Rydberg gas (N(R)) and free charge densities are examined. The gas can exist in a deep free energy well (&gt; 120 kJ mol(-1) below ionisation level when 10(10) &lt; or = N(R) &lt; or = 10(11) atoms cm(-3)) but this is approximately 11 kJ mol(-1) higher than that of the equivalent free ion-electron gas; therefore if it exists in preference to the classical form of the plasma, it is controlled by kinetic factors. A mechanism is suggested by which this could occur. Thus, whilst ionization by high energy electron impact occurs at the Cathode Fall-Negative Glow (NG) boundary as usual, excitation of Rydberg atoms becomes more probable, by electrons slowed by collision and deceleration at the opposite NG-Positive Column (PC) plasma boundary. The atoms become stabilized after passing into the PC, by collisionally induced (nlm) mixing of states and the removal of free charge by charge transfer (and hence the passage of electric current through the Rydberg gas). The coupling of Rydberg states with the ionization continuum is poor; therefore, if the rate of their charge transfer is greater than that of their ionization, the Rydberg gas will remain relatively charge free and hence stable when it is conducting a current. When applied to the FAG plasma, the model provides a self-consistent interpretive framework for all its electrical, mass spectrometric and chemical behaviour. The effect on the optical spectroscopy of these plasmas is considered briefly.",

The ET dependencies of the integral cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v=0-4)+He collisions in the ET range of 0-3 eV have also been measured using the VUV photoionization guided ion beam mass spectrometric technique, in which vibrationally selected HD+(v) reactant ions were prepared via excitation of selected autoionization resonances of HD. At low total energies, a pronounced isotope effect is observed in absolute integral cross sections for the HeH++D and HeD++H channels with significant favoring of the deuteron transfer channel. As v is increased in the range of v=0-9, the integral cross sections of the HeH++D channel are found to approach those of HeD++H. The observed velocity distributions of products HeD+ and HeH+ are consistent with an impulsive or spectator-stripping mechanism. Detailed quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations are also presented for HD+(v,j=1)+He collisions at the same energies of the experiment. The QCT calculations were performed on the most accurate ab initio potential energy surface available. If the zero-point energy of the reaction products is taken into account, the QCT cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v)+He are found to be significantly lower than the experimental results at ET values near the reaction thresholds. The agreement between the experimental and QCT cross sections improves with translational energy. Except for prethreshold reactivity, QCT calculations ignoring the zero-point energy in the products are generally in good agreement with experimental absolute cross sections. The experimental HeH+/HeD+ branching ratios for the HD+(v=0-9)+He collisions are generally consistent with QCT predictions. The observed isotope effects can be rationalized on the basis of differences in thermochemical thresholds and angular momentum conservation constraints.",

Acta Cryst. A34, 909-921]. They are based on the expansion of |r' - r|(-1) in spherical harmonics and the incomplete gamma function for a Slater-type function of the form R(l)(r) = r(n) exp(-alpha ). The formulae are valid for 0 &lt; or = r &lt; or = infinity and are easily extended to higher values of l. Special treatment of integrals is needed only for functions with n = l and n = l + 1 at r = 0. The method is tested using theoretical pseudoatom parameters of the formamide molecule obtained via reciprocal-space fitting of PBE/6-31G** densities and experimental X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5). The ESP, EF and EFG values at the nuclear positions in formamide are in very good agreement with those directly evaluated from density-functional PBE calculations with 6-31G**, aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The small observed discrepancies are attributed to the different behavior of Gaussian- and Slater-type functions near the nuclei and to imperfections of the reciprocal-space fit. An EF map is displayed which allows useful visualization of the lattice EF effects in the crystal structure of formamide. Analysis of experimental 100 K X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5) yields the value of the nuclear quadrupole moment Q((57)Fe(m)) = 0.12 x 10(-28) m(2) after taking into account Sternheimer shielding/antishielding effects of the core.

The cross sections for deactivation of K(6S) and K(4D) by collisions with H2 were measured. The temperature of the cell body was controlled at 413 K, and H2 pressure was varied between 4 and 40 Pa. The effects of K(6S, 4D)-K collisions could be neglected in our experimental condition. On excitation of K(6S) state, the decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 6S--&gt;4P transition was monitored. The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state.

Dosimetric uncertainties during treatment delivery are considered briefly but are not included in the detailed analysis. For low- and high-energy brachytherapy sources of low dose rate and high dose rate, a combined dosimetric uncertainty &lt;5% (k=1) is estimated, which is consistent with prior literature estimates. Recommendations are provided for clinical medical physicists, dosimetry investigators, and source and treatment planning system manufacturers.

The objective of that evaluation was to develop subjective probability distributions of an uncertain quantity, denoted by ρ, to represent ranges of credible values of the effectiveness of five groups of low-energy radiations (L): photons at about 1.5 keV; 15 to 30 keV photons; 40 to 60 keV photons; &gt;60 to 150 keV photons; and electrons from beta decay of tritium (H). Probability distributions of ρL for all low-energy groups were derived based on an evaluation of uncertainties in data on biological effectiveness from five areas of research and use of an elicitation process and decomposition method to combine probability distributions to represent those uncertainties. In this paper, we argue that uncertainties in ρLs for all low-energy groups are too small compared with uncertainties in biological effectiveness from the different areas of research, especially that upper confidence limits of all ρLs are too low. These deflations of uncertainty in all ρLs apparently are due, at least in part, to an invalid assumption in the decomposition method that probability distributions of biological effectiveness from the different areas of research are representations of random uncertainty that arises from repeated measurements of the same quantity under the same conditions using well-calibrated instruments. However, those distributions essentially are representations of systematic uncertainty in different estimates of biological effectiveness from each area of research, which means that a deflation of uncertainty in ρLs is not a credible result. We then use the same probability distributions of biological effectiveness from the different areas of research in an alternative analysis to derive wider probability distributions of ρL that we believe provide a better representation of the state of knowledge of the effectiveness of low-energy photons and electrons in inducing cancer in humans. Our analysis is based on the notion that each probability distribution of biological effectiveness from an area of research represents a distinctly different model of a ρL and use of the concept of model averaging to combine those distributions.",

It is shown that vibrational state control of the I*/I branching ratio in the alkyl (hydrogen) iodide photodissociation has an electronic rather than a dynamic nature: Due to a different electron density distribution at various molecular geometries, one achieves a more efficient excitation of a particular fragmentation channel rather than influences the dynamics of the decay process.",

Regarding the significance of radiation protection in RT, it is important to evaluate photoneutron contamination inside the RT room. Unfortunately, neutron dosimeters used for this purpose have limitations that can under the best conditions cause to &gt; 10% uncertainty. In addition to this uncertainty, the present Monte Carlo (MC) study introduces another uncertainty in measurements (nearly up to 20%) when neutron ambient dose equivalent (H<subn</sub<sup*</sup(10)) is measured at the patient table or inside the maze and the change in neutron energy is ignored. This type of uncertainty can even reach 35% if H<subn</sub<sup*</sup(10) is measured by dosimeters covered by a layer of <sup10</supB as converter. So, in these cases, neglecting the change in neutron energy can threaten the credibility of measured data and one should attend to this energy change in order to reduce measurement uncertainty to the possible minimum.

Theory and spectroscopic properties.\nThe excitation of a fluorescent molecule by a beta-decay electron (radioluminescence) depends upon the electron energy, the distance between radioactive 'donor' and fluorescent 'acceptor', and the excitation characteristics and solvent environment of the fluorophore. The theory for calculation of single photon radioluminescence (SPR) signals is developed here; in the accompanying paper, measurement methods and biological applications are presented. To calculate the three-dimensional spatial profile for electron energy deposition in an aqueous environment, a Monte Carlo calculation was performed incorporating theories of electron energy distributions, energy loss due to interactions with matter, and deflections in electron motion due to collisions. For low energy beta emitters, 50% of energy deposition occurs within 0.63 micron (3H, 18.5 keV), 22 microns (14C, 156 keV), 25 microns (35S, 167 keV), and 260 microns (36Cl, 712 keV) of the radioisotope. In close proximity to the beta emitter (100 nm, 3H; 10 microns, 14C) the probability for fluorophore excitation is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the beta emitter and fluorophore. To investigate the other factors that determine the probability for fluorophore excitation, SPR measurements were carried out in solutions containing 3H and a series of fluorophores in different solvents. In water, the probability of fluorescence excitation was nearly proportional to the integrated absorbance over a &gt; 1,000-fold variation in absorbances. The probability of fluorescence excitation was enhanced up to 2,600-fold when the fluorophore was in a \"scintillant\" aromatic or hydrocarbon solvent. SPR emission spectra were similar to fluorescence emission spectra obtained with photon excitation. The single photon signal due to Bremsstrahlung increased with wavelength in agreement with theory. The distance dependence for the SPR signal predicted by the model was in good agreement with measurements in which a 14C donor was separated by known thicknesses of water from a fluorescently-coated coverglass. Quantitative predictions for radioluminescence signal as a function of donor-acceptor distance were developed for specific radioisotope-fluorophore geometries in biological samples.",

Using a generating function formalism we solve the generalized optical Bloch equations and obtain an exact analytical formula for the line shape and Mandel's Q parameter. The line shape exhibits well-known behaviors, including motional narrowing when the stochastic modulation is fast and power broadening. The Mandel parameter, describing the line shape fluctuations, exhibits a transition from a quantum sub-Poissonian behavior in the fast modulation limit to a classical super-Poissonian behavior found in the slow modulation limit. Our result is applicable for weak and strong laser fields, namely, for arbitrary Rabi frequency. We show how to choose the Rabi frequency in such a way so that the quantum sub-Poissonian nature of the emission process becomes strongest. A lower bound on Q is found and simple limiting behaviors are investigated. A nontrivial behavior is obtained in the intermediate modulation limit, when the time scales for spectral diffusion and the lifetime of the excited state become similar.

We define it as the spectrum of electrons entering the sensitive to radiation volume (SV) within the cell nucleus, at the moment they enter the SV. For this spectrum we derive a formula that combines linearly the fluence spectrum and the source spectrum. The latter is the distribution of initial energies of electrons produced by a source.

Our derived formula reduces to these two prior methods in the case of high and low energy sources, respectively. The second problem is extending electron spectra to low energies. Previous studies used an energy cut-off on the order of 1 keV. However, as we show, even for high energy sources, such as <sup60</supCo, electrons with energies below 1 keV contribute about 30% to the dose. In this study all the spectra were calculated with Geant4-DNA code and a cut-off energy of only 11 eV. We present formulas for calculating frequency- and dose-average stopping powers, numerical results for several important electron and photon sources, and tables with all the data needed to use our formulas for arbitrary electron and photon sources producing electrons with initial energies up to  ∼1 MeV.",

Up to 30 scatterings are taken into account when computing the migration probabilities, the number of effectively contributing scatterings being strongly dependent on the distance-to-time ratio decreasing when one approaches the propagation front.

The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k).

The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Padé approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda.

The cross sections for deactivation of K(6S) and K(4D) by collisions with H2 were measured. The temperature of the cell body was controlled at 413 K, and H2 pressure was varied between 4 and 40 Pa. The effects of K(6S, 4D)-K collisions could be neglected in our experimental condition. On excitation of K(6S) state, the decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 6S--&gt;4P transition was monitored. The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state. Upon excitation to the K(6S) state, the dependence on H2 pressure of integrated fluorescence in the transition 4D--&gt;4P was measured.

It is well known that each coefficient c(k)(t) separates into an adiabatic term a(k)(t) that reflects the adjustment of the ground state to the perturbation--without actual transitions--and a nonadiabatic term b(k)(t) that yields the probability amplitude for a transition to the excited state. In this work, we prove that the energy at any time t also separates completely into adiabatic and nonadiabatic components, after accounting for the secular and normalization terms that appear in the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation via Dirac's method of variation of constants. This result is derived explicitly through third order in the perturbation. We prove that the cross-terms between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts of c(k)(t) vanish, when the energy at time t is determined as an expectation value. The adiabatic term in the energy is identical to the total energy obtained from static perturbation theory, for a system exposed to the instantaneous perturbation λH'(t). The nonadiabatic term is a sum over excited states ∣k&gt; of the transition probability multiplied by the transition energy. By evaluating the probabilities of transition to the excited eigenstates ∣k'(t)&gt; of the instantaneous Hamiltonian H(t), we provide a physically transparent explanation of the result for E(t). To lowest order in the perturbation parameter λ, the probability of finding the system in state ∣k'(t)&gt; is given by λ(2) ∣b(k)(t)∣(2). At third order, the transition probability depends on a second-order transition coefficient, derived in this work.

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

So far there is no established method available to check if QE actually prevails during the emission of an experimental TL signal. The present study shows that the level of QE changes with a change in the heating rate beta. The change in the level of QE in its turn gets reflected in a change in peak shape when the system turns to a non-QE condition. This property is used as the first ever experimental method to test whether or not the emission of a given glow peak occurs under the QE condition. An essential condition for holding the QE condition is found to be T(R)/taum&gt; or = 10(-3) where T(R) and taum are the glow peak recording duration and the maximum value of the free carrier lifetime, respectively. This relation between T(R) and taum is useful in finding the approximate value of taum.

For the first time, electric dipole moments are also computed in the approach, including SO coupling for transitions to the states responsible for the first absorption continuum (A-band) of ArH(+).

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

The X(1)Σ(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 Å), whereas the A(1)Π state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 Å). The X(1)Σ(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;μ&gt;(υ), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)Π.

The dissipation of the vibrational energy stored in the stretching modes proceeds through vibration-phonon coupling, while the dissipation through electronic excitations makes only minor contributions. Recently, we reported the fast relaxation of the H stretch energy on graphene [S. Sakong and P. Kratzer, J. Chem. Phys. 133, 054505 (2010)]. Interestingly, we predict the lifetime of the D stretch to be markedly longer compared to the relaxation of the H stretch. This is unexpected since the vibrational amplitudes at carbon atoms in the joint C-D vibrational modes are larger than in the joint C-H modes, due to the mass ratio m(D)/m(C) &gt; m(H)/m(C). However, the vibrational relaxation rate for the D stretch is smaller than for the H stretch, because the energy is dissipated to an acoustic phonon of graphene in the case of C-D rather than an optical phonon as is the case in C-H, and hence, the corresponding phonon density of states is lower in the C-D case. To rationalize our findings, we propose a general scheme for estimating vibrational lifetimes of adsorbates based on four factors: the density of states of the phonons that mediates the transitions, the vibration-phonon coupling strength, the anharmonic coupling between local modes, and the number of quanta involved in the transitions. Mainly the first two of these factors are responsible for the differences in the lifetimes of the C-H and C-D stretches. The possible role of the other factors is illustrated in the context of vibrational lifetimes in other recently studied systems.",

Thus, it is well-known how the rate of ionization of R-X is affected by the stabilization of the carbocation R(+), the nature of the leaving group X(-), or the solvent ionizing power. On the other hand, when asked to estimate the half-life of the ionization of a certain substrate in a certain solvent, most chemists resign. This question, however, is crucial in daily laboratory practice. Can a certain substrate R-X be handled in alcoholic or aqueous solution without being solvolyzed? Can a biologically active tertiary amine or azole be released by ionization of a quaternary ammonium ion? In this Account, we describe a straightforward means of addressing such experimental concerns. A semiquantitative answer to these questions is given by the correlation equation log k(25 °C) = s(f)(N(f) + E(f)), in which carbocations R(+) are characterized by the electrofugality parameter E(f), and leaving groups X(-) in a certain solvent are characterized by the nucleofugality parameter N(f) and the nucleofuge-specific sensitivity parameter s(f). As s(f) is typically around 1 (0.8 &lt; s(f) &lt; 1.2), ionization half-lives of around 1 h at 25 °C can be expected when E(f) + N(f) = -4. This correlation equation is formally analogous to the linear free energy relationship that was used to derive the most comprehensive nucleophilicity and electrophilicity scales presently available (Mayr, H.; Bug, T.; Gotta, M. F.; Hering, N.; Irrgang, B.; Janker, B.; Kempf, B.; Loos, R.; Ofial, A. R.; Remennikov, G.; Schimmel, H. Reference Scales for the Characterization of Cationic Electrophiles and Neutral Nucleophiles. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9500-9512). By subjecting 628 solvolysis rate constants k(25 °C) for different benzhydryl derivatives (aryl(2)CH-X) to a least-squares minimization on the basis of the correlation equation, we obtained and tabulate here (i) the electrofugality parameters E(f) for 39 benzhydrylium ions and (ii) the nucleofuge-specific parameters N(f) and s(f) for 101 combinations of common leaving groups and solvents. We show that the E(f) parameters of the reference electrofuges can be used to determine N(f) and s(f) for almost any combination of leaving group and solvent. The nucleofuge-specific parameters of the reference systems can analogously be used to derive the electrofugalities E(f) of other types of carbocations. While it has long been recognized that good nucleophiles are not necessarily poor nucleofuges, it is now reported that there is also no general inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality. Although more electrophilic methyl- and methoxy-substituted benzhydrylium ions are generally weaker electrofuges, the inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality breaks down in the series of amino-substituted benzhydrylium ions. Because neither differential solvation of the carbocations nor steric effects are explicitly considered by this treatment, predictions for substrates not belonging to the benzhydrylium series are only reliable within a factor of 10. This is hardly acceptable to physical organic chemists, who are used to high precision within narrow groups of compounds. The synthetic chemist, however, who is seeking orientation in a reactivity range of 25 orders of magnitude, might appreciate the simplicity of this approach, which only requires considering the sum E(f) + N(f) or consulting our summary graphs.",

Five mixed quantum/classical methods are tested: one mean-field approach (the coherent switching with decay of mixing method), two surface-hopping methods [the fewest switches with time uncertainty (FSTU) and FSTU with stochastic decay (FSTU/SD) methods], and two surface-hopping methods with zero-point energy (ZPE) maintenance [the FSTUSD+trajectory projection onto ZPE orbit (TRAPZ) and FSTUSD+minimal TRAPZ (mTRAPZ) methods]. We found a qualitative difference between final NH(2) internal energy distributions obtained for n(2)=0 and n(2)&gt;1, as observed in experiments. Distributions obtained for n(2)=1 present an intermediate behavior between distributions obtained for smaller and larger n(2) values. The dynamics is found to be highly electronically nonadiabatic with all these methods. NH(2) internal energy distributions may have a negative energy tail when the ZPE is not maintained throughout the dynamics. The original TRAPZ method was designed to maintain ZPE in classical trajectories, but we find that it leads to unphysically high internal vibrational energies. The mTRAPZ method, which is new in this work and provides a general method for maintaining ZPE in either single-surface or multisurface trajectories, does not lead to unphysical results and is much less time consuming. The effect of maintaining ZPE in mixed quantum/classical dynamics is discussed in terms of agreement with experimental findings. The dynamics for n(2)=0 and n(2)=6 are also analyzed to reveal details not available from experiment, in particular, the time required for quenching of electronic excitation and the adiabatic energy gap and geometry at the time of quenching.",

Upon excitation at wavelength 266 nm, we measured the fluorescence curves that exhibit a rise time constant approximately 100 fs, and two decay time constants, 7-65 ps and approximately 1 ns. We attribute the former decay to upper excited states to the S(1) state, and the latter decay to geometric relaxation and the lifetime of the S(1) state. Only the tens of picosecond decay shows a dependence on the solvent viscosity, indicating that the torsional motion dominates the relaxation. Theoretical calculations were performed to obtain the optimized structures of the free [(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diyldi-2,1-ethenediyl]bis(dimethylsilane) molecule in its ground and first excited states with methods B3LYP/6-311G(d) and CIS/6-311G(d), respectively.

Resulted analytical power-like decay function provides good fits to highly complex fluorescence kinetics. Moreover, this is a manifestation of so-called Tsallis q-exponential function, which is suitable for description of the systems with long-range interactions, memory effect, as well as with fluctuations of the characteristic lifetime of fluorescence. The proposed decay function was used to study effect of the interaction of E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP-I, the product of the deoD gene) with its specific inhibitor, viz. formycin A (FA), on fluorescence decays of ligand and enzyme tyrosine residues, in the presence of orthophosphate (P(i), a natural co-substrate). The power-like function provides new information about enzyme-ligand complex formation based on the excited state mean lifetime, heterogeneity parameter (q) and a number (N) of decay channels obtained from the variance of gamma distribution of fluorescence decay rates. With FA, which exists as a 85:15 mixture of the N(1)-H and N(2)-H tautomeric forms in aqueous solution, fluorescence intensity decay (lambda(exc)/lambda(em) 270/335 nm) is described by q approximately 1 and N approximately 200. Consequently power-like decay function converges to the single-exponential form, and lifetime distribution to the Dirac delta function. In contrast, selective excitation of the N(2)-H tautomer at higher wavelength led to a highly heterogenic fluorescence decay characterized by q&gt;1 and 10-fold lower number of decay channels. Heterogeneity of fluorescence decays of both PNP-I and FA is enhanced by PNP-FA-P(i) complex formation, reflecting a shift of the tautomeric equilibrium of FA in favor of the N(2)-H species, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from protein tyrosine residue (Tyr160) to the bound N(2)-H tautomer. Moreover, proposed model is simple, and objectively describes heterogeneous nature of studied systems.",

A range of VDW binding energies from 1.5 to 9.0 kcal mol(-1) are investigated. The anisotropic PES for the ClO.N(2) complex and a separable anharmonic oscillator approximation are used to estimate the equilibrium constant for formation of the VDW complex. Rate constants, branching ratios to produce ClOOCl, and nascent energy distributions of excited ClOOCl* are discussed with respect to the VDW binding energy and temperature. Interestingly, even for weak VDW binding energies, the N(2) usually carries away enough energy to stabilize the nascent ClOOCl*, although the VDW equilibrium constant is small. For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant.

For high radical concentrations (∼100 mM) the leakage factor is approximately 1 and, provided sufficient microwave power is available, the saturation factor is also approximately 1. In this situation the DNP enhancement is solely a product of the ratio of the electron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios and the coupling factor enabling the latter to be directly determined. Although the use of high microwave power levels needed to ensure saturation causes rapid heating of the sample, this does not prevent maximum DNP enhancements, ε(0), being obtained since T(1I) is very much less than the characteristic heating time at these concentrations. It is necessary, however, to know the temperature variation of T(1I) to allow accurate modelling of the behaviour. The DNP enhancement is found to vary linearly with temperature with ε(0)(T) = -2 ± 2 - (1.35 ± 0.02)T for 6 °C ≤ T ≤ 100 °C. The value determined for the coupling factor, 0.055 ± 0.003 at 25 °C, agrees very well with the molecular dynamics simulations of Sezer et al. (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2009, 11, 6626) who calculated 0.0534, however the experimental values increase much more rapidly with increasing temperature than predicted by these simulations. Large DNP enhancements (|ε(0)| &gt; 100) are reported at high temperatures but it is also shown that significant enhancements (e.g.∼40) can be achieved whilst maintaining the sample temperature at 40 °C by adjusting the microwave power and irradiation time. In addition, short polarisation times enable rapid data acquisition which permits further enhancement of the signal, such that useful liquid state DNP-NMR experiments could be carried out on very small samples.",

We have characterized the energetic and structural properties of unsupported neutral Aln (2 &lt;or= n &lt;or= 65) particles (clusters and nanoparticles) via molecular dynamics quenching simulations with a recently validated many-body analytic potential. For each particle size (n), the global minimum-energy structure, the distribution of the local energy minima, and the finite-temperature thermodynamics have been calculated, the latter by evaluating approximately 100,000 rovibrational partition functions for the low-energy isomers of the various particles. This analysis demonstrates that the dominant structures of clusters and nanoparticles depend on temperature as well as particle size and that one must consider statistical mechanics as well as electronic structure in determining the dominant structures, stabilities, and properties of nanoparticles. As a particularly dramatic example, although the electronic magic numbers of Aln are n = 13, 19, 23, 38, and 55 when thermal energy is neglected, the n = 38 magic number is found to become unstable relative to its neighbors (n = 37 and 39) at temperatures of 500 K and above due to vibrational energy and entropy effects. Furthermore, an energy-landscape analysis based on the probability of finding an isomer demonstrates that for many particle sizes, the global-minimum-energy structure on the potential energy surface is not the dominant structure at moderate temperatures, and other low-energy isomers may be dominant at temperatures as low as room temperature. For example, the four lowest-energy structures account for less than 50% of the population for n = 17, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41-43, 50, 56, 58, and 63-65 at 300 K and for n = 10, 11, and 17-65 at 1500 K. At 1500 K, even the 64 lowest-energy structures account for less than half the population for n = 23, 27-55, and 57-65. The increased importance of higher-energy structures at finite temperatures has important implications for understanding the size-selective reactivity and catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles. The isomeric energy (EIso), which is the difference between the thermal average energy of the particle and that of the corresponding global minimum structure in the ground electronic state, is introduced as an indicator of how well the thermochemical properties of a multi-isomer particle can be represented by those of the global minimum structure.

The ergodic principle of the collision is employed in two limiting cases, neglecting (weak ergodic limit) or accounting for explicit degeneracies of the reaction mechanisms (strong ergodic limit).

A critical discussion of the dependence of structural and thermal parameters on resolution for these compounds is presented. Results of refinements against X-ray data, cut off to different resolutions from the high-resolution data files, are compared to structural models derived from neutron diffraction experiments. The Independent Atom Model (IAM) and the Transferable Aspherical Atom Model (TAAM) are tested. The average differences between the X-ray and neutron structural parameters (with the exception of valence angles defined by H atoms) decrease with the increasing 2θmax angle. The scale of differences between X-ray and neutron geometrical parameters can be significantly reduced when data are collected to the higher, than commonly used, 2θmax diffraction angles (for Mo Kα 2θmax &gt; 65°). The final structural and thermal parameters obtained for the studied compounds using TAAM refinement are in better agreement with the neutron values than the IAM results for all resolutions and all compounds. By using TAAM, it is still possible to obtain accurate results even from low-resolution X-ray data. This is particularly important as TAAM is easy to apply and can routinely be used to improve the quality of structural investigations [Dominiak (2015 ▸). LSDB from UBDB. University of Buffalo, USA]. We can recommend that, in order to obtain more adequate (more accurate and precise) structural and displacement parameters during the IAM model refinement, data should be collected up to the larger diffraction angles, at least, for Mo Kα radiation to 2θmax = 65° (sin θmax/λ &lt; 0.75 Å(-1)). The TAAM approach is a very good option to obtain more adequate results even using data collected to the lower 2θmax angles.

Collected reflections were integrated using the latest version of the program VIIPP which uses separate Kα(1)/Kα(2) contributions to the profile fitting during integration. For each temperature both anharmonic and harmonic descriptions of the atomic thermal motion were utilized in the model refinements along with the multipole expansion of the electron density. H atoms were refined anisotropically and agree well with a previous neutron study. Topological analysis [Bader (1990). Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory. The International Series of Monographs of Chemistry, edited by J. Halpern &amp; M. L. H. Green. Oxford: Clarendon Press] of the attained electron density followed. For 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (HMX), old data collected at 20 and 120 K were re-integrated with the new version of VIIPP and refined in the same manner as for RDX. In both cases theoretical structure factors were also calculated based on the 20 K structures, and employed in comparison multipole refinements for the atoms at rest. Limiting the refinement to a harmonic model of the atomic displacements may result in a biased and erroneous electron density, especially when atomic vibrations are significant (as in RDX) and at temperatures higher than obtained by using liquid helium. Given the similarity of the two compounds the effects of anharmonic motion are strikingly more severe in the case of RDX. Our study reinforces the conclusion of Meindl et al. [Acta Cryst. (2010), A66, 362-371] that in certain cases it is necessary to include anharmonic term(s) of the probability density function (or temperature factor) in order to obtain a meaningful electron density suitable for topological analysis, even for compact (high-density) light-atom structures. For RDX it was observed that the oxygen lone-pair concentrations of electrons are located close to perpendicular to the N-O bond vectors, which is typical for explosive materials. Conjugation of the electron density in the -N-NO(2) fragment has been established based on the topological bond orders. Nine moderately strong hydrogen bonds and nine N-N, O-N and O-O bonding interactions were found and described. The RDX molecular electronic energy per mole is 4.02-4.04 a.u., very close to the reported value for HMX.",

In contrast to previous interpretation of the R&lt;--&gt;T transition in some CPs as cation ordering, T-distortion is regarded here as a particular case of general adaptation of the framework to cation insertion, which includes the deformations of the coordination polyhedra and their tilting. The research is based on a combination of experimental studies (in-situ neutron diffraction at different temperatures) for one model compound, MgMo6Se8, and structural analysis for a variety of known CPs. This analysis shows that the structure flexibility is fundamentally different for the R and T forms. As a result of the lower flexibility, in the R form, a strict correlation exists between the compression of the framework along the -3 symmetry axis and the cation position in the structure (the so-called 'delocalization'). The decreasing delocalization in the R-CPs, which occurs on cooling, leads to excessive repulsion within the cations pairs (R-Cu1.8Mo6S8 case) or undesirable asymmetry in the cation polyhedra (R-MgMo6Se8 case). The higher flexibility of the T framework allows for relaxation of these structural strains by increasing the cation-cation distances and forming a more symmetric cation environment, sometimes with higher coordination number (CN), like CN=5 in the T-Fe2Mo6S8 type. Thus, this work also proposes possible driving forces for T-distortion in CPs.",

The more expensive G3B3 method predicts heats of formation that are too negative as compared with the CCSD(T)/CBS values by up to 3-4 kcal/mol. DFT using the B3LYP functional and 6-311+G** basis set predict isodesmic reaction energies to within a few kcal/mol compared with the CCSD(T)/CBS method so isodesmic reactions involving BN compounds and the analogous hydrocarbons can be used to estimate heats of formation.

Enthalpies, entropies, and free energies are calculated for many dehydrocoupling and dehydrogenation reactions that convert BNH6 to alicyclic and cyclic oligomers and H2(g).

The condensed phase reaction free energies are less negative compared with the gas-phase reactions but are still too favorable for BNH6 to be regenerated from either c-B3N3H12 or c-B3N3H6 by just an overpressure of H2.",

The observed systematic changes with T are shown to be consistent with the dissolution of hexagonal [B3O6] boroxol rings, which are abundant in the glass, whilst the high-T (&gt;~1500 K) liquid can be more closely described as a random network structure based on [BO3] triangular building blocks.

Our conclusions are supported by both first-principles and polarizable ion model molecular dynamics simulations which are capable of giving good account of the experimental data, so long as steps are taken to ensure a ring fraction similar to that expected from Raman spectroscopy. The mean thermal expansion of the B-O bond has been measured directly to be αBO  =  3.7(2)  ×  10−6 K−1, which accounts for a few percent of the bulk expansion just above the glass transition temperature, but accounts for greater than one third of the bulk expansion at temperatures in excess of 1673 K.",

These three types of structural change are highly correlated throughout the investigated temperature range of 20 to 93 degrees C. Raman bands diagnostic of purine and pyrimidine unstacking, conformational rearrangements in the deoxyribose-phosphate moieties, and changes in environment of phosphate groups have been identified.

The work relies on the magnon-based theory of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) crystal systems of types FFF, AFF, AAF, and AAA [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 9009 (1999)]. The AAF crystal, in particular, shows interesting changes in the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility when the ferromagnetic exchange coupling constant is varied. We especially show that the susceptibility anomalies of molecular crystals fit naturally within the framework of the extended magnon-theoretical formalism, and do not necessarily imply a FM --&gt; AFM or a reverse phase transition. A real system, molecular crystal of 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl (2,4,6-TPV), has been investigated here. It was previously interpreted as an AAF system from observed susceptibility data [Tomiyoshi et al., Phys. Rev. B 49, 16031 (1994)]. The trend of the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility studied in the present work also indicates that the crystal belongs to the AAF category with a less prominent FM exchange coupling constant. To reinforce our conclusions, we have adopted a two-pronged strategy. First, the geometry of the 2,4,6-TPV monomer has been optimized here by ab initio unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) calculations using the STO-3G basis set. The optimized geometry is almost planar. A subsequent calculation has been carried out with the phenyl rings twisted out of the plane of the nitrogen atoms. The STO-3G optimized geometry, and the same geometry except for the twisted phenyl rings, have been used to perform ab initio coupled-cluster (UCCSD-T) calculations with the same basis, and UHF as well as density-functional (UB3LYP) calculations using the 6-31G basis set. The calculated data can easily rationalize the twists while the species remains in crystal. The magnetic category of the crystal has been unambiguously confirmed as AFA from ab initio UHF and UB3LYP calculations of the total energy in different spin states of dimers and trimers along the crystal axes. The computed energy values, however, fail to yield accurate estimates of the exchange coupling constants Ja, Jb, and Jc, because the latter are on the order of 1kBK corresponding to energy differences on the order of 10(-6) hartree between different spin states. In the second approach, the observed features of the susceptibility minimum and maximum have been used to determine the best values of the exchange coupling constants from the theoretical formulas for an anisotropic AFA crystal. The AFM (Ja and Jc) and FM (Jb) exchange coupling constants and the Neel temperature (TN) found from this analysis correspond to Ja + Jc = -1.05 kBK, Jb = 1.35 kBK, and TN = 1.75 K. The calculated J values significantly differ from those estimated from a linear Heisenberg chain model, but generate a susceptibility versus temperature graph that mimics the experimental plot.",

The effects of this change in structure and of intermolecular hydrogen-bonding on nuclear magnetic shielding (i.e., chemical shifts) and the nuclear quadrupolar coupling constants (QCC) are investigated by ab initio molecular orbital and density functional theory calculations. These calculations show that the nitrogen ((15)N and (14)N) and boron ((11)B and (10)B) chemical shifts should be rather insensitive to changes in r(BN) and that the concomitant changes in molecular structure. Calculations on hydrogen-bonded clusters, based on the crystal structure, indicate that H-bonding should also have very little effect on the chemical shifts.

These transitions could be unequivocally assigned since there was residual orthohydrogen at low temperatures (slow conversion to the ground state) resulting in an observable J=1--&gt;0 transition at 5 K (kT=0.48 meV). A doublet in neutron energy loss at approximately 28.5 meV is interpreted as J=1--&gt;2 transitions. In addition to the transitions between rotational states, there are a series of peaks that arise from transitions between center-of-mass translational quantum states of the confined hydrogen molecule. A band at approximately 9 meV can be unequivocally interpreted as a transition between translational states, while broad features at 20, 25, 35, and 50-60 meV are also interpreted to as transitions between translational quantum states. A detailed comparison is made with a recent five-dimensional quantum treatment of hydrogen in the smaller dodecahedral cage in the SII ice-clathrate structure. Although there is broad agreement regarding the features such as the splitting of the J=1 degeneracy, the magnitude of the external potential is overestimated. The numerous transitions between translational states predicted by this model are in poor agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons are also made with three simple exactly solved models, namely, a particle in a box, a particle in a sphere, and a particle on the surface of a sphere. Again, there are too many predicted features by the first two models, but there is reasonable agreement with the particle on a sphere model. This is consistent with published quantum chemistry results for hydrogen in the dodecahedral 5(12) cage, where the center of the cage is found to be energetically unfavorable, resulting in a shell-like confinement for the hydrogen molecule wave function. These results demonstrate that translational quantum effects are very significant and a classical treatment of the hydrogen molecule dynamics is inappropriate under such conditions.",

The importance of these parameters for the thermal NO(x) decomposition (De-NO(x)) process is discussed.

The accuracy of these κ models for DT plasmas has recently been tested against first-principles calculations using the quantum molecular-dynamics (QMD) method; although mainly for high densities (ρ &gt; 100 g/cm3), large discrepancies in κ have been identified for the peak-compression conditions in ICF. To cover the wide range of density-temperature conditions undergone by ICF imploding fuel shells, we have performed QMD calculations of κ for a variety of deuterium densities of ρ = 1.0 to 673.518 g/cm3, at temperatures varying from T = 5 × 103 K to T = 8 × 106 K. The resulting κQMD of deuterium is fitted with a polynomial function of the coupling and degeneracy parameters Γ and θ, which can then be used in hydrodynamic simulation codes. Compared with the \"hybrid\" Spitzer-Lee-More model currently adopted in our hydrocode lilac, the hydrosimulations using the fitted κQMD have shown up to ∼20% variations in predicting target performance for different ICF implosions on OMEGA and direct-drive-ignition designs for the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The lower the adiabat of an imploding shell, the more variations in predicting target performance using κQMD. Moreover, the use of κQMD also modifies the shock conditions and the density-temperature profiles of the imploding shell at early implosion stage, which predominantly affects the final target performance. This is in contrast to the previous speculation that κQMD changes mainly the inside ablation process during the hot-spot formation of an ICF implosion. ",

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies. For example, for the XY (n=2) version of the present model, such a behavior was observed only near criticality. It is shown also that the (metastable state) maximum Lyapunov exponent decreases with N like lambda(max) approximately N-kappa, where for the initial conditions employed herein (maximal magnetization), kappa=0.225+/-0.030, both above and below the critical point.",

We have characterized the energetic and structural properties of unsupported neutral Aln (2 &lt;or= n &lt;or= 65) particles (clusters and nanoparticles) via molecular dynamics quenching simulations with a recently validated many-body analytic potential. For each particle size (n), the global minimum-energy structure, the distribution of the local energy minima, and the finite-temperature thermodynamics have been calculated, the latter by evaluating approximately 100,000 rovibrational partition functions for the low-energy isomers of the various particles. This analysis demonstrates that the dominant structures of clusters and nanoparticles depend on temperature as well as particle size and that one must consider statistical mechanics as well as electronic structure in determining the dominant structures, stabilities, and properties of nanoparticles. As a particularly dramatic example, although the electronic magic numbers of Aln are n = 13, 19, 23, 38, and 55 when thermal energy is neglected, the n = 38 magic number is found to become unstable relative to its neighbors (n = 37 and 39) at temperatures of 500 K and above due to vibrational energy and entropy effects. Furthermore, an energy-landscape analysis based on the probability of finding an isomer demonstrates that for many particle sizes, the global-minimum-energy structure on the potential energy surface is not the dominant structure at moderate temperatures, and other low-energy isomers may be dominant at temperatures as low as room temperature. For example, the four lowest-energy structures account for less than 50% of the population for n = 17, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41-43, 50, 56, 58, and 63-65 at 300 K and for n = 10, 11, and 17-65 at 1500 K. At 1500 K, even the 64 lowest-energy structures account for less than half the population for n = 23, 27-55, and 57-65. The increased importance of higher-energy structures at finite temperatures has important implications for understanding the size-selective reactivity and catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles. The isomeric energy (EIso), which is the difference between the thermal average energy of the particle and that of the corresponding global minimum structure in the ground electronic state, is introduced as an indicator of how well the thermochemical properties of a multi-isomer particle can be represented by those of the global minimum structure.

The individual-site isotherms, obtained for binding repressor dimers to each site of wild-type OR and to appropriate mutant operator templates, were analyzed for the Gibbs energies of intrinsic binding and pairwise cooperative interactions. It is found that dimer affinity for each of the three sites varies inversely with temperature, i.e., the binding reactions are enthalpy driven, unlike many protein-DNA reactions. By contrast, the magnitude of the pairwise cooperativity terms describing interaction between adjacently site-bound repressor dimers is quite small. This result in combination with the recent finding that repressor monomer-dimer assembly is highly enthalpy driven (with delta H degrees = -16 kcal mol-1) [Koblan, K. S., &amp; Ackers, G. K. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7817-7821] indicates that the associative contacts between site-bound repressors that mediate cooperativity are unlikely to be the same as those responsible for dimerization. The intrinsic binding enthalpies for all three sites are negative (exothermic) and nearly temperature-invariant, indicating no heat capacity changes on the scale of those inferred in other protein-DNA systems. However, the three operator sites are affected differentially by temperature: the intrinsic binding free energies for sites OR1 and OR3 change in parallel over the entire range, delta H0OR1 = -23.3 +/- 4.0 kcal mol-1 and delta H0OR3 = -22.7 +/- 1.2 kcal mol-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A new method to calculate the specific detachment rate constants k(det)(E) and the electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon) as functions of the total energy E of the anion and the energy epsilon of the emitted electrons is presented, which is computationally simple but neglects fine structures in the detailed k(det)(E). Reduced electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) were found to be of the form (epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;)(n) exp(-epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) with n approximately = 0.15, whose shape corresponds to thermal distributions only to a limited extent. In contrast, the average energies &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; can be roughly estimated within thermionic emission and finite heat bath concepts.

Researchers typically interpret primary deuterium isotope effects based on two simple guidelines: (i) the KIE for an elementary reaction is normal (k(H)/k(D) &gt; 1) and (ii) the EIE is dictated by deuterium preferring to be located in the site corresponding to the highest frequency oscillator. In this Account, we evaluate the applicability of these rules to the interactions of H-H and C-H bonds with a transition metal center. Significantly, experimental and computational studies question the predictability of primary EIEs in these systems based on the notion that deuterium prefers to occupy the highest frequency oscillator. In particular, the EIEs for (i) formation of sigma-complexes by coordination of H-H and C-H bonds and (ii) oxidative addition of dihydrogen exhibit unusual temperature dependencies, such that the same system may demonstrate both normal (i.e., K(H)/K(D) &gt; 1) and inverse (i.e., K(H)/K(D) &lt; 1) values. The transition between a normal and inverse EIE indicates that these systems do not demonstrate the typical monotonic variation predicted by the van't Hoff relationship. Instead, the calculated EIEs in these systems are 0 at 0 K, increase to a value greater than 1, and then decrease to unity at infinite temperature. This unusual behavior may be rationalized by considering the individual factors that contribute to the EIE. Specifically, the EIE may be expressed in the form EIE = SYM x MMI x EXC x ZPE (where SYM is the symmetry factor, MMI is the mass-moment of inertia term, EXC is the excitation term, and ZPE is the zero-point energy term), and the distinctive temperature profile results from the inverse ZPE (enthalpy) and normal [SYM x MMI x EXC] (entropy) components opposing each other and having different temperature dependencies. At low temperatures, the ZPE component dominates and the EIE is inverse, while at high temperatures, the [SYM x MMI x EXC] component dominates and the EIE is normal. The inverse nature of the ZPE term is a consequence of the rotational and translational degrees of freedom of RH (R = H, CH(3)) becoming low-energy isotopically sensitive vibrations in the product, while the normal nature of the [SYM x MMI x EXC] component results from deuterium substitution having a larger impact on the moment of inertia of the smaller molecule.",

Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to evaluate the effects of specific DNA binding on thermal melting of the N-terminal and C-terminal repressor domains. Principal findings of this study are as follows: (1) Binding of repressor to each of the DNA operators is dominated by a large negative enthalpy, in agreement with earlier van't Hoff analyses of quantitative footprint titration data [Koblan &amp; Ackers (1992) Biochemistry 31, 57-65]. The calorimetric data also revealed negative heat capacities for cI binding that are of comparable magnitude with many other systems [Spolar &amp; Record (1994) Science 263, 777-784]. However, this feature in combination with the large negative values of binding enthalpies leads to an enthalpic dominance throughout the physiological temperature range. The resulting thermodynamic profile is opposite to the entropically dominated binding observed for many systems, including lambda cro repressor which binds to the same sites as cI and also employs a helix-turn-helix binding domain [Takeda et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 8180-8184]. It is suggested that these thermodynamic differences may arise from interactions of the cI repressor's N-terminal \"arm\" with the DNA. (2) Repressor monomers do not bind significantly to DNA containing either a consensus half-site or a nonconsensus half-site. Binding affinity to the double-consensus operator is much weaker than to any of the natural full-site operators. The same was found with other combinations of half-sites. A mutant repressor (PT158) which is severely defective in dimerization [Burz et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 8399-8405] was also found to bind only full-site operators and showed dimeric stoichiometry. (3) The thermal melting unit for N-terminal domains in the absence of DNA was found to reach values of 6-8 (monomer units) at concentrations where high-order oligomers of wild-type protein are formed [Senear et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 6179-6189]. However, in the presence of DNA operator sites, the cooperative unit for thermal unfolding was reduced to precisely two monomers, indicating that the N-terminal domain binds strictly as a dimer.

The present results confirm the significant role of radical complexes in the recombination kinetics of benzyl-type radicals in the gas-liquid transition range.

However, the fractionation factors between gas and melt phases during evaporation that are required to model these planetary volatile depletion processes are still sparse. In this study, twenty heating experiments were conducted in 1 atm gas-mixing furnaces to constrain the behavior of K, Cu, and Zn evaporation and isotopic fractionation from basaltic melts at high temperatures. The temperatures range from 1300 °C to 1400 °C, and durations are from 2 to 8 days. Oxygen fugacities (<if</iO<sub2</sub) range from one log unit below to ten log units above that of the iron-wüstite buffer (IW-1 to IW+10, corresponding to log<if</iO<sub2</sub of -10.7 to -0.68 at 1400 °C). The conditions were selected to achieve an evaporation-dominated regime (where timescales of diffusion &lt;&lt; evaporation for trace elements) in order to avoid diffusion-limited evaporation. Our results show during evaporation Zn behaved as the most volatile, followed by Cu and then K, regardless of temperature and oxygen fugacity. Partitioning of Zn into spinel layers within experimental capsules, however, has been observed, which has substantial effects on the Zn isotope fractionation factor. Therefore, Zn results are presented but further discussion is excluded. Element loss depends on both temperature and oxygen fugacity, where higher temperatures and lower oxygen fugacities promote evaporation. However, with varying temperature and oxygen fugacity, the kinetic isotopic fractionation factors, α (where, <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:mfrac<mml:mrow<mml:miR</mml:mi</mml:mrow <mml:mrow <mml:msub<mml:mrow<mml:miR</mml:mi</mml:mrow <mml:mrow<mml:mn0</mml:mn</mml:mrow </mml:msub </mml:mrow </mml:mfrac <mml:mo=</mml:mo <mml:msup<mml:mrow<mml:mif</mml:mi</mml:mrow <mml:mrow<mml:miα</mml:mi <mml:mo-</mml:mo <mml:mn1</mml:mn</mml:mrow </mml:msup </mml:math ), for K and Cu remain constant, thus these factors can be applied to a wider range of conditions than those in this study. The experimentally determined fractionation factors for K, and Cu during evaporation from basaltic melts are 0.9944, and 0.9961, respectively. The fractionation factors for these elements with varying volatilities are all significantly larger than the \"apparent observed fractionation factors,\" which approach one and are inferred from lunar basalts relative to the Bulk Silicate Earth.

To derive a generically valid maximum averaging area, an analytical approximation for the peak temperature increase caused by localized exposure was derived. The results for a threshold value of 1 K temperature rise were validated against simulations of a series of sources composed of electrical and magnetic elements (dipoles, slots, patches, and arrays) that represented the spectrum of relevant transmitters. The validation was successful for frequencies in which the power deposition occurred superficially (i.e., &gt;10 GHz). In conclusion, the averaging area for a PD limit of 10 W/m<sup2</sup that conservatively limits the temperature increase in the skin to less than 1 K at any distance &gt;2 mm from the transmitters is frequency dependent, increases with distance, and ranges from 3 cm<sup2</sup at &lt;10 GHz to 1.9 cm<sup2</sup at 100 GHz.

The vibrational energy levels were selected by using a semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) quantization procedure while the relative translational energy was sampled from a Boltzmann weighted distribution. The rate coefficient for the formation of the OH + O products is seen to increase monotonically with quantum number and nearly monotonically with temperature. On the MB PES, at T = 1000 K, the total rate coefficient increases by a factor of 5.2 as the initial vibrational quantum number of the O(2) diatom increases from v = 6 to v = 10.

In particular, at T = 4000 K, the two PESs used in this work differ dramatically in the roles of the less-direct and more-direct trajectories. The behavior of the more-direct and less-direct groups of trajectories can be understood in terms of the efficiency of intramolecular vibrational energy transfer.

These hot plasmas were obtained by additional electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), at the frequency of 140 Ghz, during the current ramp-up phase of the discharge. Injecting 400 kW on axis and 800 kW slightly off axis, the peak central electron temperature reached 8.0 and 7.0 keV, respectively, for a time much longer than the ionization equilibrium time of the molybdenum ions. X-ray emissions from rarely observed high charge states, Mo30+ to Mo39+, have been studied with moderate spectral resolution (lambda/delta lambda approximately 150) and a time resolution of 5 ms. A sophisticated collisional-radiative model for the study of molybdenum ions in plasmas with electron temperature in the range 4-20 keV is presented. The sensitivity of the x-ray emission to the temperature and to impurity transport processes is discussed. This model has been then used to investigate two different plasma scenarios. In the first regime the ECRH heating occurs on axis during the current ramp up phase, when the magnetic shear is evolving from negative to zero up to the half radius. The spectrum is well reproduced with the molybdenum ions in coronal equilibrium and with a central impurity peaking. In the second regime, at the beginning of the current flat top when magnetic shear is monotonic and sawtoothing activity is appearing, the lowest charge states (Mo33+ to Mo30+), populated off axis, are affected by anomalous transport and the total molybdenum profile is found to be flat up to the half radius. We conclude with the presentation of \"synthetic spectra\" computed for even higher temperature plasmas that are expected in future experiments with higher ECRH power input.",

The origins of the X 1A1--&gt;X+ 2A1 and X 1A1--&gt;A+ 2B2 transitions could be determined from the rotational structure of the bands, the photoionization selection rules, the photoionization efficiency curve, and comparison with ab initio calculations. The first adiabatic ionization energy of O3 was measured to be 101,020.5(5) cm(-1) [12.524 95(6) eV] and the energy difference between the X+ 2A1 (0,0,0) and A+ 2B2 (0,0,0) states was determined to be DeltaT0=1089.7(4) cm(-1). Whereas the X--&gt;X+ band consists of an intense and regular progression in the bending (nu2) mode observed up to v2+=4, only the origin of the X--&gt;A+ band was observed.

The appearance of the spectrum, which is regular up to 102,300 cm(-1), changes abruptly at approximately 102,500 cm(-1), a position above which the spectral density increases markedly and the rotational structure of the bands collapses. On the basis of ab initio calculations, this behavior is attributed to the onset of large-amplitude motions spreading through several local minima all the way to large internuclear distances. The ab initio calculations are consistent with earlier results in predicting a seam of conical intersections between the X+ and A+ states approximately 2600 cm(-1) above the cationic ground state and demonstrate the existence of potential minima at large internuclear distances that are connected to the main minima of the X+ and A+ states through low-lying barriers.",

The present experimental results have been combined with the most accurate earlier studies to derive an evaluation over the extended temperature range of 252-1663 K. The three parameter expression k1=2.08x10(-17) T1.5513 exp(-1848 K/T) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1) describes the rate behavior over this temperature range.

This deviation from simple van't Hoff behavior, and the occurrence of a maximum in the EIE, is the result of the entropy term being temperature dependent.

Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain and interpret TL. Here, we show analytically that observations randomly sampled in blocks from any skewed frequency distribution with four finite moments give rise to TL. We do not claim this is the only way TL arises. We give approximate formulae for the TL parameters and their uncertainty. In computer simulations and an empirical example using basal area densities of red oak trees from Black Rock Forest, our formulae agree with the estimates obtained by least-squares regression. Our results show that the correlated sampling variation of the mean and variance of skewed distributions is statistically sufficient to explain TL under random sampling, without the intervention of any biological or behavioral mechanisms. This finding connects TL with the underlying distribution of population density (or other nonnegative quantity) and provides a baseline against which more complex mechanisms of TL can be compared. ",

For H=1/2, x(t) is a Brownian motion, while for H≠1/2, x(t) is a non-Markovian process.

Pulled fronts are fronts that propagate into an unstable state, and the asymptotic front speed is equal to the linear spreading speed v(*) of small linear perturbations about the unstable state. In this paper, we study the front propagation in a simple stochastic lattice model. A detailed analysis of the microscopic picture of the front dynamics shows that for the description of the far tip of the front, one has to abandon the idea of a uniformly translating front solution. The lattice and finite particle effects lead to a \"stop-and-go\" type dynamics at the far tip of the front, while the average front behind it \"crosses over\" to a uniformly translating solution. In this formulation, the effect of stochasticity on the asymptotic front speed is coded in the probability distribution of the times required for the advancement of the \"foremost bin.\" We derive expressions of these probability distributions by matching the solution of the far tip with the uniformly translating solution behind. This matching includes various correlation effects in a mean-field type approximation. Our results for the probability distributions compare well to the results of stochastic numerical simulations. This approach also allows us to deal with much smaller values of N than it is required to have the ln(-2)N asymptotics to be valid. Furthermore, we show that if one insists on using a uniformly translating solution for the entire front ignoring its breakdown at the far tip, then one can obtain a simple expression for the corrections to the front speed for finite values of N, in which various subdominant contributions have a clear physical interpretation.",

A well-resolved acceleration of the time decay of the width of the analyticity strip δ(t) is observed at the highest resolution for 3.7&lt;t&lt;3.85 while preliminary three-dimensional visualizations show the collision of vortex sheets. The BKM criterion on the power-law growth of the supremum of the vorticity, applied on the same time interval, is not inconsistent with the occurrence of a singularity around t≃4. These findings lead us to investigate how fast the analyticity-strip width needs to decrease to zero in order to sustain a finite-time singularity consistent with the BKM theorem. A simple bound of the supremum norm of vorticity in terms of the energy spectrum is introduced and used to combine the BKM theorem with the analyticity-strip method. It is shown that a finite-time blowup can exist only if δ(t) vanishes sufficiently fast at the singularity time. In particular, if a power law is assumed for δ(t) then its exponent must be greater than some critical value, thus providing a new test that is applied to our 4096^{3} Taylor-Green numerical simulation. Our main conclusion is that the numerical results are not inconsistent with a singularity but that higher-resolution studies are needed to extend the time interval on which a well-resolved power-law behavior of δ(t) takes place and check whether the new regime is genuine and not simply a crossover to a faster exponential decay.",

In spite of its formal simplicity, it turns out to be difficult to use at high orders.

In addition, relatively large time steps (up to the field cycle) can be used.

The \"persistence probability,\" P0(t), that the particle has not visited the origin up to time t is calculated for a number of cases. For sigma&gt;1, the force is asymptotically irrelevant (with respect to the noise), and the asymptotics of P0(t) are those of a free random walker. For sigma&lt;1, the noise is (dangerously) irrelevant and the asymptotics of P0(t) can be extracted from a weak noise limit within a path-integral formalism employing the Onsager-Machlup functional. The case sigma=1, corresponding to a logarithmic potential, is most interesting because the noise is exactly marginal. In this case, P0(t) decays as a power law, P0(t) approximately t(-straight theta) with an exponent straight theta that depends continuously on the ratio of the strength of the potential to the strength of the noise. This case, with d=2, is relevant to the annihilation dynamics of a vortex-antivortex pair in the two-dimensional XY model.

Noninteger power-law tails in the probability distribution function of scaled quantities are analyzed in a similar way as in inelastic Maxwell models.

In the case c=d or a+b=1 (a not = 0, 1) , the first-order moment equation admits a closed form solution and gamma and s are calculated analytically from the transcendental equation. It becomes evident that at c=d , exchange rate b of small quantities is irrelevant to power-law tails. In the case c not = d and a+b not = 1 , a closed form solution of the first-order moment equation cannot be obtained because of asymmetry of interactions. However, the moment equation for a singular term formally forms a closed solution and possibility for the presence of power-law tails is shown.

Previous work showed that in a regime where diffusion can be neglected (large Péclet number), the structures are filamental or smooth depending on the relative strength of the chemical dynamics and the stirring induced by the flow. The scaling exponent, gamma(q), of the qth -order structure function depends, at leading order, linearly on the ratio of the rate of decay of the chemical processes, alpha , and the average rate of divergence of neighboring fluid parcel trajectories (Lyapunov exponent), h. Under a homogeneous stretching approximation, gamma(q)/q=max[alpha/h,1] which implies that a well-defined filamental-smooth transition occurs at alpha=h. This approximation has been improved by using the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents to characterize the inhomogeneous stretching of the flow. However, previous work focused more on the behavior of the exponents as q varies and less on the effects of alpha and hence the implications for the filamental-smooth transition. Here we set out the precise relation between the stretching rate statistics and the scaling exponents and emphasize that the latter are determined by the distribution of the finite-size (rather than finite-time) Lyapunov exponents. We clarify the relation between the two distributions. We show that the corrected exponents, [symbol: see text] depend nonlinearly on alpha with [formula: see text]. The magnitude of the correction to the homogeneous stretching approximation, [formula: see text], grows as alpha increases, reaching a maximum when the leading-order transition is reached (alpha=h). The implication of these results is that there is no well-defined bulk filamental-smooth transition. Instead it is the case that the chemical field is unambiguously smooth for alpha&gt;h(max), where h(max) denotes the maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponent and unambiguously filamental for alpha&lt;h, with an intermediate character for alpha between these two values. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical results obtained for a linearly decaying chemistry coupled to a renewing type of flow together with careful calculations of the Crámer function.",

The sum of the initial terms of the asymptotic series up to, and including, the least term often furnishes a fair approximation to the desired value of the function being evaluated. It was early observed by computers that if the terms of the asymptotic series alternate in sign, this approximation was often improved by replacing the least term by its half. The factor by which the least term of the asymptotic series must be multiplied so that the true value of the function being evaluated is obtained by addition of this modified least term to the remaining initial terms of the asymptotic series is known as the converging factor for the asymptotic series. The converging factor for the asymptotic series involved in the calculation of the exponential integral, for large negative values of the argument, was given as a power series in the reciprocal of the argument by Airey; the first term of this series is (1/2).

The approach involves solving the corresponding Dirichlet problem H(R)Psi(R)=E(R)Psi(R) on a finite interval [-R,R] by the Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory (RSPT). The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k). The summation of the latter series with large lambda for the octic case is considered as an extremely challenging summation problem, in part, since it was rigorously proven that the Padé approximants cannot converge and the two-point Padé approximants, which combine information of the renormalized weak coupling and strong coupling expansions, give relatively good results. The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Padé approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda. The coefficients E((k))(R) are calculated with the eigenvalue series of an operator H(Rn), whose resolvent converges to that of H(R) as n--&gt; infinity. The Padé approximants of the RSPT eigenfunction series Psi(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)psi((k))(R)lambda(k) also provide accurate results for the octic oscillator.",

By combining these methods, the B origin of 2PY at 0(0) (0)+98 cm(-1) and the bands at +218 and +252 cm(-1) are identified as overtones of the S(1) state out-of-plane vibrations nu(1) (') and nu(2) ('), as are the analogous bands of d-2PY. Anharmonic double-minimum potentials are derived for the respective out-of-plane coordinates that predict further nu(1) (') and nu(2) (') overtones and combinations, reproducing approximately 80% of the vibronic bands up to 600 cm(-1) above the 0(0) (0) band. The fluorescence spectra excited at the electronic origins and the nu(1) (') and nu(2) (') out-of-plane overtone levels confirm these assignments. The S(1) nonplanar minima and S(1)&lt;--S(0) out-of-plane progressions are in agreement with the determination of nonplanar vibrationally averaged geometries for the 0(0) (0) and 0(0) (0)+98 cm(-1) upper states by Held et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 95, 8732 (1991)]. The fluorescence lifetimes of the S(1) state vibrations show strong mode dependence: Those of the out-of-plane levels decrease rapidly above 200 cm(-1) excess vibrational energy, while the in-plane vibrations nu(5) ('), nu(8) ('), and nu(9) (') have longer lifetimes, although they are above or interspersed with the \"dark\" out-of-plane states. This is interpreted in terms of an S(1) (') state reaction with a low barrier towards a conical intersection with a prefulvenic geometry. Out-of-plane vibrational states can directly surmount this barrier, whereas in-plane vibrations are much less efficient in this respect. Analysis of the fluorescence spectra allows to identify nine in-plane S(0) (') state fundamentals, overtones of the S(0) state nu(1) (\") and nu(2) (\") out-of-plane vibrations, and &gt;30 other overtones and combination bands.

However, this method has a poor anti-noise capability and is computationally intensive. The aims of this study were to develop a new method based on the 2nd-order B-spline wavelet for calculating AIx, and to compare it with numerical differentiation and Savitzky-Golay digital differentiator (SGDD). All the three methods were applied to pulse waveforms derived from 60 healthy subjects. There was a significantly high correlation between the proposed method and numerical differentiation (r=0.998 for carotid pulses, and r=0.997 for radial pulses), as well as between the proposed method and the SGDD (r=0.995 for carotid pulses, and r=0.993 for radial pulses). In addition, the anti-noise capability of the proposed method was evaluated by adding simulated noise (&gt;10Hz) on pulse waveforms. The results showed that the proposed method was advantageous in noise tolerance than the other two methods. These findings indicate that the proposed method can quickly and accurately calculate AIx with a good anti-noise capability. ",

The summation in real space is performed using an efficient flavor of the McMurchie-Davidson recurrence relation. The expressions for performing summation in the reciprocal space are also derived and implemented. The algorithm for reciprocal space summation allows us to reuse several terms and leads to a significant improvement in efficiency when highly contracted basis functions with large exponents are used.

Analytical closed-form equations for all auxiliary quantities have already been known but they suffer from large digital erosion when some of the parameters are large or small. We derive two differential equations which are obeyed by the most difficult basic integrals. Taking them as a starting point, useful series expansions for small parameter values or asymptotic expansions for large parameter values are systematically derived. The resulting expansions replace the corresponding analytical expressions when the latter introduce significant cancellations. Additionally, we reconsider numerical integration of some necessary quantities and present a new way to calculate the integrand with a controlled precision. All proposed methods are combined to lead to a general, stable algorithm. We perform extensive numerical tests of the introduced expressions to verify their validity and usefulness.

We discuss an implementation of directed-loop updates for the SSE simulations of this model and also introduce a \"multibranch\" cluster update which significantly reduces the autocorrelation times for large K/J. In addition to the pure J-K model, which in the z basis has only off-diagonal terms, we also discuss modifications of the algorithm needed when various diagonal interactions are included.",

Starting from the general SOS method, several simplified SOS formulae are derived. In particular, within the so-called independent mode displaced harmonic oscillator model, it is shown that including the vibronic structure in the absorption and RR spectra only requires the calculation of FC overlap integrals of the type θg0|θev, where g, e, and v stand for the electronic ground state, excited state, and vibrational quantum number, respectively. Additionally, an approximation of the latter approach is introduced, referred as the simplified Φe method, in which the FC factors are neglected. This method is advantageous from the computational point of view and it is demonstrated that it reproduces the main characteristics of the more involved approaches. The merits and drawbacks of the different methods are discussed by applying them to the prototypical compound of Rhodamine 6G. Overall, this work intends to unravel and clarify some differences in the SOS theories of RR scattering. ",

At this regime measurements are sensitive to internal dynamics, and we focus on vibrational dynamics of folded proteins. Exploiting the analogy between proteins and fractals, we perform a general analytic calculation of the displacement two-point correlation functions, &lt;[u(−&gt;)(i)(t)-u(−&gt;)(j)(0)](2)&gt;. We confront the derived expressions with numerical evaluations that are based on protein data bank (PDB) structures and the Gaussian network model (GNM) for a few proteins and for the Sierpinski gasket as a controlled check. We use these calculations to evaluate S(k,t) with arrested rotational and translational degrees of freedom, and show that the decay of S(k,t) is dominated by the spatially averaged mean-square displacement of an amino acid. The latter has been previously shown to evolve subdiffusively in time, &lt;[u(−&gt;)(i)(t)-u(−&gt;)(i)(0)](2)&gt; ~t(ν), where ν is the anomalous diffusion exponent that depends on the spectral dimension d(s) and fractal dimension d(f). As a result, for wave numbers obeying k(2)&lt;u(−&gt;)(2)&gt;≳1, S(k,t) effectively decays as a stretched exponential S(k,t)≃S(k)e(-(Γ(k)t)(β)) with β≃ν, where the relaxation rate is Γ(k)~(k(B)T/mω(o)(2))(1/β)k(2/β), T is the temperature, and mω(o)(2) the GNM effective spring constant describing the interaction between neighboring amino acids. The static structure factor is dominated by the fractal character of the native fold, S(k)~k(-d(f)), with negligible to marginal influence of vibrations. The analytical expressions are first confronted with numerically based calculations on the Sierpinski gasket, and very good agreement is found between simulations and theory. We then perform PDB-GNM-based numerical calculations for a few proteins, and an effective stretched exponential decay of the dynamic structure factor is found, albeit their relatively small size. However, when rotational and translational diffusion are added, we find that their contribution is never negligible due to finite size effects. While we can still attribute an effective stretching exponent β to the relaxation profile, this exponent is significantly larger than the anomalous diffusion exponent ν. We compare our theory with recent neutron spin-echo studies of myoglobin and hemoglobin and conclude that experiments in which the rotational and translational degrees of freedom are arrested, e.g., by anchoring the proteins to a surface, will improve the detection of internal vibrational dynamics.",

We apply new theoretical developments (since 2001) in nearside-farside (NF) theory to provide insights into intricate oscillatory structures in its DCS. It is shown that a simple physically-meaningful parameterization of the scattering (S) matrix, using a background Gaussian term plus a single Regge pole and a quadratic phase, can reproduce, in the forward and sideward directions, the intricate angular scattering obtained from numerical S matrix elements computed from a quantum Born-Oppenheimer-Centrifugal-Sudden scattering technique. This encouraging result suggests that many S matrix elements obtained from computer-intensive calculations can be parameterized in a similar physically-meaningful way. The manner in which the full and NF DCSs change when the Regge pole becomes progressively less important compared to the Gaussian term is also investigated. We report the first application to reactive scattering of the Hatchell NF decomposition, including resummations of the Legendre partial wave series for the scattering amplitude. The Hatchell NF resummed DCSs are compared with the corresponding Fuller NF resummed DCSs for resummation orders of r = 0, 1, 2 and 3. We find that the Fuller NF decomposition always provides a better physical interpretation of the angular scattering. Resummation usually cleans the NF DCSs of unphysical oscillations, especially in the farside (F) DCSs, with the greatest cleaning effect on going from no resummation (r = 0) to first order resummation (r = 1). Identities are derived which relate the Fuller and Hatchell NF subamplitudes for resummation orders, r &gt; 0, to the NF unresummed subamplitudes, r = 0. These identities help us understand the origin of unexpected peaks, which sometimes appear in NF resummed DCSs, together with a simple procedure to remove them. We report Local Angular Momentum (LAM) and DCS x LAM (CLAM) analyses of the angular scattering for r = 0 and r = 1 using the Fuller NF decomposition. The LAM and CLAM analyses provide complementary (yet consistent) information to that obtained from the NF resummed DCSs.

This benchmark has been used to evaluate the performance of 31 popular density functionals, covering local-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). The ab initio benchmark has been obtained by exploring the PESs using a hierarchical series of ab initio methods [up to CCSD(T)] in combination with a hierarchical series of Gaussian-type basis sets (up to aug-cc-pVQZ). Our best CCSD(T) estimates show that the overall barriers for the various pathways increase in the order anti-E2 (X = F) &lt; SN2 (X = F) &lt; SN2 (X = Cl) ∼ syn-E2 (X = F) &lt; anti-E2 (X = Cl) &lt; syn-E2 (X = Cl). Thus, anti-E2 dominates for F(-) + CH3CH2F, and SN2 dominates for Cl(-) + CH3CH2Cl, while syn-E2 is in all cases the least favorable pathway.

The determined SD rotational state distribution in the v=0 vibrational level was found to be approximately statistical, with a small preference for formation of the F1 (Omega=3/2) fine-structure manifold over F2 (Omega=1/2). The branching into the Lambda doublet levels was also investigated, and essentially equal populations of levels of A' and A\" symmetry were found.

Pulled fronts are fronts that propagate into an unstable state, and the asymptotic front speed is equal to the linear spreading speed v(*) of small linear perturbations about the unstable state. In this paper, we study the front propagation in a simple stochastic lattice model. A detailed analysis of the microscopic picture of the front dynamics shows that for the description of the far tip of the front, one has to abandon the idea of a uniformly translating front solution. The lattice and finite particle effects lead to a \"stop-and-go\" type dynamics at the far tip of the front, while the average front behind it \"crosses over\" to a uniformly translating solution. In this formulation, the effect of stochasticity on the asymptotic front speed is coded in the probability distribution of the times required for the advancement of the \"foremost bin.\" We derive expressions of these probability distributions by matching the solution of the far tip with the uniformly translating solution behind. This matching includes various correlation effects in a mean-field type approximation. Our results for the probability distributions compare well to the results of stochastic numerical simulations. This approach also allows us to deal with much smaller values of N than it is required to have the ln(-2)N asymptotics to be valid. Furthermore, we show that if one insists on using a uniformly translating solution for the entire front ignoring its breakdown at the far tip, then one can obtain a simple expression for the corrections to the front speed for finite values of N, in which various subdominant contributions have a clear physical interpretation.",

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between BF% estimated from subcutaneous fat thickness using a previously published Japanese-based prediction equation and DXA-derived BF% in Caucasian middle-aged and older adults. A secondary aim was to develop a new prediction equation for Caucasian adults if the previously published equation did not predict BF% well in Caucasians. Cross-sectional study. One-hundred and two Caucasian adults aged 50-76 years (59 men and 43 women) had ultrasound fat thickness and DXA values measured. A new BF% prediction model was developed using ordinary least squares multiple linear regression. There was a strong correlation between ultrasound predicted and DXA-derived BF% (r = 0.882, p&lt;0.001). Bland-Altman analysis did not indicate a bias in the prediction of BF% for Caucasian adults (r = -0.092, p&gt;0.05). However, the predicted BF% was significantly higher compared to DXA-derived BF% (approximately 4%). A newly developed nonlinear prediction model used to estimate BF% was significant [F(17,84) = 33.44, p&lt;0.001] with an R2 of 0.871 and an adjusted R2 of 0.845.

Methyl radicals were generated by laser flash photolysis of azomethane or acetone. Methylperoxy radicals were monitored by UV absorption at 240 nm.

At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed.

To account for this problem, a two-step approach was proposed to quantify and correct for remobilized nitrogen from vegetative cuttings of Populus balsamifera L. grown with either nitrate (δ15N = 58.5‰) or ammonium (δ15N = -0.96‰). First, the fraction of carry-over nitrogen remaining in the cutting was estimated by isotope mass balance. Then measured δ15N values were adjusted for the fraction of pre-existing nitrogen remobilized to the plant. Mean plant δ15N prior to correction was 49‰ and -5.8‰ under nitrate and ammonium, respectively. Plant δ15N was non-linearly correlated to biomass (r2 = 0.331 and 0.249 for nitrate and ammonium, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) where the δ15N of plants with low biomass approached the δ15N of the pre-existing nitrogen. Approximately 50% of cutting nitrogen was not remobilized, irrespective of size. The proportion of carry-over nitrogen in new growth was not different between sources but ranged from less than 1% to 21% and was dependent on plant biomass and, to a lesser degree, the size of the cutting. The δ15N of newly acquired nitrogen averaged 52.7‰ and -6.4‰ for nitrate and ammonium-grown plants, respectively; both lower than their source values, as expected. Since there was a greater difference in δ15N between the carried-over pre-existing and newly assimilated nitrogen where nitrate was the source, the difference between measured δ15N and adjusted δ15N was also greater. There was no significant relationship between biomass and plant δ15N with either ammonium or nitrate after adjusting for carry-over nitrogen. Here, we provide evidence of remobilized pre-existing nitrogen influencing δ15N of new growth of P. balsamifera L. A simple, though approximate, correction is proposed that can account for the remobilized fraction in the plant. With careful sampling to quantify pre-existing nitrogen, this method can more accurately determine changes in nitrogen isotope discrimination in plants.",

Thus, accurate estimation of LDL-C is required. LDL-C is typically calculated using the Friedewald equation: (total cholesterol) - (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C]) - (triglycerides [TGs]/5). As the equation uses a fixed value equal to 5 as a divisor for TGs, it does not account for inter-individual variability, often resulting in underestimation of risk and potentially undertreatment. It is specifically inapplicable in patients with fasting triglycerides ≥400 mg/dL. A novel method of LDL-C calculation was derived and validated by Martin et al.: (non-HDL-C) - (triglycerides/adjustable factor). This equation uses an adjustable factor, the median TG:very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in strata defined by levels of TG and non-HDLC, as divisor for TGs, and the adjustable factor ranging from 3 to 12 has been shown to provide more accurate estimates of LDL-C compared with the Friedewald equation using a direct assay as the gold standard. We used 70,209 baseline and on-treatment lipid values from the VOYAGER meta-analysis database to determine the difference in calculated LDL-C values using the Friedewald and novel equations. In patients with TGs &lt;400 mg/dL, LDL-C values calculated using the novel equation were plotted against those calculated using the Friedewald equation. The novel equation generally resulted in LDL-C values greater than the Friedewald calculation, with differences increasing with decreasing LDL-C levels; 23% of individuals who reached a LDL-C target of 70 mg/dL with the Friedewald equation did not achieve this target when the novel equation was used to calculate LDL-C; these figures were 8% and 2% for &lt;100 mg/dL and &lt; 130 mg/dL targets, respectively. In patients with triglycerides ≥400 mg/dL, in whom the Friedewald equation is not valid, lipid values calculated using the novel equation were compared with those obtained by β-quantification. Values calculated with the novel equation did not appear to be closely related with those calculated by β-quantification in these patients. In conclusion, the novel equation provides a higher estimation of exact LDL-C values than the Friedewald equation, particularly in patients with low LDL-C levels, which may result in undertreatment of some patients whose LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald method. However, neither may be suitable for patients with TG ≥400 mg/dL.",

The area of this peak, which could be detected in extracts of bloodstains, but not in their fresh whole blood, increased with time. The ratios of the X area to heme area in bloodstains stored at room temperature and 4 degrees C for up to 52 weeks old linearly correlated with stain age by plotting on a double logarithmic scale. In bloodstains exposed to fluorescent light at room temperature, the regression equation calculated from the ratios (Rx) and the ages of stains in weeks (W) is ln(1000.Rx) = 1.1084 + 0.3937.ln(7.W), and the coefficient of correlation (r) is 0.9776 (n = 144, P &lt; 0.001).

They are (1) the sample-based method, and (2) the constrained maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the performance of different statistics and methods.

Based on data from comparative slaughter experiments they mathematically derived the California Net Energy System. Scaling values to body weight to the ¾ power, they summarized metabolizable energy intake (ME), energy retained (energy balance [EB]), and heat production (HP) data. They regressed the logarithm of HP on ME and extended the line to zero intake, and estimated fasting HP at 0.077 Mcal/kg<sup0.75</sup, similar to previous estimates. They found no significant difference in fasting HP between steers and heifers. Above maintenance, however, a logarithmic fit of EB on ME does not allow for increased EB once ME is greater than 340 kcal/kg<sup0.75</sup, or about three times maintenance intake. So based on their previous work, they used a linear fit so that partial efficiency of gain above maintenance was constant for a given feed. They show that with increasing roughage level efficiency of gain (slope) decreases, consistent with increasing efficiency of gain and maintenance with greater metabolizable energy of the feed. Making the system useful required that gain in body weight be related to EB. They settled on a parabolic equation, with significant differences between steers and heifers. Lofgreen and Garrett also used data from a number of experiments to relate ME and EB to estimate the ME required for maintenance (ME = HP) and then related the amount of feed that provided that amount of ME to the metabolizable energy content of the feed (MEc), resulting in a logarithmic equation. Then they related that amount of feed to the net energy for gain calculated as the slope of the EB line when regressed against feed intake. Combining the two equations, they estimate the net energy for maintenance and gain per unit feed (Mcal/kg dry matter) as a function of MEc: 0.4258 × 1.663<supMEc</sup and 2.544-5.670 × 0.6012<supMEc</sup, respectively. Finally, they show how to calculate net energy for maintenance and gain from experiments where two levels of a ration are fed and EB measured, where one level is fed and a metabolism trial is conducted, or when just a metabolism trial is conducted-but results are not consistent between designs.",

Compared with individuals with Lp(a)&lt;10 mg/dL (18 nmol/L), the multifactorially adjusted MACE incidence rate ratios were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.03-1.58) for 10 to 49 mg/dL (18-104 nmol/L), 1.44 (1.12-1.85) for 50 to 99 mg/dL (105-213 nmol/L), and 2.14 (1.57-2.92) for ≥100 mg/dL (214 nmol/L). Independent confirmation was obtained in individuals from the CCHS and CIHDS. To achieve 20% and 40% MACE risk reduction in secondary prevention, we estimated that plasma Lp(a) should be lowered by 50 mg/dL (95% CI, 27-138; 105 nmol/L [55-297]) and 99 mg/dL (95% CI, 54-273; 212 nmol/L [114-592]) for 5 years. High concentrations of Lp(a) are associated with high risk of recurrent CVD in individuals from the general population. This study suggests that Lp(a)-lowering by 50 mg/dL (105 nmol/L) short-term (ie, 5 years) may reduce CVD by 20% in a secondary prevention setting.",

Thus, it is well-known how the rate of ionization of R-X is affected by the stabilization of the carbocation R(+), the nature of the leaving group X(-), or the solvent ionizing power. On the other hand, when asked to estimate the half-life of the ionization of a certain substrate in a certain solvent, most chemists resign. This question, however, is crucial in daily laboratory practice. Can a certain substrate R-X be handled in alcoholic or aqueous solution without being solvolyzed? Can a biologically active tertiary amine or azole be released by ionization of a quaternary ammonium ion? In this Account, we describe a straightforward means of addressing such experimental concerns. A semiquantitative answer to these questions is given by the correlation equation log k(25 °C) = s(f)(N(f) + E(f)), in which carbocations R(+) are characterized by the electrofugality parameter E(f), and leaving groups X(-) in a certain solvent are characterized by the nucleofugality parameter N(f) and the nucleofuge-specific sensitivity parameter s(f). As s(f) is typically around 1 (0.8 &lt; s(f) &lt; 1.2), ionization half-lives of around 1 h at 25 °C can be expected when E(f) + N(f) = -4. This correlation equation is formally analogous to the linear free energy relationship that was used to derive the most comprehensive nucleophilicity and electrophilicity scales presently available (Mayr, H.; Bug, T.; Gotta, M. F.; Hering, N.; Irrgang, B.; Janker, B.; Kempf, B.; Loos, R.; Ofial, A. R.; Remennikov, G.; Schimmel, H. Reference Scales for the Characterization of Cationic Electrophiles and Neutral Nucleophiles. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9500-9512). By subjecting 628 solvolysis rate constants k(25 °C) for different benzhydryl derivatives (aryl(2)CH-X) to a least-squares minimization on the basis of the correlation equation, we obtained and tabulate here (i) the electrofugality parameters E(f) for 39 benzhydrylium ions and (ii) the nucleofuge-specific parameters N(f) and s(f) for 101 combinations of common leaving groups and solvents. We show that the E(f) parameters of the reference electrofuges can be used to determine N(f) and s(f) for almost any combination of leaving group and solvent. The nucleofuge-specific parameters of the reference systems can analogously be used to derive the electrofugalities E(f) of other types of carbocations. While it has long been recognized that good nucleophiles are not necessarily poor nucleofuges, it is now reported that there is also no general inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality. Although more electrophilic methyl- and methoxy-substituted benzhydrylium ions are generally weaker electrofuges, the inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality breaks down in the series of amino-substituted benzhydrylium ions. Because neither differential solvation of the carbocations nor steric effects are explicitly considered by this treatment, predictions for substrates not belonging to the benzhydrylium series are only reliable within a factor of 10. This is hardly acceptable to physical organic chemists, who are used to high precision within narrow groups of compounds. The synthetic chemist, however, who is seeking orientation in a reactivity range of 25 orders of magnitude, might appreciate the simplicity of this approach, which only requires considering the sum E(f) + N(f) or consulting our summary graphs.",

We studied three groups: (1) 715 patients with recent myocardial infarction; (2) 274 healthy persons age and sex matched to the infarct sample; and (3) 19 patients with heart transplants. Twenty-four-hour RR-interval power spectra were computed using fast Fourier transforms and log(power) was regressed on log(frequency) between 10(-4) and 10(-2) Hz. There was a power law relation between log(power) and log(frequency). That is, the function described a descending straight line that had a slope of approximately -1 in healthy subjects. For the myocardial infarction group, the regression line for log(power) on log(frequency) was shifted downward and had a steeper negative slope (-1.15). The transplant (denervated) group showed a larger downward shift in the regression line and a much steeper negative slope (-2.08). The correlation between traditional power spectral bands and slope was weak, and that with log(power) at 10(-4) Hz was only moderate. Slope and log(power) at 10(-4) Hz were used to predict mortality and were compared with the predictive value of traditional power spectral bands. Slope and log(power) at 10(-4) Hz were excellent predictors of all-cause mortality or arrhythmic death. To optimize the prediction of death, we calculated a log(power) intercept that was uncorrelated with the slope of the power law regression line. We found that the combination of slope and zero-correlation log(power) was an outstanding predictor, with a relative risk of &gt; 10, and was better than any combination of the traditional power spectral bands. The combination of slope and log(power) at 10(-4) Hz also was an excellent predictor of death after myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction or denervation of the heart causes a steeper slope and decreased height of the power law regression relation between log(power) and log(frequency) of RR-interval fluctuations. Individually and, especially, combined, the power law regression parameters are excellent predictors of death of any cause or arrhythmic death and predict these outcomes better than the traditional power spectral bands.",

We included 5414 Danish patients diagnosed with ischemic heart disease. Patients on statins were not excluded. Calculated remnant cholesterol was nonfasting total cholesterol minus LDL and HDL cholesterol. During 35836 person-years of follow-up, 1319 patients died. We examined both calculated and directly measured remnant cholesterol; importantly, however, measured remnant cholesterol made up only 9% of calculated remnant cholesterol at nonfasting triglyceride concentrations &lt;1 mmol/L (89 mg/dL) and only 43% at triglycerides &gt;5 mmol/L (443 mg/dL).

The computed formation enthalpies are then benchmarked against the values recommended in the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT). The accuracy of the methods have been interpreted in terms of descriptive statistics, including the mean-signed error, mean-unsigned error, maximum average deviation, 2σ uncertainties, and 2×root-mean-square-deviations (2RMSD). The results highlight the following rank order of accuracy for the methods studied G4 &gt; G3 &gt; W1BD &gt; CBS-APNO &gt; CBS-QB3. The findings of this work are also considered in light of a recent companion study, which took an identical approach to quantifying the accuracies of these methods for 48 closed-shell singlet CxHyOz compounds. A similar order of accuracies and precisions were observed therein: G3 &gt; G4 &gt; W1BD &gt; CBS-APNO &gt; CBS-QB3. Both studies highlight systematic biases/deviations from the ATcT for the methods investigated, which are discussed in some detail, with methods having clear tendencies to over- or underpredict the recommended formation enthalpies for radical and/or closed-shell CxHyOz compounds. We show that one can improve the accuracy of their computation, and simultaneously reduce the uncertainty, by taking unweighted average formation enthalpies from various combinations of methods used. The reader should note that the statistical analyses preceding these conclusions also highlight that these error cancellation effects are unique for closed-shell and radical species. By extension, these error-cancellation effects can be expected to be different for various homologous series and chemical functionalities and their closed- and open-shell subgroups. Hence, further benchmarking studies are advised for other homologous series, such that the scientists and engineers (e.g., combustion/atmospheric/astrochemical) who frequently use these methods can assign reasonable uncertainties to their computations, while simultaneously optimizing their computational costs. For CxHyOz compounds, a combination of the CBS-APNO/G3/G4 methods is shown to be quite powerful when the atomization method is employed and is capable of reproducing the ATcT to within \"near-chemical-accuracy\", with 2RMSD (≈95% confidence interval) values of 0.0 ± 4.34 kJ mol(-1) computed for CxHyOz radicals, 0.0 ± 4.22 kJ mol(-1) for closed-shell CxHyOz compounds, with a total uncertainty of 0.0 ± 4.27 kJ mol(-1) subsequently computed considering all 85 CxHyOz compounds. Given the performance of these methods for determination of formation enthalpies when the atomization procedure is employed, we expect isodesmic reactions involving these methods to be capable of achieving chemical accuracy, as illustrated for the case of the tert-butyl radical. We also highlight that there is still disagreement between experiment and theory for this radical, despite its significance in gas-phase chemistry. Kineticists, thermodynamicists, and chemical kinetic modellers alike are warned that the popular CBS-QB3 method is found to have particularly poor performance, with a computed 2RMSD of 0.0 ± 12.51 kJ mol(-1), indicating that one should not apply this method in isolation for formation enthalpy determination unless other error-cancellation strategies are employed.

The &gt;80th percentile cutoff values, however, were 36 mg/dl and 24 mg/dl for the Randox and UCSD assays, respectively. Despite this, Lp(a) levels were significantly associated with CAD risk, with odds ratios of 2.18 (1.58-3.01) and 2.35 (1.70-3.26) for people in the top versus bottom Lp(a) quintile for the Randox and UCSD assays, respectively. This study demonstrates that CAD risk is present at lower Lp(a) levels than the currently suggested optimal Lp(a) level of &lt;50 mg/dl. Appropriate thresholds may need to be population and assay specific until Lp(a) assays are standardized and Lp(a) thresholds are evaluated broadly across all populations at risk for CVD and aortic stenosis.

Among 189 adults [73 males, 116 females; age = 41 to 74 years; mean body mass index (BMI) = 27.3 kg/m(2)], assessments of %BF at the baseline and six months from the baseline were conducted by performing BIA and DXA.

However, most labs still rely on LDL-F and few studies have examined the accuracy and impact of contemporary LDL-C equations applied to a retrospective dataset. 934 lipid panels with a concurrent direct enzymatic LDL-C (dLDL-C) result were extracted from the laboratory information system. LDL-F, LDL-M, and LDL-S were calculated and the accuracy of each equation determined in a predominantly hypertriglyceridemic population. The impact of implementing each equation was compared by analyzing the LDL-C treatment group miscategorization rate relative to dLDL-C. The slope for the LDL-F, LDL-M and LDL-S were 0.59, 0.78, and 0.94, relative to dLDL-C. The three equations performed comparably for samples with TG &lt;4.52 mmol/L (&lt;400 mg/dL).

Its abundance in the lignocellulose makes it a desirable component for converting into various value-added compounds. In this study, conversion of xylose to four linear alkanes has been discussed by five different schemes including their thermochemistry under the framework of density functional theory. Main products are butane, pentane, octane and tridecane whereas the intermediate products include furfural, tetrahydrofuran, pentane-1,5-diol, etc. The simulations have been performed at B3LYP/6-31 + g(d,p) and M06-2X/6-31 + g(d,p) level of theories in aqueous phase using SMD solvation model. Thermochemical parameters (ΔG, ΔH and K<subeq</sub) are obtained at a wide range of temperature, i.e. 298-698 K. Single point energy change (ΔE) of all the conversion steps has also been calculated at M05-2X/6-311++g(3df,2p) level of theory in the aqueous phase. It is observed that temperature plays a vital role in the formation of products. At high temperature, only scheme RS 1 (i.e. xylose to butane) can proceed to produce butane. The absolute difference between two functionals, B3LYP and M06-2X, was found to be small (&lt;2 kcal/mol) for ring opening reactions making both the functionals suitable for a qualitative study. For saturation of cyclic compounds, a large difference (&gt;10 kcal/mol) was observed between the two functionals making higher accuracy method more suitable for them.

Using cardiopulmonary exercise testing, we studied 23 patients after a Fontan operation, and 30 patients after atrial repair for complete transposition of the great arteries, at a mean age of 24+/-10 years. Thirty-five healthy volunteers were used as controls. OUES was calculated from 100% (OUES), the first 50% (OUES(50)), and the last 50% (OUES(50-100)) of the entire exercise duration.

When a node has a BP &lt; 100% and the pattern of BPs fits this function, it is possible to estimate the number of informative sites required to obtain a given average BP.

Ammonium was converted to ammonia by addition of NaOH, followed by nitrogen isotopic analysis of the headspace by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) where complete separation of TAN from the matrix was not necessary. The ammonia concentration in the gas phase was maximised by increasing the temperature and salt concentration and by decreasing the gas liquid ratio in the headspace vials. Isotopic equilibrium was reached after less than 1 h at 80 degrees C. The measured isotopic ratio was constant for solutions containing 30-200 mM NH4-N, corresponding to 950-7000 ng NH3-N detected with the IRMS. The integrated area response at m/z 28 increased linearly with the ammonium ion concentration in the interval 10-200 mM NH4-N.

All relevant quantities are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometers, which means that the machines' inherent high precision of the order of 10(-5) can be fully exploited. External determination of dilution factors with generally lower precision is avoided. The method itself can be implemented within a day, but a calibration of the oxygen and average nitrogen isotope ratios relative to a primary isotopic reference material of known absolute isotopic composition has to be performed separately. The underlying theoretical framework is explored in depth. The effect of interferences due to 14N15N16O and 15N14N16O in the 15N2O sample and due to 15N2+ formation are fully accounted for in the calculation of the final position-dependent nitrogen isotope ratios. Considering all known statistical uncertainties of measured quantities and absolute isotope ratios of primary isotopic reference materials, we achieve an overall uncertainty of 0.9 per thousand (1 sigma). Using tropospheric N2O as common reference point for intercomparison purposes, we find a substantially higher relative enrichment of 15N at the central nitrogen atom over 15N at the terminal nitrogen atom than measured previously for tropospheric N2O based on a chemical conversion method: 46.3 +/- 1.4 per thousand as opposed to 18.7 +/- 2.2 per thousand.

As a homonuclear diatomic molecule, N(2) is difficult to detect spectroscopically through infrared or millimeter-wavelength transitions. Therefore, its abundance is often inferred indirectly through its reaction product N(2)H(+). Two main formation mechanisms, each involving two radical-radical reactions, are the source of N(2) in such environments. Here we report measurements of the low temperature rate constants for one of these processes, the N + CN reaction, down to 56 K. The measured rate constants for this reaction, and those recently determined for two other reactions implicated in N(2) formation, are tested using a gas-grain model employing a critically evaluated chemical network. We show that the amount of interstellar nitrogen present as N(2) depends on the competition between its gas-phase formation and the depletion of atomic nitrogen onto grains. As the reactions controlling N(2) formation are inefficient, we argue that N(2) does not represent the main reservoir species for interstellar nitrogen. Instead, elevated abundances of more labile forms of nitrogen such as NH(3) should be present on interstellar ices, promoting the eventual formation of nitrogen-bearing organic molecules.",

Insights into the mechanism of substrate reduction by nitrogenase have come from recent successes in trapping and characterizing intermediates generated during the reduction of protons as well as nitrogenous and alkyne substrates by MoFe proteins with amino acid substitutions. Here, we describe an intermediate generated at a high concentration during reduction of the natural nitrogenase substrate, N2, by wild-type MoFe protein, providing evidence that it contains N2 bound to the active-site FeMo cofactor. When MoFe protein was frozen at 77 K during steady-state turnover with N2, the S = 3/2 EPR signal (g = [4.3, 3.64, 2.00]) arising from the resting state of FeMo cofactor was observed to convert to a rhombic, S = 1/2, signal (g = [2.08, 1.99, 1.97]). The intensity of the N2-dependent EPR signal increased with increasing N2 partial pressure, reaching a maximum intensity of approximately 20% of that of the original FeMo cofactor signal at &gt; or = 0.2 atm N2. An almost complete loss of resting FeMo cofactor signal in this sample implies that the remainder of the enzyme has been reduced to an EPR-silent intermediate state. The N2-dependent EPR signal intensity also varied with the ratio of Fe protein to MoFe protein (electron flux through nitrogenase), with the maximum signal intensity observed with a ratio of 2:1 (1:1 Fe protein:FeMo cofactor) or higher. The pH optimum for the signal was 7.1. The N2-dependent EPR signal intensity exhibited a linear dependence on the square root of the EPR microwave power in contrast to the nonlinear response of signal intensity observed for hydrazine-, diazene-, and methyldiazene-trapped states. 15N ENDOR spectroscopic analysis of MoFe protein captured during turnover with 15N2 revealed a 15N nuclear spin coupled to the FeMo cofactor with a hyperfine tensor A = [0.9, 1.4, 0.45] MHz establishing that an N2-derived species was trapped on the FeMo cofactor. The observation of a single type of 15N-coupled nucleus from the field dependence, along with the absence of an associated exchangeable 1H ENDOR signal, is consistent with an N2 molecule bound end-on to the FeMo cofactor.",

We have identified a method that is both accurate and efficient to predict E oH values for NACs, using gas-phase quantum mechanics (QM) calculations combined with empirical correlations. First, the adiabatic electron affinity (EA) at 0 K is calculated using the B98/MG3S method, and the predictions are scaled by a factor of 0.802 to account for systematic errors in the density functional calculations. Second, the E oH values are predicted from a linear correlation between E oH and EA. Using this method, E oH values were predicted with a mean absolute deviation from measured values of 0.021 V for the 14 NACs used to obtain the correlation and 0.029 V for six additional NACs. This represents a substantial improvement in accuracy over predictions by other QM methods, which are affected by large errors in solvation or aqueous-phase calculations for some compounds.",

An omnipresent contamination with atmospheric N2 is also taken into account and is furthermore calculable in terms of a fraction. Two different mathematical approaches are presented which permit a precise calculation of the contribution of anammox, denitrification, and atmosphere to a combined N2 mixture. The calculation is based on a single isotopic analysis of a sampled N2 mixture and the determination of the 15N abundance of nitrite and nitrate (simplified approach) or of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate (comprehensive approach). Calculations are even processable under conditions where all basal educts of anammox and denitrification (ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate) are differently enriched in 15N.

These findings call into question whether the reaction parameters (rate constants and Michaelis-Menten concentrations) are function of δ(15) N values, and if these can also lead to significant effects on the bulk reaction rate. Five experiments at initial δ(15) N-NO(3) (-) values ranging from 0‰ to 1700‰ were carried out in a recent study using elemental analyser, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry techniques coupled at various levels. These data were combined here with kinetic equations of isotopologue speciation and fractionation. Our approach specifically addressed the combinatorial nature of reactions involving labeled atoms and explicitly described substrate competition and time-dependent isotopic effects. With the method presented here, we determined with relatively high accuracy that the reaction rate constants increased linearly up to 270% and the Michaelis-Menten concentrations decreased linearly by about 30% over the tested δ(15) N-NO(3) (-) values. Because the parameters were found to depend on the (15) N enrichment level, we could determine that increasing δ(15) N-NO(3) (-) values caused a decrease in bulk nitrification, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction rates by 50% to 60%. We addressed a method that allowed us to quantify the effect of substrate isotopic enrichment on the reaction kinetics. Our results enable us to reject the assumption of constant reaction parameters.

Apparent kinetic isotope effects, AKIEN, for the reduction of four mononitroaromatic compounds by AHQDS- ranged from 1.039 +/- 0.003 to 1.045 +/- 0.002 (average +/- 1sigma), consistent with previous results for various mineral-bound reductants. 15N fractionation for reduction of 1,2-dinitrobenzene and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by AHQDS- and that of 4-chloronitrobenzene by Fe(II)L2(6-), however, showed substantial variability in AKIEN-values which decreased from 1.043 to 1.010 with increasing pH. We hypothesize that the isotope-sensitive and rate-limiting step of the overall NAC reduction can shift from the dehydration of substituted N,N-dihydroxyanilines (large 15N fractionation upon N-O bond cleavage) to protonation or reduction of nitroaromatic radical anions (small 15N isotope effect upon electron transfer) consistent with calculations of semiclassical 15N isotope effects.

Although this method is very useful and reliable its application has been rather infrequent up to now. This is mainly due to the need to measure the m/z 30 in addition to the usually measured m/z 28 and 29 for dinitrogen, because the (15)N in the enriched air sample taken from an enclosure (cover box) at the soil surface is nonrandom. The signal from the m/z 30 is very low and difficult to measure with sufficient precision because other species (e.g. NO) also having the m/z 30 often interfere with its measurement. In this study the accuracy and precision of an easy to use CF-IRMS with sample batch operation to measure the ratio 30/28 was investigated. The relative standard deviation (RSD = precision) from natural abundance up to 2 at.% was always &lt;1%. After correction of the mass ratio 30/28 (R30), by means of a formula obtained by linear regression of theoretical R30 against measured R30, the accuracy of the abundance calculated from this corrected R30 was very high.

However, this technique is both time-consuming and laborious. One way of overcoming these disadvantages could be to couple a TOC analyser to determine the TDN with a sufficient quadrupole MS to determine the 15N abundance. The high TOC analyser (Elementar Analysensysteme Hanau, Germany), which catalytically oxidises the sample's total nitrogen with a high, constant yield to nitrogen monoxide (NO), appeared particularly suitable. The quadrupole-MS ESD 100 (InProcess Instruments Bremen, Germany) proved to be a suitable mass spectrometer for the 15N determination of NO. This combination of instruments was found to provide a workable method in numerous measurements of standard and actual samples. The detection limit concerning the N amount required per analysis is 2 microg, corresponding to an N concentration of 0.7 mg/l in a maximum sample volume of 3ml. Depending on the N concentration, 15N abundances starting from 0.5 at.% can be measured with the required precision of better than 3% (simple standard deviation). For example, measuring the abundance of 0.5 at.% requires about 50 microg N, whereas for 1 at.% or more only about 5 microg N is needed per analysis.",

Although the bulk nitrogen isotope analysis of organic material is not to be questioned, literature from different disciplines using IRMS provides hints that the quantitative conversion of nitrate into nitrogen presents difficulties. We observed abnormal series of δ(15)N values of laboratory standards and nitrates. These unexpected results were shown to be related to the tailing of the nitrogen peak of nitrate-containing compounds. A series of experiments were set up to investigate the cause of this phenomenon, using ammonium nitrate (NH(4)NO(3)) and potassium nitrate (KNO(3)) samples, two organic laboratory standards as well as the international secondary reference materials IAEA-N1, IAEA-N2-two ammonium sulphates [(NH(4))(2)SO(4)]-and IAEA-NO-3, a potassium nitrate. In experiment 1, we used graphite and vanadium pentoxide (V(2)O(5)) as additives to observe if they could enhance the decomposition (combustion) of nitrates. In experiment 2, we tested another elemental analyser configuration including an additional section of reduced copper in order to see whether or not the tailing could originate from an incomplete reduction process. Finally, we modified several parameters of the method and observed their influence on the peak shape, δ(15)N value and nitrogen content in weight percent of nitrogen of the target substances. We found the best results using mere thermal decomposition in helium, under exclusion of any oxygen. We show that the analytical procedure used for organic samples should not be used for nitrates because of their different chemical nature. We present the best performance given one set of sample introduction parameters for the analysis of nitrates, as well as for the ammonium sulphate IAEA-N1 and IAEA-N2 reference materials. We discuss these results considering the thermochemistry of the substances and the analytical technique itself. The results emphasise the difference in chemical nature of inorganic and organic samples, which necessarily involves distinct thermochemistry when analysed by EA-IRMS. Therefore, they should not be processed using the same analytical procedure. This clearly impacts on the way international secondary reference materials should be used for the calibration of organic laboratory standards.",

To verify this by quantifying the amount of N2+ ions, γ′-Fe4N consisting of the 15N isotope was prepared on iron substrates by plasma nitriding using a nitrogen isotopic gas (15N2). Although considerable amounts of 15N2+ were observed at 30 Da without overlap with any iron peak, the observed nitrogen concentrations of γ′-Fe4N were clearly lower than the stoichiometric composition (19–20 at%), using both pulsed voltage and pulsed laser atom probes. The origin of the missing nitrogen, excluding nitrogen obscured by other ion species, was predicted to be the occurrence of neutral nitrogen or nitrogen gas molecules in field evaporation. The generation rate of iron nitride ions (FeN2+) for 15N was significantly lower than that for 14N in γ′-Fe4N, which affected the amount of the missing nitrogen. The isotope effect suggests that the isotopic ratio cannot always be determined from only one ion species among the multiple species observed in the APT analysis.

This report describes the use of a gas chromatograph equipped with a quadrupole-type mass spectrometer (GC/MS) to measure (15)N concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in distilled water, a 2 M KCl solution and a 0.5 M K(2)SO(4) solution.

Persulfate oxidation was applied to convert TDN to nitrate, while additional pretreatment with ammonia diffusion was required for ammonium prior to the persulfate oxidation. Up to 100 samples can be measured daily using the system. We can generally run (15)N measurements with only 1-10 mL of sample for each chemical species of N, a volume 1/10-1/100 times smaller than the amount necessary for conventional methods.

Phys. 93, 1061 (1990)] with the nuclei treated classically and transitions between electronic states quantum mechanically. The potential-energy surfaces are derived from a diatomics-in-molecules model to which induced dipole-induced dipole interactions are added. The effect of the spin-orbit interaction is also discussed. The helium environment is modeled by a friction force acting on charged atoms whose speed exceeds the critical Landau velocity. The dependence of the fragment size distribution on the friction strength and on the initial nanodroplet size is investigated. By comparing with the available experimental data obtained for Ne3+ and Ne4+, a reasonable value for the friction coefficient, the only parameter of the model, is deduced. This value is then used to predict the effect of the helium environment on the dissociation dynamics of larger neon clusters, n=5-14. The results show stabilization of larger fragments than in the gas phase, but fragmentation is not completely caged. In addition, two types of dynamics are characterized for Ne4+: fast and explosive, therefore leaving no time for friction to cool down the process when dynamics starts on one of the highest electronic states, and slower, therefore leading to some stabilization by helium when it starts on one of the lowest electronic states.",

To advance isotope ratio analysis of an additional element, we present compound-specific (15)N/(14)N analysis of glyphosate and AMPA by a two step derivatization in combination with gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS). The N-H group was derivatized with isopropyl chloroformate (iso-PCF), and remaining acidic groups were subsequently methylated with trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD). Iso-PCF treatment at pH &lt;10 gave too low (15)N/(14)N ratios indicating an incomplete derivatization; in contrast, too high (15)N/(14)N ratios at pH &gt;10 indicated decomposition of the derivative.

This sensor operates by transmitting laser light through a single optical port and measuring the backscattered radiation from within the combustion device. Scanned-wavelength-modulation spectroscopy with second-harmonic detection and first-harmonic normalization (scanned-WMS-2f/1f) was used to account for variable signal collection and nonabsorption losses in the harsh environment. Two tunable diode lasers operating near 2551 and 2482 nm were utilized to measure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O concentration and temperature, while an interband cascade laser near 4176 nm and a quantum cascade laser near 4865 nm were used for measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO, respectively. The lasers were modulated at either 90 or 112 kHz and scanned across the peaks of their respective absorption features at 1 kHz, leading to a measurement rate of 2 kHz. A hybrid demultiplexing strategy involving both spectral filtering and frequency-domain demodulation was used to decouple the backscattered radiation into its constituent signals. Demonstration measurements were made in the exhaust of a laboratory-scale laminar methane-air flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure and equivalence ratios ranging from 0.7 to 1.2. A stainless steel reflective plate was placed 0.78 cm away from the sensor head within the combustion exhaust, leading to a total absorption path length of 1.56 cm.

Repeatability for distance tracking was assessed from 5 to 120 cm in 5 cm increments. Accuracy of distance tracking was investigated for paper and iPad targets, spatial integration was calculated, effects of target tilt were determined and light measurements were compared to a lux meter. In experiment 2, viewing behaviour was assessed in 41 subjects (21 non-myopic, 20 myopic) during four 15-min near tasks; (1) passive reading of printed material, (2) active writing on printed material, (3) passive viewing on an electronic device and (4) active engagement on an electronic device. Working distance was compared between tasks and refractive error groups. Clouclip distance tracking showed good repeatability, with a mean difference of 0.34 cm and limits of agreement of ±2.0 cm.

The spectra were analyzed by evaluating the temperature dependence (a) of the total bandwidth and (b) of the sub-bands obtained by numerical decomposition in terms of double Gaussians. The thermal broadening of the bands are interpreted, in both cases, as a homogeneous component, due to the presence of linear electron-phonon coupling, plus an inhomogeneous component, due to both statistical energy fluctuations at each pigment site and heterogeneity of the sample itself. Sub-bands analysis, in which eight major components are identified, yields a reorganization energy 9 cm(-1) &lt; or = Svm &lt; or = 14 cm(-1) and an inhomogeneous contribution in the range 120-170 cm(-1). In all cases the bands are substantially symmetrical in the 70-300 K temperature range. This observation gains theoretical support from an analysis of the band moments, when the influence of a low-frequency vibrational mode is considered. Analysis of the total absorption band yields Svm approximately 70 cm(-1); however, this high value is reduced to Svm approximately 11-20 cm(-1) when the red-most sub-band, with maximum at 684 nm, is eliminated at all temperatures. These data are discussed in terms of the underlying transitions, giving strong support to the presence of extreme red absorption bands in LHCII.

Nevertheless, in this range, the shortest possible wavelength facilitates signal detection. The aim of this study was, thus, to determine the maximal irradiance tolerated with 6 wavelengths: 2 red, 2 far red, and 1 near infrared lights to determine the shortest wavelength well tolerated by patients, in comparison with the standard cobalt blue light of ophthalmology slitlamp. An interventional, monocentric, single-group assignment study was conducted on 30 eyes of 30 patients with infectious keratitis. Thanks to a customized machine, the photophobic eye was exposed to the 6 lights with increasing intensity. The patients switched off the light when the discomfort was too elevated. The maximal cumulative irradiance possible at 482, 650, 675, 700, 750, and 800 nm were 171, 689, 759, 862, 920, and 889 mW/cm, respectively.

Measurements were taken at grating angles of 5 degrees , 10 degrees , and 15 degrees and the incident radiation was polarized primarily in the transverse magnetic mode. Four (three laminar, one blazed) of the gratings were ion etched in high quality quartz blanks, overcoated with 200 A of gold. A fifth (blazed) grating was ruled in gold.

Measured first-order efficiencies up to 15% were obtained for the laminar gratings and up to 8% was obtained for the ion-etched blazed grating. Much lower efficiencies (&lt;/=2%) were measured for the ruled grating. A computer program was written to calculate grating efficiencies using a full electromagnetic model.

The glass-vapor interface was considered as two distinct regions, a wavelength-thickness vapor layer joined to the surface and a more remote vapor region. The first region was analyzed as a spectral filter that annihilates the absorbed photons and the second one as a rich spectral light source. The experimental setup is described. A Rb reference cell (T = 293 K) was used. A part of the laser beam scanned the 5S1/2(F = 3) --&gt; 5P3/2(F' = 2,3,4) transition. The Doppler broadened absorption profile (FWHM = 510 MHz) was determined. The laser detuning of the profile-center relative to the F = 3 --&gt; F' = 4 transition was about 70 MHz. Another laser beam was directed to the entrance cell window. The resonant retrofluorescence S(ob)(upsilon(L)) as a function of laser detuning for a cell temperature approximately 130 degrees C and laser power 0.4 mW was obtained. We can extract the experimental signal sexp(n) (upsilon(L)) originating from the near-field region by subtracting signal S(T) (upsilon(L)) originating from the far-field region from the total experiment signal S(ob)(upsilon(L)). A fit of the normalized profile of the data corresponding to the spectral band centered on the F' = 4 --&gt; F = 3 hyperfine transition line was obtained by using a Lorentzian distribution function with GammaRF = 50 MHz full width at half-maximum. The role played by different relaxation processes contributing to the retrofluorescent atomic linewidth was characterized. The authors summed up the corresponding spectral broadening and obtained the relation GammaRF = Gamman + Gammacoll + Gammanr, where Gammacoll is the resonance collisional broadening of the hyperfine line, and Gammanr is an additional broadening induced by the nonradiative energy-transfer phenomena of the excited atoms near the cell window surface. To evaluate Gammacoll, we used the relation Gammacoll = gammaRb - RbN, where gammaRb - Rb is line broadening parameter, and N is Rb atom number density. The effective nonradiative relaxation rate of the 5P3/2(F' = 4) energy hyperfine level was estimated to be AF(nr) = 4 --&gt; F = 3 = 2.4 x 10(8) s(-1). The value of A(nr) seems relatively large compared to the spontaneous emission rate A(5P3/2 --&gt; 5P1/2) = 1.4 x 10(7) s(-1).",

If diffraction blurs the image of a point object into an Airy disk with a root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) size of s = 0.44lambda/2NA (approximately 90 nm for light with a wavelength of lambda = 600 nm and an objective lens with a numerical aperture of NA = 1.49), limiting the resolution of the far-field microscope in use to d = 2.4s approximately = 200 nm, additional knowledge about the specimen can be used to great advantage. For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images. In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) &gt; or = 1% (&gt; or = 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF). Moreover, the error in co-localizing two or more single emitters is notably worse, remaining greater than 5-10% (5-10 nm) of the PSF size. Here we report a distance resolution of s(reg) = 0.50 nm (1sigma) and an absolute accuracy of s(distance) = 0.77 nm (1sigma) in a measurement of the separation between differently coloured fluorescent molecules using conventional far-field fluorescence imaging in physiological buffer conditions. The statistical uncertainty in the mean for an ensemble of identical single-molecule samples is limited only by the total number of collected photons, to s(loc) approximately 0.3 nm, which is approximately 3 x 10(-3) times the size of the optical PSF. Our method may also be used to improve the resolution of many subwavelength, far-field imaging methods such as those based on co-localization of molecules that are stochastically switched on in space.

The E(a) values have been determined from the temperature-dependence of spectral sensitivity in the long-wavelength range. As shown previously, the simple physical idea E(a) =const. x (1/lambda(max)) (here termed the Stiles-Lewis-Barlow or SLB relation) does not hold strictly. Yet there is a significant correlation between E(a) and 1/lambda(max) (r(2)=0.73) and the regression slope obtained by an unbiased fit is 84% of the predicted value of the best SLB fit. The correlation can be decomposed into effects of A1 --&gt; A2 chromophore change and effects of opsin differences. For a chromophore change in the same opsin, studied in two A1/A2 pigment pairs, the SLB relation holds nearly perfectly. In seven pigments having different opsins but the same (A2) chromophore, the correlation of E(a) and 1/lambda(max) remained highly significant (r(2)=0.78), but the regression coefficient is only 72% of the best SLB fit. We conclude that (1) when the chromophore is exchanged in the same opsin, the lambda(max) shift directly reflects the difference in photoactivation energies, (2) when the opsin is modified by amino acid substitutions, lambda(max) and E(a) can be tuned partly independently, although there is a dominant tendency for inverse proportionality. In four (A1) rhodopsins with virtually the same lambda(max), E(a) varied over a 4.5 kcal/mol range, which may be taken as a measure of the freedom for independent tuning. Assuming that low E(a) correlates with high thermal noise, we suggest that the leeway in lambda(max) - E(a) coupling is used by natural selection to keep E(a) as high as possible in long-wavelength-sensitive pigments, and that this is why the opsin-dependent E(a) (1/lambda(max))-relation is shallower than predicted.",

Therefore, we have measured it with another technique, eccentric infrared photorefraction (the PowerRefractor), and studied how it can be modified. Particular care was taken to ensure correct calibration of the instrument. Ten young adult subjects were refracted both in the fixation axis of the right eye and from the midline between both eyes, while they read text both monocularly and binocularly at 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5 D distance (\"group 1\"). A second group of 10 subjects (\"group 2\"), measured from the midline between both eyes, was studied to analyze the effects of binocular vs monocular vision, addition of +1 or +2 D lenses, and of letter size. Spherical equivalents (SE) were analyzed in all cases. The lag of accommodation was variable among subjects (standard deviations among groups and viewing distances ranging from 0.18 to 1.07 D) but was significant when the measurements were done in the fixation axis (0.35 D at 3 D target distance to 0.60 D at 5 D with binocular vision; p&lt;0.01 or better all cases). Refracting from the midline between both eyes tended to underestimate the lag of accommodation although this was significant only at 5 D (ANOVA: p&lt;0.0001, post hoc t-test: p&lt;0.05). There was a small improvement in accommodation precision with binocular compared to monocular viewing but significance was reached only for the 5 D reading target (group 1--lags for a 3/4/5 D target: 0.35 vs 0.41 D/0.48 vs 0.47 D/0.60 vs 0.66 D, ANOVA: p&lt;0.0001, post hoc t-test: p&lt;0.05; group 2--0.29 vs 0.12 D, 0.33 vs 0.16 D, 0.23 vs -0.31 D, ANOVA: p&lt;0.0001, post hoc t-test: p&lt;0.05). Adjusting the letter height for constant angular subtense (0.2 deg) induced scarcely more accommodation than keeping letter size constantly at 3.5 mm (ANOVA: p&lt;0.0001, post hoc t-test: n.s.). Positive trial lenses reduced the lag of accommodation under monocular viewing conditions and even reversed it with binocular vision. After consideration of possible sources of measurement error, the lag of accommodation measured with photorefraction at 3 D (0.41 D SE monocular and 0.35 D SE binocular) was in the range of published values from the Canon R-1 autorefractor. With the measured lag, simulations of the retinal images for a diffraction limited eye suggest surprisingly poor letter contrast on the retina.",

The noise equivalent absorption of the recordings is on the order of α(min)≈ 5 × 10(-11) cm(-1) allowing for the detection of the O(5) transition with an intensity of 1.1 × 10(-30) cm per molecule, the smallest intensity value measured so far for an H(2) absorption line. A Galatry profile was used to reproduce the measured line shape and derive the line strengths. The pressure shift of the O(2) and O(3) lines was accurately determined from a series of recordings with pressure ranging between 10 and 700 Torr. From an exhaustive review of the literature data, the list of H(2) absorption lines detected so far has been constructed. It includes a total of 39 transitions ranging from the S(0) pure rotational line near 354 cm(-1) up to the S(1) transition of the (5-0) band near 18,908 cm(-1).

Two excited electronic states have been identified; they are assigned as &amp;Btilde;1Pi (16 449 cm-1) and &amp;Ctilde;1Sigma+ (18 509 cm-1). Unusually strong vibronic coupling through the bending vibration occurs between these two states, which causes their vibrational structures to be highly irregular; assignments have only been possible following extensive wavelength-resolved fluorescence experiments. The vibronic coupling raises the bending frequency of the &amp;Ctilde;1Sigma+ state to 457 cm-1 and reduces that of the lower Born-Oppenheimer component of the &amp;Btilde;1Pi state (which has A' symmetry in the Cs point group) to the extent that the molecule becomes nonlinear, with a potential barrier at the linear configuration of about 120 cm-1. The presence of the potential barrier is clearly demonstrated by the level structure of YOD, where the Sigma+ vibronic component of the 010 vibrational level (linear molecule notation) lies 1.4 cm-1 below the 000 level. The upper Born-Oppenheimer component, which has A\" symmetry, is unaffected; its bending frequency is similar to that of the ground state. Perturbations occur in both the &amp;Btilde;1Pi and &amp;Ctilde;1Sigma+ states; some of these represent local interactions between the two of them, but others are caused by higher vibrational levels of lower-lying \"dark\" electronic states.

Kinetic data analysis with global fitting revealed two distinct kinetic processes associated with relaxations of the early red-shifted photoproduct hK; these processes have time constants tau 1 approximately equal to 280 ns and tau 2 approximately equal to 360 microns at 20 degrees C. Spectral features demonstrate that the tau 1 process corresponds to a transition between two distinct bathointermediates, hKE and hKL. The vibrational difference bands associated with both tau 1 and tau 2 transitions are spread throughout the whole 1800-900 cm-1 range. However, the largest bands correspond to ethylenic C=C stretches, fingerprint C-C stretches and hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) wags of the retinal chromophore. The time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the tau 1 and tau 2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. The decay of the intense HOOP vibrations is nearly equally divided between the tau 1 and tau 2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hKE) bathointermediate, to a less-twisted structure in hKL, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hL intermediate. This conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the tau 1 process. The two relaxations from hKE to hL are largely analogous to corresponding relaxations (KE--&gt;KL--&gt;L) in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle, except that the second step is slowed down by over 200-fold in hR.",

These instruments both determine color by measuring the intensity of reflected light of particular wavelengths. The Photovolt ColorWalk instrument does so by shining a white light and sensing the intensity of the reflected light with a linear photodiode array. The ColorWalk results can then be expressed in terms of several standard color systems, most importantly, the Commission International d'Eclairage (CIE) Lab system, in which any color can be described by three values: L*, the lightness; a*, the amount of green or red; and b*, the amount of yellow or blue. Instead of a white light and photodiodes, the DermaSpectrometer uses two light-emitting diodes (LEDs), one green and one red, to illuminate a surface, and then it records the intensity of the reflected light. The results of these readings are expressed in terms of erythema (E) and melanin (M) indices. We measured the unexposed skin of the inner upper arm, the exposed skin of the forehead, and the hair, of 80 persons using these two instruments. Since it is important for the application of these measures in anthropology that we understand their relationship across a number of different pigmentation levels, we sampled persons from several different groups, namely, European Americans (n = 55), African Americans (n = 9), South Asians (n = 7), and East Asians (n = 9). In these subjects, there is a very high correlation between L* and the M index for the inner arm (R(2) = 0.928, P &lt; 0.001), the forehead (R(2) = 0.822, P &lt; 0.001), and the hair (R(2) = 0.827, P &lt; 0.001).

The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state. Upon excitation to the K(6S) state, the dependence on H2 pressure of integrated fluorescence in the transition 4D--&gt;4P was measured. The cross section (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the transition 6S--&gt;4D was obtained. The authors conclude that the channel for energy depletion from the 6S state is predominantly through the physical quenching to the 4D state, although the KH product has been observed in the chemical reaction",

MnXe exhibits only a single thermally stable site whose emission at 620 nm is similar to the broad a 6D bands produced with blue-site excitation in Ar and Kr. Thus in Ar(Kr), excitation of the red site at 393 (400) nm produces narrow line emissions at 427.5 (427.8) and 590 (585.7) nm. From their spectral positions, linewidths, and long decay times, these emission bands are assigned to the a 4D72 and a 6D92 states, respectively. Excitation of the blue site at 380 (385.5) nm produces broad emission at 413 (416) nm which, because of its nanosecond radiative lifetime, is assigned to resonance z 6P --&gt; a 6S fluorescence. Emission bands at 438 (440) and 625 (626.8) nm, also produced with blue-site excitation, are broader than their red-site equivalents at 427.5 and 590 nm (427.8 and 585.7 nm in Kr) but from their millisecond and microsecond decay times are assigned to the a 4D and a 6D states. The line features observed in high resolution scans of the red-site emission at 427.5 and 427.8 nm in MnAr and MnKr, respectively, have been analyzed with the W(p) optical line shape function and identified as resolved phonon structure originating from very weak (S=0.4) electron-phonon coupling. The presence of considerable hot-phonon emission (even in 12 K spectra) and the existence of crystal field splittings of 35 and 45 cm(-1) on the excited a 4D72 level in Ar and Kr matrices have been identified in W(p) line shape fits. The measured matrix lifetimes for the narrow red-site a 6D state emissions (0.29 and 0.65 ms) in Ar and Kr are much shorter than the calculated (3 s) gas phase value. With the lifetime of the metastable a 6D92 state shortened by four orders of magnitude in the solid rare gases, it is clear that the probability of the \"forbidden\" a 6D --&gt; a 6S atomic transition is greatly enhanced in the solid state. A novel feature identified in the present work is the large width and shifted 4D and 6D emissions produced for Mn atoms isolated in the blue sites of Ar and Kr. In contrast, these states produce narrow, unshifted (gas-phase-like) 4D and 6D state emissions from the red site.",

The surface was decomposed using a many-body expansion. Accurate two-body potentials for HgBr, HgAr, and ArBr were calculated using coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations and a perturbative treatment of triple excitations [CCSD(T)], as well as the multireference averaged coupled pair functional method. Correlation consistent basis sets were used to extrapolate to the complete basis set limit and corrections were included to account for scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects, core-valence correlation, and the Lamb shift. The three-body potential was computed with the CCSD(T) method and triple-zeta quality basis sets. Quasiclassical trajectories using the final analytical potential surface were directly carried out on the CID of HgBr by Ar for a large sampling of initial rotational, vibrational, and collision energies. The recombination rate of Hg and Br atoms is a likely first step in mercury depletion events that have been observed in the Arctic troposphere during polar sunrise. The effective second order rate constant for this process was determined in this work from the calculated CID rate as a function of temperature using the principle of detailed balance, which resulted in k(T) = 1.2 x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 260 K and 1 bar pressure.",

In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported.

Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

Sensitivity to symmetry and spin forbidden transitions as well as correlations to the triplet states of benzene make it possible to ascribe the main features, below 7 eV in the electronic part of the EEL spectrum, to triplet transitions. The lowest EEL feature with an energy onset at 3.5 eV is attributed to a transition to the (3)B(1)(n--&gt;pi(*)) valence electronic state and the next triplet n--&gt;pi(*) transition to a (3)A(2) state located around 4.5 eV.

The computed equilibrium geometry for the X A1 ground state, as well as vibrational frequencies for the nu2 umbrella and nu3 symmetric stretch modes, are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data. The 3Q0+ state converging to the excited I(2P1/2o) limit is found to possess a shallow minimum of 850 cm(-1) strongly shifted to larger internuclear distances (RC-I approximately 6.5a0) relative to the ground state. This makes a commonly employed single-exponent approximation for analysis of the CH3I fragmentation dynamics unsuitable. The 4E(3A1) state dissociating to the same atomic limit is calculated to lie too high in the Franck-Condon region to have any significant impact on the A-band absorption. The computed vertical excitation energies for the 3Q1, 3Q0+, and 1Q states indicate that the A-band spectrum must lie approximately between 33,000 and 44,300 cm(-1), i.e., between 225 and 300 nm.

Theory and spectroscopic properties.\nThe excitation of a fluorescent molecule by a beta-decay electron (radioluminescence) depends upon the electron energy, the distance between radioactive 'donor' and fluorescent 'acceptor', and the excitation characteristics and solvent environment of the fluorophore. The theory for calculation of single photon radioluminescence (SPR) signals is developed here; in the accompanying paper, measurement methods and biological applications are presented. To calculate the three-dimensional spatial profile for electron energy deposition in an aqueous environment, a Monte Carlo calculation was performed incorporating theories of electron energy distributions, energy loss due to interactions with matter, and deflections in electron motion due to collisions. For low energy beta emitters, 50% of energy deposition occurs within 0.63 micron (3H, 18.5 keV), 22 microns (14C, 156 keV), 25 microns (35S, 167 keV), and 260 microns (36Cl, 712 keV) of the radioisotope. In close proximity to the beta emitter (100 nm, 3H; 10 microns, 14C) the probability for fluorophore excitation is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the beta emitter and fluorophore. To investigate the other factors that determine the probability for fluorophore excitation, SPR measurements were carried out in solutions containing 3H and a series of fluorophores in different solvents. In water, the probability of fluorescence excitation was nearly proportional to the integrated absorbance over a &gt; 1,000-fold variation in absorbances. The probability of fluorescence excitation was enhanced up to 2,600-fold when the fluorophore was in a \"scintillant\" aromatic or hydrocarbon solvent. SPR emission spectra were similar to fluorescence emission spectra obtained with photon excitation. The single photon signal due to Bremsstrahlung increased with wavelength in agreement with theory. The distance dependence for the SPR signal predicted by the model was in good agreement with measurements in which a 14C donor was separated by known thicknesses of water from a fluorescently-coated coverglass. Quantitative predictions for radioluminescence signal as a function of donor-acceptor distance were developed for specific radioisotope-fluorophore geometries in biological samples.",

Significant improvement of the accuracy is achieved by means of rigorous evaluation of the quadratic dependence of the fluorescence signal on the incident photon flux in the whole wavelength range, by comparing results obtained from two independent experiments, as well as due to meticulous evaluation of critical experimental parameters, including the excitation spatial- and temporal pulse shape, laser power and sample geometry.

The concentrations of cage, intermediates and products in the femtolitre focal volume depend on reaction rates and diffusional exchange with the external volume. This problem of reaction with diffusion was analysed with analytical and numerical methods to determine simple relations between parameters useful in the design and interpretation of experiments. The diffraction-limited laser spot is approximated well by a sphere, radius A, in diffusional exchange with either an infinite uniform medium, representing extracellular photolysis, or within a non-permeable sphere, a \"cell\" of radius B, representing intracellular photolysis. Photolysis is modelled as sequential irreversible reactions, with either the excitation step alone, rate constant k(e), or with a subsequent \"dark\" reaction, rate constant k(p). For extracellular photolysis, steady-state depletion of a cage averaged in a spherical spot increases hyperbolically with k(e) with half-maximum depletion at k(e) = K0.5 = 2.5 D/A2, where D is the diffusion coefficient. With measured parameters for spot size A = 0.3 microm and diffusion D = 800 microm2/s, K0.5 = 22,200 s(-1). The optimal exposure for localized photolysis is the characteristic diffusion time tau = A2/D, 113 micros in this example, and is the time taken to reach 57% of steady state in the diffusion-limited case. In the two-step model, with excitation and \"dark\" reaction steps, rate constants both exceeding K0.5 are necessary to generate 50% of maximal product concentration in the illuminated volume. High concentrations of photolysis products depend particularly on a high excitation rate constant (k(e) &gt; K0.5), and localization of the products requires fast dark reactions (k(p) &gt; K0.5). If products diffuse faster than the cage, their steady-state concentrations are decreased, and concentration transients may occur. For localized intracellular photolysis, the duration of exposure that generates product concentration at the cell boundary, B, less than 10% of the spot concentration should be shorter than 0.043(B/A)3tau, and is determined by diffusion.",

The relative magnitudes of two-photon cross-sections for eight krypton lines in the 190-220 nm range are compared to experimental excitation spectra with good agreement. This work provides fundamental physical understanding of the Kr atom, which adds to experimental observations of relative fluorescence intensity.

Special efforts were made in constructing an optical set-up that allows the accurate determination of the fluorescence from an area of constant Ip, phi F(Ip) starts to decline at approximately 10(14) and drops to values below 0.01% at maximum Ip (approximately 10(19) photons cm-2 pulse-1).

One interpretation is to attribute this result to a very fast exciton-exciton annihilation of multiple excited states generated within this small domain. Alternatively, based on the assumption that delocalized cluster states within the monomeric/trimeric subunit of LHCII exist, the results can be consistently described by a kinetic model comprising ground, monoexcitonic, and biexcitonic states of clusters and a triplet state that is quenched by carotenoids in LHCII.

The cross sections for deactivation of K(6S) and K(4D) by collisions with H2 were measured. The temperature of the cell body was controlled at 413 K, and H2 pressure was varied between 4 and 40 Pa. The effects of K(6S, 4D)-K collisions could be neglected in our experimental condition. On excitation of K(6S) state, the decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 6S--&gt;4P transition was monitored. The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state.

Here, we demonstrate a &gt;40 nJ, sub-100 fs, wavelength-tunable ultrafast laser system based on chirped pulse amplification (CPA) in thulium-doped fiber and second-harmonic generation (SHG) technology. Through effective control of the nonlinear effect in the CPA process, we have obtained 92-fs pulses at 1903 nm with an average power of 0.89 W and a pulse energy of 81 nJ. By frequency doubling, 95-fs pulses at 954 nm with an average power of 0.46 W and a pulse energy of 42 nJ have been generated. In addition, our system can also achieve tunable wavelength from 932 nm to 962 nm (frequency doubled from 1863 nm to 1919 nm). A pulse width of ∼100 fs and sufficient pulse energy are ensured over the entire tuning range. Finally, we applied the laser in a two-photon microscope and obtained superior imaging results. Due to a relatively low repetition rate (∼ 10 MHz), similar imaging quality can be achieved at significantly reduced average power compared with a commercial 80 MHz laser system. At the same time, the lower average power is helpful in limiting the thermal load to the samples. It is believed that such a setup, with its well-balanced optical characteristics and compact footprint, provides an ideal source for two-photon microscopy.",

Experiments were performed over a wide range of excitation and probe wavelengths, using several data collection time scales. This has enabled us to resolve five different lifetimes ranging between 100 fs and 200 ps plus a nanosecond component. We demonstrate here and elsewhere [e.g., Durrant, J.R., Hastings, G., Joseph, D. M., Barber, J., Porter, G., &amp; Klug, D. R. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 11632-11636] that the kinetic spectra associated with all but two of these lifetimes are clearly distinguishable.

In this paper, we show that it is possible to spectrally and temporally resolve stimulated emission from PS2 reaction centers with great accuracy and that this stimulated emission is largely unaffected by those kinetic components which are faster than 21 ps. The observation of a distinct stimulated emission band allows us to distinguish charge-separated states from chlorin singlet states. In this way, we are able to show that the proportion of charge-separated states prior to the 21-ps component is between 0% and 25%. We also show that the shape of the spectrum which we obtain for the state P680+Ph- is essentially invariant between 100 ps and 9 ns, and is the same as that previously reported for P680+Ph- by other researchers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Illustrative (37)Cl MAS NMR spectra are obtained and analyzed for some of the samples. For perchlorate anions with quadrupolar couplings less than about 1 MHz, the (35)Cl/(37)Cl NMR parameters are most precisely determined from the full manifold of spinning sidebands observed for the satellite transitions while line-shape analysis of the central transition is employed for the somewhat larger quadrupolar couplings. The environments for the individual perchlorate anions are best characterized by the quadrupole coupling parameters (e.g., C(Q) ranges from 0.3 to 3.0 MHz), while the dispersion in the isotropic (35)Cl chemical shifts is small (1029 ppm &lt; delta(iso) &lt; 1049 ppm) for the perchlorates studied. Due to the variation in quadrupole coupling parameters, (35)Cl MAS NMR may conveniently be employed for identification of anhydrous and hydrated phases of perchlorates, in studies of phase transitions, hydration reactions, and the composition of mixed phases.

The splittings between the two sets of the same transition varied from 2 to 15 MHz, and the two components were assigned to the two lowest states of the internal rotation of CO with respect to DME governed by a twofold potential. A preliminary analysis carried out separately for the two sets of the observed transition frequencies by using an ordinary asymmetric-rotor Hamiltonian indicated that the heavy-atom skeleton of the complex was essentially planar, as evidenced by the \"pseudoinertial defects,\" i.e., the inertial defects, which involve the contributions of the out-of-plane hydrogens of the two methyl groups, I(cc)-I(aa)-I(bb) of -5.764(23) and -5.753(16) uA(2) for the symmetric and antisymmetric states, respectively. All of the observed transition frequencies were subsequently analyzed simultaneously, by using a phenomenological Hamiltonian which was described in a previous paper on Ar-DME and Ne-DME [Morita et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 094301 (2006)]. The rotational constants thus derived were analyzed to give the distance between the centers of gravity of the two component molecules, DME and CO, to be 3.682 A and the angle between the CO and the a-inertial axes to be 75.7 degrees ; the C end of the CO being closer to the DME. Most a-type transitions were observed as closely spaced triplets, which were ascribed to the internal rotation of the two methyl tops of DME. The V(3) potential barrier was obtained to be 772(2) cm(-1) from the first-order Coriolis coupling term between the internal rotation and overall rotation, which is about 82% of V(3) for the DME monomer, whereas the second-order contribution of the coupling to the B rotational constant led to V(3) of 705(3) cm(-1).

Linear arrangements of atoms are described using a dummy atom of infinite mass. The procedure has been automated in FORTRAN90 and its main advantage lies in the nontrivial reduction of the number of single-point energy calculations needed for the construction of the Hessian matrix when compared to the corresponding number using double differentiation in Cartesian coordinates. For molecules of C1 symmetry the computational savings in the energy calculations amount to 36N - 30, where N is the number of atoms, with additional savings when symmetry is present.

Scale factors for: (i) harmonic vibrational frequencies [categorized into low (&lt;1000 cm(-1)) and high (&gt;1000 cm(-1))], (ii) vibrational contributions to enthalpy and entropy, and (iii) zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs) have been determined for widely used density functionals in combination with polarization consistent basis sets (pc-n, n = 0,1,2,3,4). The density functionals include pure functionals (BP86, BPW91, BLYP, HCTH93, PBEPBE), hybrid functionals with Hartree-Fock exchange (B3LYP, B3P86, B3PW91, PBE1PBE, mPW1K, BH&amp;HLYP), hybrid meta functionals with the kinetic energy density gradient (M05, M06, M05-2X, M06-2X), a double hybrid functional with Møller-Plesset correlation (B2GP-PLYP), and a dispersion corrected functional (B97-D). The experimental frequencies for calibration were from 41 organic molecules and the ZPVEs for comparison were from 24 small molecules (diatomics, triatomics). For this family of basis sets, the scale factors for each property are more dependent on the functional selection than on basis set level, and thus allow for a suggested scale factor for each density functional when employing polarization consistent basis sets (pc-n, n = 1,2,3,4). A separate scale factor is recommended when the un-polarized basis set, pc-0, is used in combination with the density functionals.",

The ro-vibrational energy levels, expectation values for the coupling constant, and its temperature dependence were calculated variationally by using the methods implemented in the computer program TROVE. Vibrational energies and vibrational and temperature effects for coupling constant are found to be in very good agreement with the available experimental data. We found, in agreement with previous studies, that the vibrational effects constitute about 44% of the constant's equilibrium value, originating mainly from the large amplitude out-of-plane bending motion and that the temperature effects play a minor role.

With infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, the weak, torsional overtone (v(6) = 2 &lt;-- 0) has been studied leading to the measurement of 382 frequencies between 405 and 440 cm(-1) at a resolution of 0.005 cm(-1). Torsional splittings on the order of 0.03 cm(-1) were observed. With mm-wave methods, a total of 669 rotational transitions between 50 and 360 GHz have been measured at Doppler-limited resolution in the four lowest torsional states v(6) = 0, 1, 2, 3. The experimental uncertainty attained for an isolated line was better than 10 kHz below 150 GHz, and somewhat larger at higher frequencies. For v(6) = 3, torsional splittings as large as 8.7 MHz were observed. The global data set consisted of the current frequency determinations and the 443 measurements with molecular beam, microwave, and mm-wave methods analyzed by I. Ozier, J. Schroderus, S.-X. Wang, G. A. McRae, M. C. L. Gerry, B. Vogelsanger, and A. Bauder [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 190, 324-340 (1998)]. The observation of mm-wave R-branch transitions for v(6) = 1 led to a change in the J-assignment of the forbidden (Deltak = +/-3) transitions reported earlier for this torsional state. A good fit was obtained by varying 24 parameters in a Hamiltonian that represented both the torsional effects and the sextic splittings. In the earlier work, the large reduced barrier height led to high correlations among several of the torsional distortion constants. With the current measurements, many of these correlations are substantially reduced. Improved effective values were determined for the height V(3) of the hindering barrier and the first-order correction V(6) in the Fourier expansion of the potential function. The dipole function which characterizes the transition moment of the torsional overtone (v(6) = 2 &lt;-- 0) can be written as the product of a single effective dipole constant µ(T)(0,eff) and the appropriate off-diagonal matrix element of (1 - cos 3alpha)/2, where alpha is the torsional angle. From an intensity analysis of the infrared spectrum, it has been determined that |µ(T)(0,eff)| = 85.3(62) mD. A novel approach based on a simple regrouping of angular momentum operators is introduced for decoupling the torsional and rotational degrees of freedom. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.",

Theory and spectroscopic properties.\nThe excitation of a fluorescent molecule by a beta-decay electron (radioluminescence) depends upon the electron energy, the distance between radioactive 'donor' and fluorescent 'acceptor', and the excitation characteristics and solvent environment of the fluorophore. The theory for calculation of single photon radioluminescence (SPR) signals is developed here; in the accompanying paper, measurement methods and biological applications are presented. To calculate the three-dimensional spatial profile for electron energy deposition in an aqueous environment, a Monte Carlo calculation was performed incorporating theories of electron energy distributions, energy loss due to interactions with matter, and deflections in electron motion due to collisions. For low energy beta emitters, 50% of energy deposition occurs within 0.63 micron (3H, 18.5 keV), 22 microns (14C, 156 keV), 25 microns (35S, 167 keV), and 260 microns (36Cl, 712 keV) of the radioisotope. In close proximity to the beta emitter (100 nm, 3H; 10 microns, 14C) the probability for fluorophore excitation is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the beta emitter and fluorophore. To investigate the other factors that determine the probability for fluorophore excitation, SPR measurements were carried out in solutions containing 3H and a series of fluorophores in different solvents. In water, the probability of fluorescence excitation was nearly proportional to the integrated absorbance over a &gt; 1,000-fold variation in absorbances. The probability of fluorescence excitation was enhanced up to 2,600-fold when the fluorophore was in a \"scintillant\" aromatic or hydrocarbon solvent. SPR emission spectra were similar to fluorescence emission spectra obtained with photon excitation. The single photon signal due to Bremsstrahlung increased with wavelength in agreement with theory. The distance dependence for the SPR signal predicted by the model was in good agreement with measurements in which a 14C donor was separated by known thicknesses of water from a fluorescently-coated coverglass. Quantitative predictions for radioluminescence signal as a function of donor-acceptor distance were developed for specific radioisotope-fluorophore geometries in biological samples.",

The dose rate constant (Lambda) reported by the two groups, however, differed by more than 6% and there is currently no AAPM recommended consensus value for this source in clinical dosimetry. The aim of this work was to perform an independent determination of Lambda for the OptiSeed103 source using a recently developed photon spectrometry technique. Three OptiSeed103 sources (model 1032P) with known air-kerma strength were used in this study. The photon energy spectrum emitted along the radial direction on the source's bisector was measured in air using a high-resolution intrinsic germanium spectrometer designed and established for low-energy brachytherapy source spectrometry. The dose rate constant of each source was determined from its emitted energy spectrum and the spatial distribution of radioactivity in the source. Unlike other sources made with traditional titanium encapsulation, the photons emitted by the OptiSeed103 sources exhibited only slight spectral hardening, yielding a relative energy spectrum closer to that emitted by bare 103Pd. The dose rate constant determined by the photon spectrometry technique for water was 0.664 +/- 0.025 cGy h(-1) U(-1). This value agreed, within experimental uncertainties, with the Monte Carlo-calculated value (MCLambda) of 0.665 +/- 0.014 cGy h(-1) U(-1) and the TLD-measured value (with a Monte Carlo-calculated solid-phantom-to-water conversion factor) of 0.675 +/- 0.051 cGy h(-1) U(-1) reported by Wang and Hertel [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 63, 311-321 (2005)]. However, it differed by -6.7% from the McLambda of 0.712 +/- 0.043 cGy h(-1) U(-1) reported by Bernard and Vynckier [Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 1493-1504 (2005)]. The results obtained in this work provide additional information needed for establishing a consensus value for the dose rate constant for the OptiSeed103 source. It suggests that an eventual consensus value of Lambda for the OptiSeed103 source is likely to be closer to a value of 0.668 cGy h(-1) U(-1) rather than 0.693 cGy h(-1) U(-1) as initially recommended by the source manufacturer based on the two previously published results.",

As these photons of varying energies are encountered in various applications, the study of photon energy response of a dosemeter is an important aspect to ensure the accuracy in dose measurement. Responses of dosemeters have to be experimentally established because for luminescence dosemeters, they depend not only on the effective atomic number (ratio of mass energy absorption coefficients of dosemeter and tissue) of the detector, but also considerably on the luminescence efficiency and the material surrounding the dosemeters. Metal filters are generally used for the compensation of energy dependence below 200 keV and/or to provide photon energy discrimination. It is noted that the contribution to Hp(0.07) could be measured more accurately than Hp(10). For the dosemeters exhibiting high photon energy-dependent response, estimation of the beta component of Hp(0.07) becomes very difficult in the mixed field of beta radiation and photons of energy less than 100 keV. Recent studies have shown that the thickness and the atomic number of metal filters not only affect the response below 200 keV but also cause a significant over-response for high energy (&gt;6 MeV) photons often encountered in the environments of pressurised heavy water reactors and accelerators.",

Sp, Kcp, Sp / Kcp (=SKR) for the energy spectra of Cobalt-60 (Co-60), and Mohan 4 MV, 6 MV, 10 MV, 15 MV, and 24 MV photons are analytically calculated over depths from 0 to 40 centimeters in water. The Sp and Kcp are fitted to exponential functions, Sp0exp(-μ'd(l-η'd)) and Kp0exp(-μd(l-ηd)), respectively, with depth d, linear attenuation coefficient μ and beam hardening coefficient η; μ' and η' are the corresponding quantities for Sp. The relationships between μ', η', and SKR vs. μ are examined. Trends between the fitting parameters and μ were also determined, and the results applied to model the SKR of 6× and 15× clinical beams as functions of only μ, η, and depth. SKR decreases with depth for all spectra. We found μ' = (0.80496 + 4.8748μ)μ + 0.005736 and η' = (-0.13076 + 2.6571μ)μ + 0.0036151 for 0.0273/cm&lt;=μ&lt;0.0392/cm, and μ' = 0.87718μ + 0.010864 and η' =(-0.009 - 0.50122μ)μ + 0.0037 for 0.0392/cm &lt;= μ &lt;= 0.0667/cm. This model predicts the normalized SKR/(SKR(d=0)) with a relative deviation of 0.1% and max deviation of 1%. SKR/(SKR(d=0)) from clinical beams 6× and 15× is examined to be in agreement with analytic computation from spectral data with 1% and 0.5% maximum error, respectively. Knowledge of normalized SKR is a necessary to calculate scatter dose accurately. We have developed an empirical model to calculate the normalized SKR to be used for clinical (scatter) dose calculation and consequently improve dose calculation accuracy.",

The photon spectra at different positions around the seeds have first been calculated using EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code. These photon spectra are used as input for the event-by-event MC code TRION to calculate the microdosimetric lineal energy (y) distribution for each isotope. The microdosimetric dose average lineal energy, yD, calculated in a sphere of 1 microm is 3.5 keV microm(-1) for 125I and 4.0 keV microm(-1) for 103Pd, agreeing well with values reported in the literature. yD in a 1 microm sphere diminishes slightly with the distance from the seed for 103Pd. This is due to the spectral hardening caused by the presence of a gamma-ray of 357.5 keV in the initial spectrum of 103Pd. In parallel with the calculation of the microdosimetric spectra, we have analysed the distribution of the size of the energy deposition clusters generated by these low energy photons in structures of 2 and 10 nm of radius. Due to Compton interactions, the fraction of very low energy electrons (&lt;5 keV) generated by 125I photons is 51%, whereas it is only 27% for 103Pd. As these electrons deposit their energy very locally, the pattern of energy depositions contains more clusters of a few nm of radius for 125I than for 103Pd; the mean cluster orders are respectively 3.3 and 3.0 for 10 nm clusters. This is in opposition with the prediction based on the microdosimetric spectrum and the parameter yD and could be of importance for the damage to the cells.",

The expression is cubic in energy and requires as input parameters the total stopping power, So, the ratio of the scattering power and the total specific stopping power, T0/epsilon0, both taken at 10 MeV, and the radiation length for the material involved, X0. In addition to these parameters, five of the derived parameters are used to 'fine tune' the equation and minimize the mean square deviation from experimental and/or Monte Carlo data by means of non-linear regression. In the present study only Monte Carlo data determined with the new ITS.3 code have been employed. The standard deviations of the mean deviation from the Monte Carlo data at any energy are about 0.10, 0.12, 0.04, 0.11, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02 mm for Be, C, H2O, Al, Cu, Ag and U, respectively, and the relative standard deviation of the mean is about 0.5% for all materials. The fitting program gives some priority to water-equivalent materials, which explains the low standard deviation for water. A small error in the fall-off slope can give a different value for Rp. We describe a new method which reduces the uncertainty in the Rp determination, by fitting an odd function to the descending portion of the depth-dose curve in order to accurately determine the tangent at the inflection point, and thereby the practical range. An approximate inverse relation is given expressing the most probable energy of an electron beam as a function of the practical range. The resultant relative standard error of the energy is less than 0.7%, and the maximum energy error deltaEp is less than 0.3 MeV.",

The computed equilibrium geometry for the X A1 ground state, as well as vibrational frequencies for the nu2 umbrella and nu3 symmetric stretch modes, are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data.

The modeling parameters n and μ of buildup-tail function can be used to characterize the Collimator Scatter Factor (Sc) either in a square field or in the different individual upper jaw and lower jaw setting separately for individual monitor unit check. The PDD curves for four high-energy photon beams were modeled by the buildup and tail function in this study. The buildup function was a quadratic function in the form of [Formula: see text] with the main parameter of d (depth in water) and n, while the tail function was in the form of e-μd and was composed by an exponential function with the main parameter of d and μ. The PDD was the product of buildup and tail function, PDD = [Formula: see text]. The PDD of four-photon energies was characterized by the buildup-tail function by adjusting the parameters n and μ. The Sc of 6 MV and 10 MV can then be expressed simply by the modeling parameters n and μ. The main parameters n increases in buildup-tail function when photon energy increased. The physical meaning of the parameter n expresses the beam hardening of photon energy in PDD. The fitting results of parameters n in the buildup function are 0.17, 0.208, 0.495, 1.2 of four-photon energies, 4 MV, 6 MV, 10 MV, 18 MV, respectively. The parameter μ can be treated as attenuation coefficient in tail function and decreases when photon energy increased. The fitting results of parameters μ in the tail function are 0.065, 0.0515, 0.0458, 0.0422 of four-photon energies, 4 MV, 6 MV, 10 MV, 18 MV, respectively. The values of n and μ obtained from the fitted buildup-tail function were applied into an analytical formula of Sc = nE(S)0.63μE to get the collimator to scatter factor Sc for 6 and 10 MV photon beam, while nE, μE, S denotes n, μ at photon energy E of field size S, respectively. The calculated Sc were compared with the measured data and showed agreement at different field sizes to within ±1.5%. We proposed a model incorporating a two-parameter formula which can improve the fitting accuracy to be better than 1.5% maximum error for describing the PDD in different photon energies used in clinical setting. This model can be used to parameterize the Sc factors for some clinical requirements. The modeling parameters n and μ can be used to predict the Sc in either square field or individual jaws opening asymmetrically for treatment monitor unit double-check in dose calculation. The technique developed in this study can also be used for systematic or random errors in the QA program, thus improves the clinical dose computation accuracy for patient treatment.",

Application of the reference standards in nonlinear transmittance measurements is discussed. ",

Non-transparency is defined as the transmittance of the reference beam solution, whose monochromatic absorbance is unity, towards stray radiant energy. The proposed method has the same concentration absorbing sample placed in the beams of the scanning spectrophotometer, the sample-beam cuvette being a known factor longer than the reference-beam cuvette. While scanning towards shorter wavelengths, an apparent differential absorbance Mielenz peak is recorded. An exact formula is derived in this paper relating the relative stray radiant energy level to the Mielenz peak absorbance, to the known cuvette path length ratio, to the observed monochromatic absorbance of the test sample at the Mielenz peak wavelength, and to the sample transmittance towards the stray radiant energy. Sample transmittance towards stray radiant energy cannot be determined experimentally. However, the derived formula only allows the other experimental quantities to tie in together for a single numerically calculated value for the sample-transmittance towards stray radiant energy. The formulae are tedious to derive and cumbersome to handle, but their application is facilitated greatly by a Microsoft Office Excel 2007 spreadsheet. The test method was applied to an ultraviolet-visible (UV/VIS) scanning spectrophotometer at nine wavelengths in the range 713 &gt; lambda (nm) &gt;; 649 for a sample beam-to-reference beam cuvette path length ratio of 10 mm/5 mm and using blue food dye (E123) as the test material. Sample transparency to stray radiant energy fluctuated in wavelength between 0.819 and 0.948, while the relative stray radiant energy level fluctuated between 1.283 x 10(-3) and 2.516 x 10(-3). The investigation was repeated at 665.6 nm for all fifteen sample beam-to-reference beam cuvette path length ratios, which it was possible to establish using combinations of quartz-glass cuvettes with path lengths of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 mm. The sample transparency to stray radiant energy at 665.6 nm was 0.95 +/- 0.5, while the relative stray radiant energy was (1.5 +/- 0.33) x 10(-3).",

Optical absorption spectra of solvated electrons (esolv-) in Gl were recorded as a function of temperature (381&lt;or=T&lt;or=505 K). The observed redshift of the absorption maximum, homegamax, yields a temperature coefficient d(homegamax)/dT=-(2.67+/-0.07)x10(-3) eV K-1. For solutions with a concentration c(I-) approximately 10(-3)M, the absorbance of esolv- at homegamax increases by a factor of about 65 when the temperature is raised from 329 to 536 K. This effect can be partially explained by a temperature-dependent redshift of the CTTS spectrum of I- in Gl with respect to the laser wavelength. The main contribution to the increasing yield of esolv- is determined by diffusion controlled escape dynamics of the electron in the contact pair (I:e-)solv which is formed very fast during the detachment process. At room temperature no absorption of esolv- (absorbance&lt;1.0x10(-3)) could be observed which is probably a result of an extremely small self-diffusion coefficient of Gl (a factor of 1250 lower than that of water at 298 K).

The high resolution EDKs for various incident photon energies were generated using the EGSnrc user-code EDKnrc, which forces incident photons to interact at the center of a 60 cm radius sphere of water. The simulation geometry is essentially the same as the original Mackie calculation but with a greater number of scoring voxels (48 radial, 144 angular bins). For the material-specific EDKs, incident photons were forced to interact at the center of a 1 mm radius sphere of material (lung, cortical bone, silver, or titanium) surrounded by a 60 cm radius water sphere, using the original scoring voxel geometry implemented by Mackie et al. 1988 (24 radial, 48 angular bins). Our Monte Carlo-calculated high resolution EDKs showed excellent agreement with the Mackie kernels, with our kernels providing more information about energy deposition close to the interaction site. Furthermore, our EDKs resulted in smoother dose deposition functions due to the finer resolution and greater number of simulation histories. The material-specific EDK results show that the angular distribution of energy deposition is different for incident photons interacting in different materials. Calculated from the angular dose distribution for 300 keV incident photons, the expected polar angle for dose deposition (&lt;thgr;&gt;) is 28.6° for water, 33.3° for lung, 36.0° for cortical bone, 44.6° for titanium, and 58.1° for silver, showing a dependence on the material in which the primary photon interacts. These high resolution and material-specific EDKs have implications for convolution/superposition dose calculations in heterogeneous patient geometries, especially at material interfaces.",

In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects.

In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

The X(1)Σ(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 Å), whereas the A(1)Π state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 Å).

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies. For example, for the XY (n=2) version of the present model, such a behavior was observed only near criticality. It is shown also that the (metastable state) maximum Lyapunov exponent decreases with N like lambda(max) approximately N-kappa, where for the initial conditions employed herein (maximal magnetization), kappa=0.225+/-0.030, both above and below the critical point.",

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study.

The experimental relaxation rates reveal an unusual signature, in being dominated by the electron spin-rotation interaction in the MuCO radical that is formed in the addition step. In N2 moderator, k0 = 1.2+/-0.1 x 10(-34) cm(6) s(-1), only about 30% higher than found in Ar or He. The experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations carried out on the Werner-Keller-Schinke (WKS) surface [Keller et al., J. Chem. Phys. 105, 4983 (1996)], within the framework of the isolated resonance model (IRM). The positions and lifetimes of resonance states are obtained by solving the complex Hamiltonian for the nonrotating MuCO system, using an L2 method, with an absorbing potential in the asymptotic region. Accurate values of the vibrational bound and resonance states of MuCO reveal unprecedented isotope effects in comparisons with HCO, due to the remarkable effect of replacing H by the very light Mu atom (m(Mu) approximately (1/9)m(H)). Due to its pronounced zero-point energy shift, there are only two (J = 0) bound states in MuCO. Contributions from nonzero J states to the termolecular rate constants are evaluated through the J-shifting approximation, with rotational constants evaluated at the potential minimum. The value of the important A constant (181 cm(-1)) used in this approximation was supported by accurate J = K = 1 calculations, from which A = 180 cm(-1) was obtained by numerical evaluation. The calculations presented here, with a \"weak collision factor\" beta c = 0.001, indicative of the very sparse density of MuCO states, give a very good account of both the magnitude and pressure dependence of the experimental rates, but only when the fact that the two initially bound (J = 0) states become resonances for J &gt; 0 is taken into account. This is the first time in IRM calculations of atom-molecule recombination reactions where J not equal to 0 states have proven to be so important, thus providing a truly unique test of quantum rate theory.",

Relativistic and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections are also taken into account. The quantum mechanical barrier with these corrections is predicted to be 6.4+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1) and the reaction exothermicity to be 8.8+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1). The importance of these parameters for the thermal NO(x) decomposition (De-NO(x)) process is discussed. The unimolecular rate constant for dissociation of the HN(2) molecule and its lifetime are estimated by canonical transition-state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory.

The rate coefficients for Deltav = 0 processes decline monotonically with increasing |Deltaj|. The Deltav = 1 rate coefficients are also peaked near Deltaj = 0 but show a broad shoulder extending to approximately Deltaj = 30. Classical trajectory calculations and accurate quantum mechanical close-coupled calculations were used to compute theoretical rate constants from an ab initio potential surface. The agreement between the classical and quantum calculations is very good. The calculations slightly overestimate the measured rate constants for Deltav = 0, Deltaj &lt;or= 6 processes but underestimate those for Deltav = 0, Deltaj &gt;or= 20, implying that the anisotropy of the ab initio surface is too small at short range and too large at long range. For Deltav = 1 collisions, the calculations agree well with experiment for Deltaj &lt;or= 0 and show the correct qualitative behavior for positive Deltaj, including both the peaking at Deltaj = 0 and the shoulder extending to positive Deltaj. However, they underestimate rate constants for Deltav = 1, Deltaj &gt; 0 collisions, disagreeing with experiment by a factor of 2 for Deltaj approximately 20 but agreeing better at higher and lower Deltaj. Analysis of classical trajectories indicates that the vibrationally inelastic collisions fall into two groups corresponding to equatorial and near-end impacts; the former generally produce small Deltaj while the latter produce large Deltaj.

Least-squares fits to 17 potential parameters gives a potential which reproduces 173 vibrational term values with a standard deviation of only 2.8 cm-1 in the low-energy region (&lt;10 000 cm-1). For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state.

The vibration-rotation energy levels of the perturbed A 2Pi and B' 2Sigma+ states were fitted as individual term values, while those of the X 2Sigma+ ground state were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach. A new analytic potential energy function that imposes the theoretically correct attractive potential at long-range, and a radial Hamiltonian that includes the spin-rotation interaction were employed, and a significantly improved value for the ground state dissociation energy of MgH was obtained. The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The equilibrium dissociation energy for the X 2Sigma+ ground state of 24MgH has been determined to be De=11104.7+/-0.5 cm(-1) (1.37681+/-0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v''=0) is 739.11+/-0.01 cm(-1).

Key concepts, such as the phase space dividing surface separating reactants from products, the average gap time, and the volume of phase space associated with reactive trajectories, are both rigorously defined and readily computed within the phase space approach. We analyze in detail the gap time distribution and associated reactant lifetime distribution for the isomerization reaction HCN &lt;==&gt; CNH, previously studied using the methods of phase space transition state theory. Both algebraic (power law) and exponential decay regimes have been identified. Statistical estimates of the isomerization rate are compared with the numerically determined decay rate. Correcting the RRKM estimate to account for the measure of the reactant phase space region occupied by trapped trajectories results in a drastic overestimate of the isomerization rate. Compensating but as yet not fully understood trapping mechanisms in the reactant region serve to slow the escape rate sufficiently that the uncorrected RRKM estimate turns out to be reasonably accurate, at least at the particular energy studied. Examination of the decay properties of subensembles of trajectories that exit the HCN well through either of two available symmetry related product channels shows that the complete trajectory ensemble effectively attains the full symmetry of the system phase space on a short time scale t approximately &lt; 0.5 ps, after which the product branching ratio is 1:1, the \"statistical\" value.

The vibrational energy levels were selected by using a semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) quantization procedure while the relative translational energy was sampled from a Boltzmann weighted distribution. The rate coefficient for the formation of the OH + O products is seen to increase monotonically with quantum number and nearly monotonically with temperature. On the MB PES, at T = 1000 K, the total rate coefficient increases by a factor of 5.2 as the initial vibrational quantum number of the O(2) diatom increases from v = 6 to v = 10. For T = 2000 K, this factor drops to 3.3, to 2.9 for T = 3000 K, and to 2.5 for T = 4000 K.

In particular, at T = 4000 K, the two PESs used in this work differ dramatically in the roles of the less-direct and more-direct trajectories. The behavior of the more-direct and less-direct groups of trajectories can be understood in terms of the efficiency of intramolecular vibrational energy transfer.

The potential-energy surfaces are derived from a diatomics-in-molecules model with the addition of the induced dipole-induced dipole and spin-orbit interactions. The results show extensive and fast fragmentation. The dimer is the most abundant ionic fragment, with a proportion increasing from 66% for n = 2 to a maximum of 95% for n = 6 and then decreasing down to 67% for n = 11. The next abundant fragment is the monomer for n &lt; 7 and the trimer otherwise. The parent ion dissociation lifetimes are all in the range of 1 ps. Long-lived trajectories appear for initial cluster sizes of seven and higher, and favor the formation of the larger fragments (trimers and tetramers). Our results show quantitative agreement with available experimental results concerning the extensive character of the fragmentation: Ar+ and Ar2(+) are the only ionic fragments for sizes up to five atoms; their overall proportion is in quantitative agreement for all the studied sizes; Ar2(+) is the main fragment for all sizes; stable Ar3(+) fragments only appear for n &gt; or = 5, and their proportion increases smoothly with cluster size from there. However, the individual ionic monomer and dimer fragment proportions differ. The experimental ones exhibit oscillations with initial cluster size, with a slight tendency to decrease on average for the monomer. In contrast our results show a monotonic, systematic evolution, similar to what was found in our earlier studies on neon and krypton clusters. Several hypotheses are discussed in order to find the origin of this discrepancy. Finally, the metastable II(1/2)u and II(1/2)g states of Ar2(+) are found to decay with a lifetime of 3.5 and 0.1 ps, respectively, due to spin-orbit coupling.

The ST approach is used to study mass effects for product energy partitioning in HX(X = F or Cl) elimination from halogenated alkanes by using the MP26-31G(*) PES for C(2)H(5)F dissociation and varying the masses of the C, H, and F atoms.

If the center of mass of the polyatomic product is located away from the C atom from which HX recoils, the polyatomic has substantial rotation energy.

Employing a time-independent algorithm on a very fine energy grid allowed the resolution of hundreds of narrow resonances with lifetimes in the picosecond range. The resonances were assigned to rotationally excited van der Waals complexes lying in the entrance and exit channels. Resonance peaks observed in the J = 0 calculation broke into multiplets for J &gt; 0 corresponding to the range of allowed helicity states. The Smith lifetime matrix, Q(E), was used to efficiently extract the resonance properties. The largest eigenvalue of Q(E) was used for the position and total width, while the corresponding eigenvector was used to obtain the partial widths. A simple model based on the conventional treatment of rotationally excited van der Waals triatomics was used to predict the resonance spectrum to an accuracy of ~0.02 kcal∕mol. The model predicts the density of resonance states in good agreement with the exact scattering results.",

It allows recombination to occur both via direct three-body collisions and via tunneling into the quasibound states of the energy transfer mechanism. The eigenvalue rate coefficients are determined. Significant isotope effects are clearly found, and their behavior depends on the pressure, temperature, and mechanism of the reaction. Both spin statistics and symmetry breaking produce isotope effects. Under most conditions the breaking of symmetry enhances the rates, but a wide spectrum of effects is observed; they range from isotope effects with a normal mass dependence to huge, mass-independent isotope effects to cancellation and even to reversal of the isotope effects. This is the first calculation of symmetry-induced isotope effects in recombination rates from first principles. The relevance of the present effects to ozone recombination is discussed.",

It is well known that each coefficient c(k)(t) separates into an adiabatic term a(k)(t) that reflects the adjustment of the ground state to the perturbation--without actual transitions--and a nonadiabatic term b(k)(t) that yields the probability amplitude for a transition to the excited state. In this work, we prove that the energy at any time t also separates completely into adiabatic and nonadiabatic components, after accounting for the secular and normalization terms that appear in the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation via Dirac's method of variation of constants. This result is derived explicitly through third order in the perturbation. We prove that the cross-terms between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts of c(k)(t) vanish, when the energy at time t is determined as an expectation value. The adiabatic term in the energy is identical to the total energy obtained from static perturbation theory, for a system exposed to the instantaneous perturbation λH'(t).

Despite the various approximations involved in the different methods and PESs, an excellent agreement is obtained in a subset of three models: the ACCSA method with PME-SO or ab initio PESs and the QCT method with the latter PES. This suggests that the reaction takes place once the system enters the deep valley of products. In that case, the errors due to these approximate methods and PESs are small and, consequently, the rate constants are accurately calculated.

Nonseparable semiclassical transition state theory.\nFor proton transfer reactions, the tunneling contributions to the rates are often much larger than thermally activated rates at temperatures of interest. A number of separable tunneling corrections have been proposed that capture the dependence of tunneling rates on barrier height and imaginary frequency size. However, the effects of reaction pathway curvature and barrier anharmonicity are more difficult to quantify. The nonseparable semiclassical transition state theory (TST) of Hernandez and Miller [Chem. Phys. Lett. 214, 129 (1993)] accounts for curvature and barrier anharmonicity, but it requires prohibitively expensive cubic and quartic derivatives of the potential energy surface at the transition state. This paper shows how the reaction path Hamiltonian can be used to approximate the cubic and quartic derivatives used in nonseparable semiclassical transition state theory. This enables tunneling corrections that include curvature and barrier anharmonicity effects with just three frequency calculations as required by a conventional harmonic transition state theory calculation. The tunneling correction developed here is nonseparable, but can be expressed as a thermal average to enable efficient Monte Carlo calculations.

In addition to these pseudohexapeptides, conformational analysis was also carried out on three pseudotetrapeptides and three pseudooctapeptides. The target of the conformation analysis reported herein was to determine whether the ring stress of the above beta-turn models has an influence on their conformational properties. Quantitative nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements yielded interproton distances. The conformational average distances so obtained were interpreted utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to yield the conformational percentages. These conformational ratios were correlated with the conformational weights obtained by quantitative CD analysis of the same compounds. The pure component CD curves of type I and type II beta-turns were also obtained, using a recently developed algorithm (Perczel, A., Tusnády, G., Hollósi, M., &amp; Fasman, G.D., 1991b, Protein Eng. 4(6), 669-679). For the first time the results of a CD deconvolution, based on the CD spectra of 14 beta-turn models, were assigned by quantitative NOE results.

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists. As yet, the complete set of bound vibrational energy levels is far from being known, experimentally as well as theoretically. In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128]. Theory agrees with experiment within 4.5 cm(-1) on average for the four vibrational level spacings that are so far known empirically. In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state. The ground state dissociation energy D(0) is predicted to be 23164 cm(-1).",

The X(1)Σ(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 Å), whereas the A(1)Π state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 Å). The X(1)Σ(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;μ&gt;(υ), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)Π. For the level (X(1)Σ(+)), &lt;μ&gt;(0) = 0.213 D. The υ(\") = 7 and 8 X(1)Σ(+) vibrational levels are found to have the highest probability to be reached via emission from the lowest lying vibrational levels of A(1)Π. The work had a dual outcome: First, it explored consequences of different choices of the state-specific reference \"Fermi-sea\" space (\"active\" space), which is required for the construction and execution of the multiconfigurational \"complete active space self-consistent field\" calculations and the subsequent multi-reference CI calculations. In this context, comparisons with results on the weakly bound ground states of the homonuclear Be(2) and Mg(2) molecules were made. Second, it produced reliable data for the short- as well as the long-range parts of the potential energy curve (PEC). Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)Σ(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 ± 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 ± 500 a.u., respectively.

The characteristics of the estimated Lambda-doubling splitting constants (q(0), q(v), and mu) with n(= 5-8) of the nd (1)Delta(g) series have been explored. Detailed investigations reveal that the nd (1)Delta(g)(n = 6-8) states involve L uncoupling from the internuclear axis and each of these states is affected by an asymmetric perturbation caused by the up and down adjacent states. The rotational-branch intensity and position anomalies in the observed spectra of the nd (1)Delta(g) series (n = 5-8) of Na(2) lead to the conclusion that due to the effects of the L-uncoupling perturbations, the same l complexes approaching the same ion-core limits result in the same l-mixing processes which lead to the formation of the supercomplexes due to the anisotropy of the molecular-ion [Na(2)(+)(3s)] field.

Recently, the crystal structure of TGF-beta2 has been determined independently in two laboratories [Daopin, Piez, Ogawa &amp; Davies (1992). Science, 257, 369-373; Schlunegger &amp; Grütter (1992). Nature (London), 358, 430-434] and subsequently refined to higher resolutions [Daopin, Li &amp; Davies (1993). Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. In the press; Schlunegger &amp; Grütter (1993). J. Mol. Biol. In the press]. A detailed structural comparison shows that the two structures are nearly identical with the differences mostly located on the mobile regions of the molecule. The r.m.s. differences between the two structures are 0.10 A for 104 pairs of C(alpha) atoms, 0.15 A for 434 pairs of main-chain atoms, 0.33 A for 860 out of 890 pairs of protein atoms and a correlation of 90% between the temperature B factors of all protein atoms. Based on a comparison of the water molecules, a B value of 60.0 A(2) is recommended as the cut off for modeling new waters. The structural identity is striking because in one case the material was expressed in vivo in CHO cells whereas in the other case it was expressed in E. coli and had to be refolded in vitro. The overall coordinate errors are estimated to be 0.21 A from the Luzzati plot, 0.18 A from the sigma(A) plot, 0.24 A with Cruickshank's equations and 0.25 A using the empirical method of Perry &amp; Stroud. These estimates are comparable to the r.m.s. structure superposition. The r.m.s. differences correlate very well with the crystallographic B values and the relation is best described with the Cruickshank formula. In addition to the estimation of an overall error, a new application of the Cruickshank formula is presented here to estimate the local errors.",

Alternative geometries and finite salt concentration.\nThe counterion condensation theory originally proposed by Manning is extended to take account of both finite counterion concentration (m(C)) and the actual structure of the array of discrete changes. Counterion condensation is treated here as a binding isotherm problem, in which the unknown free volume is replaced by an unknown local binding constant beta', which is expected to vary with m(C) and polyion structure. The relation between the condensed fraction of counterion charge, r, beta' and m(C) is obtained from the relevant grand partition function via the maximum term method. In the case of the single polyion in a large salt reservoir, the result is practically identical to Manning's equation. In order to determine the values of beta' and r at arbitrary m(C), a second relation between r, beta' and m(C) is required. We propose an alternative auxiliary relation that is equivalent to previous assumptions near m(C) = 0, but which yields qualitatively correct and quantitatively useful results at finite m(C). Simple expressions for r vs. m(C) and beta' vs. m(C) are obtained by simultaneously solving the binding isotherm and auxiliary equations. Then r and beta' are evaluated for five different linear arrays of infinite extent with different geometries: (1) a straight line of charges with uniform axial spacing; (2) two parallel lines of in-phase uniformly spaced charges; (3) a single-helix of discrete charges with uniform axial spacing; (4) a double-helix of discrete charges with uniform axial spacing of pairs of charges; (5) a cylindrical array of many parallel charged lines, chosen to simulate a uniformly charged cylinder. In all cases, the computed binding isotherms exhibit qualitatively correct behavior. As m(C) approaches zero, r approaches the Manning limit, r = 1-1/(L(B)/b) where b is the average axial spacing of electronic charges in the array and L(B) is the Bjerrum length. However, beta' varies with polyion geometry, even in the zero salt limit, and matches the Manning value only in the case of a single straight charged line. With increasing m(C), r declines significantly below its limiting value whenever lambda(b) &gt; or approximately equal 0.3, where lambda is the Debye screening parameter. In the case of cylindrical arrays containing either 2 or 100 parallel charged lines, r also decreases, whenever lambda(d) &gt; or approximately equal 2.0, where d is the diameter of the array. In the case of two parallel charged lines, each with axial charge spacing b=3.4 A, which are separated by d = 200 A, r exhibits a plateau value, 0.76, characteristic of the two combined lines, when lambda(d)&lt;&lt;2.0, and declines with increasing m(C) to a shelf value, 0.52, characteristic of either single line, when lambda(d) &gt; or approximately equal 2.0 and the lines become effectively screened from one another. beta' behaves in a roughly similar fashion. In the case of a cylindrical array of charged lines with the diameter and linear charge density of DNA, the r-values predicted by the present theory agree fairly well with those predicted by non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory up to 0.15 M uni-univalent salt.",

In this spectral region, the pump-probe signals from ground state bleach and stimulated emission overlap strongly. Combined modeling of the time-evolution of 2D spectra as well as comparison to published pump-probe data allow us to draw conclusions on both the electronic structure of beta-carotene as well as the spectral densities giving rise to the observed optical lineshapes. To account for the experimental observations on all time scales, we need to include a transition in the visible spectral range from the first optically allowed excited state (S(2)--&gt;S(n2)). We present data from frequency resolved transient grating and pump-probe experiments confirming the importance of this transition. Furthermore, we investigate the role and nature of the S* state, controversially debated in numerous previous studies. On the basis of the analysis of Feynman diagrams, we show that the properties of S*-related signals in chi(3) techniques like pump-probe and 2D can only be accounted for if S* is an excited electronic state.

Substantial AAS has been observed directly in diffraction data near the K edge of selenium in selenolanthionine [Templeton &amp; Templeton (1988). Acta Cryst. A44, 1045-1051] and in pleiochroism of X-ray absorption in selenobiotinyl streptavidin [Hendrickson, Pähler, Smith, Satow, Merritt &amp; Phizackerley (1989). Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 86, 2190-2194]. The impact of AAS on the multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method for phase determination is of particular interest in the context of this chemical state of selenium in the light of a general method that has been developed to incorporate selenomethionine into proteins for use in MAD phasing [Hendrickson, Horton &amp; LeMaster (1990). EMBO J. 9, 1665-1672]. The first step of the MAD phasing method necessarily assumes that the anomalous-scattering factors are isotropic and our first aim here is to evaluate the effect of this approximation on initially determined phases. To obtain ultimate phases free from the effects of anisotropy, a least-squares procedure has been written in which global parameters (i.e. pertaining to the whole data set) are refined simultaneously with local parameters (i.e. pertaining to a given node h). The AAS is taken explicityly into account by considering f' and f\" as tensors instead of scalars [Templeton &amp; Templeton (1982). Acta Cryst. A38, 62-67], and the components of the f' and f\" tensors are among the refinable global parameters. The effectiveness of this procedure is tested with data simulated from the refined atomic model of selenobiotinyl streptavidin. The application of this procedure to actual Photon Factory measurements is also described. The results show that AAS does not cripple the MAD method, and that phases uncorrupted by these effects can be recovered.",

The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of ≈300  μK(CMB)√s. BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations, and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-ΛCDM expectation in the range 30 &lt; ℓ &lt; 150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of &gt;5σ. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. Cross correlating against WMAP 23 GHz maps we find that Galactic synchrotron makes a negligible contribution to the observed signal. We also examine a number of available models of polarized dust emission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power ∼(5-10)× smaller than the observed excess signal (with no significant cross-correlation with our maps). However, these models are not sufficiently constrained by external public data to exclude the possibility of dust emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. Cross correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with 3σ significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring dust at 1.7σ. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well fit by a lensed-ΛCDM+tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.20_(-0.05)(+0.07), with r = 0 disfavored at 7.0σ. Accounting for the contribution of foreground, dust will shift this value downward by an amount which will be better constrained with upcoming data sets.",

Both of these protocols are based on experiences with sources less than 1.0 cm in length. TG-43U1 recommends that for 103Pd sources, 2D anisotropy function F(r, theta), should be tabulated at a minimum for radial distances of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 cm. Anisotropy functions defined in these protocols are only valid when the point of calculation does not fall on the active length of the source. However, for elongated brachytherapy sources (active length &gt;1 cm), some of the calculation points with r &lt; 1/2 active length and small theta may fall on the source itself and there is no clear recommendation to handle this situation. In addition, the linear interpolation technique recommended by TG-43U1 is found to be valid for seed types of sources as the difference between F(r, theta) for two consecutive radii is &lt;10%. However, in the present investigations it has been found that values of F(r, 5 degrees) for a 5 cm long RadioCoil 103Pd source at radial distances of 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0 cm were 2.95, 1.74, and 1.19, respectively, with differences up to about a factor of 3. Therefore, the validity of the linear interpolation technique for an elongated brachytherapy source with such a large variation in F(r, theta) needs to be investigated. In this project, application of the TG-43U1 formalism for dose calculation around an elongated RadioCoil 103Pd brachytherapy source has been investigated. In addition, the linear interpolation techniques as described in TG-43U1 for seed type sources have been evaluated for a 5.0 cm long RadioCoil 103Pd brachytherapy source. Application of a polynomial fit to F(r, theta) has also been investigated as an alternate approach to the linear interpolation technique. The results of these investigations indicate that the TG-43U1 formalism can be extended for elongated brachytherapy sources, if the two-dimensional (2D) anisotropy function is tabulated at a minimum for radial distances of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 cm, L/2, and L/2 +/- 0.2 cm.

The experimental relaxation rates reveal an unusual signature, in being dominated by the electron spin-rotation interaction in the MuCO radical that is formed in the addition step. In N2 moderator, k0 = 1.2+/-0.1 x 10(-34) cm(6) s(-1), only about 30% higher than found in Ar or He. The experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations carried out on the Werner-Keller-Schinke (WKS) surface [Keller et al., J. Chem. Phys. 105, 4983 (1996)], within the framework of the isolated resonance model (IRM). The positions and lifetimes of resonance states are obtained by solving the complex Hamiltonian for the nonrotating MuCO system, using an L2 method, with an absorbing potential in the asymptotic region. Accurate values of the vibrational bound and resonance states of MuCO reveal unprecedented isotope effects in comparisons with HCO, due to the remarkable effect of replacing H by the very light Mu atom (m(Mu) approximately (1/9)m(H)). Due to its pronounced zero-point energy shift, there are only two (J = 0) bound states in MuCO. Contributions from nonzero J states to the termolecular rate constants are evaluated through the J-shifting approximation, with rotational constants evaluated at the potential minimum. The value of the important A constant (181 cm(-1)) used in this approximation was supported by accurate J = K = 1 calculations, from which A = 180 cm(-1) was obtained by numerical evaluation. The calculations presented here, with a \"weak collision factor\" beta c = 0.001, indicative of the very sparse density of MuCO states, give a very good account of both the magnitude and pressure dependence of the experimental rates, but only when the fact that the two initially bound (J = 0) states become resonances for J &gt; 0 is taken into account. This is the first time in IRM calculations of atom-molecule recombination reactions where J not equal to 0 states have proven to be so important, thus providing a truly unique test of quantum rate theory.",

In the translational density of states (DOS), the oscillations yield the bands at omega(1) congruent with 50 cm(-1), omega(3) congruent with 240 cm(-1) (the two well-known experimental bands of the Raman spectra) and omega(2) congruent with 160 cm(-1) (the Einstein frequency of the liquid).

The study of the relative pair dynamics shows that this lobe is due to the transverse dynamics, while the longitudinal one determines the fast DOS component at omega(3). The presence of a negative tail is highlighted. Its contribution extends beyond the region of the fast dynamics (t&lt;0.7 ps) up to about 1.5 ps and is due to a low-frequency oscillating mode that produces a low-frequency DOS band centered at about omega(0)=20 cm(-1).",

For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images. In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) &gt; or = 1% (&gt; or = 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF).

At grazing angles, the positions are calculated using the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), whereas for larger angles where the diffracted beams are transmitted though the substrate, the Born approximation (BA) is used. This method has been incorporated into simulation code (called NANOCELL) and may be used to overlay simulated spot patterns directly onto two-dimensional (2D) grazing angle of incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) patterns and 2D SAXS patterns. The GISAXS simulations are limited to the case where the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle (alpha(i) &gt; alpha(c)) and the diffraction occurs above the critical angle (alpha(f) &gt; alpha(c)). For cases of surfactant self-assembled films, the limitations are not restrictive because, typically, the critical angle is around 0.2 degrees but the largest d spacings occur around 0.8 degrees 2theta. For these materials, one finds that the DWBA predicts that the spot positions from the transmitted main beam deviate only slightly from the BA and only for diffraction peaks close the critical angle. Additional diffraction peaks from the reflected main beam are observed in GISAXS geometry but are much less intense. Using these simulations, 2D spot patterns may be used to identify space group, identify the orientation, and quantitatively fit the lattice constants for SAXS data from any angle of incidence. Characteristic patterns for 2D GISAXS and 2D low-angle transmission SAXS patterns are generated for the most common thin film structures, and as a result, GISAXS and SAXS patterns that were previously difficult to interpret are now relatively straightforward. The simulation code (NANOCELL) is written in Mathematica and is available from the author upon request.",

We find that optimal bisection thresholds, and hyperacuity tasks in general, are no better than might be expected from simple contrast detection and discrimination performance. The three-line bisection task can be described in terms of the test-pedestal paradigm where the test pattern is a horizontal dipole and the pedestal is a horizontal three-line pattern with equal spacing between the lines. When the dipole test is added to the center line, the line shifts up or down, depending on the test polarity. For low contrast pedestal lines at the optimal separation, the bisection threshold falls between the observer's own dipole contrast detection threshold and the bottom of the dipole contrast discrimination dipper function. At higher pedestal strengths performance degrades with a slope of about 0.5-0.7, similar to that found in contrast discrimination tasks. Therefore, bisection performance is compatible with expectations based on contrast discrimination data. At large pedestal line separations (&gt; 10 min) bisection thresholds in min are about 1/60 the separation and relatively independent of pedestal strength. These findings are consistent with the idea that two processes are involved in limiting bisection performance; the first limit is based on contrast sensitivity of the system and the second limit to performance is based on a local sign or position tag processing. Finally, when bisection is compared with Vernier acuity and blur resolution tasks, where the test is also a dipole, bisection performance falls roughly midway, better than Vernier acuity but worse than blur resolution.",

The diodes had a very small detection volume and one was a specially designed double diode using two parallel opposed active volumes with compensating interface perturbations. The characteristics of the detectors were investigated both for dose distribution measurements, such as depth-dose curves and lateral beam profiles, and for output factors. The dose rate and angular dependence of the diamond and the two diodes were also studied separately. The depth-dose distributions for small fields agree well for the diamond, the scintillator and the single diode, while the measured dose maximum for the double diode is about 1% higher and for the liquid chamber about 1% lower than the mean of the others when normalized at a depth of 10 cm. The plastic scintillator and the liquid ionization chamber detect a penumbra width that is slightly broadened due to the influence of their finite size, while the double diode may even underestimate the penumbra width due to its small size and high density. When corrected for the extension of the detector volume a good agreement with Monte Carlo calculated beam profiles was obtained for the plastic scintillator and the liquid ionization chamber. Profiles measured with the diamond show an asymmetry when positioned with the smallest dimension facing the beam, while the double diode, the scintillator and the liquid chamber measure symmetric profiles irrespective of positioning. Significant differences in the output factors were obtained with the different detectors. The natural diamond detector measures output factors close to those with an ionization chamber (less than 1% difference) for field sizes between 3 x 3 and 15 x 15 cm2, but overestimates the output factors for large fields and underestimates the output factors for the smallest field sizes. The single and double diodes overestimated the output factor for large field sizes by up to 7 and 12% respectively due to the high content of low-energy photons. The double diode, and to some extent the single diode, also showed a relative increase in response compared with the more water equivalent liquid chamber and plastic scintillator at the smallest fields where there is a lack of lateral electron equilibrium. Both the plastic scintillator and the liquid chamber also show responses that deviate from the ionization chamber for larger field sizes.

Previous attempts at answering this question for electromagnetic fields have emphasized maximizing the visibility under local polarization transformations. I provide a definitive answer in the general setting of partially coherent electromagnetic fields. An analytical formula is derived proving that the maximum visibility is determined by only the two smallest eigenvalues of the 4×4 two-point coherency matrix associated with the electromagnetic field. This answer reveals, for example, that any two points in a spatially incoherent scalar field can always achieve full interference visibility by applying an appropriate reversible transformation spanning both the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom - without loss of energy. Surprisingly, almost all current measures predict zero-visibility for such fields. This counter-intuitive result exploits the higher dimensionality of the Hilbert space associated with vector - rather than scalar - fields to enable coherency conversion between the field's degrees of freedom.",

When the average phase shift equals pi/2, the differential reflection phase shift delta is maximum, and the reflection Jones matrix assumes a simple form. For N &gt; square root 3, the average and differential phase shifts are equal (hence deltap = 3 deltas) at a certain angle phi that is determined as a function of N. All phase shifts rise with infinite slope at the critical angle. The limiting slope of the delta-versus-phi curve at grazing incidence (partial partial differential delta/partial partial differential phi)phi=90 degrees = -(2/N)(N2 - 1)1/2 = -2 cos phic, where phic is the critical angle and (partial partial differential2 delta/partial partial differential phi 2)phi=90 degrees = 0.

Each motion lasted for 57ms. The upper spatial limit for perception of the oblique motion was measured under two conditions: the vertical component of the oblique motion and the vertical motion were either in the same or in opposite directions. It was found that the perception of the oblique motion was strongly influenced by the relative direction of the vertical motion that preceded it; in the \"same\" condition the upper spatial limit was much shorter than in the \"opposite\" condition.

Radial TP-LIF profiles were measured for a range of pulse fluences to determine the maximum interference-free signal levels and the corresponding picosecond and nanosecond laser fluences in each of 12 flames. For an interference-free measurement, the shape of the TP-LIF profile is independent of laser fluence. For larger fluences, distortions in the profile are attributed to photodissociation of H2O, CH3, and/or other combustion intermediates, and stimulated emission. In comparison with the nanosecond laser, excitation with the picosecond laser can effectively reduce the photolytic interference and produces approximately an order of magnitude larger interference-free signal in CH4/O2/N2 flames with equivalence ratios in the range of 0.5&lt; or =Phi&lt; or =1.4, and in H2/O2 flames with 0.3&lt; or =Phi&lt; or =1.2.

No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 ± 5.7(stat) ± 1.5(syst)) × 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| &lt; 10.5 × 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence.

Despite the various approximations involved in the different methods and PESs, an excellent agreement is obtained in a subset of three models: the ACCSA method with PME-SO or ab initio PESs and the QCT method with the latter PES. This suggests that the reaction takes place once the system enters the deep valley of products.

Using the quantum uncertainty relation and electron mean free path, the magnitudes of uncertainties on electron position and momentum are calculated for different kinetic energies; a validity bound on the classical simulation of electron transport is derived. In order to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, uncertainties of 5% must be assigned to position and momentum for 1 keV electrons in water; at 100 eV, these uncertainties are 17 to 20% and are even larger at lower energies. In gaseous media such as air, these uncertainties are much smaller (less than 1% for electrons with energy 20 eV or greater). The classical Monte Carlo transport treatment is questionable for sub-1 keV electrons in condensed water as uncertainties on position and momentum must be large (relative to electron momentum and mean free path) to satisfy the quantum uncertainty principle. Simulations which do not account for these uncertainties are not faithful representations of the physical processes, calling into question the results of MC track structure codes simulating sub-1 keV electron transport. Further, the large difference in the scale at which quantum effects are important in gaseous and condensed media suggests that track structure measurements in gases are not necessarily representative of track structure in condensed materials on a micrometer or a nanometer scale.",

It is shown that the measurement uncertainty grows when both s and m increase. Also, that for s &lt; 0.25-0.3 the primary source of uncertainty is the randomness of the number of particles in the sample, and, if s exceeds 0.3, the \"log-normality\" effect becomes more dominant.

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

The motion of a particle is dominated at short times by memory effects and at longer times by the potential. We identify the time below which the particle's motion is not influenced by the potential, and find it to be approximately tau(k)/20 , where tau(k) is the relaxation time of the restoring force of the potential. This allows us to exclude the existence of free diffusive motion, &lt;Delta(x)2(t)&gt; proportional to t, even for a sphere with a radius as small as 0.27 microm in a potential as weak as 1.5 microN/m.

Furthermore, these calibration errors increase in a nontrivial fashion with particle size, trap stiffness, and sampling frequency.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

The semiclassical function from mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and frozen Gaussian wave packets is computed for the electronic transition of an excited state excess electron to the ground state in liquid methanol. The decoherence function decays on a 10 fs time scale that is qualitatively similar to the aqueous case. We demonstrate that it is the motion of the hydrogen atom, and, in particular, the hydrogen rotation around the oxygen-methyl bond which is predominantly responsible for destroying the quantum correlations between alternative states. Multiple time scales due to the slower diffusive nuclear modes, which dominate the solvation response of methanol, do not contribute to the coherence loss. The choice of the coordinate representation is investigated in detail and concluded to be irrelevant to the decay. Changes in both nuclear momenta and positions on the two alternative potential surfaces are found to contribute to decoherence, the former dominating at short times (t &lt; 5 fs), the latter controlling the decay at longer times. Various short-time approximations to the full dynamics for the decoherence function are tested for the first time. The present treatment rigorously develops the short-time description and establishes its range of validity. Whereas the lowest-order short-time approximation proves to be a very good approximation up to about 5 fs, we also find that it bounds the decay of the decoherence function. After 5 fs, the coherence decay in fact becomes faster than the single Gaussian predicted in the lowest-order short-time limit. This decay is well reflected by an enhanced low-order approximation, which is also easily computed from equilibrium classical forces.",

These investigations are based on nonadiabatic classical Monte Carlo trajectory (CMCT) simulations on a ground and an excited state potential energy surface, including up to all six adsorbate degrees of freedom. The focus is on the hot-electron mediated energy transfer from the surface to the molecule and back, and the energy partitioning between the different degrees of freedom of the desorbing molecules. We first validate for a two-mode model comprising the desorption mode and the internal vibrational coordinate, the classical Monte Carlo trajectory method by comparing with Monte Carlo wavepacket (MCWP) calculations arising from a fully quantum mechanical open-system density matrix treatment. We then proceed by extending the CMCT calculations to include all six nuclear degrees of freedom of the desorbing molecule. This allows for a detailed comparison between theory and experiment concerning isotope effects, energy partitioning (translational, vibrational, and rotational energies and their distributions), and the dependence of these properties on the laser fluence. The most important findings are as follows. (i) CMCT agrees qualitative with the MCWP scheme. (ii) The basic experimental features such as the large isotope effect, the non-linear increase of yield with laser fluence, translationally hot products (in the order of several 1000 K) and non-equipartitioning of translational and internal energies (E(trans) &gt; E(vib) &gt; E(rot)) are well reproduced.

Here, we evaluate a drift-tube IMS (DTIMS) and compare it to a similar set of experiments performed in TIMS. We found that Blanc's Law can be applied in a DTIMS to determine the mobility of an analyte in the minor gas component of a ternary mixed drift gas system within 2% error. Additionally, the calibration procedure for TIMS to convert elution voltages into a mobility value corrects for significant deviations (&gt;4%) from Blanc's Law in the elution voltage domain. For the range of gas identities probed in this effort, up to an 11% error in calibrated mobilities was observed when using a gas mixture in the TIMS that differed from the gas used for the reference mobility. However, when the gas mixture within the TIMS was the same as the respective calibrant mobilities, calibration errors within the TIMS were as low as 0.01%. Interestingly, when probing the behavior of ions with argon-containing mixtures within the TIMS, the current accepted paradigm of elution voltage being proportional to inverse mobilities in TIMS calibrations procedures was shown to deviate substantially from the trends observed with DTIMS measurements.

Electron fluxes &gt; 10(3) cm(-2) sec(-1) also are observed in the outbound pass of the Mariner 10 spacecraft throuigh the magnetosheath. The intensity versus time profiles of the particle fluxes in the magnetosphere appear with sudden onsets of approximately 10(4) cm(-2) sec(-1) beginning at interplanetary background levels and persisting for times equivalent to their being distriblited spatially over regions having a scale size comparable to the planetary radius. For a spectral form dJ/dE alpha E-gamma, where J is the differential particle intensity and E is the kinetic energy, the typical values of gamma are gamma(p) = 5.5 for protons above 500 kev and gamma(e) &gt;/= 9 for electrons above 170 kev. Large coherent electron intensity oscillations (variations of factors of 10 to 100) have been discovered with characteristic periods of approximately 6 seconds and with higher frequency components. In some cases proton bursts are found in phase with these oscillations. On the basis of the experimental evidence and a knowledge of the general magnetic field intensities and directions along the trajectory of Mariner 10 provided by the magnetic field observations, it is shown that the radiation events observed in the magnetosphere and magnetosheath are transient and are not interpretable in terms of stable trapped particle populations. Furthermtiore, experimental evidence strongly supports the view that the particles are impulsively accelerated and that the acceleration source is not more distant from the point of observation along lines of force than approximately 8 x 10(3) to 16 x 10(3) kilometers (3 to 6.5 units of Mercury's radius). Candidates for the regions most likely to be sources of particle acceleration are discussed, namely, the magnetotail and the magnetosheath. It is pointed out that the phenomena discovered at Mercury will place more stringent conditions on allowed mnodels for electron and proton acceleration than have heretofore been possible in studies within the earth's magnetosphere.",

The associated uncertainty of radioactivity, which is a significant component of data report, plays a vital role in intercomparison and should be well evaluated. Although measurement uncertainty of laboratory result was well defined in ISO standards and IAEA technical documents, the decay/ingrowth uncertainty correction from laboratory result to in-situ result was less studied. It was demonstrated that the relative uncertainty of in-situ (210)Pb activity was independent of elapsed time and equal to relative uncertainty of laboratory measuring (210)Po activity at second spontaneous deposition date. The relative uncertainty of in-situ (210)Po activity decreases with in-situ activity ratio of (210)Po to (210)Pb and increases with elapsed time between sampling date and separation date, relative uncertainty of laboratory measuring (210)Po activity at first spontaneous deposition date and relative uncertainty of in-situ (210)Pb activity.

However, whether thermal radiation with weak non-equilibrium pumping can exceed the blackbody limit in the far field remains un-answered experimentally.

This paper provides absolute intensity measurements, quantum efficiencies and signal-to-blackbody radiation ratios at peak emission wavelengths, at various temperatures (20-1400°C), for Y(2)O(3):Eu, YAG:Tb and YAG:Tm thermographic phosphors under 266 and 355 nm excitation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These terms are beneficial in a number of ways for engineers wanting to use a phosphor thermometry solution at high temperatures. They may also provide additional insight to the physical luminescence processes of phosphors at high temperatures. The phosphor signal:blackbody radiation ratio is useful because it combines the effects of blackbody radiation and phosphor emission intensities at various temperatures, providing a valuable quantitative evaluation that can be used as a design aid for phosphor selection. A figure of merit is the temperature when the blackbody radiation equals the phosphor emission (ratio = 1); this is the cross-over temperature at which the blackbody radiation rapidly starts to overtake and mask out phosphor emissions. To the best of our knowledge no such work exists previously. The results presented show a variation in phosphor intensity with increasing temperature, and although the intensity and quantum efficiencies for Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb were much greater than YAG:Tm at low temperatures, YAG:Tm was found to be the most efficient phosphor investigated at higher temperatures (&gt;900°C). With a peak emission wavelength of 458 nm, YAG:Tm experienced the lowest proportion of blackbody radiation therefore its advantage at higher temperatures was further amplified and was found to offer an advantage of approximately +350°C and +250°C increased upper temperature capability compared to Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb phosphors, respectively.",

Known as a natural Greenhouse Effect (GE), this near-surface Atmospheric Thermal Enhancement (ATE) as named herein is presently entirely attributed to the absorption of up-welling long-wave radiation by greenhouse gases. Often quoted as 33 K for Earth, GE is estimated as a difference between planet's observed mean surface temperature and an effective radiating temperature calculated from the globally averaged absorbed solar flux using the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) radiation law. This approach equates a planet's average temperature in the absence of greenhouse gases or atmosphere to an effective emission temperature assuming ATE ≡ GE. The SB law is also routinely employed to estimating the mean temperatures of airless bodies. We demonstrate that this formula as applied to spherical objects is mathematically incorrect owing to Hölder's inequality between integrals and leads to biased results such as a significant underestimation of Earth's ATE. We derive a new expression for the mean physical temperature of airless bodies based on an analytic integration of the SB law over a sphere that accounts for effects of regolith heat storage and cosmic background radiation on nighttime temperatures. Upon verifying our model against Moon surface temperature data provided by the NASA Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we propose it as a new analytic standard for evaluating the thermal environment of airless bodies. Physical evidence is presented that Earth's ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth's total ATE is ~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE = GE + TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE &gt; 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth's ATE defined as GE = ATE - TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.

It was flown on a sounding rocket, and data were obtained on the diffuse background between 80 and 650 angstroms.  These are the first spectral measurements of this background below 520 angstroms.  Several emission features were detected, including interplanetary He I 584 angstroms emission and geocoronal He II 304 angstroms emission.  Other features observed may originate in a hot ionized interstellar gas, but if this interpretation is correct, gas at several different temperatures is present.  The strongest of these features is consistent with O V emission at 630 angstroms.  This emission, when combined with upper limits for other lines, restricts the temperature of this component to 5.5 &lt; log T &lt; 5.7, in agreement with temperatures derived from O VI absorption studies.  A power-law distribution of temperatures is consistent with this feature only if the power-law coefficient is negative, as is predicted for saturated evaporation of clouds in a hot medium.  In this case, the O VI absorption data confine the filling factor of the emission of f &lt; or = 4% and the pressure to more than 3.7 x 10(4) cm-3 K, substantially above ambient interstellar pressure.  Such a pressure enhancement has been predicted for clouds undergoing saturated evaporation.  Alternatively, if the O V emission covers a considerable fraction of the sky, it would be a major source of ionization.  A feature centered at about 99 angstroms is well fitted by a cluster of Fe XVIII and Fe XIX lines from gas at log T = 6.6-6.8.

Estimation of the exposure levels is the first step in controlling adverse health effects. In the present study, the irradiance of a hot blackbody emitter is replaced by its temperature in the exposure limit values for cornea and lens in the range of 780-3,000 nm. This paper explains the development and implementation of a computer code to predict a temperature, defined as Threshold Temperature, which satisfies the exposure limits already proposed by the ICNIRP. To this end, first an infinite series was created for the calculation of spectral radiance by integration with Planck's law. For calculation of irradiance, the initial terms of this infinite series were selected, and integration was performed in the wavelength region of 780 nm to 3,000 nm. Finally, using a computer code, an unknown source temperature that can emit the same irradiance was found. Exposure duration, source area, and observer distance from the hot source were entered as input data in this proposed code. Consequently, it is possible only by measurement of a Planckian emitter temperature and taking into account the distance from source and exposure time for an observer to decide whether the exposure to IR radiation in the range of 780 to 3,000 nm is permissible or not. It seems that the substitution of irradiance by the source temperature is an easier and more convenient way for hygienists to evaluate IR exposures.",

However, considerable uncertainty exists as to planetary conditions and hence surface UV at abiogenesis. Here, we present two-stream multilayer clear-sky calculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9 Ga to constrain the UV surface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and atmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can affect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of &gt;10.4; for the same atmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the equator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Hence, surface conditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences. For climatically reasonable levels of CO<sub2</sub, fluence shortward of 189 nm is screened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from variations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding from CO<sub2</sub also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible levels of CH<sub4</sub, O<sub2</sub, and O<sub3</sub. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off comparatively slowly with increasing CO<sub2</sub levels. However, if SO<sub2</sub and/or H<sub2</subS can build up to the ≥1-100 ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can dramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses. H<sub2</subO is a robust UV shield for λ &lt; 198 nm. This means that regardless of the levels of other atmospheric gases, fluence ≲198 nm is only available for cold, dry atmospheres, meaning sources with emission ≲198 (e.g., ArF excimer lasers) can only be used in simulations of cold environments with low abundance of volcanogenic gases. On the other hand, fluence at 254 nm is unshielded by H<sub2</subO and is available across a broad range of [Formula: see text], meaning that mercury lamps are suitable for initial studies regardless of the uncertainty in primordial H<sub2</subO and CO<sub2</sub levels.

Spectral absorbance properties of pigment (aph), detritus (ad) and chromophoric dissolved organic material (aCDOM) displayed both seasonal and wavelength specific variability. On an annual basis, absorbance by aCDOM was the highest absorbing fraction (47-59%) for the UVR wavelengths measured (305, 320, 340 and 380 nm) but decreased (32%) at 450 nm. Contribution of pigments to total absorbance was highest (40-60%) during a spring bloom for both UVR and PAR. A large variability (C.V. &gt; 42%) for annual average attenuation coefficients (Kd[lambda]) at respective wavelengths observed suggests that the spectral composition of the water column changes throughout the year in this region.

Using spectral measurements (400-700 nm) from a spectrophotometer, an algorithm was developed to measure erythema in white Caucasians (n = 9) and black West Africans (n = 11) 19-24 h postsolar simulated radiation (SSR) exposures to the volar forearm.

Absorption by hemoglobin at 580 nm was used as a proxy for erythema, and melanin was quantified between 650 and 700 nm. Our algorithm corrected the erythema measurements for stray specular (mirror-like) reflection and the melanin-masking effect. A linear relationship between SSR exposure and erythema was evident (p &lt; 0.0001 for white and black skin), and white skin is 8.4 times more responsive to SSR compared to black skin.

The method, which may be applied to any black body source, uses the universality of the Planck formula for the black body spectrum, which allows estimation of the radiated power in any wavelength range by measuring the power radiated in another range. This capability may be very useful when the range of interest is one in which radiometers are expensive and difficult to calibrate, as for the IR-B and IR-C ranges, because a more commonly available luxometer can be used instead. The results of measurements and evaluations in two traditional Italian glass factories are reported and compared with the threshold limit value given by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. Intense exposures in the IR-B and IR-C ranges has been found for some workers, exceeding the limit by a large factor.

This maximum area should be conservative for any transmitter at any distance &gt;2 mm from the primary transmitting antennas or secondary field-generating sources. To derive a generically valid maximum averaging area, an analytical approximation for the peak temperature increase caused by localized exposure was derived. The results for a threshold value of 1 K temperature rise were validated against simulations of a series of sources composed of electrical and magnetic elements (dipoles, slots, patches, and arrays) that represented the spectrum of relevant transmitters. The validation was successful for frequencies in which the power deposition occurred superficially (i.e., &gt;10 GHz). In conclusion, the averaging area for a PD limit of 10 W/m<sup2</sup that conservatively limits the temperature increase in the skin to less than 1 K at any distance &gt;2 mm from the transmitters is frequency dependent, increases with distance, and ranges from 3 cm<sup2</sup at &lt;10 GHz to 1.9 cm<sup2</sup at 100 GHz. In the far-field, the area depends additionally on distance and the antenna array aperture. The correlation was found to be worse at lower frequencies (&lt;10 GHz) and very close to the source, the systematic evaluation of which is part of another study to investigate the effect of different coupling mechanisms in the reactive near-field on the ratio of temperature increase to incident power density.

The long wavelength limit (320 nm) was based on observations of the effect of window glass filtration and on comparison of the effect of mid and long UV radiation. It provide little information as to the efficacy of wavelengths in this range. We performed a series of experiments to provide more specific comparative data by testing the hypothesis that the action spectrum for carcinogenesis parallel that for erythema. Albino mice were exposed the emission of a diffraction grating monochromator (5 nm half power bandwidth) at 290, 300, 310, and 320 nm. Energy levels were proportional to valves for the erythema spectrum of untanned Caucasian human skin. Exposures were given thrice weekly until 50% of the mice had developed tumors.

It was found that, within the limits of experimental error, the hypothesis that the CIE reference action spectrum is a valid predictor of the erythemal effectiveness of different wavelengths of UVR could not be dismissed. There is no strong reason, therefore, why the CIE action spectrum should not continue to be used as a reference to compare the erythemal effectiveness of different broadband sources.

The E(a) values have been determined from the temperature-dependence of spectral sensitivity in the long-wavelength range. As shown previously, the simple physical idea E(a) =const. x (1/lambda(max)) (here termed the Stiles-Lewis-Barlow or SLB relation) does not hold strictly. Yet there is a significant correlation between E(a) and 1/lambda(max) (r(2)=0.73) and the regression slope obtained by an unbiased fit is 84% of the predicted value of the best SLB fit. The correlation can be decomposed into effects of A1 --&gt; A2 chromophore change and effects of opsin differences. For a chromophore change in the same opsin, studied in two A1/A2 pigment pairs, the SLB relation holds nearly perfectly. In seven pigments having different opsins but the same (A2) chromophore, the correlation of E(a) and 1/lambda(max) remained highly significant (r(2)=0.78), but the regression coefficient is only 72% of the best SLB fit. We conclude that (1) when the chromophore is exchanged in the same opsin, the lambda(max) shift directly reflects the difference in photoactivation energies, (2) when the opsin is modified by amino acid substitutions, lambda(max) and E(a) can be tuned partly independently, although there is a dominant tendency for inverse proportionality. In four (A1) rhodopsins with virtually the same lambda(max), E(a) varied over a 4.5 kcal/mol range, which may be taken as a measure of the freedom for independent tuning. Assuming that low E(a) correlates with high thermal noise, we suggest that the leeway in lambda(max) - E(a) coupling is used by natural selection to keep E(a) as high as possible in long-wavelength-sensitive pigments, and that this is why the opsin-dependent E(a) (1/lambda(max))-relation is shallower than predicted.",

Compared to the usually employed E//c-axis, the a-axis of Yb:YLF provides a much broader and smooth gain profile, but this comes at the expense of reduced gain product. We have shown that, despite the lower gain, which (i) increases susceptibility to cavity losses, (ii) raises lasing threshold, and (iii) inflates thermal load, efficient and high-power lasing could be achieved in the E//a axis as well. A record continuous-wave (cw) powers above 300 W, cw slope efficiencies of 73%, and a tuning range covering the 995-1020.5 nm region were demonstrated. In quasi-cw lasing experiments, via minimization of thermal effects, slope efficiencies can be scaled up to 85%. In gain-switched operation, sub-50-µs long pulses with a peak power exceeding 2.5 kW at multi-kHz repetition rate were attained. We measured a beam quality factor below 1.5 for laser average powers up to 100 W and below 3 for laser average powers up to 300 W.

Several emission features were detected, including interplanetary He I 584 angstroms emission and geocoronal He II 304 angstroms emission.  Other features observed may originate in a hot ionized interstellar gas, but if this interpretation is correct, gas at several different temperatures is present.  The strongest of these features is consistent with O V emission at 630 angstroms.  This emission, when combined with upper limits for other lines, restricts the temperature of this component to 5.5 &lt; log T &lt; 5.7, in agreement with temperatures derived from O VI absorption studies.  A power-law distribution of temperatures is consistent with this feature only if the power-law coefficient is negative, as is predicted for saturated evaporation of clouds in a hot medium.  In this case, the O VI absorption data confine the filling factor of the emission of f &lt; or = 4% and the pressure to more than 3.7 x 10(4) cm-3 K, substantially above ambient interstellar pressure.  Such a pressure enhancement has been predicted for clouds undergoing saturated evaporation.

However, considerable uncertainty exists as to planetary conditions and hence surface UV at abiogenesis. Here, we present two-stream multilayer clear-sky calculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9 Ga to constrain the UV surface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and atmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can affect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of &gt;10.4; for the same atmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the equator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Hence, surface conditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences. For climatically reasonable levels of CO<sub2</sub, fluence shortward of 189 nm is screened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from variations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding from CO<sub2</sub also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible levels of CH<sub4</sub, O<sub2</sub, and O<sub3</sub. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off comparatively slowly with increasing CO<sub2</sub levels. However, if SO<sub2</sub and/or H<sub2</subS can build up to the ≥1-100 ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can dramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses. H<sub2</subO is a robust UV shield for λ &lt; 198 nm. This means that regardless of the levels of other atmospheric gases, fluence ≲198 nm is only available for cold, dry atmospheres, meaning sources with emission ≲198 (e.g., ArF excimer lasers) can only be used in simulations of cold environments with low abundance of volcanogenic gases. On the other hand, fluence at 254 nm is unshielded by H<sub2</subO and is available across a broad range of [Formula: see text], meaning that mercury lamps are suitable for initial studies regardless of the uncertainty in primordial H<sub2</subO and CO<sub2</sub levels.

Known as a natural Greenhouse Effect (GE), this near-surface Atmospheric Thermal Enhancement (ATE) as named herein is presently entirely attributed to the absorption of up-welling long-wave radiation by greenhouse gases. Often quoted as 33 K for Earth, GE is estimated as a difference between planet's observed mean surface temperature and an effective radiating temperature calculated from the globally averaged absorbed solar flux using the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) radiation law. This approach equates a planet's average temperature in the absence of greenhouse gases or atmosphere to an effective emission temperature assuming ATE ≡ GE. The SB law is also routinely employed to estimating the mean temperatures of airless bodies. We demonstrate that this formula as applied to spherical objects is mathematically incorrect owing to Hölder's inequality between integrals and leads to biased results such as a significant underestimation of Earth's ATE. We derive a new expression for the mean physical temperature of airless bodies based on an analytic integration of the SB law over a sphere that accounts for effects of regolith heat storage and cosmic background radiation on nighttime temperatures. Upon verifying our model against Moon surface temperature data provided by the NASA Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we propose it as a new analytic standard for evaluating the thermal environment of airless bodies. Physical evidence is presented that Earth's ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth's total ATE is ~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE = GE + TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE &gt; 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth's ATE defined as GE = ATE - TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.

However, whether thermal radiation with weak non-equilibrium pumping can exceed the blackbody limit in the far field remains un-answered experimentally. Here, we compare thermal radiation from a micro-cavity/tungsten photonic crystal (W-PC) and a blackbody, which are both measured from the same sample and also in-situ.

NCN radicals and O atoms have been quantitatively generated by the pyrolysis of NCN(3) and N(2)O, respectively. NCN concentration-time profiles have been monitored behind shock waves using narrow-bandwidth laser absorption at a wavelength of λ = 329.1302 nm. Whereas no pressure dependence was discernible at pressures between 709 mbar &lt; p &lt; 1861 mbar, a barely significant temperature dependence corresponding to an activation energy of 5.8 ± 6.0 kJ mol(-1) was found. Overall, at temperatures of 1826 K &lt; T &lt; 2783 K, the rate constant can be expressed as k(NCN + O) = 9.6 × 10(13)× exp(-5.8 kJ mol(-1)/RT) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) (±40%). As a requirement for accurate high temperature rate constant measurements, a consistent NCN background mechanism has been derived from pyrolysis experiments of pure NCN(3)/Ar gas mixtures, beforehand. Presumably, the bimolecular secondary reaction NCN + NCN yields CN radicals hence triggering a chain reaction cycle that efficiently removes NCN. A temperature independent value of k(NCN + NCN) = (3.7 ± 1.5) × 10(12) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) has been determined from measurements at pressures ranging from 143 mbar to 1884 mbar and temperatures ranging from 966 K to 1900 K.

The two have been separated for 9,000 years and have adapted to different spectral environments (\"Sea\" and \"Lake\") with porphyropsins peaking at lambdamax=529 nm and 554 nm, respectively. The estimation of Ea was based on measurement of temperature effects on the spectral sensitivity of the eye.

The glass-vapor interface was considered as two distinct regions, a wavelength-thickness vapor layer joined to the surface and a more remote vapor region. The first region was analyzed as a spectral filter that annihilates the absorbed photons and the second one as a rich spectral light source. The experimental setup is described. A Rb reference cell (T = 293 K) was used. A part of the laser beam scanned the 5S1/2(F = 3) --&gt; 5P3/2(F' = 2,3,4) transition. The Doppler broadened absorption profile (FWHM = 510 MHz) was determined. The laser detuning of the profile-center relative to the F = 3 --&gt; F' = 4 transition was about 70 MHz. Another laser beam was directed to the entrance cell window. The resonant retrofluorescence S(ob)(upsilon(L)) as a function of laser detuning for a cell temperature approximately 130 degrees C and laser power 0.4 mW was obtained. We can extract the experimental signal sexp(n) (upsilon(L)) originating from the near-field region by subtracting signal S(T) (upsilon(L)) originating from the far-field region from the total experiment signal S(ob)(upsilon(L)). A fit of the normalized profile of the data corresponding to the spectral band centered on the F' = 4 --&gt; F = 3 hyperfine transition line was obtained by using a Lorentzian distribution function with GammaRF = 50 MHz full width at half-maximum. The role played by different relaxation processes contributing to the retrofluorescent atomic linewidth was characterized. The authors summed up the corresponding spectral broadening and obtained the relation GammaRF = Gamman + Gammacoll + Gammanr, where Gammacoll is the resonance collisional broadening of the hyperfine line, and Gammanr is an additional broadening induced by the nonradiative energy-transfer phenomena of the excited atoms near the cell window surface. To evaluate Gammacoll, we used the relation Gammacoll = gammaRb - RbN, where gammaRb - Rb is line broadening parameter, and N is Rb atom number density.

The surface was decomposed using a many-body expansion. Accurate two-body potentials for HgBr, HgAr, and ArBr were calculated using coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations and a perturbative treatment of triple excitations [CCSD(T)], as well as the multireference averaged coupled pair functional method. Correlation consistent basis sets were used to extrapolate to the complete basis set limit and corrections were included to account for scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects, core-valence correlation, and the Lamb shift. The three-body potential was computed with the CCSD(T) method and triple-zeta quality basis sets. Quasiclassical trajectories using the final analytical potential surface were directly carried out on the CID of HgBr by Ar for a large sampling of initial rotational, vibrational, and collision energies. The recombination rate of Hg and Br atoms is a likely first step in mercury depletion events that have been observed in the Arctic troposphere during polar sunrise. The effective second order rate constant for this process was determined in this work from the calculated CID rate as a function of temperature using the principle of detailed balance, which resulted in k(T) = 1.2 x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 260 K and 1 bar pressure.",

A model for acetone photolysis is proposed that can adequately describe both the present and literature data.

The vibrational energy levels were selected by using a semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) quantization procedure while the relative translational energy was sampled from a Boltzmann weighted distribution. The rate coefficient for the formation of the OH + O products is seen to increase monotonically with quantum number and nearly monotonically with temperature. On the MB PES, at T = 1000 K, the total rate coefficient increases by a factor of 5.2 as the initial vibrational quantum number of the O(2) diatom increases from v = 6 to v = 10.

In particular, at T = 4000 K, the two PESs used in this work differ dramatically in the roles of the less-direct and more-direct trajectories. The behavior of the more-direct and less-direct groups of trajectories can be understood in terms of the efficiency of intramolecular vibrational energy transfer.

The effects of K(6S, 4D)-K collisions could be neglected in our experimental condition. On excitation of K(6S) state, the decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 6S--&gt;4P transition was monitored. The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state.

In this study, the actual temperature distributions of two blackbodies (one has an extended cone shape, and the other a 65-mm diameter cylindrical shape) are measured, and the emissivities are calculated accordingly based on the nonisothermal model at a certain temperature (873 K).

The unique design of this instrument makes possible for the first time accurate determination of the background both at high Galactic latitude, where the signal is intrinsically faint, and at low Galactic latitude, where direct starlight has heretofore compromised measurements of the diffuse emission.  Because the data are spectroscopic, the continuum can be distinguished from the atomic and molecular transition features which also contribute to the background.  We find the continuum intensity to be well correlated with the Galactic neutral hydrogen column density until saturation at about 1200 photons cm-2  s-1 sr-1 angstrom-1 is reached where tau FUV approximately 1.  Our measurement of the intensity where tau FUV &gt; or = 1 is crucial to the determination of the scattering properties of the grains.

We evaluate models of dust composition and grain-size distribution and compare their predictions with these new results.  We present evidence that, as the Galactic neutral hydrogen column density approaches zero, the FUV continuum background arises primarily from scattering by dust, which implies that dust may be present in virtually all view directions.  A non-dust-scattering continuum component has also been identified, with an intensity (external to the foreground Galactic dust) of about 115 photons cm-2 s-1 angstrom-1.

This paper provides absolute intensity measurements, quantum efficiencies and signal-to-blackbody radiation ratios at peak emission wavelengths, at various temperatures (20-1400°C), for Y(2)O(3):Eu, YAG:Tb and YAG:Tm thermographic phosphors under 266 and 355 nm excitation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These terms are beneficial in a number of ways for engineers wanting to use a phosphor thermometry solution at high temperatures. They may also provide additional insight to the physical luminescence processes of phosphors at high temperatures. The phosphor signal:blackbody radiation ratio is useful because it combines the effects of blackbody radiation and phosphor emission intensities at various temperatures, providing a valuable quantitative evaluation that can be used as a design aid for phosphor selection. A figure of merit is the temperature when the blackbody radiation equals the phosphor emission (ratio = 1); this is the cross-over temperature at which the blackbody radiation rapidly starts to overtake and mask out phosphor emissions. To the best of our knowledge no such work exists previously. The results presented show a variation in phosphor intensity with increasing temperature, and although the intensity and quantum efficiencies for Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb were much greater than YAG:Tm at low temperatures, YAG:Tm was found to be the most efficient phosphor investigated at higher temperatures (&gt;900°C). With a peak emission wavelength of 458 nm, YAG:Tm experienced the lowest proportion of blackbody radiation therefore its advantage at higher temperatures was further amplified and was found to offer an advantage of approximately +350°C and +250°C increased upper temperature capability compared to Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb phosphors, respectively.",

By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212 +/- 11 K at a wavelength of 8 mum, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16 +/- 6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.",

Here, we describe a study of the N2 + N2⟶N2 + 2N and N2 + N2⟶4N nitrogen dissociation reactions using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. The simulations used a new potential energy surface for the N4 system; the surface is an improved version of one that was presented previously. In the QCT calculations, initial conditions were determined based on a two-temperature model that approximately separates the translational-rotational temperature from the vibrational temperature of the N2 diatoms. Five values from 8000 K to 30,000 K were considered for each of the two temperatures. Over 2.4 × 10(9) trajectories were calculated. We present results for ensemble-averaged dissociation rate constants as functions of the translational-rotational temperature T and the vibrational temperature T(v). The rate constant depends more strongly on T when T(v) is low, and it depends more strongly on T(v) when T is low. Quasibound reactant states contribute significantly to the rate constants, as do exchange processes at higher temperatures. We discuss two sets of runs in detail: an equilibrium test set in which T = T(v) and a nonequilibrium test set in which T(v) &lt; T. In the equilibrium test set, high-v and moderately-low-j molecules contribute most significantly to the overall dissociation rate, and this state specificity becomes stronger as the temperature decreases. Dissociating trajectories tend to result in a major loss of vibrational energy and a minor loss of rotational energy. In the nonequilibrium test set, as T(v) decreases while T is fixed, higher-j molecules contribute more significantly to the dissociation rate, dissociating trajectories tend to result in a greater rotational energy loss, and the dissociation probability's dependence on v weakens. In this way, as T(v) decreases, rotational energy appears to compensate for the decline in average vibrational energy in promoting dissociation. In both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium test sets, in every case, the average total internal energy loss in the dissociating trajectories is between 10.2 and 11.0 eV, slightly larger than the equilibrium potential energy change of N2 dissociation.",

Photoexcitation at long wavelengths results in population of the (1)(n/pi)sigma* excited state, prompt S-H bond fission, H atoms displaying a (nonlimiting) perpendicular recoil velocity distribution, and partner radicals formed in selected low vibrational levels of the ground state.

The computed equilibrium geometry for the X A1 ground state, as well as vibrational frequencies for the nu2 umbrella and nu3 symmetric stretch modes, are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data.

The C6H5S cofragments are formed in both their ground (X(2)B1) and first excited ((2)B2) electronic states, in a distribution of vibrational levels that spreads and shifts to higher internal energies as lambda(phot) is reduced. Excitation at lambda(phot) &gt; 275 nm populates levels of the first (1)pi pi* state, which decay by tunnelling to the dissociative (1)pi sigma* state potential energy surface (PES). S-H torsional motion is identified as a coupling mode facilitating population transfer at the conical intersection (CI) between the diabatic (1)pi pi* and (1)pi sigma* PESs. At shorter lambda(phot), the (1)pi sigma* state is deduced to be populated either directly or by efficient vibronic coupling from higher (1)pipi* states.

N-H bond fission via the low lying (1)pi sigma(*) electronic state of aniline is experimentally demonstrated. The (1)pi sigma(*) potential energy surface (PES) of this prototypical aromatic amine is essentially repulsive along the N-H stretch coordinate, but possesses a shallow potential well in the vertical Franck-Condon region, supporting quasibound vibrational levels. Photoexcitation at wavelengths (lambda(phot)) in the range 293.859 nm &gt; or = lambda(phot) &gt; or = 193.3 nm yields H atom loss via a range of mechanisms. With lambda(phot) resonant with the 1(1)pi pi(*) &lt;-- S(0) origin (293.859 nm), H atom loss proceeds via, predominantly, multiphoton excitation processes, resonantly enhanced at the one photon energy by the first (1)pi pi(*) excited state (the 1(1)pi pi(*) state). Direct excitation to the first few quasibound vibrational levels of the (1)pi sigma(*) state (at wavelengths in the range 269.513 nm &gt; or = lambda(phot) &gt; or = 260 nm) induces N-H bond fission via H atom tunneling through an exit barrier into the repulsive region of the (1)pi sigma(*) PES, forming anilino (C(6)H(5)NH) radical products in their ground electronic state, and with very limited vibrational excitation; the photo-prepared vibrational mode in the (1)pi sigma(*) state generally evolves adiabatically into the corresponding mode of the anilino radical upon dissociation. However, as the excitation wavelength is reduced (lambda(phot) &lt; 260 nm), N-H bond fission yields fragments with substantially greater vibrational excitation, rationalized in terms of direct excitation to 1(1)pi pi(*) levels, followed by coupling to the (1)pi sigma(*) PES via a 1(1)pi pi(*)/(1)pi sigma(*) conical intersection. Changes in product kinetic energy disposal once lambda(phot) approaches approximately 230 nm likely indicate that the photodissociation pathways of aniline proceed via direct excitation to the (higher) 2(1)pi pi(*) state. Analysis of the anilino fragment vibrational energy disposal-and thus the concomitant dynamics of (1)pi sigma(*) state mediated photodissociation-provides a particularly interesting study of competing sigma(*) &lt;-- pi and pi(*) &lt;-- pi absorption processes and develops our appreciation of the photochemistry of aromatic amines. It also allows revealing comparisons with simple amines (such as ammonia and methylamine) as well as the isoelectronic species, phenol.

These transitions could be unequivocally assigned since there was residual orthohydrogen at low temperatures (slow conversion to the ground state) resulting in an observable J=1--&gt;0 transition at 5 K (kT=0.48 meV). A doublet in neutron energy loss at approximately 28.5 meV is interpreted as J=1--&gt;2 transitions. In addition to the transitions between rotational states, there are a series of peaks that arise from transitions between center-of-mass translational quantum states of the confined hydrogen molecule. A band at approximately 9 meV can be unequivocally interpreted as a transition between translational states, while broad features at 20, 25, 35, and 50-60 meV are also interpreted to as transitions between translational quantum states. A detailed comparison is made with a recent five-dimensional quantum treatment of hydrogen in the smaller dodecahedral cage in the SII ice-clathrate structure. Although there is broad agreement regarding the features such as the splitting of the J=1 degeneracy, the magnitude of the external potential is overestimated. The numerous transitions between translational states predicted by this model are in poor agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons are also made with three simple exactly solved models, namely, a particle in a box, a particle in a sphere, and a particle on the surface of a sphere. Again, there are too many predicted features by the first two models, but there is reasonable agreement with the particle on a sphere model. This is consistent with published quantum chemistry results for hydrogen in the dodecahedral 5(12) cage, where the center of the cage is found to be energetically unfavorable, resulting in a shell-like confinement for the hydrogen molecule wave function. These results demonstrate that translational quantum effects are very significant and a classical treatment of the hydrogen molecule dynamics is inappropriate under such conditions.",

Using sin(2)-shaped laser pulses of 120 fs duration with a peak intensity of I(0) &gt; 10(14) W/cm(2), it has been found that below-resonant vibrational excitation with a laser carrier frequency of ω &lt; ω(10)/2 (where ω(10) is the frequency of the |v = 0&gt; → |v = 1&gt; vibrational transition) is much more efficient than a quasi-resonant vibrational excitation at ω ≈ ω(10). In particular, at the below-resonant laser carrier frequency ω = 0.3641 × 10(-2) au (799.17 cm(-1)), dissociation probabilities of H(2)(+) (15.3% at the end of the 120 fs laser pulse and 21% at t = 240 fs) are more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than those obtained for the quasi-resonant laser frequency ω = 1.013 × 10(-2) au (2223.72 cm(-1)).

The underlying mechanism of the efficient below-resonant vibrational excitation is the electron-field following and simultaneous transfer of energy to the nuclear coordinate.",

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

The absorption spectrum, in the range of 287-278 nm, was measured through cavity ring-down spectroscopy. The radical was prepared by 193 nm photolysis of monomeric formaldoxime vapor. Two diffuse features were observed in the 34800-35800 cm(-1) spectral range, along with the A-X (1,0) band of the OH cofragment.

Often the angular distributions are highly structured and the physical interpretation of this structure is an important and difficult problem. Here, we report a surprising finding for the benchmark F + H(2) --&gt; FH + H reaction, when the product molecule FH is in a vibrational state with quantum number = 3 and a rotational state with quantum number = 3. We demonstrate that the differential cross section (DCS) is an example of (attractive) rainbow scattering, being characterized by an Airy function and its derivative. The rainbow reveals its presence in the DCS by interference with the repulsive (or nearside) scattering producing characteristic diffraction oscillations. The rainbow is broad, which explains why it has not been recognized in the many earlier theoretical and experimental investigations of this reaction. There is an angular region in the DCS where the rainbow dominates, but with the unusual property that the DCS is less intense than in adjoining angular regions. The reaction investigated is F + H(2)(v(i) = 0, j(i) = 0, m(i) = 0) --&gt; FH(v(f) = 3, j(f) = 3, m(f) = 0) + H, where v(i), j(i), m(i) and v(f), j(f), m(f) are initial and final vibrational, rotational and helicity quantum numbers, respectively. The relative translational energy is 0.119 eV. We use rigorous semiclassical (asymptotic) techniques that provide physical insight as well as a mathematically sound and numerically accurate description of the angular scattering. The semiclassical DCS agrees very closely with the exact quantum DCS. The semiclassical scattering amplitude is used to assess the physical effectiveness of the Fuller nearside-farside decomposition for the partial wave series of the F + H(2) reaction, including the effect of one resummation. We also compare the semiclassical and exact quantum nearside, farside, and full local angular momenta and find good agreement. Although our new rainbow has unusual and unexpected properties, similar rainbows are predicted to occur in the DCSs of many state-to-state chemical reactions, since the semiclassical analysis is generic and not specific to the present F + H(2) example.",

The two absorption maxima are caused by a change in the ionization state of the chromophore. The equilibrium between these states appears to be governed by a hydrogen bond network that permits proton transfer between the chromophore and neighboring side chains. The predominant neutral form of the fluorophore maximally absorbs at 395 nm. It is maintained by the carboxylate of Glu-222 through electrostatic repulsion and hydrogen bonding via a bound water molecule and Ser-205. The ionized form of the fluorophore, absorbing at 475 nm, is present in a minor fraction of the native protein. Glu-222 donates its charge to the fluorophore by proton abstraction through a hydrogen bond network, involving Ser-205 and bound water. Further stabilization of the ionized state of the fluorophore occurs through a rearrangement of the side chains of Thr-203 and His-148. UV irradiation shifts the ratio of the two absorption maxima by pumping a proton relay from the neutral chromophore's excited state to Glu-222. Loss of the Ser-205-Glu-222 hydrogen bond and isomerization of neutral Glu-222 explains the slow return to the equilibrium dark-adapted state of the chromophore. In the S65T structure, steric hindrance by the extra methyl group stabilizes a hydrogen bonding network, which prevents ionization of Glu-222. Therefore the fluorophore is permanently ionized, causing only a 489-nm excitation peak. This new understanding of proton redistribution in green fluorescent protein should enable engineering of environmentally sensitive fluorescent indicators and UV-triggered fluorescent markers of protein diffusion and trafficking in living cells.",

Dissociation dynamics have been examined at photolysis wavelengths of 266 nm (which lies in the main absorption feature) and 355 nm (which lies in the long-wavelength tail) by using high-n Rydberg time-of-flight spectroscopy to obtain center-of-mass translational energy distributions for the channels that yield H atoms. Photodissociation at 355 nm yields TeH(2Pi1/2) selectively relative to the TeH(2Pi3/2) ground state. This is attributed to the role of the 3A' state, which has a shallow well at large R(H-TeH) and correlates to H+TeH(2Pi1/2). Note that the 2Pi1/2 state is analogous to the 2P1/2 spin-orbit excited state of atomic iodine, which is isoelectronic with TeH. The 3A' state is crossed at large R only by 2A\", with which it does not interact. The character of 3A' at large R is influenced by a strong spin-orbit interaction in the TeH product. Namely, 2Pi1/2 has a higher degree of spherical symmetry than does 2Pi3/2 (recall that I(2P1/2) is spherically symmetric), and consequently 2Pi1/2 is not inclined to form either strongly bonding or antibonding orbitals with the H atom. The 3A'&lt;--X transition dipole moment dominates in the long-wavelength region and increases with R. Structure observed in the absorption spectrum in the 380-400 nm region is attributed to vibrations on 3A'. The main absorption feature that is peaked at approximately 240 nm might arise from several excited surfaces. On the basis of the high degree of laboratory system spatial anisotropy of the fragments from 266 nm photolysis, as well as high-level theoretical studies, the main contribution is believed to be due to the 4A\" surface. The 4A\"&lt;--X transition dipole moment dominates in the Franck-Condon region, and its polarization is in accord with the experimental observations.

Supersonically cooled formaldehyde was excited into selected J(Ka,Kc) rotational states of six vibrational levels (1(1)4(1), 5(1), 2(2)6(1), 2(2)4(3), 2(3)4(1), and 2(4)4(1)) in the A((1)A2) state. The laser induced fluorescence spectra of the nascent HCO fragment provided detailed product state distributions. When formaldehyde was excited into the low-lying levels 1(1)4(1), 5(1), and 2(2)6(1), at E(avail)&lt;1120 cm(-1), the product state distribution can be modeled qualitatively by phase space theory. These dynamics are interpreted as arising from a reaction path on the barrierless S0 surface. When the initial states 2(2)4(3) and 2(3)4(1) were excited (E(avail)=1120-1500 cm(-1)), a second type of product state distribution appeared. This second distribution peaked sharply at low N, Ka and was severely truncated in comparison with those obtained from the lower lying states. At the even higher energy of 2(4)4(1) (E(avail) approximately 2600 cm(-1)) the sharply peaked distribution appears to be dominant. We attribute this change in dynamics to the opening up of the triplet channel to produce HCO. The theoretical height of the barrier on the T1 surface lies between 1700 and 2100 cm(-1) and so we consider the triplet reaction to proceed via tunneling at the intermediate energies and proceed over the barrier at the higher energies. Considerable population was observed in the excited (0,0,1) state for all initial H(2)CO states that lie above the appearance energy. Rotational populations in the (0,0,1) state dropped more rapidly with (N,Ka) than did the equivalent populations in (0,0,0). This indicates that, although individual rotational states are highly populated in (0,0,1), the total v3=1 population might not be so large. Specific population was also measured in the almost isoenergetic Kc and J states. No consistent population preference was found for either asymmetry or spin-rotation component.",

The energy-pooling collision 5P3/2 + 5P3/2 --&gt; 5S1/2 + 5D producted 5D state. The Rb (5P3/2) density and spatial distribution were mapped by monitoring the absorption of a counter-propagating laser beam, tuned to the 5P3/2 --&gt; 7S1/2 transition, which could be translated parallel to the pump beam. In the presence of radiation trapping, the spontaneous radiation rate is multiplied by the transmission factor T5P3/2 --&gt; 5S1/2, which describes the average probability that photons emitted within the fluorescence detection region can pass through the optically thick vapor without being absorbed. The T5P3/2 --&gt; 5S1/2 is related to the frequency dependent absorption cross section and the density and spatial distribution of atoms in the level of the transition. The effective radiative rates of the Rb D2 line as a function of the H2 pressure were obtained. These quantities were combined with the measured excited atom density and fluorescence ratio to yield absolute energy-pooling rate coefficient. The quenching collision Rb (5P3/2) + H2 (v = 0) --&gt; Rb(5S) + H2 (v = 2) producted state H2 (v= 2). This process is at least 16 times faster than the Rb (5P3/2) radiative decay rate. The reverse process of this process is relatively unlikely due to their large translational energy defect.

Hence the relaxation rate of this vibrational level is relatively slow and the nuclear spin statistics is conserved. The H2 (v = 2) density was determined by using the cross section for Rb (5P3/2)-H2 quenching. RbH was fromed by the Rb(5D) + H2 and Rb (5P3/2) + H2 (v = 2) reactions and observed by laser absorption. The ratio of 5D --&gt; 5P3/2 to 5P3/2 --&gt; 5S1/2 fluorescence was measured as a function of the H2 density.

The cross section for Rb (5P3/2) + H2 (upsilon = 2) --&gt; RbH + H is 1.00 x 10(-8) cm2.

All available spectroscopic data then provide the basis for generating an accurately determined vibrationally complete semiempirical intermolecular potential function using a four-dimensional potential coordinate morphing methodology. These results are consistent with the existence of four bound isomers: OC-HI, OC-IH, CO-HI, and CO-IH. Analysis also leads to unequivocal characterization of the common isotopic ground state as having the OC-HI structure and with the first excited state having the OC-IH structure with an energy of 3.4683(80) cm(-1) above the ground state. The potential is consistent with the following barriers between the pairs of isomers: 382(4) cm(-1) (OC-IH/OC-HI), 294(5) cm(-1) (CO-IH/CO-HI), 324(3) cm(-1) (OC-IH/CO-IH), and 301(2) cm(-1) (OC-HI/CO-HI) defined with respect to each lower minimum. The potential is also determined to have a linear OC-IH van der Waals global equilibrium minimum structure having R(e)=4.180(11) Å, θ(1)=0.00(1)°, and θ(2)=0.00(1)°. This is differentiated from its OC-HI ground state hydrogen bound structure having R(0)=4.895(1) Å, θ(1)=20.48(1)°, and θ(2)=155.213(1)° where the distances are defined between the centers of mass of the monomers and θ(1) and θ(2) as cos(-1)[&lt;cos(2) θ(i)&gt;(1/2)] for i=1 and 2. A fundamentally new molecular phenomenon - ground state isotopic isomerization is proposed based on the generated semiempirical potential. The protonated ground state hydrogen-bonded OC-HI structure is predicted to be converted on deuteration to the corresponding ground state van der Waals OC-ID isomeric structure. This results in a large anomalous isotope effect in which the R(0) center of mass distance between monomeric components changes from 4.895(1) to 4.286(1) Å. Such a proposed isotopic effect is demonstrated to be a consequence of differential zero point energy factors resulting from the shallower nature of hydrogen bonding at a local potential minimum (greater quartic character of the potential) relative to the corresponding van der Waals global minimum. Further consequences of this anomalous deuterium isotope effect are also discussed.",

In order to investigate the entrance channel, the vibronic S(1)&lt;--&gt;S(0) spectra of the 7HQ.(NH(3))(3) and the d(2)-7DQ.(ND(3))(3) clusters have been studied by resonant two-photon ionization, UV-UV depletion and fluorescence techniques, and by ab initio calculations for the ground and excited states. For both isotopomers, the low-frequency part of the S(1)&lt;--S(0) spectra is dominated by ammonia-wire deformation and stretching vibrations. Excitation of overtones or combinations of these modes above a threshold of 200-250 cm(-1) for 7HQ.(NH(3))(3) accelerates the HAT reaction by an order of magnitude or more. The d(2)-7DQ.(ND(3))(3) cluster exhibits a more gradual threshold from 300 to 650 cm(-1). For both isotopomers, intermolecular vibrational states above the threshold exhibit faster HAT rates than the intramolecular vibrations. The reactivity, isotope effects, and mode selectivity are interpreted in terms of H atom tunneling through a barrier along the O-H--&gt;NH(3) coordinate. The barrier results from a conical intersection of the optically excited (1)pi pi(*) state with an optically dark (1)pi sigma(*) state. Excitation of the ammonia-wire stretching modes decreases both the quinoline-O-H...NH(3) distance and the energetic separation between the (1)pi pi(*) and (1)pi sigma(*) states, thereby increasing the H atom tunneling rate.

Three potential energy surfaces (PES) are studied, namely, those of Bradley and Schatz (BS), Yu, Muckerman, and Sears (YMS), and Lakin, Troya, Schatz, and Harding (LTSH). 6-D calculations are performed only for the BS PES, while 5-D results are reported for all three PES'. The 6-D results obtained in the present work improve on those previously reported, since a larger vibrational basis and a better representation of the OH and CO bonds has been introduced. In particular, we now employ a generalized Lanczos-Morse discrete variable representation for both the OH and CO vibrations. In a further improvement, the generalized discrete variable representation of the CO vibration is based on different CO intramolecular potentials for the asymptotic and product grids employed in our projection formalism. This new treatment of the vibrational bases allows for a large reduction in computation time with respect to our previous implementation of the wave packet method, for a given level of accuracy. As a result, we have been able to extend the range of collision energies for which we can obtain converged 6-D results to a higher energy (0.8 eV) than was possible before (0.5 eV). The comparison of the new 6-D and previous 5-D results for the BS PES shows good agreement of the general trend in the reaction probabilities over all collision energies considered (0.1-0.8 eV), while our previous 6-D calculation showed reaction probabilities that differed from the 5-D results by up to 10% between 0.5 and 0.8 eV. The 5-D reaction probabilities reveal interesting trends for the different PES'. In particular, at low energies (&lt; 0.2 eV) the LTSH PES gives rise to much larger reactivity than the other PES', while at high energies (&gt; 0.3 eV) its reaction probability decreases with respect to the BS and YMS PES', being more than a factor of 2 smaller at 0.8 eV. A 5-D calculation on a modified version of the LTSH surface shows that the van der Waals interaction in the entrance channel, which is not correctly described in the other PES' is largely responsible for its larger reactivity at low energies. The large difference between the 5-D reaction probabilities for the YMS and LTSH PES' serves to emphasize the importance of the van der Waals interaction for the reactivity at low energies, because most of the stationary point energies on the YMS and LTSH PES are rather similar, being in line with high-level ab initio information.",

For the equal-frequency shifted harmonic oscillator model, we derive an analytic expression for the exact vibronic line shape that emphasizes the importance of using a quantum mechanical distribution of phase space initial conditions. For the unequal-frequency shifted harmonic oscillator model, we are no longer able to obtain an exact expression for the vibronic line shape in terms of independent deterministic classical trajectories. We show how one can rigorously account for corrections to the truncated Wigner approximation through nonlinear responses of the line shape function to momentum fluctuations along a classical trajectory and demonstrate the qualitative improvement in the resulting spectrum when the leading-order quantum correction is included. Finally, we numerically simulate absorption spectra of a highly anharmonic shifted Morse potential model. We find that, while finite quantization and the dissociation limit are captured with reasonable accuracy, there is a qualitative breakdown of the quasi-classical trajectory ensemble's ability to describe the vibronic line shape when the relative shift in Morse potentials becomes large.

The theoretical approach involves ab initio potential energy surfaces correlating to the X (3)Sigma(g) (-), a (1)Delta(g), and b (1)Sigma(g) (+) states of O(2) and their corresponding spin-orbit couplings [F. Dayou, M. I. Hernandez, J. Campos-Martinez, and R. Hernandez-Lamoneda, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 074311 (2005)]. Accurate Rydberg-Klein-Rees potentials are included in order to improve the description of the vibrational structure of the fragments. The calculated Boltzmann-averaged depletion probabilities display a dependence with v in good agreement with experimental measurements. The onset of the vibrational-to-electronic (V-E) depletion mechanism is noticeable for v&gt;/=26, and it is due to energy transfer to both a (1)Delta(g) and b (1)Sigma(g) (+) states of the diatom. For O(2)(X (3)Sigma(g) (-),v=28), a further and sharp increase in the removal probabilities is caused by a near degeneracy with the O(2)(b (1)Sigma(g) (+),v=19) vibrational state. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the Boltzmann-averaged probabilities indicates a transition from the vibrational-to-translational to the V-E energy transfer regime, which can be traced back to the behavior of the inelastic probabilities as functions of kinetic energy. Furthermore, branching ratios for outcomes through the three different electronic states show a strong propensity towards populating a unique vibrational level within each electronic state. These results provide supported evidence that spin-orbit couplings account for a large portion of the \"dark channel\" reported in total depletion measurements.

We find two situations where classical trajectories satisfying the correct boundary conditions must be excluded from the semiclassical formula. The first occurs when the contribution of the trajectory to the propagator becomes exponentially large as Planck's over 2 pi goes to zero. The second occurs when the contributing trajectories undergo bifurcations. Close to the bifurcation the semiclassical formula diverges. More interestingly, in the example studied, after the bifurcation, where more than one trajectory satisfying the boundary conditions exist, only one of them in fact contributes to the semiclassical formula, a phenomenon closely related to Stokes lines.

Two contrasting mechanisms determine the behavior of q(t), when the time-varying frequency Omega(t) does produce exponential instability in the linear equation q (lin)+Omega(2)(t)q(lin)=0. At low energy, the exponential instability is the dominant effect, while at high energy the bounding effect of the autonomous nonlinear term prevails. Starting from low initial energies, the result of this competition is a time-varying energy characterized by quasiperiodic peaks, with an average recurrence time T(peak). A closed critical curve S(omega) exists in the initial phase space, whose crossing corresponds to a divergence of the recurrence time T(peak).

Traditionally the torsional quantum number vt = 0, 1, 2&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;is assigned to eigenfunctions of given K in order of increasing energy. In this paper we propose an alternative labeling scheme, using the torsional quantum number vT, which is based on properties of the K-dependent torsional overlap integrals &lt;vT, K|v'T, K'&gt;. In particular, the quantum number vT is assigned in such a way that torsional wavefunctions |vT, K&gt; vary as slowly as possible when K changes by unity. Roughly speaking, vT = vt for torsional levels below the barrier, whereas vT is more closely related to the free-rotor quantum number for levels above the barrier. Because of the latter fact, we believe vT will in general be a physically more meaningful torsional quantum number for levels above the barrier. The usefulness of &lt;vT, K|v'T, K'&gt; overlap integrals for qualitative prediction of torsion-rotation band intensities and for rationalizing the magnitudes of perturbations involving some excitation of the small-amplitude vibrations in an internal rotor problem is also discussed.

For one-dimensional systems, we obtain an explicit solution for the stationary stochastic potential: the width in phase, which is defined as the root mean square fluctuation in phase, characterizes the roughness of phase locking, and diverges with the system size L according to a power law w approximately Lalpha, with alpha=1/2. To study higher-dimensional systems, we show that the eikonal approximations of the diffusion-coupled oscillator problem and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation (in the limit of small noise intensity) are equivalent. The KPZ equation governs some forms of surface growth, and the height of a growing front corresponds to the phase (the 2pi periodicity in phase is ignored) in the diffusion-coupled oscillator problem. From the equivalence, we obtain the result that spatially synchronized states may exist only in systems with a spatial dimension greater than or equal to 3; for dimensions 1 and 2, a \"rough\" state exists in which the width (in phase) diverges algebraically with the system size, alpha&gt;0.",

Comparison with the high resolution experiments of Davis and co-workers (Science, 2000, 290, 958) shows that the structures (peaks) found in the relative translational energy distributions of products could not be satisfactorily reproduced in the calculations, probably due to the classical nature of the QCT method and the importance of quantum effects.

The authors showed that the initial fast spreading of the wave packets is followed at all energies by slow periodic intramolecular vibronic energy redistribution (IVER) with periods in the range of 0.3 to several tens of picoseconds. These energy transfers lead to oscillations with the same periods in the population of each electronic state. Propagation of wave packets indicates that IVER frequencies also dominate the fluctuations of the squared modulus of the autocorrelation function |A(t)|2 at energies not too high above the bottom of the conical intersection, but this is no longer the case at higher energies. For example, for initial wave packets prepared by almost vertical excitation of the vibrational ground state of the ground electronic surface, the oscillations of |A(t)|2 essentially reflect the detuning from 1:2 resonance between the frequency of the bend and that of the symmetric stretch in the excited electronic state.

In particular, it is shown how Wigner's [E. P. Wigner, Phys.

The explicit form of the master equation so obtained contains quantum correction terms up to o(h(4)) and in the classical limit, h --&gt; 0, reduces to the classical Klein-Kramers equation. For a quantum oscillator, the method yields an evolution equation coinciding in all respects with that of Agarwal [G. S. Agarwal, Phys. Rev. A, 1971, 4, 739]. In the high dissipation limit, the master equation reduces to a semi-classical Smoluchowski equation describing non-inertial quantum diffusion in configuration space.

The Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the separability of the excited-state potential energy surface along the excited-state normal mode coordinates are assumed. However, the potential surface is not necessarily approximated as harmonic oscillator potentials along the individual normal modes. Instead, depending upon the nature of the potential surface along a particular normal mode, it is treated either in the harmonic approximation or the full one-dimensional potential is considered along this mode. The vertical Franck-Condon approach is applicable therefore even in cases where the excited state potential energy surface is highly anharmonic and the conventional harmonic Franck-Condon approach is inadequate. As an application of the method, the ultraviolet spectrum of ethylene between 6.2 eV (50,000 cm(-1)) and 8.7 eV (70,000 cm(-1)) is simulated, using the Similarity Transformed Equation of Motion Coupled-Cluster method to describe the required features of the potential energy surfaces.

High-resolution (0.0015 cm-1) spectra of the nu12 and nu13 parallel bands of perfluorocyclobutane (c-C4F8) were recorded for the first time by expanding a 10% c-C4F8 in helium mixture in a supersonic jet. Both bands are observed to be rotationally resolved in a jet with a rotational temperature of 15 K. The nu12 mode has b2 symmetry under D2d that correlates to a2u symmetry under D4h and consequently has +/- &lt;-- +/- ring-puckering selection rules. A rigid rotor fit of the nu12 band yields the origin at 1292.56031(2) cm-1 with B' = 0.0354137(3) cm-1 and B' ' = 0.0354363(3) cm-1. The nu13 mode is of b2 symmetry under D2d that correlates to b2g under D4h, and in this case, the ring-puckering selection rules are +/- &lt;-- -/+ . Rotational transitions from the ground and first excited torsional states will be separated by the torsional splitting in the ground and excited vibrational states, and indeed, we observe a splitting of each transition into strong and weak intensity components with a separation of approximately 0.0018 cm-1. The strong and weak sets of transitions were fit separately again using a rigid rotor model to give nu13(strong) = 1240.34858(4) cm-1, B' = 0.0354192(7) cm-1, and B' ' = 0.0354355(7) cm-1 and nu13(weak) = 1240.34674(5) cm-1, B' = 0.0354188(9) cm-1, and B' ' = 0.0354360(7) cm-1. High-level electronic structure calculations at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels of theory with the family of correlation consistent basis sets of quadruple-zeta quality, developed by Dunning and co-workers, yield best estimates for the vibrationally averaged structural parameters r(C-C) = 1.568 A, r(C-F)alpha = 1.340 A, r(C-F)beta = 1.329 A, alpha(F-C-F) = 110.3 degrees , thetaz(C-C-C) = 89.1 degrees , and delta(C-C-C-C) = 14.6 degrees and rotational constants of A = B = 0.03543 cm-1 and C = 0.02898 cm-1, the latter within 0.00002 cm-1 from the experimentally determined values. Anharmonic vibrational frequencies computed using higher energy derivatives at the MP2 level of theory are all within &lt;27 cm-1 (in most cases &lt;5 cm-1) from the experimentally measured fundamentals. Our best estimate for the ring-puckering barrier at the CCSD(T)/CBS (complete basis set) limit is 132 cm-1. Analysis of the C4F8 electron density suggests that the puckering barrier arises principally from the sigmaCC--&gt;sigmaCF hyperconjugative interactions that are more strongly stabilizing in the puckered than in the planar form. These interactions are, however, somewhat weaker in C4F8 than in C4H8, a fact that is consistent with the smaller barrier in the former (132 cm-1) with respect to the latter (498 cm-1).",

From this analysis new vibration-rotation energy levels and constants are given, based on the observation of a number of new vibrational levels, especially for H12C15N.

The strongest bands observed in the wavenumber region investigated are the C-C stretching fundamental nu2 (2034-2082 cm-1) and the accompanying hot bands of the types nu2 + nun - nun, where n = 3, 4, or 5, associated with the lowest stretching state v3 = 1 and with the low-lying bending states v4 = 1 and v5 = 1, 2, respectively. The combination bands of the types nu2 + nun, where n is as above, starting direct from the ground state have also been observed. In addition, the weak overtone band 2nu2 (4081-4121 cm-1) has been measured to study the anharmonicity of the C-C stretching mode. The new, more accurate values for the ground state rotational constants have been derived by combining the ground state combination differences calculated from our IR data available in the present work as well as in our previous investigations concerning the HCCI molecule to the accurate MW transitions from the literature. The rotational structures of the overtone level v2 = 2 and the combination levels v2 = vn = 1, where n is as above, have been investigated by analyzing the observed spectra with a model including various Fermi- and l-type resonances.

The computed equilibrium geometry for the X A1 ground state, as well as vibrational frequencies for the nu2 umbrella and nu3 symmetric stretch modes, are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data.

This makes a commonly employed single-exponent approximation for analysis of the CH3I fragmentation dynamics unsuitable. The 4E(3A1) state dissociating to the same atomic limit is calculated to lie too high in the Franck-Condon region to have any significant impact on the A-band absorption.

The spectrum shows splitting of the lines due to strong torsional-rotational-vibrational interactions in the molecule. Assignments were possible for rotational sub-bands in the torsional state as high as n = 4 and for K values up to 8 and J values of up to approximately 30 in most cases, for all the symmetry species. For the third excited torsional state n = 3 assignments were possible to K = 10. The data were analyzed with the help of the energy expansion model, which has been proven very successful in methanol.

The noise equivalent absorption of the recordings is on the order of α(min)≈ 5 × 10(-11) cm(-1) allowing for the detection of the O(5) transition with an intensity of 1.1 × 10(-30) cm per molecule, the smallest intensity value measured so far for an H(2) absorption line. A Galatry profile was used to reproduce the measured line shape and derive the line strengths. The pressure shift of the O(2) and O(3) lines was accurately determined from a series of recordings with pressure ranging between 10 and 700 Torr. From an exhaustive review of the literature data, the list of H(2) absorption lines detected so far has been constructed. It includes a total of 39 transitions ranging from the S(0) pure rotational line near 354 cm(-1) up to the S(1) transition of the (5-0) band near 18,908 cm(-1). These experimental values are compared to a highly accurate theoretical line list constructed for pure H(2) at 296 K (0-35,000 cm(-1), intensity cut off of 1 × 10(-34) cm per molecule). The energy levels and transition moments were computed from high level quantum mechanics calculations. The overall agreement between the theoretical and experimental values is found to be very good for the line positions. Some deviations for the intensities of the high overtone bands (V &gt; 2) are discussed in relation with possible pressure effects affecting the retrieved intensity values.

Within this frequency range the spectral lines detected contribute the majority of the total flux emitted by IRC +10216.  We use the derived column densities and excitation temperatures to simulate the molecular line emission (assuming LTE) at frequencies up to 1000 GHz.  The observed and simulated flux from line emission is compared to broadband total flux measurements and to dust emission assuming a power-law variation of the dust emissivity.

The \"simple\" PEF omits nondiagonal interaction terms, but still gives very good agreement with the experimental frequencies. The \"simple\" PEF is intended to minimize mode-mode coupling.

The calculated time constants describing energy flow out of the torsional mode are &lt;10 ps for classical vibrational energies near the classical reaction threshold energy (approximately 75 kcal mol(-1)) and greater. It is found that the rate of decay from the torsion largely depends on the amount of energy in the other vibrational modes. Analysis using power spectra shows that the torsional mode in TFE is strongly coupled to the other vibrational modes.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between BF% estimated from subcutaneous fat thickness using a previously published Japanese-based prediction equation and DXA-derived BF% in Caucasian middle-aged and older adults. A secondary aim was to develop a new prediction equation for Caucasian adults if the previously published equation did not predict BF% well in Caucasians. Cross-sectional study. One-hundred and two Caucasian adults aged 50-76 years (59 men and 43 women) had ultrasound fat thickness and DXA values measured. A new BF% prediction model was developed using ordinary least squares multiple linear regression. There was a strong correlation between ultrasound predicted and DXA-derived BF% (r = 0.882, p&lt;0.001). Bland-Altman analysis did not indicate a bias in the prediction of BF% for Caucasian adults (r = -0.092, p&gt;0.05). However, the predicted BF% was significantly higher compared to DXA-derived BF% (approximately 4%). A newly developed nonlinear prediction model used to estimate BF% was significant [F(17,84) = 33.44, p&lt;0.001] with an R2 of 0.871 and an adjusted R2 of 0.845. When examining the stability of the model, bootstrapping (n=1000) resulted in an optimism value of 0.1135 so that the corrected R2 was 0.758. After removing an outlier, the model was significant [F(17,83) = 34.82, p&lt;0.001] and it's R2 was 0.877 and adjusted R2 was 0.852. The developed equation was stable with a high degree of variance compared to results from previous studies. The results of this study also suggest that ethnicity should be considered when choosing which prediction equations should be used to estimate BF%.",

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of the EFVR to quantify the indexed EOA in patients with an aortic bioprosthesis and left ventricular dysfunction considering an indexed EOA value of 0.85 cm(2)/m(2) or less to be indicative of a prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM), defined as an EOA of the inserted prosthetic valve of less than that of the normal human valve.

Up to now, no SE/RE ratio dependent z-values have been considered. Here, we present z-values for SE/RE ratios ranging from 0 to 1. The z-multiplier (95% probability level) was empirically obtained by modulation of the standard normal distribution with the EXCEL NORMDIST function (Microsoft EXCEL 2002). In total, five distributions representing SE/RE ratios between 0 and 1 were calculated, so that the total probability outside a TE boundary +/- 1.96 sigma was in the order of 5.013%. For distributions with SE/RE ratios ranging from 0 to 1 that satisfy the aforementioned total probability outside a TE boundary +/- 1.96 sigma, we found that the associated z-multipliers exhibit values from 1.96 (SE/RE = 0), 1.769 (SE/RE = 0.25), 1.68 (SE/RE = 0.5), 1.651 (SE/RE = 0.75) TO 1.645 (SE/RE = 1).

We consider two statistics (with and without the logarithmic transformation) for testing the equality of two Poisson rates. Two methods for implementing these statistics are reviewed. They are (1) the sample-based method, and (2) the constrained maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the performance of different statistics and methods. Generally, we find that the CMLE method works satisfactorily only for the statistic without the logarithmic transformation (denoted as W(2)) while sample-based method performs better for the statistic using the logarithmic transformation (denoted as W(3)). It is noteworthy that both statistics perform well for moderate to large Poisson rates (e.g. &gt; or =10). For small Poisson rates (e.g. &lt;10), W(2) can be liberal (e.g. actual type I error rate/nominal level &gt; or =1.2) while W(3) can be conservative (e.g. actual type I error rate/nominal level &lt; or =0.8). The corresponding sample size formulae are provided and valid in the sense that the simulated powers associated with the approximate sample size formulae are generally close to the pre-chosen power level.

We integrated this method into our GPU-accelerated, multi-energetic convolution/superposition (C/S) implementation. In doing so, we have created a new dose algorithm: heterogeneity compensated superposition (HCS). Convolution in the spherical density-scaled distance space, a.k.a. C/S, has proven to be a good estimator of the dose deposited in a homogeneous volume. However, near heterogeneities electron disequilibrium occurs, leading to faster fall-off and re-buildup than predicted by C/S. We propose to filter the actual patient density in a position and direction sensitive manner, allowing the dose deposited near interfaces to be increased or decreased relative to traditional C/S. We implemented the effective density function as a multivariate first-order recursive filter. We compared HCS against traditional C/S using the ICCR 2000 Monte-Carlo accuracy benchmark, 23 similar accuracy benchmarks and 5 patient cases. For the patient cases, we created custom routines capable of using the discrete material mappings used by Monte-Carlo. C/S normally considers each voxel to be a mixture of materials based on a piecewise-linear density look-up table. Multi-energetic HCS increased the dosimetric accuracy for the vast majority of voxels; in many cases near Monte-Carlo results were achieved. HCS improved the mean Van Dyk error by 0.79 (% of Dmax or mm) on average for the patient volumes; reducing the mean error from 1.93%|mm to 1.14%|mm. We found a mean error difference of up to 0.30 %|mm between linear and discrete material mappings. Very low densities (i.e. &lt;0.1 g / cm<sup3</sup ) remained problematic, but may be solvable with a better filter function. We have developed a novel dose calculation algorithm based on the principals of C/S that better accounts for the electron disequilibrium caused by patient heterogeneity.

We evaluated the usefulness of major diastolic echocardiographic parameters and of the deceleration rate of early transmitral diastolic velocity (E/DT) in predicting lung remodeling in a rat model of HFpEF. Rats underwent aortic banding (AoB) to induce pressure overload (PO). Left ventricular hypertrophy fully developed 2 weeks after AoB. At 4 and 6 weeks, the lung weight-to-body weight ratio (LW/BW), a sensitive marker for pulmonary congestion and remodeling, dramatically increased despite preserved fractional shortening, indicating the presence of HFpEF. The time course of LW/BW was well reflected by E/DT, by the ratio of early to late transmitral diastolic velocity (E/A) and the deceleration time of E (DT), but not by the ratio of transmitral to mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E/e'). In agreement, the best correlation with LW/BW was found for E/DT (r = 0.76; p&lt;0.0001), followed by E/A (r = 0.69; p&lt;0.0001), DT (r = -0.62; p&lt;0.0001) and finally E/e' (r = 0.51; p&lt;0.001).

In a second approach, we also found that the new parameter E/DT correlated well with right ventricular weight index and echocardiographic measures of right ventricular systolic function. The novel parameter E/DT outperforms the tissue Doppler index E/e' in detecting and monitoring lung remodeling induced by pressure overload.

Fifty-nine subjects (mean age: 23.5 +/- 4.1 years) were randomly divided into a validation (VAL: n = 39) or cross-validation (XVAL: n = 20) group. Peak oxygen consumption (ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was measured via indirect calorimetry on an elliptical motion trainer for both groups. Subjects exercised at 150 strides x min(-1) against a resistance of four and a crossramp of 8%. The resistance was increased every two minutes by two units until exhaustion. For the VAL group, a stepwise regression analysis was used to predict VO(2peak) from resistance, maximal heart rate (HR(max)), body mass index (BMI), height and gender (female = 0, male = 1). The prediction equation derived from this study was VO(2peak) (ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) = 187.39403 + 12.97271 (gender) - 1.45311 (height) - 1.21604 (BMI) - 0.19613 (HR(max)) + 1.57093 (resistance) (R2 = 0.76, SEE = 4.47, p &lt; 0.05).

The model using ODI alone had an R2 of 0.57 and a root mean square error of 0.156. The model using the individual ODI items had an R2 of 0.64 and a root mean square error of 0.143. The correlation coefficient between the observed and estimated EQ-5D score was 0.78. There was no statistically significant difference between the actual EQ-5D (0.553 ± 0.238) and the estimated EQ-5D score (0.553 ± 0.186) using the ODI, BP, and LP regression model. However, rounding off the coefficients to less than 5 decimal places produced less accurate results. Unlike previous studies showing a robust relationship between low back-specific measures and the Short Form-6D, a similar relationship was not seen between the ODI, BP, LP, and the EQ-5D. Thus, the EQ-5D cannot be accurately estimated from the ODI, BP, and LP. 2.",

It has been hypothesized that, by combining the index of diastolic function (E/Ea) and a parameter that explores LV systolic performance (Sa, mitral annulus peak systolic velocity), a close prediction of the LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) can be provided. Hence, the study aim was to assess the relationship between a new parameter, E/(EaxSa), and LVEDP in patients with severe MR. A total of 55 consecutive patients with severe MR, in sinus rhythm, who had been referred for heart catheterization, was analyzed. Echocardiography was performed simultaneously with LVEDP measurements. Both, E/Ea and E/(EaxSa) were calculated, using the average of the velocities of the septal and lateral mitral annulus. A significant linear correlation was demonstrated between E/(EaxSa) and LVEDP (r = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001); this was superior to E/Ea (r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.001), Sa (r = -0.59, p = 0.004), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = 0.57, p = 0.007), E-wave (r = 0.45, p = 0.009), Ea (r = -0.31, p = 0.01), and left atrial volume (r = 0.28, p = 0.02).

We studied 450 patients (284 males; mean age 64±12 years; range 12-88) who underwent CT and ECC due to suspected coronary artery disease. For CT, we used multiphase short-axis reconstructions and evaluated them with a dedicated software tool that uses Simpson's rule to compute LV volumes.

Results in terms of EF were compared with the paired Student's t test, Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), and Bland-Altman analysis. EF was 52%±15% for CT and 55%±13% for ECC. Statistically significant differences, albeit with good correlation, were observed between the measurements (r=0.71; p&lt;0.05). ECC showed a slight tendency to overestimate EF.

We compared actual 6MWT performance against predicted 6MWT in 125 adults aged 50-85 years (62 male, 63 female). In a second sample of 246 adults aged 50-85 years (74 male, 172 female), a new prediction equation for 6MWT performance was developed using allometric modelling. This equation was then cross validated using the same sample that the other prediction equations were compared with.

A series of paired t-tests indicated significant differences between 6MWT actual and 6MWT predicted for all available prediction equations (all P&lt;0.05 or better) with the exception of the Iwama et al equation (P = .540). The Iwama et al equation also had similar bias (79.8m) and a coefficient of variation of over 15%.

When this allometric equation was applied to the original sample, the relationship between 6MWT actual and 6MWT predicted was in excess of values reported for the other previously validated prediction equations (r = .706, P = 0.001). There was a significant difference between actual 6MWT and 6MWT predicted using this new equation (P = 0.001) but the bias, standard deviation of differences and coefficient of variation were all less than for the other equations. Where actual assessment of the 6MWT is not possible, the allometrically derived equation presented in the current study, offers a viable alternative which has been cross validated and has the least SD of differences and smallest coefficient of variation compared to any of the previously validated equations for the 6MWT.",

This was a prospective cross-sectional convenience sample study of adult patients in an urban, academic ED with 97,000 annual visits. General numeracy was evaluated using four validated questions and health literacy using three commonly used validated screening tools (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults [S-TOFHLA], Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Revised [REALM-R], and the Newest Vital Sign [NVS]). Scores were dichotomized for health literacy tests to limited (low or marginal) versus adequate health literacy, and the proportion of patients answering all numeracy questions correctly was calculated with the mean proportion of correct responses in these groups. The correlation between numeracy scores and scores on the health literacy screening tools was evaluated using Spearman's correlation. A total of 446 patients were enrolled. Performance on questions evaluating general numeracy was universally poor. Only 18 patients (4%) answered all numeracy questions correctly, 88 patients (20%) answered zero questions correctly, and overall the median number of correct answers was one (interquartile range [IQR] = 1 to 2). Among patients with limited health literacy (LHL) by any of the three screening tools used, the mean number of correct numeracy answers was approximately half that of patients with adequate health literacy. However, even among those with adequate health literacy, the average number of correct answers to numeracy questions ranged from 1.6 to 2.4 depending on the screening test used. When dichotomized into those who answered ≤50% versus &gt;50% of numeracy questions correctly, there was a significant difference between those with LHL and those who scored ≤50% on numeracy. Health literacy screening results were correlated with general numeracy in the low to moderate range: S-TOFHLA rs  = 0.428 (p &lt; 0.0001); REALM, rs  = 0.400 (p &lt; 0.0001); and NVS, rs  = 0.498 (p &lt; 0.0001). Correlations between measures of general numeracy and measures of health literacy are in the low to moderate range. Performance on numeracy testing was nearly universally poor, even among patients performing well on health literacy screens, with a substantial proportion of the latter patients unable to answer half of the numeracy items correctly. Insofar as numeracy is considered a subset of health literacy, these results suggest that commonly used health literacy screening tools in ED-based studies inadequately evaluate and overestimate numeracy. This suggests the potential need for separate numeracy screening when these skills are important for health outcomes of interest. Providers should be sensitive to potential numeracy deficits among those who may otherwise have normal health literacy.",

For each session, we calculated the session-RPEs (sRPE), session-ROEs (sROE), and heart-rate-derived ITLs [i. e., Banister TRaining IMPulse method (TRIMP) and Edwards TRIMP]. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the association between sRPE, sROE, Banister TRIMP, and Edwards TRIMP. &lt;br/&gt;Results: Between-individual correlation between Banister TRIMP and subjective dancers' (sRPE) and teachers' perceptions (sROE) were moderate (r = .49, p &lt; 0.01) to large (r = .57, p &lt; 0.01).

The purpose of the present work is to investigate the dosimetric properties of an electron beam that should be achievable using existing LWFA technology, and to document the necessary improvements to make radiotherapy application for LWFA viable. This paper first qualitatively reviews the fundamental principles of LWFA and describes a potential design for a 30 cm accelerator chamber containing a gas target. Electron beam energy spectra, upon which our dose calculations are based, were obtained from a uniform energy distribution and from two-dimensional particle-in-cell (2D PIC) simulations. The 2D PIC simulation parameters are consistent with those reported by a previous LWFA experiment. According to the 2D PIC simulations, only approximately 0.3% of the LWFA electrons are emitted with an energy greater than 1 MeV. We studied only the high-energy electrons to determine their potential for clinical electron beams of central energy from 9 to 21 MeV. Each electron beam was broadened and flattened by designing a dual scattering foil system to produce a uniform beam (103%&gt;off-axis ratio&gt;95%) over a 25 x 25 cm2 field. An energy window (deltaE) ranging from 0.5 to 6.5 MeV was selected to study central-axis depth dose, beam flatness, and dose rate. Dose was calculated in water at a 100 cm source-to-surface distance using the EGS/BEAM Monte Carlo algorithm. Calculations showed that the beam flatness was fairly insensitive to deltaE. However, since the falloff of the depth-dose curve (R10-R90) and the dose rate both increase with deltaE, a tradeoff between minimizing (R10-R90) and maximizing dose rate is implied. If deltaE is constrained so that R10-R90 is within 0.5 cm of its value for a monoenergetic beam, the maximum practical dose rate based on 2D PIC is approximately 0.1 Gy min(-1) for a 9 MeV beam and 0.03 Gy min(-1) for a 15 MeV beam. It was concluded that current LWFA technology should allow a table-top terawatt (T3) laser to produce therapeutic electron beams that have acceptable flatness, penetration, and falloff of depth dose; however, the dose rate is still 1%-3% of that which would be acceptable, especially for higher-energy electron beams. Further progress in laser technology, e.g., increasing the pulse repetition rate or number of high energy electrons generated per pulse, is necessary to give dose rates acceptable for electron beams. Future measurements confirming dosimetric calculations are required to substantiate our results. In addition to achieving adequate dose rate, significant engineering developments are needed for this technology to compete with current electron acceleration technology. Also, the functional benefits of LWFA electron beams require further study and evaluation.",

This study aims to provide numerical biologically-relevant information by characterizing VHEE beams (100 and 300 MeV) against better-known beams (clinical energy electrons, photons, protons, carbon and neon ions).

Finally, the modified microdosimetric kinetic model was used to calculate the respective cell survival curves and the theoretical RBE. From the macrodosimetric point of view, VHEEs presented a potential improved biological efficacy over clinical photon/electron beams due to their increased [Formula: see text]. The microdosimetric data, however, suggests no increased biological efficacy of VHEEs over clinical electron beams, resulting in RBE values of approximately 1, giving confidence to their clinical implementation.

In this paper, a methodology is proposed and implemented to determine the energy, spectral width, and beam divergence of the electron source. All treatment head components were removed from the beam path, leaving only the exit window. With the x-ray target and flattener out of the beam, uncertainties in physical characteristics and relative position of the target and flattening filter, and in spot size, did not contribute to uncertainty in the energy. Beam current was lowered to reduce recombination effects. The measured dose distributions were compared with Monte Carlo simulation of the electron beam through the treatment head to extract the electron source characteristics. For the nominal 6 and 18 MV x-ray beams, the energies were 6.51 +/- 0.15 and 13.9 +/- 0.2 MeV, respectively, with the uncertainties resulting from uncertainties in the detector position in the measurement and in the stopping power in the simulations. Gaussian spectral distributions were used, with full widths at half maximum ranging from 20 +/- 4% at 6 MV to 13 +/- 4% at 18 MV required to match the fall-off portion of the percent-depth ionization curve. Profiles at the depth of maximum dose from simulations that used the manufacturer-specified exit window geometry and no beam divergence were 2-3 cm narrower than measured profiles. Two simulation configurations yielding the measured profile width were the manufacturer-specified exit window thickness with electron source divergences of 3.3 degrees at 6 MV and 1.8 degrees at 18 MV and an exit window 40% thicker than the manufacturer's specification with no beam divergence. With the x-ray target in place (and no flattener), comparison of measured to simulated profiles sets upper limits on the electron source divergences of 0.2 degrees at 6 MV and 0.1 degrees at 18 MV. A method of determining source characteristics without mechanical modification of the treatment head, and therefore feasible in clinics, is presented. The energies and spectral widths determined using this method agree with those determined with only the exit window in the beam path.",

Little recent research has been dedicated to this process at high laser intensity, in which back, side, and forward scatter simultaneously occur in high energy density plasmas, of relevance to, for example, shock ignition ICF. We present an experimental and particle-in-cell (PIC) investigation of hot electron production from SRS in the forward and near-forward directions from a single speckle laser of wavelength λ_{0}=1.053μm, peak laser intensities in the range I_{0}=0.2-1.0×10^{17}Wcm^{-2} and target electron densities between n_{e}=0.3-1.6%n_{c}, where n_{c} is the plasma critical density. As the intensity and density are increased, the hot electron spectrum changes from a sharp cutoff to an extended spectrum with a slope temperature T=34±1keV and maximum measured energy of 350 keV experimentally. Multidimensional PIC simulations indicate that the high energy electrons are primarily generated from SRS-driven electron plasma wave phase fronts with k vectors angled ∼50^{∘} with respect to the laser axis. These results are consistent with analytical arguments that the spatial gain is maximized at an angle which balances the tendency for the growth rate to be larger for larger scattered light wave angles until the kinetic damping of the plasma wave becomes important. The efficiency of generated high energy electrons drops significantly with a reduction in either laser intensity or target electron density, which is a result of the rapid drop in growth rate of Raman scattering at angles in the forward direction.",

The observed values for Deltalambda/lambda were 0.03, 0.14 and 0.16, respectively. The severe reduction in monochromaticity as a function of wavelength is determined by the absorption coefficient mu of the monochromator. Mu(monochromator) varies with lambda3. For an Si monochromator with its much larger absorption coefficient, Deltalambda/lambda values of 0.03 were found, regardless of the X-ray tube. This value matches a beam divergence defined by the size of the focus and of the crystal. This holds as long as the monochromator acts as a mirror, i.e. mu(monochromator) is large. In addition to monochromaticity, homogeneity of the X-ray beam is also an important factor. For this aspect the mosaicity of the monochromator is vital. In cases like Si, in which mosaicity is practically absent, the reflected X-ray beam shows an intensity distribution equal to the mass projection of the filament on the anode. Smearing by mosaicity generates a homogeneous beam. This makes a graphite monochromator attractive in spite of its poor performance as a monochromator for lambda &lt; 1 A. This choice means that scan-angle-induced spectral truncation errors are here to stay.

The lowest EEL features at 3.7 and 4.0 eV are attributed to the excitation of the triplet 1 3A'(pi --&gt; pi*) and 1 3A''(n --&gt; pi*) valence states of the molecule. The higher EEL features located at 4.9, 6.3, 7.3, and 9 eV with a weak shoulder around 6 eV are ascribed mostly to triplet valence (pi --&gt; pi*) excitation manifold of the molecule. The energy dependence of the cross section for both the lowest triplet valence excitations shows essentially a peak at about 5 eV reaching a value of 2.9 x 10(-17) cm2. The cross sections for the higher EEL features are generally characterized by a common broad maximum around 8 eV. The latter reaches a value of 1.36 x 10(-16) cm2 for the combined 6 and 6.3 eV excitation region. The maxima in the present cross sections are found to correspond to the resonances that have been reported at about the same energies in the O- yield from electron impact on thymine in the gas phase.",
