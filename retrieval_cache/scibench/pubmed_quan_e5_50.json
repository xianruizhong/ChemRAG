Our goal is to establish the relative importance of the intermediate ionization continua of the active electron and the electron-electron correlations. The calculations are based on the independent electron model. The description of initial ground state molecular orbitals of water are described by a complete-neglect-of-differential-overlap method based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals. Numerical results for the total cross sections are compared with other results and found to be in good agreement with the available experimental findings. Differentiation between the reactions of single-electron ionization and single-electron capture in electron removal process as a function of impact energies is also analyzed. Finally, the dependence of cross sections regarding electron removal on different descriptions of molecular orbitals as well as the simplest additivity rule are discussed.",

For calibration of the kinetic energy scale, a value of IE(C(7)H(8) (+))=(15.7+/-0.2) eV derived from the appearance energy of the toluene dication upon electron ionization has been accepted generally. Triggered by some recent discrepancies between CS measurements on the one hand and different experimental methods as well as theoretical predictions on the other, we have reinvestigated the photon-induced double ionization of toluene using synchrotron radiation.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

Reaction probabilities and integral cross sections (ICSs) between a collisional energy of 10(-4) eV and 0.1 eV have been calculated and compared with previously reported results of a time independent quantum mechanical (TIQM) approach. The TIQM results exhibit a dense profile with numerous narrow resonances down to Ec ~ 10(-2) eV and for the case of H2(v = 0, j = 0) a prominent peak is found at ~2.5 × 10(-4) eV. The analysis at the state-to-state level reveals that this feature is originated in those processes which yield the formation of rotationally excited HD(v' = 0, j' &gt; 0). The statistical predictions reproduce reasonably well the overall behaviour of the TIQM ICSs at the larger energy range (Ec ≥ 10(-3) eV). Thermal rate constants are in qualitative agreement for the whole range of temperatures investigated in this work, 10-100 K, although the SQM values remain above the TIQM results for both initial H2 rotational states, j = 0 and 1. The enlargement of the asymptotic region for the statistical approach is crucial for a proper description at low energies.

The dynamical observables considered include specific rate coefficients as a function of the translational energy, E(T), thermal rate coefficients in the 100-500 K temperature range. In addition, kinetic energy spectra (KES) of the D(+) ions reactively scattered in H(+) + D(2) collisions are also presented for translational energies between 0.4 eV and 2.0 eV. For the two reactions, the best global agreement between experiment and theory over the whole energy range corresponds to the QCT calculations using a gaussian binning (GB) procedure, which gives more weight to trajectories whose product vibrational action is closer to the actual integer QM values. The QM calculations also perform well, although somewhat worse over the more limited range of translational energies where they are available (E(T) &lt; 0.6 eV and E(T) &lt; 0.2 eV for the H(+) + D(2) and D(+) + H(2) reactions, respectively). The worst agreement is obtained with the SQCT method, which is only adequate for low translational energies.

It is worth noting that none of the theoretical approaches can account satisfactorily for the experimental specific rate coefficients of H(+) + D(2) for E(T)≤ 0.2 eV although there is a considerable scatter in the existing measurements. On the whole, the best agreement with the experimental laboratory KES is obtained with the simulations carried out using the state resolved differential cross sections (DCSs) calculated with the QCT-GB method, which seems to account for most of the observed features.

A new method to calculate the specific detachment rate constants k(det)(E) and the electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon) as functions of the total energy E of the anion and the energy epsilon of the emitted electrons is presented, which is computationally simple but neglects fine structures in the detailed k(det)(E). Reduced electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) were found to be of the form (epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;)(n) exp(-epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) with n approximately = 0.15, whose shape corresponds to thermal distributions only to a limited extent. In contrast, the average energies &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; can be roughly estimated within thermionic emission and finite heat bath concepts. An effective temperature T(d)(E) is determined from the relation E - EA = &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; + kT(d), where &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; denotes the thermal internal energy of the detachment product SF(6) at the temperature T(d) and EA is the electron affinity of SF(6).

Simplified representations of k(det)(E) in terms of T(d)(E) from the literature are shown to lead to only semiquantitative agreement with the equally simple but more accurate calculations presented here. An effective \"isokinetic\" electron emission temperature T(e)(E) does not appear to be useful for the electron detachment system considered because it neither provides advantages over a representation of k(det)(E) as a function of T(d)(E), nor are recommended relations between T(e)(E) and T(d)(E) of sufficient accuracy.",

Total energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit applying the focal point analysis.

Relativistic and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections are also taken into account.

The importance of these parameters for the thermal NO(x) decomposition (De-NO(x)) process is discussed.

For small clusters (n &lt; or = 6), a systematic examination of VDE convergence reveals that it is possible to converge this quantity to within approximately 0.01 eV of the complete-basis limit, using a highly diffuse but otherwise economical Pople-style basis set of double-zeta quality, with 28 atom-centered basis functions per water molecule. Floating-center basis functions can be useful but are not required to obtain accurate VDEs. Second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory suffices to obtain VDEs that are within 0.05 eV of the results from both experiment and coupled-cluster theory, and which always err toward underbinding the extra electron. In contrast to these consistent predictions, VDEs calculated using density functional theory (DFT) vary widely, according to the fraction of Hartree-Fock exchange in a given functional. Common functionals such as BLYP and B3LYP overestimate the VDE by 0.2-0.5 eV, whereas a variant of Becke's \"half and half\" functional is much closer to coupled-cluster predictions. Exploratory calculations for (H2O)20- and (H2O)24- cast considerable doubt on earlier calculations that were used to assign the photoelectron spectra of these species to particular cluster isomers.",

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists. As yet, the complete set of bound vibrational energy levels is far from being known, experimentally as well as theoretically. In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128]. Theory agrees with experiment within 4.5 cm(-1) on average for the four vibrational level spacings that are so far known empirically. In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

The ΔMBPT(2) method is defined as the correlated extension of the ΔHF method. Energy differences are obtained by integrating the energy derivative with respect to occupation numbers over the appropriate parameter range. This is made possible by writing the second-order energy as a function of the occupation numbers. Relaxation effects are fully included at the SCF level. This is in contrast to linear response theory, which makes the D-ΔMBPT(2) applicable not only to single excited but also higher excited states. We show the relationship of the D-ΔMBPT(2) method for IPs and EAs to a second-order approximation of the effective Fock-space coupled-cluster Hamiltonian and a second-order electron propagator method. We also discuss the connection between the D-ΔMBPT(2) method for excitation energies and the CIS-MP2 method. Finally, as a proof of principle, we apply our method to calculate ionization potentials and excitation energies of some small molecules. For IPs, the ΔMBPT(2) results compare well to the second-order solution of the Dyson equation. For excitation energies, the deviation from equation of motion coupled cluster singles and doubles increases when correlation becomes more important. When using the numerical integration technique, we encounter difficulties that prevented us from reaching the ΔMBPT(2) values.

At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed. This effect is attributed to a contribution from the radical complex mechanism as was also observed in other recombination reactions of larger radicals.

Theory and spectroscopic properties.\nThe excitation of a fluorescent molecule by a beta-decay electron (radioluminescence) depends upon the electron energy, the distance between radioactive 'donor' and fluorescent 'acceptor', and the excitation characteristics and solvent environment of the fluorophore. The theory for calculation of single photon radioluminescence (SPR) signals is developed here; in the accompanying paper, measurement methods and biological applications are presented. To calculate the three-dimensional spatial profile for electron energy deposition in an aqueous environment, a Monte Carlo calculation was performed incorporating theories of electron energy distributions, energy loss due to interactions with matter, and deflections in electron motion due to collisions. For low energy beta emitters, 50% of energy deposition occurs within 0.63 micron (3H, 18.5 keV), 22 microns (14C, 156 keV), 25 microns (35S, 167 keV), and 260 microns (36Cl, 712 keV) of the radioisotope. In close proximity to the beta emitter (100 nm, 3H; 10 microns, 14C) the probability for fluorophore excitation is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the beta emitter and fluorophore. To investigate the other factors that determine the probability for fluorophore excitation, SPR measurements were carried out in solutions containing 3H and a series of fluorophores in different solvents. In water, the probability of fluorescence excitation was nearly proportional to the integrated absorbance over a &gt; 1,000-fold variation in absorbances. The probability of fluorescence excitation was enhanced up to 2,600-fold when the fluorophore was in a \"scintillant\" aromatic or hydrocarbon solvent. SPR emission spectra were similar to fluorescence emission spectra obtained with photon excitation. The single photon signal due to Bremsstrahlung increased with wavelength in agreement with theory. The distance dependence for the SPR signal predicted by the model was in good agreement with measurements in which a 14C donor was separated by known thicknesses of water from a fluorescently-coated coverglass. Quantitative predictions for radioluminescence signal as a function of donor-acceptor distance were developed for specific radioisotope-fluorophore geometries in biological samples.",

Five groups of guinea-pigs were used to test the effect of various spectral bands of solar-simulated light on low-dose DMBA-induced melanocytic nevi. Animals were irradiated with either UVB to near UVA2 (290-325 nm), UVA, visible light, full solar spectrum or no irradiation three times per wk for 12 mo to determine the broad-band effect of nevi-inducing irradiation.

No differences in skin thickness were found between any group (p=0.11). In conclusion, we present a report of the active waveband of melanocytic nevi induction; where UVB to near UVA2 is the likely responsible waveband.

The organic radicals generated were monitored indirectly following conversion (by reaction with Br2) to Br atoms, which were detected by resonance fluorescence. The photolysis of Cl2 in back-to-back experiments at the same wavelength and under identical experimental conditions served as chemical actinometer. The pressure and temperature dependent quantum yields obtained with this method are in good agreement with previous literature values and are reproduced using the parameterisation developed by Blitz et al. The Br formation kinetics deviated from that expected from reactions of CH3 and CH3CO alone and Br atoms were still observed at high yield even when the quantum yield of formation of CH3 and CH3CO was low. This is explained by the reactive quenching of thermalized triplet acetone (T1) by Br2. High yields of T1 (&gt;80%) at the highest pressure in this study indicate that any dissociation from the first excited singlet state (S1) occurs in competition with intersystem crossing, and that physical quenching of S1 to the electronic ground (S0) is not a major process at these wavelengths.

Investigations were carried out in several deaerated solvents using acridone and naphthalene derivatives as a sensitizer and emitter, respectively. Both upconversion quantum efficiency and sample photostability under continuous photoirradiation strongly depended on the solvent. The former dependence is governed by the solvent polarity, which affects the triplet energy level matching between the sensitizer and emitter because of the solvatochromism of the sensitizer. To elucidate the latter, first we investigated the photodegradation of samples without the emitter, which revealed that the sensitizer degradation rate is correlated with the difference between the frontier orbital energy levels of the sensitizer and solvent. Inclusion of the emitter effectively suppressed the degradation of the sensitizer, which is ascribed to fast quenching of the triplet sensitizer by the emitter and justifies the use of ketonic sensitizers for UV-UC in solvents. A theoretical model was developed to acquire insight into the observed temporal decays of the upconverted emission intensity under continuous photoirradiation. The theoretical curves generated by this model fitted the experimental decay curves well, which allowed the reaction rate between the emitter and solvent to be obtained. This rate was also correlated with the difference between the frontier orbital energy levels of the emitter and solvent. Finally, based on the acquired findings, general design guidelines for developing UV-UC samples were proposed.",

The vibrational energy distribution in the resulting catechoxyl product changes notably as λ(phot) is tuned on resonance with either the v' = 0, m(2)' = 1(+) or m(2)' = 2(+) torsional levels of the photo-prepared 1(1)ππ* state: the product state distribution is highly sensitive to the degree of OH torsional excitation (m(2)) prepared during photo-excitation. It is deduced that such torsional excitation can be redistributed very efficiently into ring puckering (and likely also in-plane ring stretch) vibrations as the molecule tunnels to its repulsive 1(1)πσ* state and dissociates. These observations can be rationalised by consideration of the photo-prepared nuclear wavefunctions. Analysis of the product vibrational energy distribution also reveals that the O-H bond strength of the non hydrogen bonded O-H moiety in catechol, D(0)(H-catechoxyl) ≤ 27 480 ± 50 cm(-1), ∼2500 cm(-1) lower than that of the sole O-H bond in bare phenol. As a consequence, the vertical excitation energy of the 1(1)πσ* state in catechol is reduced relative to that in phenol, yielding a particularly broad distribution of product vibrations for λ(phot) &lt; 270 nm. This study highlights the interplay between molecular geometry and redistribution of vibrational energy during ultraviolet photolysis of phenols.",

Many of the Total Kinetic Energy Release (TKER) spectra obtained from photolysis of 4-FPhOH show structure, the analysis of which reveals striking parallels with that reported previously for photolysis of bare phenol (M. G. D. Nix, A. L. Devine, B. Cronin, R. N. Dixon and M. N. R. Ashfold, J. Chem. Phys., 2006, 125, 133318). The data demonstrates the importance of O-H bond fission, and that the resulting 4-FPhO co-fragments are formed in a select fraction of their available vibrational state density. All spectra recorded at lambda(phot)&gt; or = 238 nm show a feature centred at TKER approximately 5500 cm(-1). These H atom fragments show no recoil anisotropy, and are rationalised in terms of initial S(1)&lt;-- S(0) (pi* &lt;--pi) excitation and subsequent dissociation via two successive radiationless transitions: internal conversion to ground (S(0)) state levels carrying sufficient O-H stretch vibrational energy to allow efficient transfer to (and round) the Conical Intersection (CI) between the S(0) and S(2)((1)pi sigma*) Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) at larger R(O-H), en route to H atoms and ground state 4-FPhO products. The vibrational energy disposal in the 4-FPhO products indicates that parent mode nu(16a) promotes non-adiabatic coupling at the S(0)/S(2) CI. Spectra recorded at lambda(phot)&lt; or = 238 nm reveal a faster (but still isotropic) distribution of recoiling H atoms, centred at TKER approximately 12 000 cm(-1), attributable to H + 4-FPhO products formed when the optically excited (1)pi pi* molecules couple directly with the (1)pi sigma* PES. Parent mode nu(16b) is identified as the dominant coupling mode at the S(1)((1)pi pi*)/S(2)((1)pi sigma*) CI, and the resulting 4-FPhO radical co-fragments display progressions in nu(18b) (the C-O in-plane wagging mode) and nu(7a) (an in-plane ring breathing mode involving significant C-O stretching motion). Analysis of all structured TKER spectra yields a C-F bond dissociation energy: D(0)(H-OC(6)H(4)F) = 29 370 +/- 50 cm(-1). The photodissociation of 4-ClPhOH shows many similarities, though the 4-ClPhO products formed together with faster H atoms at shorter wavelengths (lambda(phot)&lt; or = 238 nm, by coupling through the S(1)/S(2) CI) show activity in an alternative ring breathing mode (nu(19a) rather than nu(7a)). Spectral analysis yields D(0)(H-OC(6)H(4)Cl) = 29 520 +/- 50 cm(-1). H atom formation via O-H bond fission is (at best) a very minor channel in the photolysis of 4-BrPhOH at all wavelengths investigated. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations suggest that this low H atom yield is because of competition from the alternative C-Br bond fission channel, and that the analogous C-Cl bond fission may be responsible for the weakness of the one photon-induced H atom signals observed when photolysing 4-ClPhOH at longer wavelengths.",

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface. Rate constants calculated with the CVBMM surface agree with the MPW54 rate constants within 12% for 534-2000 K and within 23% for 200-491 K. The full CVBMM potential-energy surface is now available for use in variety of dynamics calculations, and it provides a prototype for developing CVBMM potential-energy surfaces for other reactions.",

The photodissociation dynamics of this SH decorated aromatic ring system are contrasted with that of thiophenol (Devine et al. J. Phys. Chem.

Photoexcitation at long wavelengths results in population of the (1)(n/pi)sigma* excited state, prompt S-H bond fission, H atoms displaying a (nonlimiting) perpendicular recoil velocity distribution, and partner radicals formed in selected low vibrational levels of the ground state. This energy disposal can be rationalized by considering the forces acting as the excited molecules evolve on the (1)(n/pi)sigma* potential energy surface (PES).

For the ground state of 1 and of its radical cation (1(+*)) and anion (1(-*)), we report the UV-visible absorption spectra, and for neutral 1, also the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and the decomposition of the absorption spectrum into purely polarized components, deduced from fluorescence polarization. These results were used to identify a series of singlet excited states. For the first excited singlet and triplet states of 1, the transient visible absorption spectra, S(1) --&gt; S(x) and sensitized T(1) --&gt; T(x), and single exponential lifetimes, tau(F) = approximately 5.3 ns and tau(T) = approximately 200 micros, are reported. The spectra and lifetimes of S(1) --&gt; S(0) fluorescence and sensitized T(1) --&gt; T(x) absorption of 1 were obtained in a series of solvents, as was the fluorescence quantum yield, Phi(F) = 0.95-0.99. No phosphorescence has been detected. The first triplet excitation energy of solid 1 (11,400 cm(-1)) was obtained by electron energy loss spectroscopy, in agreement with previously reported solution values. The fluorescence excitation spectrum suggests an onset of a nonradiative channel at approximately 37,000 cm(-1). Excitation energies and relative transition intensities are in agreement with those of ab initio (CC2) calculations after an empirical 3000 cm(-1) adjustment of the initial state energy to correct differentially for a better quality description of the initial relative to the terminal state of an absorption transition. The interpretation of the MCD spectrum used the semiempirical PPP method, whose results for the S(0) --&gt; S(x) spectrum require no empirical adjustment and are otherwise nearly identical with the CC2 results in all respects including the detailed nature of the electronic excitation. The ground state geometry of 1 was also calculated by the MP2, B3LYP, and CAS methods. The calculations provided a prediction of changes of molecular geometry upon excitation or ionization and permitted an interpretation of the spectra in terms of molecular orbitals involved. Computations suggest that 1 can exist as two nearly isoenergetic conformers of C(2) or C(s) symmetry. Linear dichroism measurements in stretched polyethylene provide evidence for their existence and show that they orient to different degrees, permitting a separation of their spectra in the region of the purely polarized first absorption band. Their excitation energies are nearly identical, but the Franck-Condon envelopes of their first transition differ to a surprising degree.",

The energy response factor for a given radiation quality relative to 60Co was determined for BeO and compared to the Al2O3:C and LiF:Mg,Ti dosemeters. Burlin cavity theory calculations were done using mean photon energy (MPE) of the beam spectra, while EGSnrc software package was used to carry out MC simulation of full spectra. The cavity theory and MC methods agreed well within the 0.7%. Energy response of x-ray beams at MV range showed a maximum of 1.5% under-response. At energies higher than 150 kV (105 keV MPE) showed no significant difference while a significant under-response were observed at 100 kV (53 keV MPE) and 50 kV (29 keV MPE), ~8 and ~12%, respectively. BeO, Al2O3:C and LiF:Mg,Ti dosemeters exhibited very similar energy response at higher energies mainly in the MeV range. At 50 kV (29 keV MPE), however, BeO dosemeter under responded by a factor of 0.878, while Al2O3:C and LiF:Mg,Ti dosemeters over responded by a factor of 3.2 and 1.44, respectively. Furthermore, at low energies, BeO energy response showed dependence on photon spectra. For instance, at 100 kV, the difference was ~8, ~6 and 2% for 53, 60 and 83 keV MPE (ISO 4037N-100), respectively. Furthermore, calibration with 137Cs instead of 60Co resulted up to 1.8% differences in energy response. Both energy spectrum and calibration methods make considerable differences in energy response of OSLDs. This study concludes that BeO chips are nearly energy independent at energies higher than 100 keV MPE, while Al2O3:C dosemeters show an extremely enhanced energy-response ranging between 1.44 and 3.2 at energies between 170 and 29 keV MPE mainly due to dominance of photoelectric effect.",

The X(1)Σ(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 Å), whereas the A(1)Π state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 Å).

Thus, it is well-known how the rate of ionization of R-X is affected by the stabilization of the carbocation R(+), the nature of the leaving group X(-), or the solvent ionizing power. On the other hand, when asked to estimate the half-life of the ionization of a certain substrate in a certain solvent, most chemists resign. This question, however, is crucial in daily laboratory practice. Can a certain substrate R-X be handled in alcoholic or aqueous solution without being solvolyzed? Can a biologically active tertiary amine or azole be released by ionization of a quaternary ammonium ion? In this Account, we describe a straightforward means of addressing such experimental concerns. A semiquantitative answer to these questions is given by the correlation equation log k(25 °C) = s(f)(N(f) + E(f)), in which carbocations R(+) are characterized by the electrofugality parameter E(f), and leaving groups X(-) in a certain solvent are characterized by the nucleofugality parameter N(f) and the nucleofuge-specific sensitivity parameter s(f). As s(f) is typically around 1 (0.8 &lt; s(f) &lt; 1.2), ionization half-lives of around 1 h at 25 °C can be expected when E(f) + N(f) = -4. This correlation equation is formally analogous to the linear free energy relationship that was used to derive the most comprehensive nucleophilicity and electrophilicity scales presently available (Mayr, H.; Bug, T.; Gotta, M. F.; Hering, N.; Irrgang, B.; Janker, B.; Kempf, B.; Loos, R.; Ofial, A. R.; Remennikov, G.; Schimmel, H. Reference Scales for the Characterization of Cationic Electrophiles and Neutral Nucleophiles. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9500-9512). By subjecting 628 solvolysis rate constants k(25 °C) for different benzhydryl derivatives (aryl(2)CH-X) to a least-squares minimization on the basis of the correlation equation, we obtained and tabulate here (i) the electrofugality parameters E(f) for 39 benzhydrylium ions and (ii) the nucleofuge-specific parameters N(f) and s(f) for 101 combinations of common leaving groups and solvents. We show that the E(f) parameters of the reference electrofuges can be used to determine N(f) and s(f) for almost any combination of leaving group and solvent. The nucleofuge-specific parameters of the reference systems can analogously be used to derive the electrofugalities E(f) of other types of carbocations. While it has long been recognized that good nucleophiles are not necessarily poor nucleofuges, it is now reported that there is also no general inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality. Although more electrophilic methyl- and methoxy-substituted benzhydrylium ions are generally weaker electrofuges, the inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality breaks down in the series of amino-substituted benzhydrylium ions. Because neither differential solvation of the carbocations nor steric effects are explicitly considered by this treatment, predictions for substrates not belonging to the benzhydrylium series are only reliable within a factor of 10. This is hardly acceptable to physical organic chemists, who are used to high precision within narrow groups of compounds. The synthetic chemist, however, who is seeking orientation in a reactivity range of 25 orders of magnitude, might appreciate the simplicity of this approach, which only requires considering the sum E(f) + N(f) or consulting our summary graphs.",

Using two variants of the laser photoelectron attachment method with a thermal gas target (T(G) = 300 K), we measured the energy dependent yield for Br- formation over the range E = 3-1200 meV with resolutions of about 3 meV (E &lt; 200 meV) and 35 meV. At the onsets for excitation of one and two quanta for the C-Br stretching mode nu3, downward cusps are detected. With reference to the recommended thermal (300 K) attachment rate coefficient k(A)(CF3Br) = 1.4 x 10(-8) cm3 s(-1), absolute cross sections have been determined for Br- formation. In addition, we studied Br- and (CF3Br)Br- formations with a seeded supersonic target beam (10% CF3Br in helium carrier gas, with a stagnation pressure of 1-4 bars and nozzle temperatures of 300 and 600 K) and found prominent structure in the anion yields due to cluster formation. Using the microwave pulse radiolysis swarm technique, allowing for controlled variation of the electron temperature by microwave heating, we studied the dependence of the absolute DEA rate coefficient on the mean electron energy E over the range of 0.04-2 eV at gas temperatures T(G) ranging from 173 to 600 K. For comparison with the experimental results, semiempirical resonance R-matrix calculations have been carried out. The input for the theory includes the known energetic and structural parameters of the neutral molecule and its anion; the parameters of the resonant anion curves are chosen with reference to the known thermal rate coefficient for the DEA process. For the gas temperature T(G) = 300 K, good overall agreement of the theoretical DEA cross section with the experimental results is observed; moreover, rate coefficients for Br- formation due to Rydberg electron transfer, calculated with both the experimental and the theoretical DEA cross sections, are found to agree with the previously reported absolute experimental values. At T(G) = 300 K, satisfactory agreement is also found between the calculated and experimental attachment rate coefficients for mean electron energies E = 0.04-2 eV. The strong increase of the measured rate coefficients with rising gas temperature, however, could be only partially recovered by the R-matrix results.

Comparable naphthalenic fluorescence of c-1 (LH model A) is quenched beyond detectability.

The larger value of σ(1(2)A'') with respect to σ(1(2)A') arises from the larger value of bmax(1(2)A'') with respect to bmax(1(2)A'), and this results from the more attractive character of the former PES. Besides, the reaction probabilities are quite large [0.78-0.98 (1(2)A'') and 0.78-0.93 (1(2)A')], and the decreasing trend of both cross-sections as Ecol increases arises from the barrierless character of both PESs.

A second narrowband tunable cw Ti:Sapphirelaser (PROBE) is then scanned, while 3(1)Pi --&gt; 1(X)1Sigma+ violet fluorescence is monitored. The Doppler-free signals accurately map the 3(1)Pi(v, J) ro-vibrational energy levels. These energy levels are then fit to a Dunham expansion to provide a set of molecular constants. The Dunham constants, in turn, are used to construct an RKR potential curve. Resolved 3(1)Pi(v, J) --&gt; 1(X)1Sigma+(v\", J\") fluorescence scans are also recorded with both PUMP and PROBE laser frequencies fixed. Comparison between observed and calculated Franck-Condon factors is used to determine the absolute vibrational numbering of the 3(1)Pi state levels and to determine the variation of the 3(1)Pi --&gt; 1(X)1Sigma+ transitiondipole moment with internuclear separation.

Optical absorption spectra of solvated electrons (esolv-) in Gl were recorded as a function of temperature (381&lt;or=T&lt;or=505 K). The observed redshift of the absorption maximum, homegamax, yields a temperature coefficient d(homegamax)/dT=-(2.67+/-0.07)x10(-3) eV K-1. For solutions with a concentration c(I-) approximately 10(-3)M, the absorbance of esolv- at homegamax increases by a factor of about 65 when the temperature is raised from 329 to 536 K. This effect can be partially explained by a temperature-dependent redshift of the CTTS spectrum of I- in Gl with respect to the laser wavelength. The main contribution to the increasing yield of esolv- is determined by diffusion controlled escape dynamics of the electron in the contact pair (I:e-)solv which is formed very fast during the detachment process. At room temperature no absorption of esolv- (absorbance&lt;1.0x10(-3)) could be observed which is probably a result of an extremely small self-diffusion coefficient of Gl (a factor of 1250 lower than that of water at 298 K).

Use of narrow band radiation enables nascent measurements with sufficient speed resolution to allow both the character of the initial electronic transition and speed of the fragments to be determined. The time dependence of the integrated area of the measured Doppler profiles has been used to determine both the I* quantum yield and the collisional electronic quenching rate constant of I* (I* = (2)P(1/2)) by I(2). These values are also determined using the diode laser gain versus absorption technique. In the 248 nm case an I* quantum yield of 0.45 +/- 0.04 and 0.42 +/- 0.04 is found by each method, respectively, and an electronic quenching rate constant of (3.6 +/- 0.5) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), consistent with literature, is determined. The form of the nascent Doppler profile indicates that excitation to a Omega = 1 state dominates, with subsequent dissociation to I((2)P(1/2)) + I((2)P(3/2)), in keeping with assignment of the upper state as 1441 (3)Sigma(+)(1(u)). The deviation from Phi(I*) = 0.5 can be attributed to a contribution from the 1441 (3)Sigma(+)(0(u)(-)) state which dissociates to two ground state iodine atoms. 193 nm excitation exhibits more complicated dynamics and kinetics, including a pressure dependent I* quantum yield. At the low pressures, &lt;200 mTorr, used in the FM Doppler measurements there are two speed components to the profile suggesting multiple dissociation pathways. Firstly, fast iodine fragments indicate single photon absorption in a parallel transition followed by direct dissociation. Secondly, a slower speed component can be attributed to iodine atoms formed after radiative transfer to unbound levels in the ground state and the a' surface. Investigation of the changes in Doppler profiles with time suggest that some of the a' surface population may transfer to the bound B((3)Pi(0u)(+)) state which then in turn undergoes collision-induced predissociation to produce I atoms on the ground electronic state.",

The longer wavelength measurements have been complemented by measurements of excitation spectra for forming parent and fragment ions by two (or more) photon ionisation processes.

Branching into the various spin-orbit states of the Cl(+)((3)P(J)) product is found to depend sensitively upon v(+') and, in the case of the v(+')=13 level, to vary with the precise choice of excitation wavelength within the A (2)Sigma(+)&lt;--X (2)Pi(13,0) band.

This computational scheme is denoted as SORA-Met. The SORA-Met calculation yields anisotropies, Delta sigma = sigma(parallel) - sigma(perpendicular), for the halogen nuclei in hydrogen halides that are too small. In the NESC theory, the small component of the spinor is combined to the large component via the operator sigma x piU/2c, in which pi = p + A, U is a nonunitary transformation operator, and c approximately = 137.036 a.u. is the velocity of light.

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

We drive proton-spin quantum jumps by a magnetic radio-frequency field in a Penning trap with a homogeneous magnetic field. The induced spin transitions are detected in a second trap with a strong superimposed magnetic inhomogeneity. This enables the measurement of the spin-flip probability as a function of the drive frequency. In each measurement the proton's cyclotron frequency is used to determine the magnetic field of the trap. From the normalized resonance curve, we extract the particle's magnetic moment in terms of the nuclear magneton: μp = 2.792847350(9)μN.

It improves the precision of the forty-year-old indirect measurement, in which significant theoretical bound state corrections were required to obtain µp, by a factor of 3. By application of this method to the antiproton magnetic moment, the fractional precision of the recently reported value can be improved by a factor of at least 1,000.

For comparison, we repeat single-state calculations with the Stark-Werner (SW) and Hartke-Stark-Werner (HSW) PESs. The ASW DCSs differ from those predicted for the SW and HSW PES in the backward direction. These differences arise from nonadiabatic coupling between several electronic states. The DCSs are then used in forward simulations of the laboratory-frame angular distributions (ADs) measured by Lee, Neumark, and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 82, 3045 (1985)]. The simulations are scaled to match experiment over the range 12 degrees &lt;Theta(lab)&lt;80 degrees.

At the lowest collision energy (1.84 kcal/mol), the simulations, for all three sets of PESs consistently underestimate the sideways scattering.

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

The potential function yields an accurate representation of spectroscopic data that span 99.24% of the well depth and the number of fitted parameters is significantly less than half the number of parameters determined in conventional Dunham analyses. A novel variant of the Morse/long-range potential model has been employed in the representation of the ground state potential, and a critical comparison has been made with an extended modified Lennard-Jones potential model. Proper account has been taken of the known long-range van der Waals form of the potential, and our final potential function is determined with constrained literature values of the C(8) and C(10) dispersion energy coefficients, along with a fitted value of C(6)=3.31(5) x 10(7) cm(-1) A(6)=6870(100) a.u.

The X(1)Σ(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 Å), whereas the A(1)Π state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 Å). The X(1)Σ(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;μ&gt;(υ), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)Π. For the level (X(1)Σ(+)), &lt;μ&gt;(0) = 0.213 D. The υ(\") = 7 and 8 X(1)Σ(+) vibrational levels are found to have the highest probability to be reached via emission from the lowest lying vibrational levels of A(1)Π. The work had a dual outcome: First, it explored consequences of different choices of the state-specific reference \"Fermi-sea\" space (\"active\" space), which is required for the construction and execution of the multiconfigurational \"complete active space self-consistent field\" calculations and the subsequent multi-reference CI calculations. In this context, comparisons with results on the weakly bound ground states of the homonuclear Be(2) and Mg(2) molecules were made. Second, it produced reliable data for the short- as well as the long-range parts of the potential energy curve (PEC). Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)Σ(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 ± 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 ± 500 a.u., respectively.

The origins of the X 1A1--&gt;X+ 2A1 and X 1A1--&gt;A+ 2B2 transitions could be determined from the rotational structure of the bands, the photoionization selection rules, the photoionization efficiency curve, and comparison with ab initio calculations. The first adiabatic ionization energy of O3 was measured to be 101,020.5(5) cm(-1) [12.524 95(6) eV] and the energy difference between the X+ 2A1 (0,0,0) and A+ 2B2 (0,0,0) states was determined to be DeltaT0=1089.7(4) cm(-1). Whereas the X--&gt;X+ band consists of an intense and regular progression in the bending (nu2) mode observed up to v2+=4, only the origin of the X--&gt;A+ band was observed. The analysis of the rotational structure in each band led to the derivation of the r0 structure of O3+ in the X+ [C2v,r0=1.25(2) A,alpha0=131.5(9) degrees ] and A+[C2v,r0=1.37(5) A,alpha0=111.3(38) degrees ] states. The appearance of the spectrum, which is regular up to 102,300 cm(-1), changes abruptly at approximately 102,500 cm(-1), a position above which the spectral density increases markedly and the rotational structure of the bands collapses. On the basis of ab initio calculations, this behavior is attributed to the onset of large-amplitude motions spreading through several local minima all the way to large internuclear distances. The ab initio calculations are consistent with earlier results in predicting a seam of conical intersections between the X+ and A+ states approximately 2600 cm(-1) above the cationic ground state and demonstrate the existence of potential minima at large internuclear distances that are connected to the main minima of the X+ and A+ states through low-lying barriers.",

The ET dependencies of the integral cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v=0-4)+He collisions in the ET range of 0-3 eV have also been measured using the VUV photoionization guided ion beam mass spectrometric technique, in which vibrationally selected HD+(v) reactant ions were prepared via excitation of selected autoionization resonances of HD. At low total energies, a pronounced isotope effect is observed in absolute integral cross sections for the HeH++D and HeD++H channels with significant favoring of the deuteron transfer channel. As v is increased in the range of v=0-9, the integral cross sections of the HeH++D channel are found to approach those of HeD++H. The observed velocity distributions of products HeD+ and HeH+ are consistent with an impulsive or spectator-stripping mechanism. Detailed quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations are also presented for HD+(v,j=1)+He collisions at the same energies of the experiment.

The agreement between the experimental and QCT cross sections improves with translational energy. Except for prethreshold reactivity, QCT calculations ignoring the zero-point energy in the products are generally in good agreement with experimental absolute cross sections. The experimental HeH+/HeD+ branching ratios for the HD+(v=0-9)+He collisions are generally consistent with QCT predictions.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state. We were unable to fit these levels. Tests show that the resulting effective potential surface has no problems with unphysical holes and gives a reasonable representation of the rotational structure of the low-lying vibrational states of NO2.

Two systems of blue-degraded bands were measured at high spectral resolution in the ranges 8000-9000 and 5700-6700 cm(-1) and vibrational and rotational analyses were performed. In order to aid in the analysis of the experimental data, a series of relativistic configuration interaction calculations has been carried out to obtain potential curves for the low-lying states of TeLi and the isovalent TeH and also electric dipole transition moments connecting them. As in the TeH system, the ground state of TeLi is found to be X(2)Pi(i), but with a remarkably smaller spin-orbit splitting. The TeLi calculations indicate a strongly bound A(2)Sigma(+) state, while in TeH the analogous state is computed to lie significantly higher at approximately 32 000 cm(-1), and it is strongly predissociated. Based on the theoretical analysis, the observed TeLi band systems are assigned to the transitions A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(1)(2)Pi(3/2)(X(1)3/2) and A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(2)(2)Pi(1/2)(X(2)1/2).

The expressions are based on a solution to the Boltzmann equation that is exact when the electric field is weak, the electron-Fermi-degeneracy parameter Theta&gt;&gt;1, and the electron-ion Coulomb-coupling parameter Gamma/Z&lt;&lt;1. (Gamma is the ion-ion coupling parameter and Z is the ion charge state.) Assuming a screened 1/r electron-ion scattering potential, we calculate the Coulomb logarithm in the second Born approximation. The ratio of the term obtained in the second approximation to that obtained in the first is used to define the parameter regime over which the calculation is valid. We find that the accuracy of the approximation is determined by Gamma/Z and not simply the temperature, and that a quantum-mechanical description can be required at temperatures orders of magnitude less than assumed by Spitzer [Physics of Fully Ionized Gases (Wiley, New York, 1962)]. When the magnetic field B=0, the conductivity is identical to the Spitzer result except the Coulomb logarithm ln Lambda(1)=(ln chi(1)-1 / 2)+[(2Ze(2)/lambdam(e)v(2)(e1))(ln chi(1)-ln 2(4/3))], where chi(1) identical with 2m(e)v(e1)lambda/ variant Planck's over 2pi, m(e) is the electron mass, v(e1) identical with (7k(B)T/m(e))(1/2), k(B) is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, lambda is the screening length, variant Planck's over 2pi is Planck's constant divided by 2pi, and e is the absolute value of the electron charge. When the plasma Debye length lambda(D) is greater than the ion-sphere radius a, we assume lambda=lambda(D); otherwise we set lambda=a. The B=0 conductivity is consistent with measurements when Z greater, similar 1, Theta greater, similar 2, and Gamma/Z less, similar 1, and in this parameter regime appears to be more accurate than previous analytic models. The minimum value of ln Lambda(1) when Z&gt; or =1, Theta&gt; or =2, and Gamma/Z&lt; or =1 is 1.9. The expression obtained for the resistivity tensor (B not equal 0) predicts that eta( perpendicular )/eta( parallel ) (where eta( perpendicular ) and eta( parallel ) are the resistivities perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field) can be as much as 40% less than previous analytic calculations.

Comparison with the high resolution experiments of Davis and co-workers (Science, 2000, 290, 958) shows that the structures (peaks) found in the relative translational energy distributions of products could not be satisfactorily reproduced in the calculations, probably due to the classical nature of the QCT method and the importance of quantum effects.

Overall, both surfaces led to similar results, although the YZCL2 surface is more accurate to describe the H(3)O PES, as derived from comparison with high level ab initio results.

Based on multireference configuration interaction (MRCISD+Q) results with a correlation-consistent polarized valence quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) basis set, appended with core correlation and relativistic corrections, we propose the relative energies: T(e)(FeNC), (6)Delta(0)&lt;(6)Pi (2300 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Delta (2700 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Pi (4200 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Sigma(-); and T(e)(FeCN), (6)Delta(0)&lt;(6)Pi (1800 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Delta (2500 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Pi (2900 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Sigma(-). The (4)Delta and (4)Pi states have massive multireference character, arising mostly from 11sigma--&gt;12sigma promotions, whereas the sextet states are dominated by single electronic configurations. The single-reference CCSDT-3 (coupled cluster singles and doubles with iterative partial triples) method appears to significantly overshoot the stabilization of the quartet states provided by both static and dynamical correlation. The (4,6)Delta and (4,6)Pi states of both isomers are rather ionic, and all have dipole moments near 5 D. On the ground (6)Delta surface, FeNC is predicted to lie 0.6 kcal mol(-1) below FeCN, and the classical barrier for isocyanide/cyanide isomerization is about 6.5 kcal mol(-1). Our data support the recent spectroscopic characterization by Lei and Dagdigian [J. Chem.

Their assignments for the ground term symbol, isotopomeric rotational constants, and the Fe-N omega(3) stretching frequency are confirmed; however, we find rather different structural parameters for (6)Delta FeNC:r(e)(Fe-N)=1.940 A and r(N-C)=1.182 A at the cc-pVQZ MRCISD+Q level. Our results also reveal that the observed band of FeNC originating at 27 236 cm(-1) should have an analog in FeCN near 23 800 cm(-1) of almost equal intensity. Therefore, both thermodynamic stability and absorption intensity factors favor the eventual observation of FeCN via a (6)Pi&lt;--(6)Delta transition in the near-UV.",

These results are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined Cu-C bond length of 1.829 A and C-N bond distance of 1.162 A.

The WP-EQM calculations include all total angular momenta up to J(max) = 50, and therefore the various dynamical observables are converged up to 0.6 eV. It has been found that it is necessary to include all Coriolis couplings to obtain reliable converged results. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods are thoroughly compared as a function of the total energy for a series of J values. Comparisons are also made of total reaction cross sections as function of the collision energy, and rate constants. In addition, opacity functions, integral cross sections (ICS) and differential cross sections (DCS) are presented at 102 meV, 201.3 meV and 524.6 meV collision energy. The agreement between the three sets of results is only qualitative. The QCT calculations fail to describe the overall reactivity and most of the dynamical observables correctly. At low collision energies, the QCT method is plagued by the lack of conservation of zero point energy, whilst at higher collision energies and/or total angular momenta, the appearance of an effective repulsive potential associated with the centrifugal motion \"over\" the well causes a substantial decrease of the reactivity. In turn, the statistical models overestimate the reactivity over the whole range of collision energies as compared with the WP-EQM method. Specifically, at sufficiently high collision energies the reaction cannot be deemed to be statistical and important dynamical effects seem to be present. In general the WP-EQM results lie in between those obtained using the QCT and SQCT methods. One of the main, unexpected, conclusions of this work is that an accurate description of the reaction and of its various dynamical features requires a computationally expensive, accurate quantum mechanical treatment.",

A new model explains the variation of the frequency difference, suggesting that the upper kHz QPO, namely nuh, is an upper hybrid frequency of the Keplerian oscillator under the influence of the Coriolis force and the lower kHz QPO is the Keplerian frequency nuK. Such an oscillator has two branches characterized by a high frequency nuh ( approximately 1 kHz) and by a low frequency nuL ( approximately 50 Hz). The frequency nuL depends strongly on the angle delta between the normal to the neutron star disk and Omega-the angular velocity of the magnetosphere surrounding the neutron star. In the lower part of the QPO spectrum ( approximately 10 Hz), this model identifies the frequency of radial viscous oscillations nuV (previously called \"extra noise component\") and the break frequency nub, which is associated with the diffusive process in the transition region (the innermost part of the disk). According to this model, all frequencies (namely nuh, nuL, nub, and nuV) have specific dependences on nuK. This Letter focuses on the verification of the predicted relations.

The agreement between the classical and quantum calculations is very good. The calculations slightly overestimate the measured rate constants for Deltav = 0, Deltaj &lt;or= 6 processes but underestimate those for Deltav = 0, Deltaj &gt;or= 20, implying that the anisotropy of the ab initio surface is too small at short range and too large at long range.

However, in reality, electrolytes have several decay modes e-κr/r, e-κ'r/r etc. with different decay lengths, 1/κ, 1/κ' etc., that in general are different from the Debye length. As an illustration of the significance of multiple decay modes in electrolytes, the present work uses a very simple extension of the Debye-Hückel approximation with two decay lengths, which predicts oscillatory modes when appropriate. This approach gives very accurate results for radial distribution functions and thermodynamic properties of aqueous solutions of monovalent electrolytes for all concentrations investigated, including high ones. It is designed to satisfy necessary statistical mechanical conditions for the distributions. The effective dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte plays an important role in the theory and each mode has its own value of this entity. Electrolytes with high electrostatic coupling, like those with multivalent ions and/or with solvent of low dielectric constant, have decay lengths in dilute solutions that substantially deviate from the Debye length. It is shown that this is caused by nonlinear ion-ion correlation effects and the origin of under-screening, i.e., 1/κ &gt; 1/κD, in dilute symmetric electrolytes is analyzed. The under-screening is accompanied by an increase in the effective dielectric permittivity that is also caused by these correlations. The theoretical results for the decay length are successfully compared with recent experimental data for simple electrolytes in various solvents. The paper includes background material on electrolyte theory and screening in order to be accessible for nonexperts in the field.",

It is shown that in the case of continuous probability distributions for the couplings, the number of ground states is finite in the thermodynamic limit. However, for a bimodal probability distribution (+/-J with probabilities p and 1-p, respectively), the average number of ground states is maximum for a wide range of values of p around p=1 / 2 and depends on the total number of sites at hierarchy level n, Nn. In this case, for all lattices investigated, it is shown that the ground-state degeneracy behaves like exp[h(d)Nn], in the limit Nn large, where h(d) is a positive number which depends on the lattice fractal dimension. The probability of finding frustrated cells at a given hierarchy level n, Fn(p), is calculated analytically (three last hierarchy levels for d=2 and the last hierarchy of the d=3 lattice, with 0&lt;or=p&lt;or=1), as well as numerically (all other cases, with p=1 / 2).

For d=2 our results refer to the paramagnetic phase, whereas for all other dimensions considered [which are greater than the lower critical dimension dl (dl approximately 2.5)], our results refer to the spin-glass phase at zero temperature; in the latter cases h(d) increases with the fractal dimension. For n&gt;&gt;1, only the last hierarchies contribute significantly to the ground-state degeneracy; such a dominant behavior becomes stronger for high fractal dimensions. The exponential increase of the number of ground states with the total number of sites is in agreement with the mean-field picture of spin glasses.",

This range of excitation wavelengths allows selective population of A (2)Sigma(+) state levels with all vibrational (v(+')) quantum numbers in the range 0&lt; or =v(+')&lt; or =15.

No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 ± 5.7(stat) ± 1.5(syst)) × 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| &lt; 10.5 × 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence.

Each 2(l) pole is defined by a rank-l irreducible tensor with (2l+1) components P(m)((l)) proportional to the solid spherical harmonic r(l)Y(m)(l)(theta,phi). Here we focus our attention on 2(l) poles with l=2,3,4 (quadrupole Theta, octopole Omega, and hexadecapole Phi). An important conclusion of this study is that n can be 1 or 2 depending on both the multipole rank l and state quantum number Lambda. For Sigma(+/-)(Lambda=0) states, all 2(l) poles have one independent parameter (n=1). For spatially degenerate states--Pi, Delta, and Phi (Lambda=1,2,3)--the general rule reads n=1 for l&lt;2/Lambda/ (when the 2(l)-pole rank lies below 2/Lambda/ but n=2 for higher 2(l) poles with l&gt;or=2/Lambda/. The second nonzero term is the off-diagonal matrix element [formula: see text]. Thus, a Pi(Lambda=1) state has one dipole (mu(z)) but two independent 2(l) poles for l&gt;or=2--starting with the quadrupole [Theta(zz),(Theta(xx)-Theta(yy))]. A Delta(Lambda=2) state has n=1 for 2((1,2,3)) poles (mu(z),Theta(zz),Omega(zzz)) but n=2 for higher 2((l&gt;or=4)) poles--from the hexadecapole Phi up. For Phi(Lambda=3) states, it holds that n=1 for 2(1) to 2(5) poles but n=2 for all 2((l&gt;or=6)) poles. In short, what is usually stated in the literature--that n=1 for all possible 2(l) poles of linear molecules--only applies to Sigma(+/-) states. For degenerate states with n=2, all Cartesian 2(l)-pole components (l&gt;or=2/Lambda/) can be expressed as linear combinations of two irreducible multipoles, P(m=0)((l)) and P/m/=2 Lambda)((l)) [parallel (z axis) and anisotropy (xy plane)].

The formulae are valid for 0 &lt; or = r &lt; or = infinity and are easily extended to higher values of l. Special treatment of integrals is needed only for functions with n = l and n = l + 1 at r = 0.

The ESP, EF and EFG values at the nuclear positions in formamide are in very good agreement with those directly evaluated from density-functional PBE calculations with 6-31G**, aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The small observed discrepancies are attributed to the different behavior of Gaussian- and Slater-type functions near the nuclei and to imperfections of the reciprocal-space fit. An EF map is displayed which allows useful visualization of the lattice EF effects in the crystal structure of formamide.

Evaluation of the properties in an infinite crystal.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and precise evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Nguyen, Macchi &amp; Volkov (2020), Acta Cryst. A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

For electron scattering, new total electron scattering cross sections (e-TCS) have been measured with a high resolution magnetically confined electron beam transmission system from 1 to 200 eV. Dissociative electron attachment processes for electron energies from 3 to 52 eV have been analyzed by measuring the relative O<sup-</sup anion production yield. In addition, elastic, inelastic, and total scattering cross section calculations have been carried out in the framework of the Independent Atom Model by using the Screening Corrected Additive Rule, including interference effects (IAM-SCARI). Based on the previous cross section compilation from Itikawa ( <iJ. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data</i, 2002, 31, 749-767) and the present measurements and calculations, an updated recommended e-TCS data set has been used as reference values to obtain a self-consistent integral cross section data set for the elastic and inelastic (vibrational excitation, electronic excitation, and ionization) scattering channels. A similar calculation has been carried out for positrons, which shows important differences between the electron scattering behavior: e.g., more relevance of the target polarization at the lower energies, more efficient excitation of the target at intermediate energies, but a lower total scattering cross section for increasing energies, even at 5000 eV. This result does not agree with the charge independence of the scattering cross section predicted by the first Born approximation (FBA). However, we have shown that the inelastic channels follow the FBA's predictions for energies above 500 eV while the elastic part, due to the different signs of the scattering potential constituent terms, remains lower for positrons even at the maximum impact energy considered here (5000 eV). As in the case of electrons, a self-consistent set of integral positron scattering cross sections, including elastic and inelastic (vibrational excitation, electronic excitation, positronium formation, and ionization) channels is provided. Again, to derive these data, positron scattering total cross sections based on a previous compilation from Brunger et al. ( <iJ. Phys. Chem. Ref.

Data for the main inelastic channels, i.e. direct ionization and positronium formation, derived with this procedure, show excellent agreement with the experimental results available in the literature. Inconsistencies found between different model potential calculations, both for the elastic and inelastic collision processes, suggest that new calculations using more sophisticated methods are required.",

Lett. 2001, 336, 1], our data confirm the absence of a barrier along the path to the LiH depletion reaction and further reveal possible spurious features of the earlier computed surface which may in turn affect the resulting rates from low-energy dynamic studies of the title system.",

Such metastable matter-positron complexes are stabilized by a variety of mechanisms, which can have both covalent and noncovalent character. Specifically, electron-positron binding often involves strong many-body correlation effects, posing a substantial challenge for quantum-chemical methods based on atomic orbitals. Here we propose an accurate, efficient, and transferable variational ansatz based on a combination of electron-positron geminal orbitals and a Jastrow factor that explicitly includes the electron-positron correlations in the field of the nuclei, which are optimized at the level of variational Monte Carlo (VMC). We apply this approach in combination with diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to calculate binding energies for a positron <ie</i<sup+</sup and a positronium Ps (the pseudoatomic electron-positron pair), bound to a set of atomic systems (H<sup-</sup, Li<sup+</sup, Li, Li<sup-</sup, Be<sup+</sup, Be, B<sup-</sup, C<sup-</sup, O<sup-</sup and F<sup-</sup). For PsB, PsC, PsO, and PsF, our VMC and DMC total energies are lower than that from previous calculations; hence, we redefine the state of the art for these systems. To assess our approach for molecules, we study the potential-energy surfaces (PES) of two hydrogen anions H<sup-</sup mediated by a positron (<ie</i<sup+</supH<sub2</sub<sup2-</sup), for which we calculate accurate spectroscopic properties by using a dense interpolation of the PES. We demonstrate the reliability and transferability of our correlated wave functions for electron-positron interactions with respect to state-of-the-art calculations reported in the literature.",

To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous theoretical PESs proposed for Cu-He and Au-He, and a single one for Ag-He [Z. J. Jakubek and M. Takami, Chem. Phys. Lett. 265, 653 (1997)], computed about 10 years ago at MP2 level and significantly improved by our study. To reach a high degree of accuracy in the determination of the three M-He potentials (M=Cu,Ag,Au), we performed extensive series of test computations to establish the appropriate basis set, the theoretical method, and the computational scheme for these systems. For each M-He dimer we computed the PES at the CCSD(T) level of theory, starting from the reference unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave function. We described the inner shells with relativistic small core pseudopotentials, and we adopted high quality basis sets for the valence electrons. We also performed CCSDT computations in a limited set of M-He internuclear distances, adopting a medium-sized basis set, such as to define for each dimer a CCSD(T) to CCSDT correction term and to improve further the quality of the CCSD(T) interaction potentials. The Cu-He complex has minimum interaction energy (E(min)) of -28.4 microhartree at the internuclear distance of 4.59 A (R(min)), and the short-range repulsive wall starts at 4.04 A (R(E=0)). Quite interestingly, the PES of Ag-He is more attractive (E(min)=-33.8 microhartree) but presents nearly the same R(min) and R(E=0) values, 4.60 and 4.04 A, respectively. The interaction potential for Au-He is markedly deeper and shifted at shorter distances as compared to the lighter complexes, with E(min)=-69.6 microhartree, R(min)=4.09 A and R(E=0)=3.60 A. As a first insight in the structure of M-He(n) aggregates, we determined the rovibrational structure of the three M-He dimers.

The metastable decay shows a lifetime of 5.8 +/- 1.5 micros. The measured kinetic energy release spectrum of the dissociation shows one broad peak. To understand the observed features, ab initio potential energy surface (PES) for the ground electronic state of CO2(2+) was computed using a multireference configuration interaction method and a correlation-consistent polarized-valence quadruple-zeta basis set, for a range of internuclear distances and O-C-O bond angles, and an analytic fit of the PES was obtained. The computed PES clearly indicates the metastability of the dication and yields a barrier height and an asymptotic limit in fair agreement with the reported data. A time-dependent quantum mechanical approach was used to compute the ground vibrational state wave function of CO2 in its ground electronic state. Assuming a Franck-Condon transition, the same function was taken to be the initial wave function at time t = 0 for the time evolution on the fitted PES for the ground electronic state of CO2(2+). The autocorrelation function was computed and Fourier transformed to obtain the excitation spectrum. Upon convolution with the instrument resolution function, the kinetic energy release spectrum was obtained, in good agreement with the experimental results, particularly at lower energies.

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

We demonstrate that the unphysical states arise due to the incompleteness of the space-fixed total angular momentum basis caused by using a fixed cutoff value J<submax</sub for the total angular momentum of the collision complex J. As a result, certain orbital angular momentum (l) basis states lack the full range of J values required by the angular momentum addition rules, resulting in the appearance of unphysical states.

To illustrate the procedure, we use the augmented basis sets to calculate the state-to-state cross sections for rotational and spin relaxation in cold collisions of <sup40</supCaH(X<sup2</supΣ<sup+</sup, v = 0, N = 1, M<subN</sub = 1, M<subS</sub = 1/2) molecules with <sup4</supHe atoms in a magnetic field. We find excellent agreement with benchmark calculations, validating our proposed procedure. We find that N-conserving spin relaxation from the highest-energy to the lowest-energy Zeeman state of the N = 1 manifold, |1112〉→|1-1-12〉 is nearly completely suppressed due to the lack of spin-rotation coupling between the fully spin-stretched Zeeman states. Our results demonstrate the possibility of rigorous, computationally efficient, and unphysical state-free quantum calculations on cold molecular collisions and on near-threshold energy levels of strongly anisotropic atom-molecule collision complexes in an external magnetic field.",

In this Letter, we report an experimental implementation of OAM multiplexed continuous variables (CV) entanglement based on a four-wave mixing (FWM) process, in which 13 pairs of entangled Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes, LG_{ℓ,pr} and LG_{-ℓ,conj}, are simultaneously and deterministically generated, where ℓ (ℓ integer) is the topological charge corresponding to the OAM mode and pr (conj) indicates a probe (conjugate) beam.

The final state of the NO molecule is detected by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The state-selected NO molecule is oriented with either the N end or the O end toward the incoming D2 molecule by application of a static electric field E in the scattering region. This field is directed parallel or antiparallel to the relative velocity vector v. Comparison of signals taken for the different applied field directions gives the experimental steric asymmetry SA, defined by SA = (sigma v upward arrow downward arrow E - sigma v upward arrow upward arrow E)/(sigma v upward arrow downward arrow E + sigma v upward arrow upward arrow E), which is equal to within a factor of -1 to the molecular steric effect, Si--&gt;f identical with (sigmaD2--&gt;NO - sigmaD2--&gt;ON)/(sigmaD2--&gt;NO + sigmaD2--&gt;ON).

With Allen et al. as a bridge, connections are made between this recent work in electron vortex wave functions and much earlier works, extending a 175 year old tradition in matter wave vortices.This article is part of the themed issue 'Optical orbital angular momentum'.",

We experimentally determine this ratio using simultaneous measurements of both the levitation force and the torque on an acoustic absorber exerted by a broad range of helical ultrasonic beams produced by a 1000-element matrix transducer array. In general, beams with helical phase fronts have been shown to contain orbital angular momentum as the result of the azimuthal component of the Poynting vector around the propagation axis. Theory predicts that for both optical and acoustic helical beams the ratio of the angular momentum current of the beam to the power should be given by the ratio of the beam's topological charge to its angular frequency.

Application of a static electric field E in the scattering region, directed parallel or antiparallel to the relative velocity vector v, allows the state-selected NO molecule to be oriented with either the N end or the O end towards the incoming He atom. Laser-induced fluorescence detection of the final state of the NO molecule is used to determine the experimental steric asymmetry, [formula: see text], which is equal to within a factor of (- 1) to the molecular steric effect, S(i--&gt;f) is identical with (sigma(He--&gt;NO) - (sigma(He--&gt;ON))/(sigma(He--&gt;NO) + sigma(He--&gt;ON)). The dependence of the integral inelastic cross section on the incoming lambda-doublet component is also observed as a function of the final rotational (j'), spin-orbit (omega'), and lambda-doublet (epsilon') state. The measured steric asymmetries are significantly larger than previously observed for NO-Ar scattering, supporting earlier proposals that the repulsive part of the interaction potential is responsible for the steric asymmetry. In contrast to the case of scattering with Ar, the steric asymmetry of NO-He collisions is not very sensitive to the value of omega'. However, the lambda-doublet propensities are very different for [omega=0.5(F1)--&gt;omega'= 1.5(F2)] and [omega=0.5(F1)--&gt;omega'=0.5(F1)] transitions. Spin-orbit manifold conserving collisions exhibit a propensity for parity conservation at low deltaj, but spin-orbit manifold changing collisions do not show this propensity. In conjunction with the experiments, state-to-state cross sections for scattering of oriented NO(2Pi) molecules with He atoms are predicted from close-coupling calculations on restricted coupled-cluster methods including single, double, and noniterated triple excitations [J. Klos, G. Chalasinski, M. T. Berry, R.Bukowski, and S. M. Cybulski, J. Chem. Phys. 112, 2195 (2000)] and correlated electron-pair approximation [M. Yang and M. H. Alexander, J. Chem.

Additionally, calculated field-free integral cross sections for collisions at Etr = 508 cm(-1) are compared to the experimental data of Joswig et al. [J. Chem. Phys.85, 1904 (1986)].

Unlike thymine, which exhibits a structureless spectrum, the vibronic spectrum of 5M2HP is well structured, allowing us to determine the rotational constants and the methyl group torsional barriers in the S0 and S1 states. The 0(0)(0), 6a(0)(1), 6b(0)(1), and 14(0)(1) band contours were measured at 900 MHz (0.03 cm(-1)) resolution using mass-specific two-color resonant two-photon ionization (2C-R2PI) spectroscopy. All four bands are polarized perpendicular to the pyrimidine plane (&gt;90% c type), identifying the S1&lt;--S0 excitation of 5M2HP as a 1nπ* transition. All contours exhibit two methyl rotor subbands that arise from the lowest 5-methyl torsional states 0A\" and 1E\". The S0 and S1 state torsional barriers were extracted from fits to the torsional subbands. The 3-fold barriers are V3\" = 13 cm(-1) and V3' = 51 cm(-1); the 6-fold barrier contributions V6\" and V6' are in the range of 2-3 cm(-1) and are positive in both states. The changes of A, B, and C rotational constants upon S1 &lt;--S0 excitation were extracted from the contours and reflect an “anti-quinoidal” distortion. The 0(0)(0) contour can only be simulated if a 3 GHz Lorentzian line shape is included, which implies that the S1(1nπ*) lifetime is ~55 ps. For the 6a(0)(1) and 6b(0)(1) bands, the Lorentzian component increases to 5.5 GHz, reflecting a lifetime decrease to ~30 ps. The short lifetimes are consistent with the absence of fluorescence from the 1nπ* state. Combining these measurements with the previous observation of efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) from the S1 state to a long-lived T1 (3nπ*) state that lies ~2200 cm(-1) below [S. Lobsiger, S. et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, 12, 5032] implies that the broadening arises from fast intersystem crossing with k(ISC) ≈ 2 × 10(10) s(-1).

The infrared spectra of the resulting complexes exhibit a sequence of rotationally resolved vibrational nu(3) bands in the vicinity of 2060 cm(-1), which are sufficiently separated to assign them to clusters with specific numbers of attached molecules for n=1-16. The present article contains the first complete analysis of the spectra for n=2-8 and a full documentation of the results for n=8-15 briefly described in a short report [Europhys. Lett. 83, 66008 (2008)]. Distinct rotational Q-branches are observed for all OCS-(o-D(2))(n) clusters at the He droplet temperatures of 0.38 K and 0.15 K, indicating that the (o-D(2))(n) shell rotates nearly freely about the molecular OCS axis. In the case of OCS-(p-H(2))(n) at 0.38 K, the Q-branch is seen for most n, with the exception of n=5, 6 and n=12. At 0.15 K, the Q-branch has disappeared for all n&gt;or=11, indicating that the axial rotations are no longer active. Previously, the absence of a Q-branch for n=5 and 6 was explained by the high group symmetry of the bosonic p-H(2) rigid (donut) rings around the OCS molecule. This model, however, fails in explaining the disappearance of the Q-branch for n&gt;or=11. In essential agreement with recent path-integral Monte Carlo calculations, the observed phenomenon is attributed to the onset of superfluidity in the multiring p-H(2) shell and the related permutations of bosonic p-H(2) molecules. A floppy shell model, which accounts for the effect of tunneling and exchange of molecules within the clusters, is able to explain the postulated superfluid behavior of the p-H(2) shell at low temperatures. Within this model the activation of states of low axial symmetry is responsible for the appearance of the Q-branch at higher temperatures.",

By combining these methods, the B origin of 2PY at 0(0) (0)+98 cm(-1) and the bands at +218 and +252 cm(-1) are identified as overtones of the S(1) state out-of-plane vibrations nu(1) (') and nu(2) ('), as are the analogous bands of d-2PY. Anharmonic double-minimum potentials are derived for the respective out-of-plane coordinates that predict further nu(1) (') and nu(2) (') overtones and combinations, reproducing approximately 80% of the vibronic bands up to 600 cm(-1) above the 0(0) (0) band. The fluorescence spectra excited at the electronic origins and the nu(1) (') and nu(2) (') out-of-plane overtone levels confirm these assignments. The S(1) nonplanar minima and S(1)&lt;--S(0) out-of-plane progressions are in agreement with the determination of nonplanar vibrationally averaged geometries for the 0(0) (0) and 0(0) (0)+98 cm(-1) upper states by Held et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 95, 8732 (1991)]. The fluorescence lifetimes of the S(1) state vibrations show strong mode dependence: Those of the out-of-plane levels decrease rapidly above 200 cm(-1) excess vibrational energy, while the in-plane vibrations nu(5) ('), nu(8) ('), and nu(9) (') have longer lifetimes, although they are above or interspersed with the \"dark\" out-of-plane states. This is interpreted in terms of an S(1) (') state reaction with a low barrier towards a conical intersection with a prefulvenic geometry. Out-of-plane vibrational states can directly surmount this barrier, whereas in-plane vibrations are much less efficient in this respect. Analysis of the fluorescence spectra allows to identify nine in-plane S(0) (') state fundamentals, overtones of the S(0) state nu(1) (\") and nu(2) (\") out-of-plane vibrations, and &gt;30 other overtones and combination bands.

The outer Be<sub4</subLi<sub4</sub ring in 1 and 3 also supports 2σ aromaticity, collectively leading to 3-fold π/σ aromaticity for these ppC/ptC clusters.

All the 9 Λ-S states correlate to the first two dissociation limits, N((4)Su)+Se((3)Pg) and N((4)Su)+Se((3)Dg), of NSe radical. Of these Λ-S states, the 1(6)Σ(+), 1(4)Σ(+), 1(6)Π, 2(4)Π and 1(4)Δ are found to be rather weakly bound states. The 1(2)Σ(+) is found to be unstable and has double wells. And the 1(6)Σ(+), 1(4)Σ(+), 1(4)Π and 1(6)Π are found to be the inverted ones with the SO coupling included. The PEC calculations are made by the complete active space self-consistent field method, which is followed by the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction approach with the Davidson modification. The spin-orbit coupling is accounted for by the state interaction approach with the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. The convergence of the present calculations is discussed with respect to the basis set and the level of theory. Core-valence correlation corrections are included with a cc-pCVTZ basis set. Scalar relativistic corrections are calculated by the third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a cc-pV5Z basis set. All the PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The variation with internuclear separation of spin-orbit coupling constants is discussed in brief for some Λ-S states with one shallow well on each PEC. The spectroscopic parameters of 9 Λ-S and 28 Ω states are determined by fitting the first ten vibrational levels whenever available, which are calculated by solving the rovibrational Schrödinger equation with Numerov's method. The splitting energy in the X(2)Π Λ-S state is determined to be about 864.92 cm(-1), which agrees favorably with the measurements of 891.80 cm(-1).

The unsolvated monomers and dimers have been considered and compared to the 1:1 mixed aggregates formed with lithium dimethylamide. In all cases, the separate entities, their docking complexes, the transition states, and the condensation products have been characterized and compared to the corresponding situations involving methyllithium, taken as a prototypic sp3 nucleophile. Regarding the monomers, this study shows that, in the three cases considered, formaldehyde forms a pretransition state complex in which the oxygen of the carbonyl interacts with the lithium cation along one of its lone pair. A small energy barrier (&lt; or =2.1 kcal.mol(-1)) brings to the transition state, then to the lithium alcoholate resulting from the largely exothermic condensation (approximately 40 kcal.mol(-1)). The structure of the homogeneous dimers considered in a second step has been optimized and lead to arrangements in which a planar quadrilateral C-Li-C-Li is always obtained. In the presence of formaldehyde, these entities provide complexes exhibiting lithium-oxygen interaction similar to those occurring with the monomers. For the dimers, the geometry at the TS evokes a pi-complex between the C=O and the lithium cation, particularly pronounced in the case of phenyllithium. The resulting alcoholates are obtained following a larger exothermic reaction (approximately 55 kcal.mol(-1)). The heterogeneous dimers with lithium dimethylamide have been finally examined. In these cases, the aldehyde can orientate toward either the carbon or the nitrogen, leading to the expected lithium alcoholate or alpha-amino alcoholate, respectively. Whatever the orientation, the complexes present characteristics close to those calculated for the homogeneous dimer complexes. These similarities are conserved at the transition state.",

Extended ab initio calculations using the MR configuration interaction (MRCI) method have been performed to describe in a balanced way the manifold of electronic states derived from the dangling bonds created by initial removal of two neighboring carbon atoms from the graphene network. In total, this study took into account the characterization of 16 electronic states (eight singlets and eight triplets) considering unrelaxed and relaxed defect structures. The ground state was found to be of (1)Ag character with around 50% closed shell character. The geometry optimization process leads to the formation of two five-membered rings in a pentagon-octagon-pentagon (5-8-5) structure. The closed shell character increases thereby to ∼70%; the analysis of unpaired density shows only small contributions confirming the chemical stability of that entity. For the unrelaxed structure the first five excited states ((3)B3g, (3)B2u, (3)B1u, (3)Au and (1)Au) are separated from the ground state by less than 2.5 eV. For comparison, unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using several types of functionals have been performed within different symmetry subspaces defined by the open shell orbitals. Comparison with the MRCI results gave good agreement in terms of finding the (1)Ag state as a ground state and in assigning the lowest excited states. Linear interpolation curves between the unrelaxed and relaxed defect structures also showed good agreement between the two classes of methods opening up the possibilities of using extended nanoflakes for multistate investigations at the DFT level.

This led to planar aromatic 10π electron systems, nonplanar bicyclic structures with a transannular S-S bond, and tricyclic structures by bridging the planar rings with an acceptor or donor unit. The final structures depend on the number of π electrons in the bridges. Intermediate biradicals are stabilized by Jahn-Teller distortion, giving transannular S-S bonds between the NSN units. This procedure may be summarized by two rules, which provide a rationale for the structures of a large number of sulfur-nitrogen-based molecules. The long bonds between the NSN units show a p character of &gt;95 %.

The goal is to address Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein nuclear spin statistics on an equal footing and to deliver excited states with a similar accuracy to that of the ground state, implementing ab initio-derived potential models as well. The method is applied to clusters of up to four (three) <sup4</supHe atoms and para-H<sub2</sub molecules (<sup3</supHe atoms) inside a single-walled (1 nm diameter) carbon nanotube.

The calculations were performed at the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) and the coupled cluster including singles, doubles, and a perturbative estimate of triples replacement [CCSD(T)] levels of electronic structure theory. At both levels of theory, by including results corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), we have estimated the complete basis set (CBS) limit by employing the family of Dunning's correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets. The largest MP2 calculation was performed with the cc-pV6Z basis set (2772 basis functions), whereas the largest CCSD(T) calculation was with the cc-pV5Z basis set (1752 basis functions). The cluster geometries were optimized with basis sets up to quadruple-ζ quality, observing that both its intra- and intermolecular parts have practically converged with the triple-ζ quality sets. The use of converged geometries was found to play an important role for obtaining accurate estimates for the CBS limits. Our results demonstrate that the binding energies with the families of the plain (cc-pVnZ) and augmented (aug-cc-pVnZ) sets converge [within &lt;0.01 kcal/mol for MP2 and &lt;0.15 kcal/mol for CCSD(T)] to the same CBS limit. In addition, the average of the uncorrected and BSSE-corrected binding energies was found to converge to the same CBS limit much faster than either of the two constituents (uncorrected or BSSE-corrected binding energies). Due to the fact that the family of augmented basis sets (especially for the larger sets) causes serious linear dependency problems, the plain basis sets (for which no linear dependencies were found) are deemed as a more efficient and straightforward path for obtaining an accurate CBS limit. We considered extrapolations of the uncorrected (ΔE) and BSSE-corrected (ΔEcp) binding energies, their average value (ΔEave), as well as the average of the latter over the plain and augmented sets (ΔẼave) with the cardinal number of the basis set n. Our best estimate of the CCSD(T)/CBS limit for the π-π binding energy in the PD benzene dimer is De = -2.65 ± 0.02 kcal/mol. The best CCSD(T)/cc-pV5Z calculated value is -2.62 kcal/mol, just 0.03 kcal/mol away from the CBS limit. For comparison, the MP2/CBS limit estimate is -5.00 ± 0.01 kcal/mol, demonstrating a 90% overbinding with respect to CCSD(T). The spin-component-scaled (SCS) MP2 variant was found to closely reproduce the CCSD(T) results for each basis set, while scaled opposite spin (SOS) MP2 yielded results that are too low when compared to CCSD(T).

The computed rate coefficients obtained at different ab initio, DFT and TST levels are compared with experimental values available in the 1000-1200 K temperature range. Based on the rate coefficients computed at the ICVT/SCT level, the highest TST level used in this study, the BH&amp;HLYP functional performs best among all the functionals used, while the RCCSD(T)/CBS//MP2/6-31++G** level is the best among all the ab initio levels used. Comparing computed reaction rate coefficients obtained at different levels of theory shows that, the computed barrier height has the strongest effect on the computed reaction rate coefficients as expected. Variational effects on the computed rate coefficients are found to be negligibly small. Although tunneling effects are relatively small at high temperatures (~1500 K), SCT corrections are significant at low temperatures (~300 K), and both barrier heights and the magnitudes of the imaginary frequencies affect SCT corrections.",

At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed.

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface. Rate constants calculated with the CVBMM surface agree with the MPW54 rate constants within 12% for 534-2000 K and within 23% for 200-491 K.

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods.

Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state.

The force constant for the linear angle potential can be derived analytically from the corresponding force constant in the traditional potential. The new potential is tested on the properties of alkynes, nitriles, and carbon dioxide. We find that the angles of the linear groups remain about 2° closer to 180° using the new potential. The bond and angle force constants for carbon dioxide were tuned to reproduce the experimentally determined frequencies. An interesting finding was that simulations of liquid carbon dioxide under pressure with the new flexible model were stable only when explicitly modeling the long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions due to the very long-range nature of the LJ interactions (&gt;1.7 nm).

For two eigenstates that differ only in the symmetry of the vibrational wave function, |110&gt;|0&gt;(A1) and |110&gt;|0&gt;(E), the ratio of reaction cross sections is 1.00 +/- 0.05, showing that there is no difference in enhancement of the H-atom abstraction reaction. Molecules with excited local modes corresponding to one quantum of C-H stretch in each of two distinct oscillators react exclusively to form C-H stretch excited CH2D products. Conversely, eigenstates containing stretch excitation in a single C-H oscillator form predominantly ground vibrational state CH2D products. Analyzing the product state yields for reaction of the |110&gt;|0&gt;(A1) state of CH3D yields an enhancement of 20 +/- 4 over the thermal reaction. A local mode description of the vibrational motion along with a spectator model for the reactivity accounts for all of the observed dynamics.",

On the other hand, presenting strong vibration-rotation bands in the 9 μm atmospheric window, it is a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. In the present work, the vibrational and ro-vibrational properties of CH(2)F(2), providing basic data for its atmospheric modeling, are studied in detail by coupling medium resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to high-level electronic structure ab initio calculations. Experimentally a full quantum assignment and accurate integrated absorption cross sections are obtained up to 5000 cm(-1). Ab initio calculations are carried out by using CCSD(T) theory and large basis sets of either the correlation consistent or atomic natural orbital hierarchies. By using vibrational perturbation theory to second order a complete set of vibrational and ro-vibrational parameters is derived from the ab initio quartic anharmonic force fields, which well compares with the spectroscopic constants retrieved experimentally. An excellent agreement between theory and experiment is achieved for vibrational energy levels and integrated absorption cross sections: transition frequencies up to four quanta of vibrational excitation are reproduced with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 7 cm(-1) while intensities are predicted within few km mol(-1) from the experiment. Basis set performances and core correlation effects are discussed throughout the paper. Particular attention is focused in the understanding of the anharmonic couplings which rule the vibrational dynamics of the |ν(1)&gt;, |2ν(8)&gt;, |2ν(2)&gt; three levels interacting system. The reliability of the potential energy and dipole moment surfaces in reproducing the vibrational eigenvalues and intensities as well as in modeling the vibrational and ro-vibrational mixings over the whole 400-5000 cm(-1) region is also demonstrated by spectacular spectral simulations carried out by using the ro-vibrational Hamiltonian constants, and the relevant coupling terms, obtained from the perturbation treatment of the ab initio anharmonic force field.

Together with an estimated rotational temperature of 25 K, the rotational band structure could be completely resolved, and nearly 900 transitions were assigned in the spectrum. A set of 13 molecular parameters of the vibronic transition was simultaneously adjusted to the measured data by means of a weighted nonlinear least-squares fit procedure. The weights themselves were determined by a careful analysis of the uncertainties in the measured line frequencies. The overall rms deviation of the fit was 3.1 MHz or about 10% of the observed linewidth. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to the best-fit parameter set in order to find error estimates for the single constants as realistic as possible. The interdependencies of the parameters were analyzed by means of correlation coefficients obtained from the fit output. These statistical findings were incorporated into comparisons with results from other works. As far as ground state-related data are concerned general agreement with IR-band investigations was found.

All relevant rate constants of this triplet chain reaction were extracted from laser flash photolysis plus steady-state photolysis experiments. The crucial rate constant ka for adiabatic isomerization of the triplet reactant to triplet product (R* --&gt; P*) cannot be directly measured because it is so large relative to the bimolecular rate of R* formation via sensitization. However, ka was obtained indirectly using a cage/encounter complex model to analyze the competition between the dissociation of encounter pairs with the sensitizer, e.g., S/R* --&gt; S + R*, and the in-cage processes, S/R* --&gt; S/P* --&gt; S*/P, in nonviscous and viscous solvents. These measurements yielded ka values of (approximately 4-9) x 10(9) s(-1), which suggests that only a small (approximately 3 kcal/mol) energy barrier exists along the potential energy surface from R* to P*. Steady-state data indicated that the chain-terminating rate constant R* --&gt; R is negligibly small, an ideal condition for chain amplification. Triplet energy transfer from a series of sensitizers to the Dewar benzene derivatives shows a nonclassical falloff in rate constants with decreasing sensitizer triplet energy, suggesting energy transfer to thermally distorted configurations having lower singlet-triplet energy gaps.

The fitting is based on variational calculations carried out with the extended Morse Oscillator Rigid Bender Internal Dynamics model. The potential function is expanded in Morse-type functions of the stretching variables and in cosine of the bending angle. The present calculation produces results in significantly better agreement with experiment than previous determinations of the potential energy surface, and the energies predicted with the new surface are sufficiently accurate to be useful for the assignment of new high-resolution spectra.

The results are interpreted with an expanded version of Polanyi's Rules for bimolecular reactions, and three trends are evident. (1) Relative translation of reactants is the main contributor to surmounting the barrier, since all transition states (TSs) are early with respect to sigma bond formation. (2) Vibrational excitation in the 1,3-dipole bending modes required for reaction is related to the lateness of the TS with respect to dipole bending: diazonium betaines (late TS, dipole bending required) &gt; nitrilium betaines &gt; azomethine betaines (early TS, dipole bending least important). This is also the order of the activation barriers (high --&gt; low).

Basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrections are applied to obtain 1.5 kcal mol(-1) for the binding energy of the ClO.N(2) van der Waals (VDW) complex. A model PES is developed and used in quasi-classical trajectory calculations to obtain the capture rate constant and nascent energy distributions of ClOOCl* produced via the chaperon mechanism. A range of VDW binding energies from 1.5 to 9.0 kcal mol(-1) are investigated. The anisotropic PES for the ClO.N(2) complex and a separable anharmonic oscillator approximation are used to estimate the equilibrium constant for formation of the VDW complex. Rate constants, branching ratios to produce ClOOCl, and nascent energy distributions of excited ClOOCl* are discussed with respect to the VDW binding energy and temperature. Interestingly, even for weak VDW binding energies, the N(2) usually carries away enough energy to stabilize the nascent ClOOCl*, although the VDW equilibrium constant is small. For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant. For the calculated ClO.N(2) binding energy of 1.5 kcal mol(-1), the VDW equilibrium constant is small, and the chaperon mechanism is only important at very high pressures.",

Known as T1, it follows the G3(MP2) recipe, by substituting an HF/6-31G* for the MP2/6-31G* geometry, eliminating both the HF/6-31G* frequency and QCISD(T)/6-31G* energy and approximating the MP2/G3MP2large energy using dual basis set RI-MP2 techniques. Taken together, these changes reduce computation time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Atom counts, Mulliken bond orders, and HF/6-31G* and RI-MP2 energies are introduced as variables in a linear regression fit to a set of 1126 G3(MP2) heats of formation. The T1 procedure reproduces these values with mean absolute and rms errors of 1.8 and 2.5 kJ/mol, respectively. It reproduces experimental heats of formation for a set of 1805 diverse organic molecules from the NIST thermochemical database with mean absolute and rms errors of 8.5 and 11.5 kJ/mol, respectively. Heats of formation of flexible molecules have been approximated by the heats of formation of their lowest-energy conformer as given by the T1 recipe. This has been identified by examining all conformers for molecules with fewer than 100 conformers and by examining a random sample of 100 conformers for molecules with more than 100 conformers. While this approximation necessarily yields heats of formation that are too negative, the error for typical organic molecules with less than 10 degrees of conformational freedom (several thousand conformers) is &lt;2-3 kJ/mol. T1 heats of formation have been used to calculate energy differences for a variety of structural, positional, and stereoisomers, as well as energy differences between conformers in a variety of simple acyclic and cyclic molecules for which reliable experimental data are available. In terms of both overall error and errors for individual systems, T1 provides a better account of the experimental thermochemistry than any practical quantum chemical method that we have previously examined. A database of approximately 40,000 T1 calculations for both rigid and flexible organic molecules has been produced and is available as part of the Spartan Molecular Database (SMD) in the current version of the Spartan electronic structure program (Spartan'08). (A subset of approximately 5000 molecules is provided as part of the standard release, and the full T1 database can be licensed.). This collection differs from the other components of SMD in that the lowest-energy conformation for each molecule has been assigned using a high-level quantum chemical method and not molecular mechanics. Thus, it is not only a source of \"high-quality\" calculated heats of formation for organic molecules but also a source of conformational preferences.",

At the onsets for excitation of one and two quanta for the C-Br stretching mode nu3, downward cusps are detected. With reference to the recommended thermal (300 K) attachment rate coefficient k(A)(CF3Br) = 1.4 x 10(-8) cm3 s(-1), absolute cross sections have been determined for Br- formation. In addition, we studied Br- and (CF3Br)Br- formations with a seeded supersonic target beam (10% CF3Br in helium carrier gas, with a stagnation pressure of 1-4 bars and nozzle temperatures of 300 and 600 K) and found prominent structure in the anion yields due to cluster formation. Using the microwave pulse radiolysis swarm technique, allowing for controlled variation of the electron temperature by microwave heating, we studied the dependence of the absolute DEA rate coefficient on the mean electron energy E over the range of 0.04-2 eV at gas temperatures T(G) ranging from 173 to 600 K. For comparison with the experimental results, semiempirical resonance R-matrix calculations have been carried out. The input for the theory includes the known energetic and structural parameters of the neutral molecule and its anion; the parameters of the resonant anion curves are chosen with reference to the known thermal rate coefficient for the DEA process. For the gas temperature T(G) = 300 K, good overall agreement of the theoretical DEA cross section with the experimental results is observed; moreover, rate coefficients for Br- formation due to Rydberg electron transfer, calculated with both the experimental and the theoretical DEA cross sections, are found to agree with the previously reported absolute experimental values. At T(G) = 300 K, satisfactory agreement is also found between the calculated and experimental attachment rate coefficients for mean electron energies E = 0.04-2 eV. The strong increase of the measured rate coefficients with rising gas temperature, however, could be only partially recovered by the R-matrix results.

From the results of the best fit to the model and the emission spectral intensities, the relative orientation of the out-of-plane pi electron of the A-state complex and the Ar atom has been estimated. No bands of the Ar complex were found near the C3, A-X, (0,0) band, consistent with the fact that the A 1Piu, upsilon = 0 level of free C3 is strongly perturbed by triplet levels. In the excitation spectra of the Ar complex, the bands with upsilonb' &gt; 0 show redshifts of about 16-36 cm(-1) compared to those of free C3, indicating that the A-state complex in these levels is more tightly bonded than the X-state complex.",

The deuteration effect on k[combining low line]IC is investigated for naphthalene, anthracene, free-base porphyrin (H2P) and tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP). The results show that anharmonic effects are important when calculating k[combining low line]IC for transitions between electronic states that are energetically separated (ΔE) by more than 20 000-25 000 cm-1. Anharmonic effects are also important when ΔE &lt; 20 000-25 000 cm-1 and when the accepting modes are X-H stretching vibrations with a frequency larger than 2000 cm-1. The calculations show that there is mixing between the S1 and S2 states of naphthalene induced by non-adiabatic interactions. The non-adiabatic interaction matrix element between the S1 and S2 states is 250 cm-1 and 50 cm-1 for the normal and fully deuterated naphthalene structure and this difference significantly affects the estimated fluorescence quantum yield.

Their UV absorption spectrum has been recorded at 7 K, between 190 and 350 nm; it consists of a first broad and intense band peaking at about 38,000 cm(-1) followed by a number of broad bands of lower intensity from 39,000 to 45,000 cm(-1). None of the bands observed shows appreciable fine vibronic structure, so that the energies of experimental electronic origins cannot be deduced and the assignment of the experimental spectrum using empirical methods based on crystal field theory cannot be attempted. Alternatively, the profile of the absorption spectrum has been obtained theoretically using the U-F bond lengths and totally symmetric vibrational frequencies of the ground 5f2 - 1A(1g) and 5f16d(t(2g))1 - iT(1u) excited states, their energy differences, and their corresponding electric dipole transition moments calculated using the relativistic ab initio model potential embedded cluster method.

In particular, the first broad and intense band peaking at about 38,000 cm(-1) can be safely assigned to the 0-0 and 0-1 members of the a(1g) progression of the 5f2 - 1A(1g)--&gt;5f16d(t(2g))1 - 1T(1u) electronic origin.

In this Rapid Communication, we validate their hypothesis by deriving an explicit formula for the local box-counting dimension of a countably-infinite discrete quantum spectrum. This formula expresses the local box-counting dimension of a spectrum in terms of single and double integrals of the NNSD of the spectrum. As applications, we derive an analytical formula for Poisson spectra and closed-form approximations to the local box-counting dimension for spectra having Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), and Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE) spacing statistics. In the Poisson and GOE cases, we compare our theoretical formulas with the published numerical data of Wang and Ong and observe excellent agreement between their data and our theory. We also study numerically the local box-counting dimensions of the Riemann zeta function zeros and the alternate levels of GOE spectra, which are often used as numerical models of spectra possessing GUE and GSE spacing statistics, respectively.

Cesium atoms were optically excited to the 6P3/2 state. The excited atom density and spatial distribution were mapped by monitoring the absorption of a counterpropagating single mode laser beam, tuned to the 6P1 --&gt; 8S(1/2) transitions, which could be translated parallel to the pump beam. The transmission factors, which describe the average probability that photons emitted within the fluorescence detection region can pass through the optically thick vapor without being absorbed, were calculated for 6P --&gt; 6S(1/2) transitions. The N2 caused line broadening and therefore increased the effective pumping rate and radiative rates. The effective radiative rates were calculated for the 6P(J) --&gt; 6S transitions.

The 5P3/2 and 5P1/2 states are separated by 238 cm(-1). The closest other states are &gt;6500 cm(-1) or &gt;28 KT. Neglect of these other states should be an excellent approximation. In the experiment the Rb density was 4.5 x 10(11) cm(-3). Using radiation trapping theory the effective radiative rate=Gammae5P3/2--&gt;5S1/2 2.47 x 10(7) s(-1) was obtained. For quenching by He only electronic to translational energy transfer is possible. However, in the N2 case, electronic to vibrational or rotational transfer is important. The Rb(5P3/2) state is 13 cm(-1) lower than the N2[X'Sigmag+ (V= 5, J= 11)]state; this energy gap is near resonant. The authors have not attempted to directly observe this possible E-R quenching channel Using a two-state rate equation model the transfer rate coefficients from Rb(5PJ) were obtained. The rate coefficient (k21He) for 5P3/2--&gt;5P1/2 transfer in collision with He is 2.61 x 10(-12) cm3 x s(-1). By comparing the direct and sensitized fluorescence intensities for He and N2 case, and fitting the experimental results to the rate equation analysis, the authors estimate that the rate coefficient (k21N2) for 5P3/2-5P1/2 transfer in collision with N2 is 2.36 x 10(-11) cm3 x s(-1). The E-V quenching rate coefficient (kN2) of the 5PJ state is 1.44 x 10(-10) cm3 x s(-1). The authors found find that the rate coefficient kN2 is about 6 times larger than the k21N2.

The cross sections for deactivation of K(6S) and K(4D) by collisions with H2 were measured. The temperature of the cell body was controlled at 413 K, and H2 pressure was varied between 4 and 40 Pa. The effects of K(6S, 4D)-K collisions could be neglected in our experimental condition. On excitation of K(6S) state, the decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 6S--&gt;4P transition was monitored. The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state. Upon excitation to the K(6S) state, the dependence on H2 pressure of integrated fluorescence in the transition 4D--&gt;4P was measured. The cross section (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the transition 6S--&gt;4D was obtained. The authors conclude that the channel for energy depletion from the 6S state is predominantly through the physical quenching to the 4D state, although the KH product has been observed in the chemical reaction",

Inverting the Fredholm equation to derive the composition and size distribution of particles from measured VSFs remains challenging because 1) the solution depends on the kernel function, and 2) the kernel function needs to be constructed to avoid singularity. In this study, a thorough review of the earlier and current inversion techniques is provided. An inversion method based on nonnegative least squares is presented and evaluated using the VSFs measured by a prototype volume scattering meter at the LEO-15 site off the New Jersey coast. The kernel function was built by a compilation of individual subpopulations, each of which follows a lognormal size distribution and whose characteristic size and refractive index altogether cover the entire ranges of natural variability of potential marine particles of the region. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the kernel function being constructed is neither singular nor pathological. A total of 126 potential subpopulations were identified, among which 11 are common in more than half of the inversions and only five consistently present (&gt;90% of measurements). These five subpopulations can be interpreted as small colloidal type particles of sizes around 0.02 μm, submicrometer detritus-type particles (n(r)=1.02, r(mode)=0.2 μm), two micrometer-sized subpopulations with one relatively soft (n(r)=1.04 and r(mode)=1.6 μm) and the other relatively refringent (n(r)=1.10 and r(mode)=3.2 μm), and bubbles of relatively large sizes (n(r)=0.75 and r(mode)=10 μm). Reconstructed PSDs feature a bimodal shape, with the smaller peak dominated by the colloidal subpopulations and the larger particles closely approximated by a power-law function. The Junge-type slope averages -4.0±0.2, in close agreement with the well-known mean value of -4.0 over the global ocean. The distribution of the refractive index suggested a dominance of particles of higher water content, also in agreement with earlier results based on the backscattering ratio and attenuation coefficients at the same area. Surprisingly, the colloidal-type subpopulations, which have often been operationally classified as \"dissolved\" and neglected for their scattering, exhibit significant backscattering with contributions of up to 40% over the entire backward angles.",

The squared magnitude of the NMR-active fields are then used to calculate the gradient-recalled images of the cylinder, for small tip angles of the magnetization; and the result is shown to predict almost quantitatively the intensity patterns of experimental proton images at 3.0 and 4.0T, in a cylindrical phantom of radius 9.25cm, filled with 0.05M aqueous NaCl. In particular, the artifactual brightening at the center of the recorded image is convincingly reproduced in a simulation, whose underlying model excludes wave propagation along the direction of the cylinder axis. Formation of the artifact is explained in terms of the focussing of the RF magnetic field at the center of the cylinder, as illustrated by contour plots showing the time evolution of the rotating flux. An extended electromagnetic model--having the dielectric cylinder enclosed in a long, shielded volume resonator (e.g., of bird cage type)--is then sketched. The mathematical details appear in Appendix A; and the simulated images are shown to be virtually indistinguishable from those of the simpler original model. The theory of the Q, or quality factor, of the dielectric cylinder--considered itself as a resonant object--is developed for the enclosed cylinder model, where flux containment by the shield permits an unambiguous treatment of both the stored energy and the radiative losses. This is extended to treat the Q of a lossy dielectric sphere without shielding. Further plots of flux contours are given for the sphere, excited at 208 MHz with a uniform circularly polarized field, as well as by a surface coil, and for the enclosed cylinder in the range 140-160 MHz. It is then argued that the center brightening artifacts in magnetic resonance images are due to the underdamped dielectric resonance of the sample, i.e., at Q &gt;0.5, while the overdamped condition, Q &lt; 0.5, leads to exclusion of flux from the center, i.e., to the classic skin effect. The term \"dielectric resonance\" is shown to require careful interpretation for mixed-mode excitation, such as occurs with a surface coil. An extended reciprocity formula for NMR reception, valid for an arbitrary electromagnetic Green's function, is also given in Appendix B.",

If diffraction blurs the image of a point object into an Airy disk with a root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) size of s = 0.44lambda/2NA (approximately 90 nm for light with a wavelength of lambda = 600 nm and an objective lens with a numerical aperture of NA = 1.49), limiting the resolution of the far-field microscope in use to d = 2.4s approximately = 200 nm, additional knowledge about the specimen can be used to great advantage. For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images. In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) &gt; or = 1% (&gt; or = 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF). Moreover, the error in co-localizing two or more single emitters is notably worse, remaining greater than 5-10% (5-10 nm) of the PSF size. Here we report a distance resolution of s(reg) = 0.50 nm (1sigma) and an absolute accuracy of s(distance) = 0.77 nm (1sigma) in a measurement of the separation between differently coloured fluorescent molecules using conventional far-field fluorescence imaging in physiological buffer conditions. The statistical uncertainty in the mean for an ensemble of identical single-molecule samples is limited only by the total number of collected photons, to s(loc) approximately 0.3 nm, which is approximately 3 x 10(-3) times the size of the optical PSF. Our method may also be used to improve the resolution of many subwavelength, far-field imaging methods such as those based on co-localization of molecules that are stochastically switched on in space. The improved resolution will allow the structure of large, multisubunit biological complexes in biologically relevant environments to be deciphered at the single-molecule level.",

E 97, 030202(R) (2018)10.1103/PhysRevE.97.030202], Sakhr and Nieminen (SN) solved a hypothesis formulated two decades ago, according to which the local box-counting dimension D_{box}(r) of a given energy spectrum, or more generally of a discrete set, should exclusively depend on the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution P(s) of the spectrum (set). SN found analytically this dependence, which led them to obtain closed formulas for the local box-counting dimension of Poisson spectra and of spectra belonging to Gaussian orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles. Here, first, we present a different derivation of the equation establishing the connection of D_{box}(r) and P(s) using the concept of surrogate spectrum. Although our equation is formally different to the SN result, we prove that both are equivalent. Second, we apply our equation to solve the inverse problem of determining the functional form of P(s) for spectra with real fractal structure and constant box-counting dimension D_{box}, and we find that P(s) should behave as a power-law of the spacing, with an exponent given by -(1+D_{box}). Finally, we present four applications or consequences of this last result: First, we provide a simple algorithm able to generate random fractal spectra with prescribed and constant D_{box}. Second, we calculate D_{box} for the sets given by the zeros of fractional Brownian motions, whose P(s) is known to have a power-law tail. Third, we also study D_{box}(r) for the zeros of fractional Gaussian noises, whose P(s) in known to present fat (but not power-law) tails, and that could be misinterpreted as real fractals. And finally, we present the calculation of D_{box} for the spectra of Fibonacci Hamiltonians, known to have fractal properties, simply by fitting their corresponding P(s) to a power-law without the need of applying a box-counting algorithm.",

At the different Cs densities, we have measured the time-integrated intensities of the components and fitted a three-state rate equation model to obtain the cross sections.

The cross section for 6D(5/2)--&gt;6D(3/2) transfer is (2.1 +/- 0.4) x 10(14) cm2. The cross section for excitation transfer out of the 6D doublet is sigmaQ = (1.6 +/- 0.4) x 10(-14) cm2.

At a Cs density lower than 6.0 x 10(12) cm3, the laser was used to pump the 6D(3/2) and 6D(5/2) states, respectively. The resulting fluorescence included the direct component emitted in the decay of the 6D(J) state and the sensitized component arising from the collisionally populated 7P(J') state. Relative intensities of the components yielded the cross sections.

The generalized model yields a significant advantage in terms of the ratio of the number of equations to that of unknowns in the factor analysis problem in dynamic SPECT studies. We solved the 5D model using a least-squares approach. In addition to the traditional non-negativity constraints, we constrained the solution using a priori knowledge of both time and energy, assuming that primary factors (spectra) are Gaussian-shaped with full-width at half-maximum equal to gamma camera energy resolution. 5D-GFA was validated in a simultaneous pre-/post-synaptic dual isotope dynamic phantom study where 99mTc and 123I activities were used to model early Parkinson disease studies. 5D-GFA was also applied to simultaneous perfusion/dopamine transporter (DAT) dynamic SPECT in rhesus monkeys. In the striatal phantom, 5D-GFA yielded significantly more accurate and precise estimates of both primary 99mTc (bias=6.4 % +/- 4.3 %) and 1231 (-1.7% +/- 6.9%) time activity curves (TAC) compared to conventional FADS (biases = 15.5% +/- 10.6% in 99mTc and 8.3% +/- 12.7% in 123I, p &lt; 0.05). Our technique was also validated in two primate dynamic dual isotope perfusion/DAT transporter studies. Biases of 99mTc-HMPAO and 123I-DAT activity estimates with respect to estimates obtained in the presence of only one radionuclide (sequential imaging) were significantly lower with 5D-GFA (9.4% +/- 4.3% for 99mTc-HMPAO and 8.7% +/-4.1% for 123I-DAT) compared to biases greater than 15% for volumes of interest (VOI) over the reconstructed volumes (p &lt; 0.05). 5D-GFA is a novel and promising approach in dynamic SPECT imaging that can also be used in other modalities. It allows accurate and precise dynamic analysis while compensating for Compton scatter and cross-talk.",

In line with the presence of golden sectioning in natural growth patterns, recent EEG recordings show an absence of coherence between brain frequencies related by the golden ratio, suggesting the potential relevance of the golden section to brain dynamics. Using Mondrian-type patterns comprising a number of paired sections in a range of five section-section areal ratios (including golden-sectioned pairs), participants were asked to indicate as rapidly and accurately as possible the polarity (light or dark) of the smallest section in the patterns. They were also asked to independently assess the aesthetic appeal of the patterns. No preference was found for golden-sectioned patterns, while reaction times (RTs) tended to decrease overall with increasing ratio independently of each pattern's fractal dimensionality. (Fractal dimensionality was unrelated to ratio and measured in terms of the Minkowski-Bouligand box-counting dimension). The ease of detecting the smallest section also decreased with increasing ratio, although RTs were found to be substantially slower for golden-sectioned patterns under 8-paired sectioned conditions. This was confirmed by a significant linear relationship between RT and ratio (p &lt; .001) only when the golden-sectioned RTs were excluded [the relationship was non-significant for the full complement of ratios (p = .217)]. Image analysis revealed an absence of spatial frequencies between 4 and 8 cycles-per-degree that was exclusive to the 8-paired (golden)-sectioned patterns. The significance of this was demonstrated in a subsequent experiment by addition of uniformly distributed random noise to the patterns. This provided a uniform spatial-frequency profile for all patterns, which did not influence the decrease in RT with increasing ratio but abolished the elevated RTs to golden-sectioned patterns. This suggests that optical limitation in the form of reduced inter-neural synchronization during spatial-frequency coding may be the foundation for the perceptual effects of golden sectioning.",

The characteristics of the estimated Lambda-doubling splitting constants (q(0), q(v), and mu) with n(= 5-8) of the nd (1)Delta(g) series have been explored.

The rotational-branch intensity and position anomalies in the observed spectra of the nd (1)Delta(g) series (n = 5-8) of Na(2) lead to the conclusion that due to the effects of the L-uncoupling perturbations, the same l complexes approaching the same ion-core limits result in the same l-mixing processes which lead to the formation of the supercomplexes due to the anisotropy of the molecular-ion [Na(2)(+)(3s)] field.

We find two situations where classical trajectories satisfying the correct boundary conditions must be excluded from the semiclassical formula. The first occurs when the contribution of the trajectory to the propagator becomes exponentially large as Planck's over 2 pi goes to zero. The second occurs when the contributing trajectories undergo bifurcations. Close to the bifurcation the semiclassical formula diverges. More interestingly, in the example studied, after the bifurcation, where more than one trajectory satisfying the boundary conditions exist, only one of them in fact contributes to the semiclassical formula, a phenomenon closely related to Stokes lines.

The key hypothesis is that the random class of potential energy valleys dominates the statistical mechanics of the liquid at temperatures above melting T approximately greater than Tm and that these valleys are macroscopically uniform in the thermodynamic limit. This allows us to use a single random valley to calculate the vibrational contribution to liquid properties, exactly in the thermodynamic limit, and as an approximation at finite number of particles N . This approximation is tested here for liquid Na with a physically realistic potential based on electronic structure theory. Steepest descent quenches were made from the molecular dynamics equilibrium liquid (N=500) at temperatures from 0.90Tm to 3.31Tm, and six potential parameters were calculated for each structure, namely, the potential energy and five principal moments of the vibrational frequency distribution. The results show temperature-independent means and small standard deviations for all potential parameters, consistent with random valley uniformity at N--&gt;infinity, and with finite- N broadening at N=500. The expected error in the single random valley approximation for Na at N=500 and T approximately greater than Tm is 0.1% for the entropy and 0.5% for the internal energy, negligible in the current development of liquid dynamics theory. In related quench studies of recent years, the common finding of nearly temperature-independent means of structural potential energy properties at T approximately greater than Tm suggests that the single random valley approximation might also apply to systems more complicated than the elemental liquids.",

In this work we apply the FH formulation to the study of NeN-coronene clusters (N = 1-4, 14) in the 2-14 K temperature range. Quadratic (FH2) and quartic (FH4) contributions to the effective potentials are built upon Ne-Ne and Ne-coronene analytical potentials. In particular, a new corrected expression for the FH4 effective potential is reported. FH2 and FH4 cluster energies and structures-obtained from energy optimization through a basin-hopping algorithm as well as classical Monte Carlo simulations-are reported and compared with reference path integral Monte Carlo calculations. For temperatures T &gt; 4 K, both FH2 and FH4 potentials are able to correct the purely classical calculations in a consistent way. However, the FH approach fails at lower temperatures, especially the quartic correction. It is thus crucial to assess the range of applicability of this formulation and, in particular, to apply the FH4 potentials with great caution. A simple model of N isotropic harmonic oscillators allows us to propose a means of estimating the cutoff temperature for the validity of the method, which is found to increase with the number of atoms adsorbed on the coronene molecule.

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies. For example, for the XY (n=2) version of the present model, such a behavior was observed only near criticality. It is shown also that the (metastable state) maximum Lyapunov exponent decreases with N like lambda(max) approximately N-kappa, where for the initial conditions employed herein (maximal magnetization), kappa=0.225+/-0.030, both above and below the critical point.",

Reaction probabilities and integral cross sections (ICSs) between a collisional energy of 10(-4) eV and 0.1 eV have been calculated and compared with previously reported results of a time independent quantum mechanical (TIQM) approach. The TIQM results exhibit a dense profile with numerous narrow resonances down to Ec ~ 10(-2) eV and for the case of H2(v = 0, j = 0) a prominent peak is found at ~2.5 × 10(-4) eV. The analysis at the state-to-state level reveals that this feature is originated in those processes which yield the formation of rotationally excited HD(v' = 0, j' &gt; 0). The statistical predictions reproduce reasonably well the overall behaviour of the TIQM ICSs at the larger energy range (Ec ≥ 10(-3) eV). Thermal rate constants are in qualitative agreement for the whole range of temperatures investigated in this work, 10-100 K, although the SQM values remain above the TIQM results for both initial H2 rotational states, j = 0 and 1.

Five mixed quantum/classical methods are tested: one mean-field approach (the coherent switching with decay of mixing method), two surface-hopping methods [the fewest switches with time uncertainty (FSTU) and FSTU with stochastic decay (FSTU/SD) methods], and two surface-hopping methods with zero-point energy (ZPE) maintenance [the FSTUSD+trajectory projection onto ZPE orbit (TRAPZ) and FSTUSD+minimal TRAPZ (mTRAPZ) methods].

Distributions obtained for n(2)=1 present an intermediate behavior between distributions obtained for smaller and larger n(2) values. The dynamics is found to be highly electronically nonadiabatic with all these methods. NH(2) internal energy distributions may have a negative energy tail when the ZPE is not maintained throughout the dynamics. The original TRAPZ method was designed to maintain ZPE in classical trajectories, but we find that it leads to unphysically high internal vibrational energies. The mTRAPZ method, which is new in this work and provides a general method for maintaining ZPE in either single-surface or multisurface trajectories, does not lead to unphysical results and is much less time consuming. The effect of maintaining ZPE in mixed quantum/classical dynamics is discussed in terms of agreement with experimental findings.

The TDQM results show that the reactive threshold drops from 10 kcal/mol for v = 0 to 6 for v = 1, 5 for v = 2 and 4 for v = 3, suggesting a much slower increase in rate constant with vibrational excitation above v = 1 than below. For H2(v &gt; 0), the classical results are larger than the quantum results by a factor approximately 2 near threshold, but the agreement monotonically improves until they are within approximately 10% near 30 kcal/mol collision energy. We believe these differences arise from stronger vibrational adiabaticity in the quantum dynamics, an effect examined before for this system at lower energies. We have also computed QCT OH(v',j') state-resolved cross sections and angular distributions. The QCT state-resolved OH(v') cross sections peak at the same vibrational quantum number as the H2 reagent. The OH rotational distributions are also quite hot and tend to cluster around high rotational quantum numbers. However, the dynamics seem to dictate a cutoff in the energy going into OH rotation indicating an angular momentum constraint. The state-resolved OH distributions were fit to probability functions based on conventional information theory extended to include an energy gap law for product vibrations.",

Three potential energy surfaces (PES) are studied, namely, those of Bradley and Schatz (BS), Yu, Muckerman, and Sears (YMS), and Lakin, Troya, Schatz, and Harding (LTSH). 6-D calculations are performed only for the BS PES, while 5-D results are reported for all three PES'. The 6-D results obtained in the present work improve on those previously reported, since a larger vibrational basis and a better representation of the OH and CO bonds has been introduced. In particular, we now employ a generalized Lanczos-Morse discrete variable representation for both the OH and CO vibrations. In a further improvement, the generalized discrete variable representation of the CO vibration is based on different CO intramolecular potentials for the asymptotic and product grids employed in our projection formalism. This new treatment of the vibrational bases allows for a large reduction in computation time with respect to our previous implementation of the wave packet method, for a given level of accuracy. As a result, we have been able to extend the range of collision energies for which we can obtain converged 6-D results to a higher energy (0.8 eV) than was possible before (0.5 eV). The comparison of the new 6-D and previous 5-D results for the BS PES shows good agreement of the general trend in the reaction probabilities over all collision energies considered (0.1-0.8 eV), while our previous 6-D calculation showed reaction probabilities that differed from the 5-D results by up to 10% between 0.5 and 0.8 eV. The 5-D reaction probabilities reveal interesting trends for the different PES'. In particular, at low energies (&lt; 0.2 eV) the LTSH PES gives rise to much larger reactivity than the other PES', while at high energies (&gt; 0.3 eV) its reaction probability decreases with respect to the BS and YMS PES', being more than a factor of 2 smaller at 0.8 eV. A 5-D calculation on a modified version of the LTSH surface shows that the van der Waals interaction in the entrance channel, which is not correctly described in the other PES' is largely responsible for its larger reactivity at low energies. The large difference between the 5-D reaction probabilities for the YMS and LTSH PES' serves to emphasize the importance of the van der Waals interaction for the reactivity at low energies, because most of the stationary point energies on the YMS and LTSH PES are rather similar, being in line with high-level ab initio information.",

The building blocks of this decomposition are the Helmholtz free energies of the constituents (phase and stationary heterophase clusters) and, for every cluster species, a volume V(k)(cm), which is of the magnitude of the thermal fluctuation volume of the center of mass of the stationary cluster containing k monomers. A definition of V(k)(cm) is given in terms of the configuration integrals of the clusters. V(k)(cm) is evaluated for k &gt;&gt; 1, with the result that V(k)(cm) is proportional to k(-1/2) and is a function of temperature, the specific volume, and the isothermal compressibility of the phase in the cluster.

Usually, the phenomenon of quantum resonance was studied in nondegenerate [G. M. Zaslavsky, Chaos in Dynamic Systems (Harwood Academic, Chur, 1985)] and degenerate [Demikhovskii, Kamenev, and Luna-Acosta, Phys. Rev. E 52, 3351 (1995)] classically chaotic systems only in the particular regions of the classical phase space, such as the center of the resonance or near the separatrix. The system under consideration is degenerate, and even an infinitely small perturbation generates in the classical phase space an infinite number of the resonant cells which are arranged in the pattern with the axial symmetry of the order 2&amp;mgr; (where &amp;mgr; is the resonance number). We show analytically that the Husimi functions of all Floquet states (the quantum phase space) have the same symmetry as the classical phase space. This correspondence is demonstrated numerically for the Husimi functions of the Floquet states corresponding to the motion near the elliptic stable points (centers of the classical resonance cells). The derived results are valid in the resonance approximation when the perturbation amplitude is small enough, and the stochastic layers in the classical phase space are exponentially thin. The developed approach can be used for studying a global symmetry of more complicated quantum systems with chaotic behavior. (c) 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

Molecular-dynamics simulations yield good agreement with these theoretical predictions. Therefore, in this system, the second moment of the wave packet diverges as a function of time despite the wave packet is not spreading. Thus, this only criterion, often considered earlier as proving the spreading of a wave packet, cannot be considered as sufficient in any model. The anharmonic case is investigated numerically. It is found for intermediate disorder that the tail of the energy profile becomes very close to those of the harmonic case. For weak and strong disorders, our results suggest that the crossover to the harmonic behavior occurs at much larger |n-n₀| and larger time.",

The simple case characterized by λ=0, whose Hamiltonian H[over ̂]_{0} is represented by a diagonal matrix, is well established and solvable within Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics; in particular, it follows the third law of thermodynamics, presenting zero entropy (S_{BG}=0) at zero temperature (T=0). Herein it is shown that the introduction of a perturbation λV[over ̂] (λ&gt;0) in the Hamiltonian may lead to a nontrivial ground state, characterized by an entropy S[p] (with S[p]≠S_{BG}[p]), if the Hermitian operator V[over ̂] is represented by a 2×2 matrix, defined by nonzero off-diagonal elements V_{12}=V_{21}=-z, where z is a real positive number. Hence, this new term in the Hamiltonian, presenting V_{12}≠0, may produce physically significant changes in the ground state, and especially, it allows for the introduction of an effective temperature θ (θ∝λz), which is shown to be a parameter conjugated to the entropy S. Based on this, one introduces an infinitesimal heatlike quantity, δQ=θdS, leading to a consistent thermodynamic framework, and by proposing an infinitesimal form for the first law, a Carnot cycle and thermodynamic potentials are obtained.

These calculations show that energies several times K(B)T make the largest contributions to the rate. Several orders of magnitude of cancellation due to phase interference is found in the evaluation of the coupling matrix elements between the initial and final states, and this is one of the main factors leading to the very small value for the relaxation rate. The region near the classical turning point in the relative translational motion of the colliding molecules dominates the calculation of the contribution to the rate at each energy. Calculations using low-order expansions of the translational potential energy and the interstate coupling about this turning point provide good approximations to the exact quantum mechanical rate.

While DC often accounts for &gt;80% of thermodynamic and spectroscopic property changes, the commonly used practice of including only the FD correction in kinetics calculations is rarely found to be adequate. For electron-transfer reactions not in the inverted region, the common physical picture that diabatic processes occur because of surface hopping at the transition state is proven inadequate as the DC acts first to block access, increasing the transition state energy by (ℏω)(2)λ/16J(2) (where λ is the reorganization energy, J the electronic coupling and ω the vibration frequency). However, the rate constant in the weakly-coupled Golden-Rule limit is identified as being only inversely proportional to this change rather than exponentially damped, owing to the effects of tunneling and surface hopping. Such weakly-coupled long-range electron-transfer processes should therefore not be described as \"non-adiabatic\" processes as they are easily described by Born-Huang ground-state adiabatic surfaces made by adding the DC to the BO surfaces; instead, they should be called just \"non-Born-Oppenheimer\" processes.

High-power pulses are necessary to achieve fast (&lt;10 ns) spin rotations in order to alleviate the limited excitation bandwidth and time resolution that typically hamper pulsed EPR at these high frequencies. While at these frequencies, an FEL is the only source that provides ~1 kW of power and can be tuned continuously up to frequencies above 1 THz, it has only recently been implemented for one- and two-pulse EPR, and the capabilities of the FEL as an EPR source are still being expanded. This manuscript presents phase cycling of two pulses in an FEL-EPR spectrometer operating at 240 GHz. Given that the FEL, unlike amplifiers, cannot be easily phase-locked to a reference source, we instead apply retrospective data processing to measure the relative phase of each FEL pulse in order to correct the signal phase accordingly. This allows the measured signal to be averaged coherently, and the randomly changing phase of the FEL pulse results in a stochastic phase cycle, which, in the limit of many pulses, efficiently cancels artifacts and improves sensitivity. Further, the relative phase between the first and second pulse, which originates from the difference in path length traversed by each pulse, can be experimentally measured without phase-sensitive detection. We show that the relative phase of the two pulses can be precisely tuned, as well as distinctly switched by a fixed amount, with the insertion of a dielectric material into the quasi-optical path of one of the pulses. Taken together, these techniques offer many of the advantages of arbitrary phase control, and allow application of phase cycling to dramatically enhance signal quality in pulsed EPR experiments utilizing high-power sources that cannot be phase-locked.",

The cold plasma approximation is adopted, which requires the wavelength to be sufficiently large. The pertinent requirement valid for large amplitude waves is determined. The general nonlinear solution of the continuity and momentum transfer equations for the electron fluid along with Poisson's equation is obtained in simple parametric form. It is shown that in all typical hydrogen plasmas, the influence of plasma resistivity on the modes in question is negligible. Within the limitations of the solution found, the nonlinear time evolution of any (periodic) initial electron number density profile ne(x,t=0) can be determined (examples). For the modes in question, an idealized model of a strictly cold and collisionless plasma is shown to be applicable to any real plasma, provided that the wavelength λ&gt;&gt;λmin(n(0),Te) , where n(0)=const and Te are the equilibrium values of the electron number density and electron temperature. Within this idealized model, the minimum of the initial electron density n(e)(xmin,t=0) must be larger than half its equilibrium value, n(0)/2 . Otherwise, the corresponding maximum n(e)(xmax,t=τ(p)/2) , obtained after half a period of the plasma oscillation blows up.

Here, we use a transmission electron microscope to measure the position-dependent phase shift imparted to a relativistic electron wave function when it traverses a standing laser wave. The kinetic energy of the electrons is varied between 80 and 300 keV, and the laser standing wave has a continuous-wave intensity of 175  GW/cm^{2}. In contrast to the nonrelativistic case, we demonstrate that the phase shift depends on both the electron velocity and the wave polarization, confirming the predictions of a quasiclassical theory of the interaction. Remarkably, if the electron's speed is greater than 1/sqrt[2] of the speed of light, the phase shift at the electric field nodes of the wave can exceed that at the antinodes. In this case there exists a polarization such that the phase shifts at the nodes and antinodes are equal, and the electron does not experience Kapitza-Dirac diffraction.

A variational calculation gives the energy level (i.e., eigenvalue) as the expectation value of the molecular Hamiltonian &lt;phi/H/phi&gt;, where /phi&gt; is the trial wave function. The true (i.e., exact) eigenvalue E can thus be expressed as this variational result plus a correction, i.e., E=&lt;phi/H/phi&gt;+DeltaE, the correction being due to the lack of exactness of the trial wave function. A formally exact expression for DeltaE is usually given (via Löwdin partitioning methodology) in terms of the Greens function of the Hamiltonian projected onto the orthogonal complement of /phi&gt;. Formal treatment of this expression (using Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory to infinite order) leads to an expression for DeltaE that involves matrix elements of the Greens function for the unprojected, i.e., full molecular Hamiltonian, which can then be approximated semiclassically. (Specifically, the Greens function is expressed as the Fourier transform of the quantum mechanical time evolution operator, e(-iHt/variant Planck's over 2pi), which in turn is approximated by using an initial value representation of semiclassical theory.) Calculations for several test problems (a one dimensional quartic potential, and vibrational energy levels of H(2)O and H(2)CO) clearly support our proposition that the error in the total eigenvalue E arises solely due to the semiclassical error in approximating DeltaE, which is usually a small fraction of the total energy E itself.",

The glass-vapor interface was considered as two distinct regions, a wavelength-thickness vapor layer joined to the surface and a more remote vapor region. The first region was analyzed as a spectral filter that annihilates the absorbed photons and the second one as a rich spectral light source. The experimental setup is described. A Rb reference cell (T = 293 K) was used. A part of the laser beam scanned the 5S1/2(F = 3) --&gt; 5P3/2(F' = 2,3,4) transition. The Doppler broadened absorption profile (FWHM = 510 MHz) was determined. The laser detuning of the profile-center relative to the F = 3 --&gt; F' = 4 transition was about 70 MHz. Another laser beam was directed to the entrance cell window. The resonant retrofluorescence S(ob)(upsilon(L)) as a function of laser detuning for a cell temperature approximately 130 degrees C and laser power 0.4 mW was obtained. We can extract the experimental signal sexp(n) (upsilon(L)) originating from the near-field region by subtracting signal S(T) (upsilon(L)) originating from the far-field region from the total experiment signal S(ob)(upsilon(L)). A fit of the normalized profile of the data corresponding to the spectral band centered on the F' = 4 --&gt; F = 3 hyperfine transition line was obtained by using a Lorentzian distribution function with GammaRF = 50 MHz full width at half-maximum. The role played by different relaxation processes contributing to the retrofluorescent atomic linewidth was characterized. The authors summed up the corresponding spectral broadening and obtained the relation GammaRF = Gamman + Gammacoll + Gammanr, where Gammacoll is the resonance collisional broadening of the hyperfine line, and Gammanr is an additional broadening induced by the nonradiative energy-transfer phenomena of the excited atoms near the cell window surface. To evaluate Gammacoll, we used the relation Gammacoll = gammaRb - RbN, where gammaRb - Rb is line broadening parameter, and N is Rb atom number density. The effective nonradiative relaxation rate of the 5P3/2(F' = 4) energy hyperfine level was estimated to be AF(nr) = 4 --&gt; F = 3 = 2.4 x 10(8) s(-1).

To assess the performance of these solutions we compare the predictions for the fluence rate and two metrics of the optical penetration depth with Monte Carlo simulations. We provide results under both refractive-index matched and mismatched conditions for optical properties where the ratio of reduced scattering to absorption lies in the range 0&lt; or =(micro(s')/micro(a))&lt; or =10(4). For planar irradiation, the delta-P(1) approximation provides fluence rate profiles accurate to +/-16% for depths up to six transport mean free paths (l*) over the full range of optical properties. Metrics for optical penetration depth are predicted with an accuracy of +/-4%. For Gaussian irradiation using beam radii r(0) &gt; or =3 l*, the accuracy of the fluence rate predictions is no worse than in the planar irradiation case. For smaller beam radii, the predictions degrade significantly. Specifically for media with (micro(s')/micro(a))=1 irradiated with a beam radius of r(0)=l*, the error in the fluence rate approaches 100%. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the optical penetration depth predictions remains excellent for Gaussian beam irradiation, and degrades to only +/-20% for r(0)=l*.

The results are compared with numerically exact quantum mechanical wave packet propagation and with results of the time-independent WKB method. The wave functions for the metastable states in the region over the well are reproduced very accurately by the SWP; in the classically forbidden region and outside of the centrifugal barrier, the SWP wave functions are qualitatively correct. Prony's method was used to extract energies and lifetimes from the autocorrelation functions.

This occurs both by distortion of the zfs tensor due to intermolecular collisions and, for complexes with less than cubic symmetry, by reorientational modulation of the permanent zfs tensor. The reorientational mechanism is much less well characterized in previous work than the distortional mechanism although it is an important determinant of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) paramagnetic relaxation enhancement phenomena (i.e., the enhancement of NMR relaxation rates produced by paramagnetic ions in solution or NMR-PRE). The classical density matrix theory of spin relaxation does not provide an appropriate description of the reorientational mechanism at low Zeeman field strengths because the zero-order spin wave functions are stochastic functions of time. Using spin dynamics simulation techniques, the time correlation functions of the spin operators have been computed and used to determine decay times for the reorientational relaxation mechanism for S=1. In the zfs limit of laboratory field strengths (H(Zeem)&lt;&lt;H(zfs) (composite function)), when the zfs tensor is cylindrical, the spin decay is exponential, the spin relaxation time, tau(S) (composite function) approximately 0.53tau(R)((1)), where tau(R)((1)) is the reorientational correlation time of a molecule-fixed vector. The value of tau(S) (composite function) is independent of the magnitude of the cylindrical zfs parameter (D), but it depends strongly on low symmetry zfs terms (the E/D ratio). Other spin dynamics (SD) simulations examined spin decay in the intermediate regime of field strengths where H(Zeem) approximately H(zfs) (composite function), and in the vicinity of the Zeeman limit. The results demonstrate that the reorientational electron spin relaxation mechanism is often significant when H(zfs) (composite function)&gt; or =H(Zeem), and that its neglect can lead to serious errors in the interpretation of NMR-PRE data.",

Our initial implementation is based on a multiheaded Shavitt graph approach that allows for the efficient simultaneous computation of entire blocks of Hamiltonian matrix elements. Two algorithms are implemented. The SO-GCF method expands the spin-orbit wave function in the basis of GCFs and results in a Hamiltonian matrix of dimension N(dim)=N(alpha)((S(max) + 1)(2) - S(min)(2)). N(alpha) is the number of sets of nonlinear arc factor parameters, and S(min) and S(max) are respectively the minimum and maximum values of an allowed spin range in the wave function expansion. The SO-SCGCF (SO spin contracted GCF) method expands the wave function in a basis of spin contracted functions and results in a Hamiltonian matrix of dimension N(dim) = N(alpha). For a given N(alpha) and spin range, the number of parameters defining the wave function is the same in the two methods after accounting for normalization. The full Hamiltonian matrix construction with both approaches scales formally as O(N(alpha)(2)omegan(4)) for n molecular orbitals. The omega factor depends on the complexity of the Shavitt graph and includes factors such as the number of electrons, N, and the number of interacting spin states. Timings are given for Hamiltonian matrix construction for both algorithms for a range of wave functions with up to N = n = 128 and that correspond to an underlying linear full-CI CSF expansion dimension of over 10(75) CSFs, many orders of magnitude larger than can be considered using traditional CSF-based spin-orbit CI approaches. For Hamiltonian matrix construction, the SO-SCGCF method is slightly faster than the SO-GCF method for a given N(alpha) and spin range.

Electron spin echo experiments (echo detected ESR, electron spin-lattice relaxation, and spin echo dephasing) were performed in the temperature range of 4.2-50 K. The rigid lattice g factors are g(x) = 2.0016, g(y) = 2.0505, and g(z) = 2.0355, and they are gradually averaged with temperature to the final collapse into a single line with g = 2.028 above 300 K.

The low-lying orbital states of the open form of S(3)(-) molecule having C(2v) symmetry are considered and molecular orbital (MO) theory of the g factors is presented. The orbital mixing coefficients were calculated from experimental g factors and available theoretical orbital splitting. They indicate that the unpaired electron spin density in the ground state is localized mainly (about 50%) on the central sulfur atom of S(3)(-) anion radical, whereas in the excited electronic state the density is localized mainly on the lateral sulfur atoms (90%). A strong broadening of the ESR lines in directions around the twofold symmetry axis of the radical S(3)(-) molecule (z-axis) is discovered below 10 K. It is due to a distribution of the S-S-S bond angle value influencing mainly the energy of the (2)B(2)-symmetry MO. This effect is smeared out by molecular dynamics at higher temperatures. A distribution of the g factors is confirmed by the recovery of the spin system magnetization during spin-lattice relaxation measurements, which is described by a stretched exponential function. Both the spin-lattice relaxation and electron spin echo dephasing are governed by localized phonon mode of energy of about 40 cm(-1). Thus, the anion-radical S(3)(-) molecules are weakly bonded to the zeolite framework, and they do not participate in the phonon motion of the host lattice because of their own local dynamics.",

Slice images were measured of the three-dimensional recoil distribution of the S((1)D(2)) photofragment for different polarization geometries of the photolysis and probe laser.

The angular distribution of the S((1)D(2)) velocity rings are extracted and analyzed using two different polarization models. The first model assumes the nonaxial dynamics evolves after excitation to a single potential energy surface of an oriented OCS(v(2) = 1|JlM = 111) molecule.

Med. 38, 1923-1929 (1997)], the authors presented a dosimetry system which combines the computational ease of the MIRD schema with additional information provided by microdosimetry for use with alpha-particle emitters. In addition to the absorbed dose (average specific energy) to the targets (cell nuclei), this system gives the spread (standard deviation) in values of this specific energy received by individual targets. It also gives the fraction of targets receiving zero (or any number of) hits. In this paper, input quantities are presented for alpha-particle energies and cell and nuclear sizes appropriate for the radionuclides being investigated. The quantities include S values for the usual determination of the absorbed dose along with the microdosimetric quantities, &lt;z1&gt; and &lt;(z1)2&gt;, the average and average square, respectively, of the single-hit specific energy. Using analytical procedures described previously [Med. Phys. 19, 1385-1393 (1992)], the single-hit distributions of specific energy are determined for the given alpha-particle energies, source locations, and target sizes. From these distributions, the values for the input quantities are calculated. Sources considered are (1) those located inside and on the surface of the target cell and an unbounded source in the medium external to the cell; (2) those distributed uniformly on either side of a plane boundary or on the surface of the plane with a spherical target at various distances from the plane; and (3) those located either inside or on the surface of a spherical boundary centered externally to the target. Examples show how the input quantities are used to provide the spread in specific-energy values and the probability of any number of hits for nuclei of cells exposed to these sources. Thus a complete micro-dosimetric analysis involving the calculation of multi-hit specific energy distributions is not necessary to provide this information. Such information may be useful in interpreting the biological response due to alpha-particle emitters.",

Gauge-invariant (including) atomic orbitals (GIAOs) are used to ensure origin-independent [alpha](D) values. Using large basis sets which include diffuse functions DFT [alpha](D) values are in good agreement with experimental values (175.8 degrees and 139.2 degrees for (1S,5R)-1 and -2, respectively); errors are in the range 25-35 degrees. HF/SCF [alpha](D) values, in contrast, are much less accurate; errors are in the range 75-95 degrees. The use of small basis sets which do not include diffuse functions substantially lowers the accuracy of predicted [alpha](D) values, as does the use of the static limit approximation: beta(nu) approximately beta(o). The use of magnetic-field-independent atomic orbitals, FIAOs, instead of GIAOs, leads to origin-dependent, and therefore nonphysical, [alpha](D) values. We also report DFT calculations of [alpha](D) for the 1-phenyl derivative of 1, 3. DFT calculations find two stable conformations, differing in the orientation of the phenyl group, of very similar energy, and separated by low barriers. Values of [alpha](D) predicted using two different algorithms for averaging over phenyl group orientations are in good agreement with experiment. In principle, the absolute configuration (AC) of a chiral molecule can be assigned by comparison of the optical rotation predicted ab initio to the experimental value. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of the choice of ab initio methodology in obtaining reliable optical rotations and, hence, ACs, and show that, at the present time, DFT constitutes the method of choice.",

In the sigma system alpha spin electrons flow from N to the halogen while beta spin electrons flow in the opposite direction and interestingly from both the sigma and the pi systems of the halogen to the sigma system of N. In NF the number of beta spins lost by F is essentially equal to the number of alpha spins gained and the atomic charges are essentially 0. The small dipole in NF is the result of a slight imbalance in the induced atomic dipoles. For NCl and NBr the halogen loses more beta spins than it gains alpha spins resulting in the polarity N(-)X(+). It is interesting that at equilibrium N gained electrons in the pi system while the halogen lost pi electrons relative to the separated atoms. This however is not back donation in the usual sense because the electrons gained by N have alpha spin while those lost by the halogen have beta spin. Detailed examination of the spin flow shows that the excess alpha electrons in the pi system of N come from an intra-atomic transfer from the N sigma system.

Chem. Chem. Phys. 2011, 13, 8392) reported the surprising result that four simple parametrized S matrices can reproduce the forward-angle glory scattering of the H + D(2)(v(i)=0,j(i)=0) → HD(v(f)=3,j(f)=0) + D reaction, whose differential cross section (DCS) had been computed in a state-of-the-art scattering calculation for a state-of-the-art potential energy surface. Here, v and j are vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively, and the translational energy is 1.81 eV. This paper asks the question: Can we replace the analytic functions (of class C(ω)) used by Shan-Connor with simpler mathematical functions and still reproduce the forward-angle glory scattering? We first construct S matrix elements (of class C(0)) using a quadratic phase and a piecewise-continuous pre-exponential factor consisting of three pieces. Two of the pieces are constants, with one taking the value N (a real normalization constant) at small values of the total angular momentum number, J; the other piece has the value 0 at large J. These two pieces are joined at intermediate values of J by either a straight line, giving rise to the linear parametrization (denoted param L), or a quadratic curve, which defines the quadratic parametrization (param Q). We find that both param L and param Q can reproduce the glory scattering for center-of-mass reactive scattering angles, θ(R) ≲ 30°. Second, we use a piecewise-discontinuous pre-exponential factor and a quadratic phase, giving rise to a step-function parametrization (param SF) and a top-hat parametrization (param TH). We find that both param SF and param TH can reproduce the forward-angle scattering, even though these class C(-1) parametrizations are usually considered too simplistic to be useful for calculations of DCSs. We find that an ultrasimplistic param THz, which is param TH with a phase of zero, can also reproduce the glory scattering at forward angles. The S matrix elements for param THz are real and consist of five nonzero equal values, given by S(J) = 0.02266, for the window, J = 21(1)25. Param THz is sufficiently simple that we can derive closed forms for the partial wave scattering amplitude, f(θ(R)), and the near-side (N) and far-side (F) subamplitudes. We show that window representations of f(θ(R)) provide important insights into the range of J values that contribute to the reaction dynamics. Other theoretical techniques used are NF theory for the analysis of DCSs and full and NF local angular momentum theory, in both cases including up to three resummations of f(θ(R)) before making the NF decomposition. Finally, we investigate the accuracy of various semiclassical glory theories for the DCS of param L. By varying one phase parameter for param L, we show that the uniform semiclassical approximation is accurate from θ(R) = 0° to close to θ(R) = 180°. Our approach is an example of a \"weak\" form of Heisenberg's S matrix program, which does not use a potential energy surface(s); rather it focuses on the properties of the S matrix. Our method is easy to apply to DCSs from experimental measurements or from computer simulations.",

Applications to S = (1)/(2) and S = (5)/(2).\nThe magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) properties of a spin-allowed transition from an orbitally nondegenerate ground state manifold A to an orbitally nondegenerate excited state manifold J in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are derived for any S &gt;/= (1)/(2). Three physically distinct mechanisms are identified that lead to MCD intensity and depend on SOC between excited states which leads to a sum rule and SOC between the ground state and other excited states that leads to deviations from the sum rule. The model is valid for any symmetry of the magnetic coupling tensors and arbitrary transition polarizations. The S = (1)/(2) case is analytically solved, and the determination of linear polarizations from MCD saturation magnetization data is discussed. For all mechanisms the MCD intensity is proportional to the spin-expectation values of the ground state sublevels which are conveniently generated from a spin-Hamiltonian (SH). For Kramers systems with large zero-field splittings (ZFSs) this allows the contribution from each Kramers doublet to the total MCD intensity to be related through their effective g-values, therefore significantly reducing the number of parameters required to analyze experimental data. The behavior of high-spin systems is discussed in the limits of weak, intermediate, and strong ZFS relative to the Zeeman energy. The model remains valid in the important case of intermediate ZFS where the ground state sublevels may cross as a function of applied magnetic field and there are significant off-axis contributions to the MCD intensity due to a change of the electron spin quantization axis. The model permits calculation of MCD C-term signs from molecular wave functions, and explicit expressions are derived in terms of MOs for S = (1)/(2) and S = (5)/(2). Two examples from the literature are analyzed to demonstrate how the C-term signs can be evaluated by a graphical method that gives insight into their physical origin.",

The spin (AM) density is also a vector in the field of three dimensions (3D), since its orientation can be in any direction. In this Letter, we show that through focusing a Gaussian beam with both on-axis and off-axis vortices in a high-numerical-aperture system, the spin (AM) density vector in the focal region exhibits nontrivial behaviors: rotating around the central axis along the propagation direction. We demonstrate that this helical behavior of the spin (AM) density vector is mainly caused by the different Gouy phases of the three field components. By changing the position of the off-axis vortex and the semiaperture angle, the helical shape and the helical length can be adjusted. This is a new type of optical twist, to the best of our knowledge, and it may supply another rotational degree of freedom in optical tweezers.",

Each 2(l) pole is defined by a rank-l irreducible tensor with (2l+1) components P(m)((l)) proportional to the solid spherical harmonic r(l)Y(m)(l)(theta,phi). Here we focus our attention on 2(l) poles with l=2,3,4 (quadrupole Theta, octopole Omega, and hexadecapole Phi). An important conclusion of this study is that n can be 1 or 2 depending on both the multipole rank l and state quantum number Lambda. For Sigma(+/-)(Lambda=0) states, all 2(l) poles have one independent parameter (n=1). For spatially degenerate states--Pi, Delta, and Phi (Lambda=1,2,3)--the general rule reads n=1 for l&lt;2/Lambda/ (when the 2(l)-pole rank lies below 2/Lambda/ but n=2 for higher 2(l) poles with l&gt;or=2/Lambda/. The second nonzero term is the off-diagonal matrix element [formula: see text]. Thus, a Pi(Lambda=1) state has one dipole (mu(z)) but two independent 2(l) poles for l&gt;or=2--starting with the quadrupole [Theta(zz),(Theta(xx)-Theta(yy))]. A Delta(Lambda=2) state has n=1 for 2((1,2,3)) poles (mu(z),Theta(zz),Omega(zzz)) but n=2 for higher 2((l&gt;or=4)) poles--from the hexadecapole Phi up. For Phi(Lambda=3) states, it holds that n=1 for 2(1) to 2(5) poles but n=2 for all 2((l&gt;or=6)) poles. In short, what is usually stated in the literature--that n=1 for all possible 2(l) poles of linear molecules--only applies to Sigma(+/-) states. For degenerate states with n=2, all Cartesian 2(l)-pole components (l&gt;or=2/Lambda/) can be expressed as linear combinations of two irreducible multipoles, P(m=0)((l)) and P/m/=2 Lambda)((l)) [parallel (z axis) and anisotropy (xy plane)].

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface.

This applies for VIF pictures as one-electron Hamiltonian operators as well as VIF pictures as one-electron density operators that constitute a new implementation of the VIF method simpler in its application and more accurate in its results than previous approaches. A procedure for estimating elements of the effective charge density-bond order matrix, Pmunu, from electron configurations in atoms is presented, and it is shown how these lead to loop and line constants in the VIF picture. From these structural formulas, one finds the number of singly, doubly, and unoccupied molecular orbitals, as well as the number of molecular orbitals with energy lower, equal, and higher than -1/2Eh, the negative of the hydrogen atom's ionization energy. The VIF results for water are in qualitative agreement with MP2/6311++G3df3pd, MO energy levels where the simple VIF for water presented in the earlier literature does not agree with computed energy levels. The method presented here gives the simplest accurate VIF pictures for hydrocarbons. It is shown how VIF can be used to predict thermal barriers to chemical reactions. Insertion of singlet carbene into H2 is given as an example. VIF pictures as one-electron density operators describe the ground-state multiplicities of B2, N2, and O2 molecules and as one-electron Hamiltonian operators give the correct electronegativity trend across period two. Previous implementations of VIF do not indicate singly occupied molecular orbitals directly from the pictorial VIF rules for these examples. The direct comparison between structural formulas that represent electron density and those that represent energy is supported by comparison of a simple electronegativity scale, chiD=N/n2, with well-known electronegativity scales of Pauling, Mulliken, and Allen. This scale comes from the method used to calculate Pmumu for sp3 hybridized period-two elements and is comparable to electronegativity because it has the same form as &lt;1/r&gt; for hydrogenic orbitals. It therefore provides a physical basis for the representation of one electron density and Hamiltonian operators by the same VIF picture.",

The iterative Franck-Condon analysis (IFCA) procedure was carried out to determine the equilibrium geometrical parameters of the A(1)A'' state of HGeCl by matching the simulated, and available experimental SVL emission spectra of HGeCl and DGeCl of Tackett et al., J Chem Phys 2006, 124, 124320, using the available, estimated experimental equilibrium (r(e)(z)) structure for the X(1)A' state, while varying the equilibrium geometrical parameters of the A(1)A'' state systematically. Employing the derived IFCA geometry of r(e)(HGe) = 1.590 A, r(e)(GeCl) = 2.155 A and theta(e)(HGeCl) = 112.7 degrees for the A(1)A'' state of HGeCl in the spectral simulation, the simulated absorption and SVL emission spectra of HGeCl and DGeCl agree very well with the available experimental LIF and SVL emission spectra, respectively.",

In the present paper we calculate a new ab initio potential energy surface for the X3B1 state, and we calculate ab initio the potential energy surfaces of the a1A1 and b1B1 excited singlet electronic states (which become degenerate as a 1Delta state at linearity). We use the multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI) level of theory with molecular orbital bases that are optimized separately for each state by complete-active-space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. For the X state we use the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program to obtain the rotation-vibration energies. For the a and b excited singlet electronic states we calculate the rovibronic energy levels using the RENNER Hamiltonian and computer program. We also calculate ab initio the dipole moment surfaces for the X, a, and b electronic states, and the out-of-plane transition moment surface for the b &lt;-- a electronic transition. We use this information to simulate absorption spectra within X3B1 and a1A1 state and of the b1B1 &lt;-- a1A1 transition in order to aid in the search for them. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

In contrast, the other two states, i.e. the 2(2)A' and 1(4)A' states, are energetically not favourable to the reaction as the first state has a potential barrier of 0.2 eV in the entrance channel and the former one presents long range potential wells and repulsive wall for carbon approaches near OH. The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one. Nevertheless, a decreasing behaviour with the temperature remains between 10 and 500 K if we consider the total rate constant of C((3)P) + OH(X(2)Pi), sum of the three reactive states rate constants.",

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists.

In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects.

Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

Additional methodological and computational details of the implementation, which uses an iterative Jacobi-Davidson diagonalization algorithm to properly address the inherent \"hard-core\" He-He interaction problem, are described here. The convergence of total energies, average pair He-He interaction energies, and relevant one- and two-body properties upon increasing the angular part of the one-particle basis set (expanded in spherical harmonics) has been analyzed, considering Cl(2) as the dopant and a semiempirical model (T-shaped) He-Cl(2)(B) potential. Converged results are used to analyze global energetic and structural aspects as well as the configuration makeup of the wave functions, associated with the ground and low-lying \"solvent\" excited states. Our study reveals that besides the fermionic nature of (3)He atoms, key roles in determining total binding energies and wave-function structures are played by the strong repulsive core of the He-He potential as well as its very weak attractive region, the most stable arrangement somehow departing from the one of N He atoms equally spaced on equatorial \"ring\" around the dopant. The present results for N = 4 fermions indicates the structural \"pairing\" of two (3)He atoms at opposite sides on a broad \"belt\" around the dopant, executing a sort of asymmetric umbrella motion. This pairing is a compromise between maximizing the (3)He-(3)He and the He-dopant attractions, and suppressing at the same time the \"hard-core\" repulsion. Although the He-He attractive interaction is rather weak, its contribution to the total energy is found to scale as a power of three and it thus increasingly affects the pair density distributions as the cluster grows in size.",

Lett. 248, 409), which was determined by fits to vibrational term values alone and was claimed to be more accurate than other published spectroscopically determined potentials for this system, actually gives unacceptably poor results for rotationally excited water. Reasons for this failure are discussed and the dangers of relying on vibrational term values alone are emphasized. Previous spectroscopic potentials for ground state NO2 are all found to have problems with unphysical minima (\"holes\"). Starting from the potential energy surface for the ground (&amp;Xtilde;2A1) electronic state of NO2 constructed by S. A. Tashkun and P. Jensen (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 173) using the approximate MORBID approach a suitable starting point for fits using an exact kinetic energy operator approach was constructed. Least-squares fits to 17 potential parameters gives a potential which reproduces 173 vibrational term values with a standard deviation of only 2.8 cm-1 in the low-energy region (&lt;10 000 cm-1). For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state. We were unable to fit these levels. Tests show that the resulting effective potential surface has no problems with unphysical holes and gives a reasonable representation of the rotational structure of the low-lying vibrational states of NO2.

With configuration interaction active spaces covering also the σ- in addition to the π-electrons, OM2/MRCI excitation energies turn out to become smaller by at most 0.35 eV for the ionic and 0.15 eV for the covalent excitations. The particle-hole (ph) symmetry, which in Pariser-Parr-Pople models arises from the zero-differential overlap approximation, is demonstrated to be only weakly broken in OM2 such that the oscillator strengths of the covalent 1B(u)(-) states, which artificially vanish in ph-symmetric models, are predicted to be very small. According to OM2/MRCI and experimental data the 1B(u)(-) state is the third excited singlet state for N &lt; 12 and becomes the second for N ≥ 14.

Besides, the reaction probabilities are quite large [0.78-0.98 (1(2)A'') and 0.78-0.93 (1(2)A')], and the decreasing trend of both cross-sections as Ecol increases arises from the barrierless character of both PESs.

In all cases, the cation-water molecules, E(exch-rep(three-body)), has been found to be the dominant contribution to many-body exchange-repulsion effects, higher order terms being negligible. As the physical basis of this effect is discussed, a three-center exponential term was introduced in the SIBFA (Sum of Interactions Between Fragments Ab initio computed) polarizable molecular mechanics procedure to model such effects. The three-body correction is added to the two-center (two-body) overlap-like formulation of the short-range repulsion contribution, E(rep), which is grounded on simplified integrals obtained from localized molecular orbital theory. The present term is computed on using mostly precomputed two-body terms and, therefore, does not increase significantly the computational cost of the method. It was shown to match closely E(three-body) in a series of test cases bearing on the complexes of Ca(2+), Zn(2+), and Hg(2+). For example, its introduction enabled to restore the correct tetrahedral versus square planar preference found from quantum chemistry calculations on the tetrahydrate of Hg(2+) and [Hg(H(2)O)(4)](2+).",

All available spectroscopic data then provide the basis for generating an accurately determined vibrationally complete semiempirical intermolecular potential function using a four-dimensional potential coordinate morphing methodology. These results are consistent with the existence of four bound isomers: OC-HI, OC-IH, CO-HI, and CO-IH. Analysis also leads to unequivocal characterization of the common isotopic ground state as having the OC-HI structure and with the first excited state having the OC-IH structure with an energy of 3.4683(80) cm(-1) above the ground state. The potential is consistent with the following barriers between the pairs of isomers: 382(4) cm(-1) (OC-IH/OC-HI), 294(5) cm(-1) (CO-IH/CO-HI), 324(3) cm(-1) (OC-IH/CO-IH), and 301(2) cm(-1) (OC-HI/CO-HI) defined with respect to each lower minimum. The potential is also determined to have a linear OC-IH van der Waals global equilibrium minimum structure having R(e)=4.180(11) Å, θ(1)=0.00(1)°, and θ(2)=0.00(1)°. This is differentiated from its OC-HI ground state hydrogen bound structure having R(0)=4.895(1) Å, θ(1)=20.48(1)°, and θ(2)=155.213(1)° where the distances are defined between the centers of mass of the monomers and θ(1) and θ(2) as cos(-1)[&lt;cos(2) θ(i)&gt;(1/2)] for i=1 and 2. A fundamentally new molecular phenomenon - ground state isotopic isomerization is proposed based on the generated semiempirical potential. The protonated ground state hydrogen-bonded OC-HI structure is predicted to be converted on deuteration to the corresponding ground state van der Waals OC-ID isomeric structure. This results in a large anomalous isotope effect in which the R(0) center of mass distance between monomeric components changes from 4.895(1) to 4.286(1) Å. Such a proposed isotopic effect is demonstrated to be a consequence of differential zero point energy factors resulting from the shallower nature of hydrogen bonding at a local potential minimum (greater quartic character of the potential) relative to the corresponding van der Waals global minimum. Further consequences of this anomalous deuterium isotope effect are also discussed.",

Finally, the surface also exhibits two conical intersection seams that are energetically accessible at low collision energies.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects.

The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

However, semiempirical molecular orbital models still are of limited accuracy and need to be improved if the full potential of new linear scaling techniques, such as MOZYME and LocalSCF, is to be realized. Accordingly, in this article we present RM1 (Recife Model 1): a reparameterization of AM1. As before, the properties used in the parameterization procedure were: heats of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials and geometric variables (bond lengths and angles). Considering that the vast majority of molecules of importance to life can be assembled by using only six elements: C, H, N, O, P, and S, and that by adding the halogens we can now build most molecules of importance to pharmaceutical research, our training set consisted of 1736 molecules, representative of organic and biochemistry, containing C, H, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I atoms. Unlike AM1, and similar to PM3, all RM1 parameters have been optimized. For enthalpies of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials, and interatomic distances, the average errors in RM1, for the 1736 molecules, are less than those for AM1, PM3, and PM5. Indeed, the average errors in kcal x mol(-1) of the enthalpies of formation for AM1, PM3, and PM5 are 11.15, 7.98, and 6.03, whereas for RM1 this value is 5.77. The errors, in Debye, of the dipole moments for AM1, PM3, PM5, and RM1 are, respectively, 0.37, 0.38, 0.50, and 0.34. Likewise, the respective errors for the ionization potentials, in eV, are 0.60, 0.55, 0.48, and 0.45, and the respective errors, in angstroms, for the interatomic distances are 0.036, 0.029, 0.037, and 0.027. The RM1 average error in bond angles of 6.82 degrees is only slightly higher than the AM1 figure of 5.88 degrees, and both are much smaller than the PM3 and PM5 figures of 6.98 degrees and 9.83 degrees, respectively. Moreover, a known error in PM3 nitrogen charges is corrected in RM1. Therefore, RM1 represents an improvement over AM1 and its similar successor PM3, and is probably very competitive with PM5, which is a somewhat different model, and not fully disclosed. RM1 possesses the same analytical construct and the same number of parameters for each atom as AM1, and, therefore, can be easily implemented in any software that already has AM1, not requiring any change in any line of code, with the sole exception of the values of the parameters themselves.",

The potential-energy hypersurfaces show two types of minima: (1) collinear with the dihalogen bond and (2) in a bridging position. The former represent the most stable minima for these systems, and their binding energies decrease in the order Br &gt; Cl &gt; F. Isotropic atom-atom potentials cannot reproduce this binding pattern. Of the other levels of theory, CCSD(T)(fc)/aug-cc-pVTZ reproduces the reference data very well, as does MP2(fc)/aug-cc-pVDZ, which performs better than MP2 with the larger basis sets (aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pvTZ). B3LYP-D3 and M06-2X reproduce the binding patterns moderately well despite the former using an isotropic dispersion potential correction. B3LYP-D3(bj) performs even better. The success of the B3LYP-D3 methods is because polar flattening of the halogens allows the argon atom to approach more closely in the direction collinear with the bond, so that the sum of dispersion potential and repulsion is still negative at shorter distances than normally possible and the minimum is deeper at the van der Waals distance. Core polarization functions in the basis set and including the core orbitals in the CCSD(T)(full) calculations lead to a uniform decrease of approximately 20% in the magnitudes of the calculated interaction energies. The EXXRPA+@EXX (exact exchange random phase approximation) orbital-dependent density functional also gives interaction energies that correlate well with the highest level of theory but are approximately 10% low. The newly developed EXXRPA+@dRPA functional represents a systematic improvement on EXXRPA+@EXX. ",

Performance of multireference methods is examined in calculations of the fully spin-polarized S=5((11) summation operator(+) (u)) state against the recent accurate single-reference coupled cluster CCSD(T) results [A. A. Buchachenko, Chem. Phys. Lett. 459, 73 (2008)]. The detailed comparison reveals a serious disagreement between the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) and related nonperturbative results on the one hand and the complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT) calculations on the other. A striking difference found in the CASPT results of the second and third orders indicates poor perturbation expansion convergence. It is shown that a similar problem has affected most of the previous calculations performed using CASPT2 and similar perturbative approximations. The composition of the active space in the reference multiconfigurational self-consistent field calculations, the core correlation contribution, and basis set saturation effects are also analyzed. The lower spin states, S=0-4, are investigated using the MRCI method. The results indicate a similar dispersion binding for all the spin states within the manifold related to the closed 4s shells, which appears to screen and suppress the spin coupling between the half-filled 3d atomic shells. On this premise, the full set of model potentials is built by combining the accurate reference CCSD(T) interaction potential for S=5 and the MRCI spin-exchange energies for the S&lt;5 states. This approach leads to the value of 550 cm(-1) as a lower bound for the (1) summation (+) (g) ground-state dissociation energy. The spin-exchange energies themselves are found to comply with the simple Heisenberg model. The effective spin-coupling parameter J is estimated as -3.9 cm(-1), a value roughly 2.5 times smaller in magnitude than those measured in the inert gas cryogenic matrices. Compressing of the Mn(2) dimer in the matrix cage is suggested as the prime cause of this disagreement.",

Our best estimation is DeltaH(o)(f,298) (HOBr) = -15.3 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol and is very likely to lie toward the more negative values. The present value is 1.4 kcal/mol lower than the widely used experimental determination of Ruscic and Berkowitz (J. Chem. Phys. 1994, 101, 7795), DeltaH(o)(f,298)(HOBr) &gt; -13.93 +/- 0.42 kcal/mol.

Geometrical parameters, vibrational frequencies, atomic charge distributions, orbital occupancies, and bonding enthalpies are reported. The M(n)(+)-O distances are shorter in the hydroxides than in the corresponding hydrates (published previously as Part 1, Inorg. Chem. 1998, 37, 4421-4431) due to a greater electrostatic interaction in the hydroxides. The natural bond orbitals for most of the first-row transition metal ion hydroxides do not contain a formal metal-oxygen bonding orbital; nevertheless the atomic charge distributions show that for both n = 1 and 2 a significant amount of electron density is consistently transferred from the hydroxide ion to the bound metal ion. Deprotonation enthalpies for the hydrates have been evaluated according to the simple dissociation process, M(n)(+)[OH(2)] --&gt; M(n)(+)[OH(-)] + H(+), and also via proton transfer to another water molecule, M(n)(+)[OH(2)] + H(2)O --&gt; M(n)(+)[OH(-)] + H(3)O(+).

Proton transfer to bases other than water, for example side chain groups of certain amino acids, could more than offset the decrease in deprotonation energy due to the filling of the first coordination shell. Linear relationships have been found between the pK(a) values for ionization of the Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+), Fe(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), and Zn(2+) aquo ions, and Delta for the bonding of the first water molecule, for the bonding of the hydroxide ion, and for proton dissociation from the monohydrate. Similar relationships have also been found between the pK(a) values and the reciprocal of the M-O bond lengths in both the monohydrates and hydroxides. Thus the ionization of metal hydrates in water echoes the properties of the monomeric species M(n)(+)[OH(2)].",

Extrapolation to the one-particle basis set limit was performed and core correlation and scalar relativistic contributions were included directly, while the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction was added. Our best purely ab initio PES, denoted \"mixed,\" is constructed from two PESs which differ in whether the ic-ACPF higher-order correlation correction was added or not. Rovibrational transition energies computed from the mixed PES agree well with experiment and the best previous theoretical studies, but most importantly the quality does not deteriorate even up to 10 300 cm(-1) above the zero-point energy (ZPE). The mixed PES was improved further by empirical refinement using the most reliable J=0-2 rovibrational transitions in the HITRAN 2004 database. Agreement between high-resolution experiment and rovibrational transition energies computed from our refined PES for J=0-6 is excellent. Indeed, the root mean square (rms) error for 13 HITRAN 2004 bands for J=0-2 is 0.023 cm(-1) and that for each band is always &lt;or=0.06 cm(-1). For J=3-5 the rms error is always &lt;or=0.15 cm(-1). This agreement means that transition energies computed with our refined PES should be useful in the assignment of new high-resolution NH(3) spectra and in correcting mistakes in previous assignments. Ideas for further improvements to our refined PES and for extension to other isotopolog are discussed.",

The surfaces are spline-based fits of approximately 20,000 fixed geometry ab initio calculations at the complete-active-space self-consistent field+second-order perturbation theory (CASSCF+MP2) level with a O(4s3p2d1f)/H(3s2p) one electron basis set. Computed rate constants compare well to measurements in the 1000-2500 K range using these surfaces. We also compute the total, rovibrationally resolved, and differential angular cross sections at fixed collision velocities from near threshold at approximately 4 km s(-1) (16.9 kcal mol(-1) collision energy) to 11 km s(-1) (122.5 kcal mol(-1) collision energy), and we compare these computed cross sections to available space-based and laboratory data. A major finding of the present work is that above approximately 40 kcal mol(-1) collision energy rovibrationally excited OH(X2pi) products are a significant and perhaps dominant contributor to the observed 1-5 micro spectral emission from O(3P)+H2O(X1A1) collisions. Another important result is that OH(X2pi) products are formed in two distinct rovibrational distributions. The \"active\" OH products are formed with the reagent O atom, and their rovibrational distributions are extremely hot. The remaining \"spectator\" OH is relatively rovibrationally cold. For the active OH, rotational energy is dominant at all collision velocities, but the opposite holds for the spectator OH. Summed over both OH products, below approximately 50 kcal mol(-1) collision energy, vibration dominates the OH internal energy, and above approximately 50 kcal mol(-1) rotation is greater than vibrational energy. As the collision energy increases, energy is diverted from vibration to mostly translational energy. We note that the present fitted surfaces can also be used to investigate direct collisional excitation of H2O(X1A1) by O(3P) and also OH(X2pi)+OH(X2pi) collisions.",

Accurate simulations are presented which include anisotropy of the g and (four) (55)Mn hyperfine tensors, chosen according to a database of (55)Mn(III) and (55)Mn(IV) hyperfine tensors obtained previously using unbiased least-squares spectral fitting routines. In view of the large (30%) anisotropy common to Mn(III) hyperfine tensors in all complexes, previous MLS simulations which have assumed isotropic hyperfine constants have required physically unrealistic parameters. A simple model is found which offers good simulations of both the native \"19-21-line\" MLS and the \"26-line\" NH(3)-bound form of the MLS. Both a dimer-of-dimers and distorted-trigonal magnetic models are examined to describe the symmetry of the Heisenberg exchange interactions within the Mn(4) cluster and thus define the initial electronic basis states of the cluster. The effect of rhombic symmetry distortions is explicitly considered. Both magnetic models correspond to one of several possible structural models for the Mn(4) cluster proposed independently from Mn EXAFS studies. Simulated MLS were constructed for each of the eight (or seven) doublet states of the Mn(4) cluster in the WOC for the two viable oxidation models (3Mn(III)-1Mn(IV) or 3Mn(IV)-1Mn(III)), and using a wide range of axial Mn hyperfine tensors, with either coaxial or orthogonal tensor alignments. We find accurate simulations using the 3Mn(III)-1Mn(IV) oxidation model. In the dimer-of-dimers coupling model, the spin state conversion between two doublet states |S(12),S(34),S(T)|(7)/(2),4,(1)/(2)&gt; and |(7)/(2),3,(1)/(2)&gt; is found to explain the large (25%) contraction in the hyperfine splitting observed upon conversion from the native MLS to the NH(3)-bound MLS. Stabilization of this excited state as the new ground state is caused by change in the intermanganese exchange coupling, without appreciable change in the intrinsic hyperfine tensors. The lack of good simulations of the Ca(2+)-depleted MLS suggests that Ca(2+)-depletion changes both Mn ligation and intermanganese exchange coupling. The 3Mn(IV)-1Mn(III) oxidation model is disfavored because only approximate simulations could be found for the native MLS and no agreement with the NH(3)-bound MLS was obtained. The scalar part of the hyperfine tensors for both Mn(III) and Mn(IV) ions were found to approximate (+/-5%) the values for the dimanganese(III,IV) catalase enzyme, suggesting similar overall ligand types. However, the large (30%) anisotropic part of the Mn(III) hyperfine interaction is opposite in sign to that found in all tetragonally extended six-coordinate Mn(III) ions (i.e., the usual Jahn-Teller splitting). The distribution of spin density from the high-spin d(4) electron configuration of each Mn(III) ion corresponds to a flattened (oblate) ellipsoid. This electronic distribution is favored in five-coordinate ligand fields having trigonally compressed bipyramidal geometry, but it could also arise, in principle, in strained six-coordinate ligand fields having tetragonally compressed geometry, i.e. [Mn(2)(&amp;mgr;-O)](4+) (reverse Jahn-Teller distortion). The resulting valence electronic configurations are described as e'(2)e\"(2) and (d(pi))(3)(d(x)()()2(-)(y)()()2)(1), respectively, in contrast to the (d(pi))(3)(d(z)()()2)(1) configuration common to unstrained six-coordinate tetragonally-extended Mn(III) ions, such as found in the [Mn(2)(&amp;mgr;-O)(2)](3+) core in several synthetic dimers and catalase. Both of the former geometries predict strongly oxidizing Mn(III) ions, thereby suggesting a structural basis for the oxidative reactivity of the Mn(4) cluster in the WOC. The magnetic model needed to explain the MLS is not readily reconciled with the simplest structural and electronic models deduced from EXAFS studies of the WOC.",

A 103, 042809 (2021)PLRAAN2469-992610.1103/PhysRevA.103.042809] have performed the first complete calculation of the Lamb shift of the helium 2 ^{3}S_{1} and 2 ^{3}P_{J} triplet states up to the term in α^{7}m.

The fitting to all 1111 input data (involving rotation-vibrational states with J &lt;/= 10) had a standard deviation of 0.18 cm-1 and was obtained by varying 14 parameters. With the new potential energy function, the rotation-vibration energies of H2130Te have been calculated with the MORBID program. In particular, we have calculated the rotational energy manifolds for J &lt;/= 40 in the lowest vibrational states. Compared to previous potential energy functions for H2Te, the new function has substantially improved the reproduction of the rotational spacings in the excited vibrational states. An important aim of the present work is the further characterization of the anomalous \"fourfold cluster effect\" (i.e., the formation of four-member groups of nearly degenerate rotation-vibration energies at high rotational excitation) exhibited by the energy levels of H2Te. Comparison of our theoretical results with the experimental results of J.-M. Flaud, M. Betrencourt, P. Arcas, H. Burger, O. Polanz, and W. J. Lafferty (1997, J. Mol.

In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported.

Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

Reaction probabilities and integral cross sections (ICSs) between a collisional energy of 10(-4) eV and 0.1 eV have been calculated and compared with previously reported results of a time independent quantum mechanical (TIQM) approach. The TIQM results exhibit a dense profile with numerous narrow resonances down to Ec ~ 10(-2) eV and for the case of H2(v = 0, j = 0) a prominent peak is found at ~2.5 × 10(-4) eV. The analysis at the state-to-state level reveals that this feature is originated in those processes which yield the formation of rotationally excited HD(v' = 0, j' &gt; 0). The statistical predictions reproduce reasonably well the overall behaviour of the TIQM ICSs at the larger energy range (Ec ≥ 10(-3) eV). Thermal rate constants are in qualitative agreement for the whole range of temperatures investigated in this work, 10-100 K, although the SQM values remain above the TIQM results for both initial H2 rotational states, j = 0 and 1. The enlargement of the asymptotic region for the statistical approach is crucial for a proper description at low energies. In particular, we find that the SQM method leads to rate coefficients in terms of the energy in perfect agreement with previously reported measurements if the maximum distance at which the calculation is performed increases noticeably with respect to the value employed to reproduce the TIQM results.",

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J.

We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J.

Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

Theoretical results based on time-dependent and time-independent quantum mechanical methods agree nearly perfectly with each other, and the agreement with the experiment is good at low collision energies and very good at high collision energies. This behavior is in marked contrast to a previous report on the HD(nu' = 3,j') product state rotational distribution [Pomerantz et al., J. Chem.

In the new experiments, the associative desorption of H(2) is studied in a velocity resolved and final rovibrational state selected manner, using time-of-flight techniques in combination with resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization laser detection. Average desorption energies and rotational quadrupole alignment parameters were obtained in this way for a number of (v = 0, 1) rotational states, v being the vibrational quantum number. Results of quantum dynamics calculations based on a potential energy surface computed with a specific reaction parameter (SRP) density functional, which was derived earlier for dihydrogen interacting with Cu(111), are compared with the results of the new experiments and with the results of previous molecular beam experiments on sticking of H(2) and on rovibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering of H(2) and D(2) from Cu(100). The calculations use the Born-Oppenheimer and static surface approximations. With the functional derived semi-empirically for dihydrogen + Cu(111), a chemically accurate description is obtained of the molecular beam experiments on sticking of H(2) on Cu(100), and a highly accurate description is obtained of rovibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering of D(2) from Cu(100) and of the orientational dependence of the reaction of (v = 1, j = 2 - 4) H(2) on Cu(100). This suggests that a SRP density functional derived for H(2) interacting with a specific low index face of a metal will yield accurate results for H(2) reactively scattering from another low index face of the same metal, and that it may also yield accurate results for H(2) interacting with a defected (e.g., stepped) surface of that same metal, in a system of catalytic interest. However, the description that was obtained of the average desorption energies, of rovibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering of H(2) from Cu(100), and of the orientational dependence of reaction of (v = 0, j = 3 - 5, 8) H(2) on Cu(100) compares less well with the available experiments. More research is needed to establish whether more accurate SRP-density functional theory dynamics results can be obtained for these observables if surface atom motion is added to the dynamical model. The experimentally and theoretically found dependence of the rotational quadrupole alignment parameter on the rotational quantum number provides evidence for rotational enhancement of reaction at low translational energies.",

Evaluation of the properties in an infinite crystal.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and precise evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Nguyen, Macchi &amp; Volkov (2020), Acta Cryst. A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

Electron detachment from SF6(-).\nDetailed statistical rate calculations combined with electron capture theory and kinetic modeling for the electron attachment to SF(6) and detachment from SF(6)(-) [Troe et al., J. Chem. Phys. 127, 244303 (2007)] are used to test thermionic electron emission models. A new method to calculate the specific detachment rate constants k(det)(E) and the electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon) as functions of the total energy E of the anion and the energy epsilon of the emitted electrons is presented, which is computationally simple but neglects fine structures in the detailed k(det)(E). Reduced electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) were found to be of the form (epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;)(n) exp(-epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) with n approximately = 0.15, whose shape corresponds to thermal distributions only to a limited extent. In contrast, the average energies &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; can be roughly estimated within thermionic emission and finite heat bath concepts. An effective temperature T(d)(E) is determined from the relation E - EA = &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; + kT(d), where &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; denotes the thermal internal energy of the detachment product SF(6) at the temperature T(d) and EA is the electron affinity of SF(6). The average electron energy is then approximately given by &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; = kT(d)(E), but dynamical details of the process are not accounted for by this approach. Simplified representations of k(det)(E) in terms of T(d)(E) from the literature are shown to lead to only semiquantitative agreement with the equally simple but more accurate calculations presented here. An effective \"isokinetic\" electron emission temperature T(e)(E) does not appear to be useful for the electron detachment system considered because it neither provides advantages over a representation of k(det)(E) as a function of T(d)(E), nor are recommended relations between T(e)(E) and T(d)(E) of sufficient accuracy.",

Although ab initio methods have proven capable of handling such electron transfer events when the Rydberg orbital has principal quantum number n = 3, they have proven to be incapable of handling Rydberg states having quantum number n &gt; 3, so having a new tool capable of handling n &gt; 3 Rydberg states is important. The model (i) focuses on each Rydberg orbital's large peak of high amplitude, (ii) approximates the electron density within this peak as constant within a radial shell characterized by a radius &lt;r&gt; and thickness T both of which depend on the quantum number n, and (iii) assumes that strong coupling (either with an orbital of an anion donor or to a disulfide sigma* or a backbone amide pi* orbital) occurs when the valence orbital penetrates fully within the radial shell of the Rydberg orbital. These assumptions permit a derivation of the ratios of rates of electron transfer for n &gt; 3 to those for n = 3. Combining these ratios with ab initio rates for n = 3 allows one to make rate predictions for inter- and intramolecular electron transfer involving Rydberg orbitals appropriate to the electron transfer dissociation process. One important prediction of this model is that the combination of large-penetration and Landau-Zener surface-crossing conditions places very severe limitations on which Rydberg levels can initially be populated in electron transfer dissociation. Another prediction is that a Rydberg orbital of a given principal quantum number n has a limited range of distances over which it can transfer an electron; sigma* or pi* orbitals either too far from or too close to a given Rydberg orbital cannot accept an electron from that orbital.",

However, in reality, electrolytes have several decay modes e-κr/r, e-κ'r/r etc. with different decay lengths, 1/κ, 1/κ' etc., that in general are different from the Debye length. As an illustration of the significance of multiple decay modes in electrolytes, the present work uses a very simple extension of the Debye-Hückel approximation with two decay lengths, which predicts oscillatory modes when appropriate. This approach gives very accurate results for radial distribution functions and thermodynamic properties of aqueous solutions of monovalent electrolytes for all concentrations investigated, including high ones. It is designed to satisfy necessary statistical mechanical conditions for the distributions. The effective dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte plays an important role in the theory and each mode has its own value of this entity. Electrolytes with high electrostatic coupling, like those with multivalent ions and/or with solvent of low dielectric constant, have decay lengths in dilute solutions that substantially deviate from the Debye length. It is shown that this is caused by nonlinear ion-ion correlation effects and the origin of under-screening, i.e., 1/κ &gt; 1/κD, in dilute symmetric electrolytes is analyzed. The under-screening is accompanied by an increase in the effective dielectric permittivity that is also caused by these correlations.

This model defines a librating chain that reduces in appropriate limits to the freely rotating or wormlike chains, it can accommodate local crumpling or extreme stiffness, and it is easy to simulate. A planar-quadratic (pq), analytic approximation is based on an expansion of the electrostatic energy in eigenfunctions of the quadratic form that describes the backbone energy, and on the assumption that the quadratic form not only is positive but also adequately confines the chain in an infinite phase space of dihedral angles to the physically unique part with all |phi(i)| &lt; pi. The pq approximation is available under these weak constraints, but the simulations confirm its quantitative accuracy only under the expected condition that alpha is large, that is, for very stiff chains. Stiff chains can also be simulated with small alpha and small theta and compared to an OSF approximation suitably generalized to chains with finite rather than vanishing theta, and increasing agreement with OSF is found the smaller is theta. The two approximations, one becoming exact as alpha --&gt; infinity with fixed theta, the other as theta --&gt; 0 with fixed alpha, are quantitatively similar in behavior, both giving a persistence length P = P0 + aD2 for stiff chains, where D is the Debye length. However, the coefficient apq is about twice the value of aOSF. Under other conditions the simulations show that P may or not be linear in D2 at small or moderate D, depending on the magnitudes of alpha, beta, theta, and the charge density but always becomes linear at large D. Even at a moderately low charge density, corresponding to fewer than 20% of the beads being charged, and with strong crumpling induced by large beta, increasing D dissolves blobs and recovers a linear dependence of P on D2, although a lower power of D gives an adequate fit at moderate D. For the class of models considered, it is concluded that the only universal feature is the asymptotic linearity of P in D2, regardless of flexibility or stiffness.",

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

Acta Cryst. A34, 909-921]. They are based on the expansion of |r' - r|(-1) in spherical harmonics and the incomplete gamma function for a Slater-type function of the form R(l)(r) = r(n) exp(-alpha ). The formulae are valid for 0 &lt; or = r &lt; or = infinity and are easily extended to higher values of l. Special treatment of integrals is needed only for functions with n = l and n = l + 1 at r = 0. The method is tested using theoretical pseudoatom parameters of the formamide molecule obtained via reciprocal-space fitting of PBE/6-31G** densities and experimental X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5). The ESP, EF and EFG values at the nuclear positions in formamide are in very good agreement with those directly evaluated from density-functional PBE calculations with 6-31G**, aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The small observed discrepancies are attributed to the different behavior of Gaussian- and Slater-type functions near the nuclei and to imperfections of the reciprocal-space fit. An EF map is displayed which allows useful visualization of the lattice EF effects in the crystal structure of formamide.

Here we investigate how those corrections influence the accuracy of binding free energy predictions for sodium-water clusters.

When compared with experimental binding free energies, however, the exchange-corrected CAM-B3LYP functional performs best (error &lt;1 kcal/mol), possibly because of its parametrization to experimental formation enthalpies.

As in the previous study [Nguyen, Kisiel &amp; Volkov (2018). Acta Cryst. A74, 524-536], the EP electron repulsion integral is evaluated analytically using the Löwdin α-function approach.

The DS approach is competitive in terms of precision and speed with the ES technique only for crystal structures of small molecules that do not carry a large molecular dipole moment.

Each peak displays both increasing breadth and increasing blueshift with increasing E, and the blueshift also increases with increasing v'. The first two properties are consistent with a predominantly repulsive excited-state potential-energy surface, while the last is speculated to be a reflection of the rHH dependence of the ionic surface. Quantum scattering calculations based on ab initio potential surfaces for the excited and ionic states in spherical and infinite-order-sudden rigid rotor approximations are in semiquantitative agreement with the measurements.

These ions are dominantly formed via sharply structured resonance features at energies below the threshold for electronic excitation and result from dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The most dominant DEA channel is formation of (M-HCl)-, i.e., ejection of a neutral HCl molecule with the negative charge remaining on the ring. The reaction cross section is 9 x 10(-18) m2 and 5 x 10(-18) m2 for 6-Cl and 5-ClU, respectively, and thus about two orders of magnitude higher than the geometrical cross section of the molecule. Further reactions also operative via low energy resonances (&lt;2.5 eV) are Cl- abstraction, dehydrogenation [formation of (M-H)-, M=ClU], and DEA processes associated with a ring opening. Most of the ion yield curves exhibit remarkably sharp structures which have not been observed before in DEA to a polyatomic system. Although some possibilities on their origin are discussed, their interpretation remains a challenge for theory and further experiments. While electron attachment to both 6-ClU and 5-ClU generates fragments of the same stoichiometric composition, their ion yields and also their relative intensities show some very pronounced differences which can be explained by the different structure but also the different energetic situation in the two isomers.",

The value of the EOD coefficient is difficult to justify, and available literature data on this for Nafion membranes show scattering from in experiments and simulations. Here, we use a classical all-atom model to compute the EOD coefficient and thermodynamic properties of water from molecular dynamics simulations for temperatures between 330 and 420 K, and for different water contents between λ = 5 and λ = 20. λ is the ratio between the moles of water molecules to the moles of sulfonic acid sites. This classical model does not capture the Grotthuss mechanism; however, it is shown that it can predict the EOD coefficient within the range of experimental values for λ = 5 where the vehicular mechanism dominates proton transfer. For λ &gt; 5, the Grotthuss mechanism becomes dominant. To obtain the EOD coefficient, average velocities of water and ions are computed by imposing different electric fields to the system. Our results show that the velocities of water and hydronium scale linearly with the electric field, resulting in a constant ratio of ca. 0.4 within the error bars. We find that the EOD coefficient of water linearly increases from 2 at λ = 5 to 8 at λ = 20 and the results are not sensitive to temperature. The EOD coefficient at λ = 5 is within the range of experimental values, confirming that the model can capture the vehicular transport of protons well. At λ = 20, due to the absence of proton hopping in the model, the EOD coefficient is overestimated by a factor of 3 compared to experimental values. To analyze the interactions between water and Nafion, the partial molar enthalpies and partial molar volumes of water are computed from molecular dynamics simulations. At different water uptakes, multiple linear regression is used on raw simulation data within a narrow composition range of water inside the Nafion membrane. The partial molar volumes and partial molar excess enthalpies of water asymptotically approach the molar volumes and molar excess enthalpies of pure water for water uptakes above 5. This confirms the model can capture the bulklike behavior of water in the Nafion at high water uptakes.",

Moreover, because of weaker f-d Coulomb interactions for the U3+ ion than for the isoelectronic Nd3+ lanthanide ion, the very simple model assuming the coupling of crystal-field levels of the 6d1 electron with the lattice and the multiplet structure of the 5f2 configuration may be employed for the qualitative description of the general structure of the U3+ ion f-d spectrum.",

This study examines the trends and quantifies the mechanism of this series for the lanthanide ion Pr(3+), with the 4f(2) electronic configuration. A new and concise measurement by a single parameter, σee, is introduced to quantify the overall strength of interelectronic repulsion, as the alternative to the Slater parameters, F(k) (k = 2, 4, 6). Energy parameters have been derived from the literature electronic spectra of Pr(3+), in the free ion and in various crystalline hosts, with new calculations in some cases. It is found that at least the first 12 of the 13 multiplet terms of Pr(3+) must be well-determined to obtain reliable parameter values. The shifts of various energy levels for changes in the Slater parameters are not uniform in direction. For the various Pr(3+) solid-state systems, the change in σee is only up to ∼5%, with the magnitude of σee in the order F(-) &gt; Cl(-) &gt; O(2-) ≈ Br(-) &gt; C, and decreasing with lower coordination number of the ligand. The decreases of the Slater parameters from the free ion values are reasonably estimated by considering the dielectric constant of the medium. In particular, the magnitude of σee (and of the spin-orbit coupling constant) is proportional to the polarizability of the ligand for F(-), Cl(-), O(2-), and Br(-). The data point scatter for oxide systems is accounted for by considering the individual ligand bond distances. A fair estimation of nephelauxetic effects can be made from some luminescence transition energies, by contrast with Eu(3+) systems where crystal field effects also play a major role. In conclusion, the nephelauxetic effect of Pr(3+) is due to the polarization of the ligand by one 4f electron, and the interaction of the other electron with the induced multipolar moments, of which the dipole moment dominates.

P. de Lara-Castells, G. Delgado-Barrio, P. Villarreal, and A. O. Mitrushchenkov, J. Chem. Phys. 125, 221101 (2006)]. Additional methodological and computational details of the implementation, which uses an iterative Jacobi-Davidson diagonalization algorithm to properly address the inherent \"hard-core\" He-He interaction problem, are described here. The convergence of total energies, average pair He-He interaction energies, and relevant one- and two-body properties upon increasing the angular part of the one-particle basis set (expanded in spherical harmonics) has been analyzed, considering Cl(2) as the dopant and a semiempirical model (T-shaped) He-Cl(2)(B) potential. Converged results are used to analyze global energetic and structural aspects as well as the configuration makeup of the wave functions, associated with the ground and low-lying \"solvent\" excited states. Our study reveals that besides the fermionic nature of (3)He atoms, key roles in determining total binding energies and wave-function structures are played by the strong repulsive core of the He-He potential as well as its very weak attractive region, the most stable arrangement somehow departing from the one of N He atoms equally spaced on equatorial \"ring\" around the dopant. The present results for N = 4 fermions indicates the structural \"pairing\" of two (3)He atoms at opposite sides on a broad \"belt\" around the dopant, executing a sort of asymmetric umbrella motion. This pairing is a compromise between maximizing the (3)He-(3)He and the He-dopant attractions, and suppressing at the same time the \"hard-core\" repulsion. Although the He-He attractive interaction is rather weak, its contribution to the total energy is found to scale as a power of three and it thus increasingly affects the pair density distributions as the cluster grows in size.",

Because the time of the fine structure exchanging is much shorter than the lifetime of the 5D state, the fluorescence originating from the 5D state produced by the 5P1/2 + 5P3/2 and 5P3/2 + 5P3/2 processes follows the instantaneous production rate of the 5P1/2 + 5P1/2 process.

From the number of water molecules that are lost from the reduced cluster, the average and maximum possible internal energy is determined to be approximately 4.4 and 5.2 eV, respectively, for Ca(H(2)O)(30)(2+). This value is approximately the same as the calculated ionization energies of M(H(2)O)(n)(+), M = Mg and Ca, for large n indicating that the vast majority of the recombination energy is partitioned into internal modes of the ion and that the dissociation of these ions is statistical. For smaller clusters, estimates of the dissociation energies for the loss of H and of water molecules are obtained from theory. For Mg(H(2)O)(n)(2+), n = 4-6, the average internal energy deposition is estimated to be 4.2-4.6 eV. The maximum possible energy deposited into the n = 5 cluster is &lt;7.1 eV, which is significantly less than the calculated recombination energy for this cluster. There does not appear to be a significant trend in the internal energy deposition with cluster size whereas the recombination energy is calculated to increase significantly for clusters with fewer than 10 water molecules. These, and other results, indicate that the dissociation of these smaller clusters is nonergodic.",

The rate constants of bimolecular collisions, K(col) for 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin-1-oxyl-3-carboxylic acid (CP) when it is uncharged (at low pH) and K(col)⁻ when it is charged (CP⁻; at high pH), are measured as functions of temperature and ionic strength. The ratio f* ≡ K(col)⁻/K(col) is a direct measure of the effect of charge on the collision rate. Neglecting the small differences in size and diffusion coefficients of CP and CP⁻, f* is the fractional change in collision rate due to Coulomb repulsion which was treated theoretically in Debye's classic paper [Trans. Electr. Chem. Soc. 1942, 82, 265]. K(col) and K(col)⁻ are determined from EPR spectral changes due to spin-spin interactions which are dominated by Heisenberg spin exchange under the conditions of these experiments. Values of f* vary linearly with values of κ · d in the range 0.4 &lt; κ · d &lt; 1.8, where κ and d are the inverse Debye screening length and the distance at closest approach, respectively. Values of d obtained in two independent ways, (1) from rotational correlation times measured by EPR and (2) by insisting that the experimental results be consistent with the Debye theory at infinite dilution, yield similar results. As the ionic strength is increased (κ increased), the screening effect reduces the effect of the Coulomb barrier more slowly than predicted by the Debye theory. While values of K(col) and K(col)⁻ vary substantially with T, approximately following the Stokes-Einstein-Smoluchowski equation, values of f* depend only slightly on temperature at a given value of κ · d, as is predicted by Debye's theory.",

A range of VDW binding energies from 1.5 to 9.0 kcal mol(-1) are investigated. The anisotropic PES for the ClO.N(2) complex and a separable anharmonic oscillator approximation are used to estimate the equilibrium constant for formation of the VDW complex. Rate constants, branching ratios to produce ClOOCl, and nascent energy distributions of excited ClOOCl* are discussed with respect to the VDW binding energy and temperature. Interestingly, even for weak VDW binding energies, the N(2) usually carries away enough energy to stabilize the nascent ClOOCl*, although the VDW equilibrium constant is small. For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant. For the calculated ClO.N(2) binding energy of 1.5 kcal mol(-1), the VDW equilibrium constant is small, and the chaperon mechanism is only important at very high pressures.",

Using this approach the equilibrium structures of the monomer (NaCl) and the dimer (Na(2)Cl(2)), together with the fraction of vapor existing as dimer, have been determined by gas-phase electron diffraction supplemented with data from microwave spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.

Based on the rate coefficients computed at the ICVT/SCT level, the highest TST level used in this study, the BH&amp;HLYP functional performs best among all the functionals used, while the RCCSD(T)/CBS//MP2/6-31++G** level is the best among all the ab initio levels used. Comparing computed reaction rate coefficients obtained at different levels of theory shows that, the computed barrier height has the strongest effect on the computed reaction rate coefficients as expected. Variational effects on the computed rate coefficients are found to be negligibly small. Although tunneling effects are relatively small at high temperatures (~1500 K), SCT corrections are significant at low temperatures (~300 K), and both barrier heights and the magnitudes of the imaginary frequencies affect SCT corrections.",

Due to intersubject variability, the SAR is usually conservatively estimated based on standard human models that include an applied safety margin to ensure safe operation. One approach to reducing the restrictions is to create more accurate subject-specific models from their segmented MR images. This study uses electromagnetic simulations to investigate the minimum number of tissue groups required to accurately determine SAR in the human head. Tissue types from a fully characterized electromagnetic human model with 47 tissue types in the head and neck region were grouped into different tissue clusters based on the conductivities, permittivities, and mass densities of the tissues. Electromagnetic simulations of the head model inside a parallel transmit head coil at 7 tesla were used to determine the minimum number of required tissue clusters to accurately determine the subject-specific SAR. The identified tissue clusters were then evaluated using 2 additional well-characterized electromagnetic human models. A minimum of 4-clusters-plus-air was found to be required for accurate SAR estimation. These tissue clusters are centered around gray matter, fat, cortical bone, and cerebrospinal fluid. For all 3 simulated models, the parallel transmit maximum 10g SAR was consistently determined to within an error of &lt;12% relative to the full 47-tissue model.

Single-point coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations have also been carried out to calibrate the correlation effect. The HF calculations yield unbound potentials largely because of the exchange-repulsion interaction. In the MP2 calculations, the basis set effects on the repulsion exponent, the equilibrium bond length, the binding energy, and the asymptotic behavior of the calculated intermolecular potentials have been thoroughly studied. We have employed basis sets from the Slater type orbitals fitted with Gaussian functions (STO-nG, n = 3 approximately 6), Pople's medium size basis sets [up to 6-311++G(3df,3pd)], to Dunning's correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ, X = D, T, Q). With increasing basis size, the repulsion exponent and the equilibrium bond length converge at the 6-31G** basis set and the 6-311++G(3d,3p) basis set, respectively, while a large basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ) is required to converge the binding energy at a chemical accuracy ( approximately 0.05 kcal/mol). Up to the largest basis set used, the asymptotic dispersion coefficient has not converged to the expected C6 value from molecular polarizability calculations. We attribute the slow convergence partly to the inefficacy of using the MP2 calculations with Gaussian type functions to model the asymptotic behavior. Both the basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrected and uncorrected results are presented to emphasize the importance of including such corrections. Only the BSSE corrected results systematically converge to the expected potential curve with increasing basis size. The DFT calculations generate a wide range of interaction patterns, from purely unbound to strongly bound, underestimating or overestimating the binding energy. The binding energies calculated using the OPTXHCTH147, PBEVP86, PBEP86, PW91TPSS, PW91PBE, and PW91PW91 functionals and the equilibrium bond lengths calculated using the MPWHCTH93, TPSSHCTH, PBEVP86, PBEP86, PW91TPSS, PW91PBE, and PW91PW91 functionals are close to the MP2 results using the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set.

The method is based on the simultaneous truncation of the molecular orbital (MO) basis and the auxiliary basis set used for the DF approximation. For the reduction of the size of the MO basis, state-specific natural orbitals (NOs) are constructed for each excited state using the average of the second-order Møller-Plesset (MP2) and the corresponding configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles [CIS(D)] density matrices. After removing the NOs of low occupation number, natural auxiliary functions (NAFs) are constructed [M. Kállay, J. Chem. Phys. 141, 244113 (2014)], and the NAF basis is also truncated. Our results show that, for a triple-zeta basis set, about 60% of the virtual MOs can be dropped, while the size of the fitting basis can be reduced by a factor of five. This results in a dramatic reduction of the computational costs of the solution of the CC2 equations, which are in our approach about as expensive as the evaluation of the MP2 and CIS(D) density matrices. All in all, an average speedup of more than an order of magnitude can be achieved at the expense of a mean absolute error of 0.02 eV in the calculated excitation energies compared to the canonical CC2 results.

Front-side attack identity S(N)2 reactions for both SiH(3)X and CH(3)X have double-well potential energy surfaces (PESs), but their transition-state positions are different relative to the positions of reactants and products: it is lower for SiH(3)X, and it is higher for CH(3)X. The minimum energy path for an S(N)2(Si) reaction with retention of configuration proceeds from a stable pentacoordinated anion intermediate of C(s) symmetry (TBP) via a C(s) transition state (SP) to a complementary pentacoordinated intermediate (TBP) and finally up to separate products.

Here, we sought to obtain a functional GM-CSF/IL-6 fusion protein and to investigate its biological activities in vitro. A novel construct encoding a fusion protein of huGM-CSF (9-127) and IL-6 (29-184) was generated in the pBV220 expression vector by step-by-step cloning. Amino acids 1-8 of huGM-CSF and amino acids 1-28 of huIL-6 were deleted by PCR. The mutant huGM-CSF (9-127) and huIL-6 (29-184) cDNAs were linked via a linker sequence encoding 15 amino acid residues (G-G-S-G-S)3. Direct sequencing was used to confirm the validity of the desired construct, and the fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli host strain BL21 (DE3) in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). The expression level was more than 25% of the total cell lysate, and a novel purification and refolding strategy was used to isolate the fusion protein product. Inclusion bodies were purified by Q Sepharose H.P. ion exchange in 8 mol/L urea, followed by in situ refolding by Sephacryl S-200. The renatured fusion proteins were obtained at a purity of &gt;95%, and the strategy of refolding on the gel filtration column was found to be efficient, with a relative refolding rate of 80%. This entire refolding and purification procedure could be performed within one day and may prove applicable to large-scale purification and refolding of recombinant proteins from IBs in E. coli. This new method was used to obtain huGM-CSF (9-127)/IL-6 (29-184) fusion protein with high purity and biological activity. MTT assays in TF-1 and B9 cell lines showed that the specific biological activity of huGM-CSF was 1.14+/-0.10 x 10(8) U/mg, and that for huIL-6 was 1.89+/-0.11 x 10(7) U/mg.

Using this strategy, we can perform computations in minutes or hours, instead of days or months. Applying the proposed scheme enables us to routinely treat systems with 50 atoms at the CCSD(T)(F12) level in combination with appropriate basis sets to obtain nearly CBS accuracy.

The corresponding vectors are tensors in what is called CP-format. The final wave functions are therefore represented in a hierarchical CP-format. Computational efficiency and accuracy are significantly improved by representing the Hamiltonian in the same hierarchical format as the wave function.

In both methods, the diagonalized g tensor principal axes are found to be aligned with the radical's inertial axes. The tensor components are in very good agreement with those determined experimentally by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The MRCI technique produced g tensor components that are more accurate than those obtained by the CPKS-HDF method. Nonetheless, to get reasonable MRCI results, one must include the in-plane and out-of-plane interactions in an unbiased way. The minimum reference space that satisfies these conditions is generated from a complete active space of nine electrons in six orbitals [CAS(9,6)] and contains a(1), a(2), b(1) and b(2) type orbitals. In addition, the number of roots in the MRCI-SOS g tensor expansion should include all excited states that range from 0 to 56,000 cm(-1). The most accurate results are obtained using an MRCI-SOS/CAS(13,9) calculation. These g tensor components are within the experimental accuracy range of 1000 ppm. The one- and two-electron contributions to the g tensor components are separated and individually analyzed. The very good agreement with experiment opens the door for further accurate calculations of spin Hamiltonian tensors of larger DTA• radicals.",

The retention times of the C(7)-C(31) alkanes acquired during 24 isothermal experiments cover the 0-6s retention time area in the second dimension retention time space, which makes it possible to calculate the retention indices of target compounds from the corresponding retention time values without the extension of the retention space of the reference compounds.

The extension of carbon numbers in reference n-alkanes up to two more carbon atoms introduces &lt;10 retention index units (iu) of deviation.

In addition, the electromagnetic form-factor ratio (|G_{E}/G_{M}|) and the value of the effective (|G_{eff}|), electric (|G_{E}|), and magnetic (|G_{M}|) form factors are measured by studying the helicity angle of the proton at 16 center-of-mass energy points. |G_{E}/G_{M}| and |G_{M}| are determined with high accuracy, providing uncertainties comparable to data in the spacelike region, and |G_{E}| is measured for the first time.

We, therefore, employed the Z-vector method in the relativistic coupled-cluster framework and found that HgH has a very large Eeff value (123.2 GV/cm) which makes it a potential candidate for the next generation eEDM experiment. Our study also reveals that it has a large scalar-pseudoscalar (S-PS) P,T-violating interaction constant, Ws = 284.2 kHz. To judge the accuracy of the obtained results, we have calculated parallel and perpendicular magnetic hyperfine structure (HFS) constants and compared with the available experimental values. The results of our calculation are found to be in nice agreement with the experimental values. Therefore, by looking at the HFS results, we can say that both Eeff and Ws values are also very accurate.

These can be used in the Hamiltonian to define a robust and efficient electrostatic embedding QM/MM method. The original formulation of ESPF QM/MM was based on two main approximations, namely, neglecting the grid derivatives and nonconserving of the total QM charge. Here, we present a new ESPF atomic charge operator, which overcomes these drawbacks at virtually no extra computational cost. The new charge operators employ atom-centered grids and conserve the total charge when traced with the density matrix. We present an efficient and easy-to-implement analytic form for the energy, gradient, and hessian that scales linearly with the MM subsystem size. We show that grid derivatives and charge conservation are fundamental to preserve the translational invariance properties of energies and their derivatives and exact conditions to be satisfied by the atomic charge derivatives.

By combining the pseudopotential approximation introduced by Dehmelt 25 years ago with the assumption of thermal equilibrium (leading to a Boltzmann ion energy distribution), the resulting ion spatial distribution (for ions of a single mass-to-charge ratio) depends only on total number of ions, trap pseudopotential, and temperature. (The equilibrium assumption is justified by the high helium bath gas pressure at which analytical quadrupole ion traps are typically operated.) The electric potential generated by the ion space charge may be generated from Poisson's equation subject to a Boltzmann ion energy distribution. However, because the ion distribution depends in turn on the total potential, solving for the potential and the ion distribution is no longer a simple boundary condition differential equation problem; an iterative procedure is required to obtain a self-consistent result. For the particularly convenient operating condition, (a z = -8qU/mϱ 0 (2) Ω(2), and q z =-4qV mϱ 0 (2) Ω(2), where U and V are direct current and radiofrequency (frequency, ω) voltages applied to the trap, m/q is ion mass-to-charge ratio, and ϱ0 is the radius of the ring electrode at the z=0 midplane], both the pseudopotential and the ion distribution become spherically symmetric. The resulting one-dimensional problem may be solved by a simple optimization procedure. The present model accounts qualitatively for the dependence of total potential and ion distribution on number of ions (higher ion density or lower temperature flattens the total potential and widens the spatial distribution of ions) and pseudopotential (higher pseudopotential increases ion density near the center of the trap without widening the ion spatial distribution).

In the quantum electrodynamical framework employed, the coupling between the pair is mediated by the exchange of a single virtual photon. The probability amplitude found from second-order perturbation theory is a product of the electric moments located at each center and the resonant multipole-multipole interaction tensor. Using the Fermi golden rule, a general formula for the rate of energy transfer is obtained. As an illustration of the efficacy of the theory developed, rates of excitation energy exchange are calculated for systems interacting through dipole-quadrupole, dipole-octupole, quadrupole-quadrupole, and the familiar dipole-dipole coupling. For each of the cases examined, the near- and far-zone limits of the migration rate are calculated from the result valid for all donor-acceptor separations beyond wave function overlap. Expression of the octupole contribution to the transfer rate in terms of its irreducible components of weights 1 and 3 leads to new features. The octupole weight-1 term is found to contribute only when the interaction is retarded, while the dipole-octupole weight-1 contribution appears as a higher-order correction term to the dipole-dipole rate. Order of magnitude estimates are given for the contributions of dipole-quadrupole and dipole-octupole terms relative to the leading dipole-dipole rate for near-, intermediate-, and far-zone separations to further understand the role played by higher multipole moments in the transfer of excitation and the mechanism dominating the process.",

In this study, we develop a new algorithm to treat such boundaries; the new method is called the balanced redistributed charge (balanced RC or BRC) scheme with a tuned fluorine link atom. The MM point charge on the MM boundary atom is modified to conserve the total charge of the entire system, and the modified charge is redistributed to the midpoints of the bonds between an MM boundary atom and its neighboring MM atoms. A pseudopotential is added to the fluorine link atom to reproduce the partial charge of the uncapped portion of the QM subsystem. We select proton affinities as the property used to validate the new method because the energy change associated with the addition of an entire charge (proton) to the QM system is very sensitive to the treatment of electrostatics at the boundary; we apply the new method to calculate proton affinities of 25 molecules with 13 different kinds of bonds being cut. The average proton affinity in the test set is 373 kcal/mol, and the test set provides a more challenging test than those usually used for testing QM/MM methods. For this challenging test set, common unbalanced schemes give a mean unsigned error (MUE) of 15-21 kcal/mol for H link atoms or 16-24 kcal/mol for F link atoms, much larger than the 5 kcal/mol obtained by simply omitting the MM region with either kind of link atom. Balancing the charges reduces the error to 5-7 kcal/mol for H link atoms and 4-6 kcal/mol for F link atoms. Balancing the charges and also tuning an F link atom lowers the MUE to 1.3-4 kcal/mol, with the best result for the balanced RC scheme. We conclude that properly tuning the link atom and correctly treating the point charges near the QM/MM boundary significantly improves the accuracy of the calculated proton affinities. ",

The simplest problem involves quantum particles localized within the 'groove', a quasi-1D region created by two adjacent, identical and parallel nanotubes. At low temperature (T), the transverse motion of the adsorbed gas, in the plane perpendicular to the axes of the tubes, is frozen out. Then, the low T heat capacity C(T) of N particles is that of a 1D classical gas: C(*)(T) = C(T)/(Nk(B)) --&gt; 1/2. The dimensionless heat capacity C(*) increases when T ≥ 0.1T(x, y) (transverse excitation temperatures), asymptoting at C(*) = 2.5. The second problem involves a gas localized between two nearly parallel, co-planar nanotubes, with small divergence half-angle γ. In this case, too, the transverse motion does not contribute to C(T) at low T, leaving a problem of a gas of particles in a 1D harmonic potential (along the z axis, midway between the tubes). Setting ω(z) as the angular frequency of this motion, for T ≥ τ(z) ≡ ω(z)ħ/k(B), the behavior approaches that of a 2D classical gas, C(*) = 1; one might have expected instead C(*) = 1/2, as in the groove problem, since the limit γ ≡ 0 is 1D. For T &lt;&lt; τ(z), the thermal behavior is exponentially activated, C(*) ∼ (τ(z)/T)(2)e(-τ(z)/T). At higher T (T ≈ ε(y)/k(B) ≡ τ(y) &gt;&gt; τ(z)), motion is excited in the y direction, perpendicular to the plane of nanotubes, resulting in thermal behavior (C(*) = 7/4) corresponding to a gas in 7/2 dimensions, while at very high T (T &gt; ħω(x)/k(B) ≡ τ(x) &gt;&gt; τ(y)), the behavior becomes that of a D = 11/2 system.

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early.

In contrast, the other two states, i.e. the 2(2)A' and 1(4)A' states, are energetically not favourable to the reaction as the first state has a potential barrier of 0.2 eV in the entrance channel and the former one presents long range potential wells and repulsive wall for carbon approaches near OH. The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one. Nevertheless, a decreasing behaviour with the temperature remains between 10 and 500 K if we consider the total rate constant of C((3)P) + OH(X(2)Pi), sum of the three reactive states rate constants.",

The trajectories are initiated at the transition state with fixed energy in reaction-coordinate translation E(t) (double dagger). The QCT simulations have zero-point energy (ZPE) in the vibrational modes orthogonal to the reaction coordinate, while there is no ZPE for the STs. A semiquantitative agreement is obtained between the ST and QCT average percent product energy partitionings. The ST approach is used to study mass effects for product energy partitioning in HX(X = F or Cl) elimination from halogenated alkanes by using the MP26-31G(*) PES for C(2)H(5)F dissociation and varying the masses of the C, H, and F atoms.

The key hypothesis is that the random class of potential energy valleys dominates the statistical mechanics of the liquid at temperatures above melting T approximately greater than Tm and that these valleys are macroscopically uniform in the thermodynamic limit. This allows us to use a single random valley to calculate the vibrational contribution to liquid properties, exactly in the thermodynamic limit, and as an approximation at finite number of particles N . This approximation is tested here for liquid Na with a physically realistic potential based on electronic structure theory. Steepest descent quenches were made from the molecular dynamics equilibrium liquid (N=500) at temperatures from 0.90Tm to 3.31Tm, and six potential parameters were calculated for each structure, namely, the potential energy and five principal moments of the vibrational frequency distribution. The results show temperature-independent means and small standard deviations for all potential parameters, consistent with random valley uniformity at N--&gt;infinity, and with finite- N broadening at N=500. The expected error in the single random valley approximation for Na at N=500 and T approximately greater than Tm is 0.1% for the entropy and 0.5% for the internal energy, negligible in the current development of liquid dynamics theory. In related quench studies of recent years, the common finding of nearly temperature-independent means of structural potential energy properties at T approximately greater than Tm suggests that the single random valley approximation might also apply to systems more complicated than the elemental liquids.",

At zero temperature we identify four phases in the plane (U,n) ( U is the on-site potential and n is the filling) and relative phase transitions as well as different types of charge ordering. These features are endorsed by investigating at T=0 the chemical potential and pertinent local correlators, the particle and double occupancy correlation functions, the entropy, and by studying the behavior in the limit T--&gt;0 of the charge and spin susceptibilities. A detailed study of the thermodynamic quantities is also presented at finite temperature. This study evidences that a finite-range order persists for a wide range of the temperature, as shown by the behavior of the correlation functions and by the two-peak structure exhibited by the charge susceptibility and by the entropy. Moreover, the equations of motion formalism, together with the use of composite operators, allows us to exactly determine the set of elementary excitations. As a result, the density of states can be determined and a detailed analysis of the specific heat allows for identifying the excitations and for ascribing its two-peak structure to a redistribution of the charge density.",

The system is shown to possess an infinite volume limit when (N(1),N(2),V)--&gt; infinity, keeping N(1)/V(1/3) and N(2)/V(1/3) fixed. The saddle point approximation becomes here exact for (N1,N2,V)--&gt; infinity. It provides a nonlinear differential equation for the densities of each kind of particle. For the spherically symmetric case, we compute the densities as functions of two dimensionless physical parameters: eta(1)=Gm(2)(1)N(1)/V(1/3)T and eta(2)=Gm(2)(2)N(2)/V(1/3)T (where G is Newton's constant, m(1) and m(2) the masses of the two kinds of particles, and T the temperature). According to the values of eta(1) and eta(2) the system can be either in a gaseous phase or in a highly condensed phase. The gaseous phase is stable for eta(1) and eta(2) between the origin and their collapse values. We have thus generalized the well-known isothermal sphere for two kinds of particles. The gas is inhomogeneous and the mass M(R) inside a sphere of radius R scales with R as M(R) proportional to R(d) suggesting a fractal structure. The value of d depends in general on eta(1) and eta(2) except on the critical line for the canonical ensemble in the (eta(1),eta(2)) plane where it takes the universal value d approximately 1.6 for all values of N(1)/N(2). The equation of state is computed. It is found to be locally a perfect gas equation of state. The thermodynamic functions (free energy, energy, entropy) are expressed and plotted as functions of eta(1) and eta(2). They exhibit a square root Riemann sheet with the branch points on the critical canonical line. The behavior of the energy and the specific heat at the critical line is computed.

The potential function yields an accurate representation of spectroscopic data that span 99.24% of the well depth and the number of fitted parameters is significantly less than half the number of parameters determined in conventional Dunham analyses.

As shown by Golosov, this model exhibits a strong localization phenomenon for the thermal packet: all thermal trajectories starting from the same initial condition in the same sample remain within a finite distance of each other even in the limit of infinite time. More precisely, he has proved that the disorder average P(t)(y) of the distribution of the relative distance y=x(t)-m(t) with respect to the (disorder-dependent) most probable position m(t), converges in the limit t--&gt; infinity, towards a distribution P(G)(y) defined as a functional of two independent Bessel processes. In this paper, we revisit this question of the localization of the thermal packet. We first generalize the result of Golosov by computing explicitly the joint distribution P( infinity )(y,u) of relative position y=x(t)-m(t) and relative energy u=U(x(t))-U(m(t)) for the thermal packet. Next, we compute the localization parameters Y(k), representing the disorder-averaged probabilities that k particles of the thermal packet are at the same place in the infinite-time limit, and the correlation function C(l) representing the disorder-averaged probability density that two particles of the thermal packet are at a distance l from each other. We, moreover, prove that our results for Y(k) and C(l) exactly coincide with the thermodynamic limit L--&gt; infinity of the analog quantities computed for independent particles at equilibrium in a finite sample of length L. So even if the Sinai dynamics on the infinite line is always out-of-equilibrium since it consists in jumps in deeper and deeper wells, the particles of the same thermal packet can nevertheless be considered asymptotically as if they were at thermal equilibrium in a Brownian potential. Finally, we discuss the properties of the finite-time metastable states that are responsible for the localization phenomenon and compare with the general theory of metastable states in glassy systems, in particular as a test of the Edwards conjecture.",

The simplest problem involves quantum particles localized within the 'groove', a quasi-1D region created by two adjacent, identical and parallel nanotubes. At low temperature (T), the transverse motion of the adsorbed gas, in the plane perpendicular to the axes of the tubes, is frozen out. Then, the low T heat capacity C(T) of N particles is that of a 1D classical gas: C(*)(T) = C(T)/(Nk(B)) --&gt; 1/2. The dimensionless heat capacity C(*) increases when T ≥ 0.1T(x, y) (transverse excitation temperatures), asymptoting at C(*) = 2.5. The second problem involves a gas localized between two nearly parallel, co-planar nanotubes, with small divergence half-angle γ. In this case, too, the transverse motion does not contribute to C(T) at low T, leaving a problem of a gas of particles in a 1D harmonic potential (along the z axis, midway between the tubes). Setting ω(z) as the angular frequency of this motion, for T ≥ τ(z) ≡ ω(z)ħ/k(B), the behavior approaches that of a 2D classical gas, C(*) = 1; one might have expected instead C(*) = 1/2, as in the groove problem, since the limit γ ≡ 0 is 1D. For T &lt;&lt; τ(z), the thermal behavior is exponentially activated, C(*) ∼ (τ(z)/T)(2)e(-τ(z)/T). At higher T (T ≈ ε(y)/k(B) ≡ τ(y) &gt;&gt; τ(z)), motion is excited in the y direction, perpendicular to the plane of nanotubes, resulting in thermal behavior (C(*) = 7/4) corresponding to a gas in 7/2 dimensions, while at very high T (T &gt; ħω(x)/k(B) ≡ τ(x) &gt;&gt; τ(y)), the behavior becomes that of a D = 11/2 system.

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study.

Despite the various approximations involved in the different methods and PESs, an excellent agreement is obtained in a subset of three models: the ACCSA method with PME-SO or ab initio PESs and the QCT method with the latter PES. This suggests that the reaction takes place once the system enters the deep valley of products. In that case, the errors due to these approximate methods and PESs are small and, consequently, the rate constants are accurately calculated.

The trajectories are initiated at the transition state with fixed energy in reaction-coordinate translation E(t) (double dagger). The QCT simulations have zero-point energy (ZPE) in the vibrational modes orthogonal to the reaction coordinate, while there is no ZPE for the STs. A semiquantitative agreement is obtained between the ST and QCT average percent product energy partitionings. The ST approach is used to study mass effects for product energy partitioning in HX(X = F or Cl) elimination from halogenated alkanes by using the MP26-31G(*) PES for C(2)H(5)F dissociation and varying the masses of the C, H, and F atoms.

The key hypothesis is that the random class of potential energy valleys dominates the statistical mechanics of the liquid at temperatures above melting T approximately greater than Tm and that these valleys are macroscopically uniform in the thermodynamic limit. This allows us to use a single random valley to calculate the vibrational contribution to liquid properties, exactly in the thermodynamic limit, and as an approximation at finite number of particles N . This approximation is tested here for liquid Na with a physically realistic potential based on electronic structure theory. Steepest descent quenches were made from the molecular dynamics equilibrium liquid (N=500) at temperatures from 0.90Tm to 3.31Tm, and six potential parameters were calculated for each structure, namely, the potential energy and five principal moments of the vibrational frequency distribution. The results show temperature-independent means and small standard deviations for all potential parameters, consistent with random valley uniformity at N--&gt;infinity, and with finite- N broadening at N=500. The expected error in the single random valley approximation for Na at N=500 and T approximately greater than Tm is 0.1% for the entropy and 0.5% for the internal energy, negligible in the current development of liquid dynamics theory. In related quench studies of recent years, the common finding of nearly temperature-independent means of structural potential energy properties at T approximately greater than Tm suggests that the single random valley approximation might also apply to systems more complicated than the elemental liquids.",

We obtain an exact expression for the conditional probability density function rhoT(yT,t|yT,0) that a tagged particle T (T=1,...,N) is at position yT at time t given that it at time t=0 was at position yT,0.

As shown by Golosov, this model exhibits a strong localization phenomenon for the thermal packet: all thermal trajectories starting from the same initial condition in the same sample remain within a finite distance of each other even in the limit of infinite time. More precisely, he has proved that the disorder average P(t)(y) of the distribution of the relative distance y=x(t)-m(t) with respect to the (disorder-dependent) most probable position m(t), converges in the limit t--&gt; infinity, towards a distribution P(G)(y) defined as a functional of two independent Bessel processes. In this paper, we revisit this question of the localization of the thermal packet. We first generalize the result of Golosov by computing explicitly the joint distribution P( infinity )(y,u) of relative position y=x(t)-m(t) and relative energy u=U(x(t))-U(m(t)) for the thermal packet. Next, we compute the localization parameters Y(k), representing the disorder-averaged probabilities that k particles of the thermal packet are at the same place in the infinite-time limit, and the correlation function C(l) representing the disorder-averaged probability density that two particles of the thermal packet are at a distance l from each other. We, moreover, prove that our results for Y(k) and C(l) exactly coincide with the thermodynamic limit L--&gt; infinity of the analog quantities computed for independent particles at equilibrium in a finite sample of length L. So even if the Sinai dynamics on the infinite line is always out-of-equilibrium since it consists in jumps in deeper and deeper wells, the particles of the same thermal packet can nevertheless be considered asymptotically as if they were at thermal equilibrium in a Brownian potential. Finally, we discuss the properties of the finite-time metastable states that are responsible for the localization phenomenon and compare with the general theory of metastable states in glassy systems, in particular as a test of the Edwards conjecture.",

With a near pure case (b) coupling model for the upper triplet state, we have assigned a significant portion of the spectrum, mainly the F1 (J = N + 1) and F2 (J = N) spin components, primarily in the lower frequency region of the band. The lines corresponding to the F3 (J = N - 1) component are weak at lower frequencies and heavily congested in the central and higher frequency regions of the spectrum. Perturbations and predissociation phenomena have reduced the effective lifetime of the metastable 3A2 state and have also limited the number of transitions included in the least-squares fit of the band. Approximately 100 lines have been assigned in the range from 9100-9550 cm-1. Three rotational, three centrifugal distortion, three spin-rotation, and one spin-spin constant were varied.

These highly precise measurements cover the transitions from J = 2 &lt;-- 1 to J = 6 &lt;-- 5 with frequencies ranging from 220 to 661 GHz. For each of the five observed rotational transitions, the narrow linewidths of the saturation dips (about 20 kHz) permitted the resolution of the hyperfine splitting for the first time. This splitting is caused by the (13)C-nuclear spin-rotation interaction yielding a value for the nuclear spin-rotation coupling constant of C(I)((13)C(16)O). If combined with the beam measurements (C(I)((13)C(16)O) = 32.63(10) kHz), a slight J-dependence of the spin-rotation coupling constant can be determined (C(J) = 30 +/- 13 Hz). In addition, we have measured in the Doppler-limited mode several higher J rotational line positions of (13)C(16)O up to 991 GHz with an accuracy of 5 kHz.

By combining the measurements here with previously published microwave and infrared data in one global fit, an improved set of spectroscopic parameters for SiS has been derived which include several terms describing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. With this parameter set, highly accurate rotational frequencies for this important astronomical molecule can now be predicted well into the terahertz region.",

Empirical lower state energies of 59 transitions are determined from the ratio of the absolute absorption line strengths at 25 and 81 K.

Finally, a more precise analysis of the absorption spectrum has been achieved by taking into account anharmonicity of the C-H stretching and its coupling with the ring-puckering motion.",

These transitions could be unequivocally assigned since there was residual orthohydrogen at low temperatures (slow conversion to the ground state) resulting in an observable J=1--&gt;0 transition at 5 K (kT=0.48 meV). A doublet in neutron energy loss at approximately 28.5 meV is interpreted as J=1--&gt;2 transitions. In addition to the transitions between rotational states, there are a series of peaks that arise from transitions between center-of-mass translational quantum states of the confined hydrogen molecule. A band at approximately 9 meV can be unequivocally interpreted as a transition between translational states, while broad features at 20, 25, 35, and 50-60 meV are also interpreted to as transitions between translational quantum states. A detailed comparison is made with a recent five-dimensional quantum treatment of hydrogen in the smaller dodecahedral cage in the SII ice-clathrate structure. Although there is broad agreement regarding the features such as the splitting of the J=1 degeneracy, the magnitude of the external potential is overestimated. The numerous transitions between translational states predicted by this model are in poor agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons are also made with three simple exactly solved models, namely, a particle in a box, a particle in a sphere, and a particle on the surface of a sphere. Again, there are too many predicted features by the first two models, but there is reasonable agreement with the particle on a sphere model. This is consistent with published quantum chemistry results for hydrogen in the dodecahedral 5(12) cage, where the center of the cage is found to be energetically unfavorable, resulting in a shell-like confinement for the hydrogen molecule wave function. These results demonstrate that translational quantum effects are very significant and a classical treatment of the hydrogen molecule dynamics is inappropriate under such conditions.",

A preliminary analysis of the rotational structure of the absorption spectra of 16O3 and 18O3 shows that this spectral region corresponds to a superposition of two different electronic transitions, one with a very broad rotational structure, showing for the first time the asymmetric stretching frequency mode nu3 of the electronic state 3A2, the other formed by a completely diffuse band, probably the 2(1)(0) band of a new transition due to the triplet electronic state 3B2. Predissociation effects induce large broadening of the rotational lines for the transition centered at 10,473 cm-1 identified as the 3(2)(0) band of the 3A2 &lt;-- X1A1 electronic transition. The rotational structure cannot be analyzed directly but instead the band contour method was used to confirm the symmetry of the transition and to estimate the spectroscopic constants for the 16O isotopomer. The origin of the band is at 10,473 +/- 3 cm-1 and the value of the 16O3(3A2) antisymmetric stretching frequency mode is equal to 460 +/- 2 cm-1. We believe that the diffuse band is due to the 3B2 state and is located at about 10,363 +/- 3 cm-1 for 16O3 and 10,354 +/- 3 cm-1 for 18O3. The isotopic rules confirm the different results obtained for 18O3 and 16O3.",

Hyperfine structure in the rotational transitions of the lowest-energy fine structure component ((2)Pi(12) for C(5)H and C(7)H, and (2)Pi(32) for C(6)H) of each species was measured between 6 and 22 GHz, and precise rotational, centrifugal distortion, Lambda-doubling, and (13)C hyperfine coupling constants were determined. In addition, resolved hyperfine structure in the lowest rotational transition (J = 32--&gt;12) of the three (13)C isotopic species of C(3)H was measured by the same technique. By combining the centimeter-wave measurements here with previous millimeter-wave data, a complete set of (13)C hyperfine coupling constants were derived to high precision for each isotopic species. Experimental structures (r(0)) have been determined for C(5)H and the two longer carbon-chain radicals, and these are found to be in good agreement with the predictions of high-level coupled-cluster calculations. C(3)H, C(5)H, and C(7)H exhibit a clear alternation in the magnitude and sign of the (13)C hyperfine coupling constants along the carbon-chain backbone. Because the electron spin density is nominally zero at the central carbon atom of C(3)H, C(5)H, and C(7)H, and at alternating sets of carbon atoms of C(5)H and C(7)H, owing to spin polarization, almost all of the (13)C coupling constants at these atoms are small in magnitude and negative in sign. Spin-polarization effects are known to be important for the Fermi-contact (b(F)) term, but prior to the work here they have generally been neglected for the hyperfine terms a, c, and d.",

Contrary to what is usually assumed, the 3Q0+(A1), 3Q1(E), and 1Q(E)&lt;--X A1 transition moments are found to be strongly dependent on the C-I fragmentation coordinate.

It is predicted that significantly higher I* quantum yield values (&gt;0.9) may be achieved when vibrationally hot CH3I molecules are excited in the appropriate spectral range. It is shown that vibrational state control of the I*/I branching ratio in the alkyl (hydrogen) iodide photodissociation has an electronic rather than a dynamic nature: Due to a different electron density distribution at various molecular geometries, one achieves a more efficient excitation of a particular fragmentation channel rather than influences the dynamics of the decay process.",

Vibrational-state-specific total-removal relaxation rate coefficients, k(v) (M), for RbH(X1sigma+, v\" = 15-22) by M = H2 and N2 were investigated in a pump and probe configuration. By the overtone pumping with a cw diode laser, highly vibrational states v\" = 15-22 of RbH in its ground electronic state were obtained. Another diode laser was used to probe the prepared vibrational state. The decay signal of laser induced time-resolved fluorescence from A 1sigma+ (v') --&gt; X1sigma+ (v\") transition was monitored. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, the total relaxation rate coefficient k(v) (H2) were yielded. A plot of k(v) (H2 + N2) vs alpha (mole fraction H2) yields a line with a slope of k(v) (H2)-k(v) (N2) and an intercept of k(v) (N2).

Torsional splittings on the order of 0.03 cm(-1) were observed. With mm-wave methods, a total of 669 rotational transitions between 50 and 360 GHz have been measured at Doppler-limited resolution in the four lowest torsional states v(6) = 0, 1, 2, 3. The experimental uncertainty attained for an isolated line was better than 10 kHz below 150 GHz, and somewhat larger at higher frequencies. For v(6) = 3, torsional splittings as large as 8.7 MHz were observed. The global data set consisted of the current frequency determinations and the 443 measurements with molecular beam, microwave, and mm-wave methods analyzed by I. Ozier, J. Schroderus, S.-X. Wang, G. A. McRae, M. C. L. Gerry, B. Vogelsanger, and A. Bauder [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 190, 324-340 (1998)]. The observation of mm-wave R-branch transitions for v(6) = 1 led to a change in the J-assignment of the forbidden (Deltak = +/-3) transitions reported earlier for this torsional state. A good fit was obtained by varying 24 parameters in a Hamiltonian that represented both the torsional effects and the sextic splittings. In the earlier work, the large reduced barrier height led to high correlations among several of the torsional distortion constants. With the current measurements, many of these correlations are substantially reduced. Improved effective values were determined for the height V(3) of the hindering barrier and the first-order correction V(6) in the Fourier expansion of the potential function. The dipole function which characterizes the transition moment of the torsional overtone (v(6) = 2 &lt;-- 0) can be written as the product of a single effective dipole constant µ(T)(0,eff) and the appropriate off-diagonal matrix element of (1 - cos 3alpha)/2, where alpha is the torsional angle. From an intensity analysis of the infrared spectrum, it has been determined that |µ(T)(0,eff)| = 85.3(62) mD. A novel approach based on a simple regrouping of angular momentum operators is introduced for decoupling the torsional and rotational degrees of freedom. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.",

A Galatry profile was used to reproduce the measured line shape and derive the line strengths. The pressure shift of the O(2) and O(3) lines was accurately determined from a series of recordings with pressure ranging between 10 and 700 Torr. From an exhaustive review of the literature data, the list of H(2) absorption lines detected so far has been constructed.

The overall agreement between the theoretical and experimental values is found to be very good for the line positions. Some deviations for the intensities of the high overtone bands (V &gt; 2) are discussed in relation with possible pressure effects affecting the retrieved intensity values.

International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. B, Reciprocal space, 1st ed., edited by U. Shmueli, ch. 1.2. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Coppens (1997). X-ray Charge Densities and Chemical Bonding. New York: Oxford University Press]. Only in very special cases it is possible to derive an analytical representation of the normalization coefficients for 4 &lt; l ≤ 7 (Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988). In most cases for l &gt; 4 the density normalization coefficients were calculated numerically to within seven significant figures. In this study we review the literature on the density-normalized spherical harmonics, clarify the existing notations, use the Paturle-Coppens (Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988) method in the Wolfram Mathematica software to derive the Cartesian spherical harmonics for l ≤ 20 and determine the density normalization coefficients to 35 significant figures, and computer-generate a Fortran90 code. The article primarily targets researchers who work in the field of experimental X-ray electron density, but may be of some use to all who are interested in Cartesian spherical harmonics. ",

These transitions could be unequivocally assigned since there was residual orthohydrogen at low temperatures (slow conversion to the ground state) resulting in an observable J=1--&gt;0 transition at 5 K (kT=0.48 meV). A doublet in neutron energy loss at approximately 28.5 meV is interpreted as J=1--&gt;2 transitions. In addition to the transitions between rotational states, there are a series of peaks that arise from transitions between center-of-mass translational quantum states of the confined hydrogen molecule. A band at approximately 9 meV can be unequivocally interpreted as a transition between translational states, while broad features at 20, 25, 35, and 50-60 meV are also interpreted to as transitions between translational quantum states. A detailed comparison is made with a recent five-dimensional quantum treatment of hydrogen in the smaller dodecahedral cage in the SII ice-clathrate structure. Although there is broad agreement regarding the features such as the splitting of the J=1 degeneracy, the magnitude of the external potential is overestimated. The numerous transitions between translational states predicted by this model are in poor agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons are also made with three simple exactly solved models, namely, a particle in a box, a particle in a sphere, and a particle on the surface of a sphere. Again, there are too many predicted features by the first two models, but there is reasonable agreement with the particle on a sphere model. This is consistent with published quantum chemistry results for hydrogen in the dodecahedral 5(12) cage, where the center of the cage is found to be energetically unfavorable, resulting in a shell-like confinement for the hydrogen molecule wave function. These results demonstrate that translational quantum effects are very significant and a classical treatment of the hydrogen molecule dynamics is inappropriate under such conditions.",

Evaluation of the properties in an infinite crystal.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and precise evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Nguyen, Macchi &amp; Volkov (2020), Acta Cryst. A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

For the first time, electric dipole moments are also computed in the approach, including SO coupling for transitions to the states responsible for the first absorption continuum (A-band) of ArH(+). On this basis, the partial and total absorption spectra in this energy range are obtained. It is shown that absorption in the A-band is dominated by the parallel A(1)Sigma(+)&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) transition. In the low-energy part of the band (&lt;95 x 10(3) cm(-1)) the absorption is caused by the perpendicular B(1)Pi&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) excitation, but transitions to the b(3)Pi(0(+),1) states are also not negligible. The branching ratio Gamma for the final photodissociation products is calculated and it is shown to increase smoothly from 0 in the red tail of the band to 1 at E&gt;or= 10(5) cm(-1). The latter value corresponds to the exclusive formation of the spin-excited Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)) ions, and thus leads to the inverse population of the Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)-(2)P(3/2)) ion states.",

In order to resolve the disagreement, have performed high-precision variational calculations in Hylleraas coordinates.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J.

Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

A new calculation method of branching ratios for given total nuclear spins and scrambling mechanisms is also developed. The anisotropic long-range electrostatic interaction potential of H(2) in the Coulomb field of H(3) (+) is taken into account using the first-order perturbation theory in forming the complex. The CRPs and the product distribution of the ortho-para conversion reaction at very low energies with reactants in their ground vibronic and lowest rotational states for given initial nuclear spin species are presented as a function of collision energy assuming complete proton scrambling or incomplete proton scrambling.

The ET dependencies of the integral cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v=0-4)+He collisions in the ET range of 0-3 eV have also been measured using the VUV photoionization guided ion beam mass spectrometric technique, in which vibrationally selected HD+(v) reactant ions were prepared via excitation of selected autoionization resonances of HD. At low total energies, a pronounced isotope effect is observed in absolute integral cross sections for the HeH++D and HeD++H channels with significant favoring of the deuteron transfer channel. As v is increased in the range of v=0-9, the integral cross sections of the HeH++D channel are found to approach those of HeD++H.

The agreement between the experimental and QCT cross sections improves with translational energy. Except for prethreshold reactivity, QCT calculations ignoring the zero-point energy in the products are generally in good agreement with experimental absolute cross sections. The experimental HeH+/HeD+ branching ratios for the HD+(v=0-9)+He collisions are generally consistent with QCT predictions.

The potential of classical microdosimetry to offer a viable and simpler alternative to more elaborate mechanistic approaches for practical applications is discussed. Track-structure simulations with the Geant4-DNA low-energy extension of the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit were used for calculating lineal energy spectra in spherical volumes with dimensions relevant to double-strand-break (DSB) induction. The microdosimetric spectra were then used to calculate the yield of simple and clustered DSB based on literature values of the threshold energy of DNA damage. The influence of the different implementations of the dielectric function of liquid water available in Geant4-DNA (Option 2 and Option 4 constructors), as well as the effect of particle tracking cutoff energy and target size are examined. Frequency- and dose-mean lineal energies in liquid-water spheres of 2, 2.3, 2.6, and 3.4 nm diameter, as well as, number of simple and clustered DSB/Gy/cell are presented for electrons over the 100 eV to 100 keV energy range. Results are presented for both the 'default' (Option 2) and 'Ioannina' (Option 4) physics models of Geant4-DNA applying several commonly used tracking cutoff energies (10, 20, 50, 100 eV). Overall, the choice of the physics model and target diameter has a moderate effect (up to ~10%-30%) on the DSB yield whereas the effect of the tracking cutoff energy may be significant (&gt;100%). Importantly, the yield of both simple and clustered DSB was found to vary significantly (by a factor of 2 or more) with electron energy over the examined range. The yields of electron-induced simple and clustered DSB exhibit a strong energy dependence over the 100 eV-100 keV range with implications to radiation quality issues. It is shown that a classical microdosimetry approach for the calculation of DNA damage based on lineal energy spectra in nanometer-size targets predicts comparable results to computationally intensive mechanistic approaches which use detailed atomistic DNA geometries, thus, offering a relatively simple and robust alternative for some practical applications.",

Calculation of dynamic correlation effects was performed using the multistate complete active space second-order perturbation method, based on state-averaged complete active space self-consistent-field reference wave functions obtained with seven active electrons in an active space of 16 molecular orbitals. A relativistic atomic natural orbital-type basis set from the MOLCAS library was used for Cr. Good agreement is found between the current calculations and experiment for the lowest two (6)Sigma(+) states, the only states for which spectroscopic data are available. Potential curves for the 3 (6)Sigma(+) and 2 (6)Pi states are complicated by avoided crossings with higher states of the same symmetry, thus resulting in double-well structures for these two states.

R-branch (J + 1 &lt;-- J) transitions for J = 0, 1 and Q-branch rotational transitions for the v5 = 1 vibrational state have been measured by waveguide Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy in the range 8-26.5 GHz. The Q-branch transitions include 28 direct l-type doubling transitions (kl = +1, A1) &lt;--&gt; (kl = +1, A2) with J &lt; or = 62, and 108 direct l-type resonance transitions following the selection rule delta k = delta l = +/-2 with J &lt; or = 60 and G = |k - l| &lt; or = 3. A process called \"regional resonance\" was observed in which a cluster of levels interacted strongly over a large range in J. This process led to the observation of 55 perturbation-allowed transitions following the selection rules delta(k - l) = +/-3, +/-6. In particular, (kl = +1, A+) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -2, A-), (kl = +4, A+) &lt;--&gt; (kl = +1, A-), (kl = +2) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -1), (kl = +3) &lt;--&gt; (kl = 0), (kl = +2) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -3), and (kl = +3) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -3). The various aspects of the regional resonances are discussed in detail.

On the other hand, reductions with the (delta k = +/-1, deltal = -/+2) interaction parameter q12 fixed to zero failed to reproduce the experimental data since the parameters defining the reduction transformation do not arise in the correct order of magnitude. The ground-state data have been analyzed including parameters up to fourth order constraining either parameters of the delta k = +/-3 interactions to zero (reduction A), or of the delta k = +/-6 interactions to zero (reduction B).

The glass-vapor interface was considered as two distinct regions, a wavelength-thickness vapor layer joined to the surface and a more remote vapor region. The first region was analyzed as a spectral filter that annihilates the absorbed photons and the second one as a rich spectral light source. The experimental setup is described. A Rb reference cell (T = 293 K) was used. A part of the laser beam scanned the 5S1/2(F = 3) --&gt; 5P3/2(F' = 2,3,4) transition. The Doppler broadened absorption profile (FWHM = 510 MHz) was determined. The laser detuning of the profile-center relative to the F = 3 --&gt; F' = 4 transition was about 70 MHz. Another laser beam was directed to the entrance cell window. The resonant retrofluorescence S(ob)(upsilon(L)) as a function of laser detuning for a cell temperature approximately 130 degrees C and laser power 0.4 mW was obtained. We can extract the experimental signal sexp(n) (upsilon(L)) originating from the near-field region by subtracting signal S(T) (upsilon(L)) originating from the far-field region from the total experiment signal S(ob)(upsilon(L)). A fit of the normalized profile of the data corresponding to the spectral band centered on the F' = 4 --&gt; F = 3 hyperfine transition line was obtained by using a Lorentzian distribution function with GammaRF = 50 MHz full width at half-maximum. The role played by different relaxation processes contributing to the retrofluorescent atomic linewidth was characterized. The authors summed up the corresponding spectral broadening and obtained the relation GammaRF = Gamman + Gammacoll + Gammanr, where Gammacoll is the resonance collisional broadening of the hyperfine line, and Gammanr is an additional broadening induced by the nonradiative energy-transfer phenomena of the excited atoms near the cell window surface. To evaluate Gammacoll, we used the relation Gammacoll = gammaRb - RbN, where gammaRb - Rb is line broadening parameter, and N is Rb atom number density. The effective nonradiative relaxation rate of the 5P3/2(F' = 4) energy hyperfine level was estimated to be AF(nr) = 4 --&gt; F = 3 = 2.4 x 10(8) s(-1). The value of A(nr) seems relatively large compared to the spontaneous emission rate A(5P3/2 --&gt; 5P1/2) = 1.4 x 10(7) s(-1).",

The 5P3/2 state was populated by the energy transfer process: Rb(5P1/2)+Rb(5S1/2) --&gt; Rb(5P3/2)+Rb(5Sl/2). The resulting densities of Rb atoms at the 5P1/2 level were obtained from the absorption of narrow spectral line from a Rb hollow cathode lamp, connecting the 5P1/2 state to 7S state. Since the effective lifetimes of the 5P1/2 and 5P3/2 states are approximately equal, the densities of the 5P3/2 level were obtained from the D2 to D1 fluorescence ratios where D1 and D2 are lines of the 5P1/2 --&gt; 5S1/2 and 5P3/2 --&gt; 5S1/2 transition. Because the time of the fine structure exchanging is much shorter than the lifetime of the 5D state, the fluorescence originating from the 5D state produced by the 5P1/2 + 5P3/2 and 5P3/2 + 5P3/2 processes follows the instantaneous production rate of the 5P1/2 + 5P1/2 process. It is clear that 5P/2 + 5P3/2 and 5P3/2 + 5P3/2 collisions can significantly influence the results obtained for the 5P1/2 + 5P1/2 rate since the energy defect for 5D state is much smaller for 5P1/2 + 5P3/2 and 5P3/2 + 5P3/2 collisions than for 5P1/2 + 5P1/2 collisions. Effective lifetimes of the 5P levels were calculated using radiation trapping theory. The time-integrated populations and signals were studied and analyzed. The resulting fluorescence included the direct component emitted in the decay of the optically excited 5P1/2 state and the sensitized component arising from the collisions for populating 5D state at different cell temperature. These relative intensities were combined with the measured excited atom densities to yield absolute energy-pooling rate coefficients. The cross sections (in units of 10(-14) cm2) for the energy-pooling collisions [i. e. , 5P1/2 + 5P1/2, 5P1/2 + 5P3/2, 5P3/2 + 5P3/2] are 0.78, 2.9 and 3.1, respectively. The dependence of the rates upon energy defect deltaE was examined, but the 5D3/2 level was approximately equally populated in 5P3/2 + 5P3/2 (deltaE = 68 cm(-1)) and 5P3/2 + 5P1/2 (deltaE = 306 cm(-1)) collisions. The 5P1/2 + 5P3/2 collisions are as efficient as 5P3/2 + 5P3/2 for populating 5D3/2 state.",

It is well known that each coefficient c(k)(t) separates into an adiabatic term a(k)(t) that reflects the adjustment of the ground state to the perturbation--without actual transitions--and a nonadiabatic term b(k)(t) that yields the probability amplitude for a transition to the excited state. In this work, we prove that the energy at any time t also separates completely into adiabatic and nonadiabatic components, after accounting for the secular and normalization terms that appear in the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation via Dirac's method of variation of constants. This result is derived explicitly through third order in the perturbation. We prove that the cross-terms between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts of c(k)(t) vanish, when the energy at time t is determined as an expectation value. The adiabatic term in the energy is identical to the total energy obtained from static perturbation theory, for a system exposed to the instantaneous perturbation λH'(t). The nonadiabatic term is a sum over excited states ∣k&gt; of the transition probability multiplied by the transition energy. By evaluating the probabilities of transition to the excited eigenstates ∣k'(t)&gt; of the instantaneous Hamiltonian H(t), we provide a physically transparent explanation of the result for E(t). To lowest order in the perturbation parameter λ, the probability of finding the system in state ∣k'(t)&gt; is given by λ(2) ∣b(k)(t)∣(2). At third order, the transition probability depends on a second-order transition coefficient, derived in this work.

Supersonically cooled formaldehyde was excited into selected J(Ka,Kc) rotational states of six vibrational levels (1(1)4(1), 5(1), 2(2)6(1), 2(2)4(3), 2(3)4(1), and 2(4)4(1)) in the A((1)A2) state.

When formaldehyde was excited into the low-lying levels 1(1)4(1), 5(1), and 2(2)6(1), at E(avail)&lt;1120 cm(-1), the product state distribution can be modeled qualitatively by phase space theory. These dynamics are interpreted as arising from a reaction path on the barrierless S0 surface. When the initial states 2(2)4(3) and 2(3)4(1) were excited (E(avail)=1120-1500 cm(-1)), a second type of product state distribution appeared. This second distribution peaked sharply at low N, Ka and was severely truncated in comparison with those obtained from the lower lying states. At the even higher energy of 2(4)4(1) (E(avail) approximately 2600 cm(-1)) the sharply peaked distribution appears to be dominant. We attribute this change in dynamics to the opening up of the triplet channel to produce HCO. The theoretical height of the barrier on the T1 surface lies between 1700 and 2100 cm(-1) and so we consider the triplet reaction to proceed via tunneling at the intermediate energies and proceed over the barrier at the higher energies. Considerable population was observed in the excited (0,0,1) state for all initial H(2)CO states that lie above the appearance energy. Rotational populations in the (0,0,1) state dropped more rapidly with (N,Ka) than did the equivalent populations in (0,0,0). This indicates that, although individual rotational states are highly populated in (0,0,1), the total v3=1 population might not be so large. Specific population was also measured in the almost isoenergetic Kc and J states. No consistent population preference was found for either asymmetry or spin-rotation component.",

MnXe exhibits only a single thermally stable site whose emission at 620 nm is similar to the broad a 6D bands produced with blue-site excitation in Ar and Kr. Thus in Ar(Kr), excitation of the red site at 393 (400) nm produces narrow line emissions at 427.5 (427.8) and 590 (585.7) nm. From their spectral positions, linewidths, and long decay times, these emission bands are assigned to the a 4D72 and a 6D92 states, respectively. Excitation of the blue site at 380 (385.5) nm produces broad emission at 413 (416) nm which, because of its nanosecond radiative lifetime, is assigned to resonance z 6P --&gt; a 6S fluorescence. Emission bands at 438 (440) and 625 (626.8) nm, also produced with blue-site excitation, are broader than their red-site equivalents at 427.5 and 590 nm (427.8 and 585.7 nm in Kr) but from their millisecond and microsecond decay times are assigned to the a 4D and a 6D states. The line features observed in high resolution scans of the red-site emission at 427.5 and 427.8 nm in MnAr and MnKr, respectively, have been analyzed with the W(p) optical line shape function and identified as resolved phonon structure originating from very weak (S=0.4) electron-phonon coupling. The presence of considerable hot-phonon emission (even in 12 K spectra) and the existence of crystal field splittings of 35 and 45 cm(-1) on the excited a 4D72 level in Ar and Kr matrices have been identified in W(p) line shape fits. The measured matrix lifetimes for the narrow red-site a 6D state emissions (0.29 and 0.65 ms) in Ar and Kr are much shorter than the calculated (3 s) gas phase value.

The principal focus is on the vibronic contributions, and the correlated distortions of the bipyridine ligand in the emitting MLCT excited state. To address the issues that are involved, the emission band shape at 77 K is interpreted as the sum of a fundamental component, corresponding to the {e,0'} --&gt; {g,0} transition, and progressions in the ground-state vibrational modes that correlate with the excited-state distortion. Literature values of the vibrational parameters determined from the resonance-Raman (rR) for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ are used to model the emission spectra and to evaluate the spectral analysis. The Gaussian fundamental component with an energy Ef and bandwidth Deltanu1/2 is deconvoluted from the observed emission spectrum. The first-, second-, and third-order terms in the progressions of the vibrational modes that contribute to the band shape are evaluated as the sums of Gaussian-shaped contributions of width Deltanu1/2. The fundamental and the rR parameters give an excellent fit of the observed emission spectrum of [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+, but not as good for the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ emission spectrum probably because the Franck-Condon excited state probed by the rR is different in symmetry from the emitting MLCT excited state. Variations in vibronic contributions for the series of complexes are evaluated in terms of reorganizational energy profiles (emreps, Lambdax) derived from the observed spectra, and modeled using the rR parameters. This modeling demonstrates that most of the intensity of the vibronic envelopes obtained from the frozen solution emission spectra arises from the overlapping of first-order vibronic contributions of significant bandwidth with additional convoluted contributions of higher order vibronic terms. The emrep amplitudes of these complexes have their maxima at about 1500 cm(-1) in frozen solution, and Lambdax(max) decreases systematically by approximately 2-fold as Ef decreases from 17,220 for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to 12,040 cm(-1) for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ through the series of complexes. Corrections for higher order contributions and bandwidth differences based on the modeling with rR parameters indicate that the variations in Lambdax(max) imply somewhat larger decreases in first-order bpy vibrational reorganizational energies. The large attenuation of vibrational reorganizational energies of the [Ru(Am)6-2n(bpy)n]2+ complexes contrasts with the apparent similarity of reorganizational energy amplitudes for the absorption and emission of [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+. These observations are consistent with increasing and very substantial excited-state/ground-state configurational mixing and decreasing excited-state distortion as Ef decreases, but more severe attenuation for singlet/singlet than triplet/singlet mixing (alphage &gt; alphaeg for the configurational mixing coefficients at the ground-state and excited-state potential energy minima, respectively); it is inferred that 0.18 &gt; or = alphage2 &gt; or = 0.09 for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and 0.37 &gt; or = alphage2 &gt; or = 0.18 for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ in DMSO/water glasses, where the ranges are based on models that there is or is not a spin restriction on configurational mixing (alphage &gt; alphaeg and alphage = alphaeg), respectively, for these complexes.",

The last of these is obtained via a UV-labeling technique and represents the first observation of the A &lt;-- X transition. The emission spectrum yields extensive assignments for the 0-4, 0-5, and 1-4 bands of beta --&gt; A, with both e and f lines identified. The well-known perturbation in v = 7 of the B state is attributed to interaction with v = 9 of A. A newly identified perturbation in B(6) involves coupling with A(8). The known perturbation in B(8) may involve A(11), but other assignments cannot be ruled out. Approximate potential curves are derived for all three valence states and used to compute the vibrational factors for the perturbations, permitting extraction of the electronic coupling strengths. The B-A coupling elements are within approximately 10% of expectations for rotation-electronic coupling within a Hund's case (a) 3Pi manifold, but the strength of the perturbation between A(5) and A'(6) is only about 30% of predictions for this model.

The vibrational levels of RbH(X1sigma+,v\" = 0-2) generated in the reaction of Rb(6D) with H2. Vibrational-state-specific total-removal relaxation rate coefficients, k(v) (M), for RbH(X1sigma+, v\" = 15-22) by M = H2 and N2 were investigated in a pump and probe configuration. By the overtone pumping with a cw diode laser, highly vibrational states v\" = 15-22 of RbH in its ground electronic state were obtained. Another diode laser was used to probe the prepared vibrational state. The decay signal of laser induced time-resolved fluorescence from A 1sigma+ (v') --&gt; X1sigma+ (v\") transition was monitored. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, the total relaxation rate coefficient k(v) (H2) were yielded. A plot of k(v) (H2 + N2) vs alpha (mole fraction H2) yields a line with a slope of k(v) (H2)-k(v) (N2) and an intercept of k(v) (N2). The values of k(v) (H2) obtained from the slope of the fitted lines compare well with determined values of the k(v) (H2) from the Sern-Volmer plots. At v\" &lt; 18, the rate coefficients k(v) (M) increases linearly with vibrational quantum number. This linear region is dominated by single quantum relaxation (deltav = 1) collisional propensity rules. The region (v\" &gt; or = 18) where the dependence is much stronger than linear shows significant contribution from multiquantum (deltav &gt; or = 2) relaxation or resonant vibration-vibration energy transfer between highly vibrationally excited RbH and H2 or N2. For RbH(v\") + N2 (0), we measured the time-profile of v\" = 16 after preparation of v\" = 21. A clear bimodal distribution was observed. The first peak is due to resonant vibration-vibration energy transfer: RbH (v\" = 21) + N2 (0) --&gt; RbH (v\" = 16) + N2 (1). The much broader second peak, at longer time delays, is due to sequential single-quantum relaxation. Although the second process results in a distribution that is much more spread out in time, the peak height is in the same order of magnitude, indicating that the two processes are at least comparable in probability.",

One was for the H<sub3</sub proton in apopinenone and other α,β unsaturated ketones; the others occurred for protons in close proximity to hydroxyl groups. To provide more information, smaller analogues of known geometry and chemical shifts were subject to the same analysis. In cyclopentenone, the Gaussian geometry gave good agreement with the observed shifts, but the MMFF94, MMX and MM3 geometries all gave errors for different protons. These results show clearly that the molecular geometries of the α,β unsaturated ketones are responsible for the errors. The errors for the alcohols were examined using ethanol as model and were shown to be due to the different possible conformations of the OH group. Similar GIAO calculations on substituted methanes gave good agreement for the methyl compounds but poor agreement for di and tri halosubstituted methanes. The aforementioned method of molecular mechanics plus GIAO calculations is shown to be a very useful tool for the investigation of molecular geometries and conformations. However, multihalogen compounds may require different basis sets for accurate calculations. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

Nondestructive structure selection of the complexes and the dipole moment determination were performed by using a 2-m electrostatic hexapole field. The experimentally determined permanent dipole moments are 1.2 +/- 0.1 D for Al-CH(3)CN and 2.7 +/- 0.2 D for Al-NH(3). We find that the dipole moment of Al-NH(3) becomes larger than that of neat NH(3), while the formation of the Al-CH(3)CN complex produces a smaller dipole moment than that of neat CH(3)CN on the other hand. We performed the ab initio calculations to draw out plausible complex structures and to clarify the bonding character after formation of the complex, and we made comparisons with the computational results done by several groups. The Mulliken population analysis suggests the Al--&gt;CH(3)CN charge flow, but on the other hand the Natural population analysis indicates very little charge flow. For the Al-NH(3) complex, the polarization effect of NH(3) and the N--&gt;Al sigma donation would enhance the dipole moment strength. However, there still remains a controversial disagreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. Further experimental determination using the hexapole method for various metal-ligand complexes and clusters could reveal the basic nature of interaction in the complex systems in general, and this method would complement theoretical calculations.",

The GED data were augmented by molecular orbital calculations, and the analysis was aided by use of rotational constants from microwave (MW) spectroscopy.

The gauche-trans (gt) orientation of the CH2OH group is favourable to both neutral and protonated forms of diosgenyl glucosides at the PM3 level. DFT studies also predict conformational mixtures for both neutral and protonated forms of simplified diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosides. These investigations showed unequivocally the preference for the ccw arrangement over cw, and that values of angle φ concur with the exo-anomeric effect. The B3LYP functional predicts the greater stability of the gt and tg orientations for the neutral and protonated analogues respectively. According to both PM3 and B3LYP calculations, torsion angle ψ has only a minor influence on the conformational energy. The importance of the geometry parameters affecting the stability of these conformers appears to be as follows: angle φ≈NH2/ccw/cw&gt;gg/gt/tg&gt;angle ψ.",

The overall conformation of an oligosaccharide depends primarily on the orientation of the torsion angles (phi, psi, and omega) between glycosyl residues. Numerous experimental studies have shown that in glucopyranosides the omega-torsion angle (O(6)-C(6)-C(5)-O(5)) displays a preference for gauche orientations, in disagreement with predictions based on gas-phase quantum mechanics calculations. In contrast, the omega-angle in galactopyranosides displays a high proportion of the anti-orientation. For oligosaccharides containing glycosidic linkages at the 6-position (1--&gt;6 linked), variations in rotamer population have a direct effect on the oligosaccharides' structure and function, and yet the physical origin of these conformational preferences remains unclear. Although it is generally recognized that the gauche effect in carbohydrates is a solvent-dependent phenomenon, the mechanism through which solvent induces the gauche preference is not understood. In the present work, quantum mechanics and solvated molecular dynamics calculations were performed on two representative carbohydrates, methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside and methyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside. We show that correct reproduction of the experimental rotamer distributions about the omega-angles is obtained only after explicit water is included in the molecular dynamics simulations. The primary role of the water appears to be to disrupt the hydrogen bonding within the carbohydrate, thereby allowing the rotamer populations to be determined by internal electronic and steric repulsions between the oxygen atoms. The results reported here provide a quantitative explanation of the conformational behavior of (1--&gt;6)-linked carbohydrates.",

In this study, the two issues are addressed in the context of a decaalanine peptide in water, by considering the 310-, α-, and π-helical states. The simulations rely on the ball-and-stick local-elevation umbrella-sampling (B&amp;S-LEUS) method. In this scheme, the states are defined as hyperspheres (balls) in a (possibly high dimensional) collective-coordinate space and connected by hypercylinders (sticks) to ensure transitions. A new object, the pipe, is also introduced here to handle curvilinear pathways. Optimal sampling within the so-defined space is ensured by confinement and (one-dimensional) memory-based biasing potentials associated with the three different kinds of objects. The simulation results are then analysed in terms of free energies using reweighting, possibly relying on two distinct sets of collective coordinates for the state definition and analysis. The four possible choices considered for these sets are Cartesian coordinates, hydrogen-bond distances, backbone dihedral angles, or pairwise sums of successive backbone dihedral angles. The results concerning decaalanine underline that the concept of conformational state may be extremely ambiguous, and that its tentative absolute definition as a free-energy basin remains subordinated to the choice of a specific analysis space. For example, within the force-field employed and depending on the analysis coordinates selected, the 310-helical state may refer to weakly overlapping collections of conformations, differing by as much as 25 kJ mol(-1) in terms of free energy. As another example, the π-helical state appears to correspond to a free-energy basin for three choices of analysis coordinates, but to be unstable with the fourth one. The problem of conformational-state definition may become even more intricate when comparison with experiment is involved, where the state definition relies on spectroscopic or functional observables.

These results are consistent with the existence of four bound isomers: OC-HI, OC-IH, CO-HI, and CO-IH. Analysis also leads to unequivocal characterization of the common isotopic ground state as having the OC-HI structure and with the first excited state having the OC-IH structure with an energy of 3.4683(80) cm(-1) above the ground state. The potential is consistent with the following barriers between the pairs of isomers: 382(4) cm(-1) (OC-IH/OC-HI), 294(5) cm(-1) (CO-IH/CO-HI), 324(3) cm(-1) (OC-IH/CO-IH), and 301(2) cm(-1) (OC-HI/CO-HI) defined with respect to each lower minimum.

A fundamentally new molecular phenomenon - ground state isotopic isomerization is proposed based on the generated semiempirical potential. The protonated ground state hydrogen-bonded OC-HI structure is predicted to be converted on deuteration to the corresponding ground state van der Waals OC-ID isomeric structure. This results in a large anomalous isotope effect in which the R(0) center of mass distance between monomeric components changes from 4.895(1) to 4.286(1) Å.

At low pH, the conformational equilibrium is heavily weighted toward the gauche-hydroxyl rotamers with a range of 81% in DMSO-d(6) to 92% in tert-butyl alcohol-d(10).

Thus, replacing L-Ala by D-Ala at both L1 and L2 of a common beta turn may contribute as much as 6 kcal/mol toward its refolding as an inverse-common beta turn.",

Analysis of the symmetry of the conformation space defined by the three M-P-X-C (X = CH(2) or O) torsion angles (t(1-3)) implies the existence of seven unique conformer types (A (aaa), B (g(+)g(+)g(+)), C (ag(+)g(+)), D (aag(+)), E (g(-)ag(+)), F (ag(-)g(+)), G (g(-)g(+)g(+)) and their symmetry equivalents) arising from the combinations of g(-), g(+) and a torsions. These conformers are observed in 1972 M-PEt(3) and 735 M-P(OMe)(3) fragments from crystal structures of metal complexes in the CSD following the popularity sequence: F &gt; C &gt;&gt; D &gt; B &gt; G &gt; E &gt;&gt; A for M-PEt(3); and: C &gt; D &gt; F &gt;&gt; E &gt;&gt; A, B, G. for M-P(OMe)(3). Pathways for low-energy interconversion of these conformers, dominated by single chain flip routes, are readily inferred for M-P(OMe)(3). The conformers of M-PEt(3) are apparently less readily interconverted. The popularity of conformations is only loosely related to the energies of these conformations as calculated by DFT or MM methods for two-, four- (square planar) and six-coordinate metal complexes of these ligands (and free PEt(3) and P(OMe)(3)). It would appear that the conformational preferences observed are determined by a balance between intra-ligand effects (repulsion between chains and avoidance of syn-pentane-like); inter-ligand effects (repulsions between gauche substituents at P and cis co-ligands notably when the coordination number at the metal is high); and residual anomeric effects (weakly favouring anti conformations in P(OMe)(3) species).",

In order to find the most appropriate backbone parameters, close to 100 000 different combinations of parameters have been screened.

To first order in perturbation theory, the ZFS arises from the direct spin-spin dipole-dipole interaction. To second order, contributions arise from spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The latter contributions are difficult to treat since the SOC mixes states of different multiplicities. This is an aspect of dominant importance for the correct prediction of the D tensor. In this work, the theory of the D tensor is discussed from the point of view of analytic derivative theory. Starting from a general earlier perturbation treatment [F. Neese and E. I. Soloman, Inorg. Chem. 37, 6568 (1998)], straightforward response equations are derived that are readily transferred to the self-consistent field (SCF) Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional theory (DFT) framework. The main additional effort in such calculations arises from the solution of nine sets of nonstandard coupled-perturbed SCF equations. These equations have been implemented together with the spin-orbit mean-field representation of the SOC operator and a mean-field treatment of the direct spin-spin interaction into the ORCA electronic structure program. A series of test calculations on diatomic molecules with accurately known zero-field splittings shows that the new approach corrects most of the shortcomings of previous DFT based methods and, on average, leads to predictions within 10% of the experimental values. The slope of the correlation line is essentially unity for the B3LYP and BLYP functionals compared to approximately 0.5 in previous treatments.",

The rates are calculated on the basis of a microcanonical approach using the Langevin model and the conservation laws of mass, energy, angular momentum, and nuclear spin. Full scrambling of all five nuclei during the collision is assumed for the calculations and alternatively partial dynamical restrictions are considered. The ergodic principle of the collision is employed in two limiting cases, neglecting (weak ergodic limit) or accounting for explicit degeneracies of the reaction mechanisms (strong ergodic limit). The resulting sets of rate coefficients are shown to be consistent with the detailed balance and thermodynamical equilibrium constants. Rate coefficients, k(T), for the deuteration chain of H(3)(+) with HD as well as H(2)D(+)/H(3)(+) equilibrium ratios have been measured in a variable temperature 22-pole ion trap. In particular, the D(2)H(+) + HD --&gt; D(3)(+) + H(2) rate coefficient indicates a change in reaction mechanism when going to higher temperatures.

Ab initio multireference configuration interaction calculations were performed on both barrierless PESs (where the minimum energy path involves the insertion of the O atom into the middle of the H2(+) bond), and suitable analytical expressions were developed for the first time and used in quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations. k(1) ≈ 3k(2) independent of the isotopic variant, k(H2(+)) &gt; k(HD(+)) &gt; k(D2(+)) for , and the intermolecular and intramolecular isotopic effects are essentially independent of T.

The larger value of σ(1(2)A'') with respect to σ(1(2)A') arises from the larger value of bmax(1(2)A'') with respect to bmax(1(2)A'), and this results from the more attractive character of the former PES. Besides, the reaction probabilities are quite large [0.78-0.98 (1(2)A'') and 0.78-0.93 (1(2)A')], and the decreasing trend of both cross-sections as Ecol increases arises from the barrierless character of both PESs. We expect that these results (in particular, the competition between proton transfer and hydrogen atom transfer) will encourage experimentalists to carry out investigations on this interesting reaction.

Comparison with the high resolution experiments of Davis and co-workers (Science, 2000, 290, 958) shows that the structures (peaks) found in the relative translational energy distributions of products could not be satisfactorily reproduced in the calculations, probably due to the classical nature of the QCT method and the importance of quantum effects.

Overall, both surfaces led to similar results, although the YZCL2 surface is more accurate to describe the H(3)O PES, as derived from comparison with high level ab initio results.

The WP-EQM calculations include all total angular momenta up to J(max) = 50, and therefore the various dynamical observables are converged up to 0.6 eV. It has been found that it is necessary to include all Coriolis couplings to obtain reliable converged results. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods are thoroughly compared as a function of the total energy for a series of J values. Comparisons are also made of total reaction cross sections as function of the collision energy, and rate constants. In addition, opacity functions, integral cross sections (ICS) and differential cross sections (DCS) are presented at 102 meV, 201.3 meV and 524.6 meV collision energy. The agreement between the three sets of results is only qualitative. The QCT calculations fail to describe the overall reactivity and most of the dynamical observables correctly. At low collision energies, the QCT method is plagued by the lack of conservation of zero point energy, whilst at higher collision energies and/or total angular momenta, the appearance of an effective repulsive potential associated with the centrifugal motion \"over\" the well causes a substantial decrease of the reactivity. In turn, the statistical models overestimate the reactivity over the whole range of collision energies as compared with the WP-EQM method. Specifically, at sufficiently high collision energies the reaction cannot be deemed to be statistical and important dynamical effects seem to be present. In general the WP-EQM results lie in between those obtained using the QCT and SQCT methods. One of the main, unexpected, conclusions of this work is that an accurate description of the reaction and of its various dynamical features requires a computationally expensive, accurate quantum mechanical treatment.",

A range of VDW binding energies from 1.5 to 9.0 kcal mol(-1) are investigated. The anisotropic PES for the ClO.N(2) complex and a separable anharmonic oscillator approximation are used to estimate the equilibrium constant for formation of the VDW complex. Rate constants, branching ratios to produce ClOOCl, and nascent energy distributions of excited ClOOCl* are discussed with respect to the VDW binding energy and temperature. Interestingly, even for weak VDW binding energies, the N(2) usually carries away enough energy to stabilize the nascent ClOOCl*, although the VDW equilibrium constant is small. For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant.

The thermodynamic parameters associated with the melting-freezing transition have been determined to four digit accuracy, which generates accurate new values for the coexistence properties of the HS system.

Moreover, it is found that there is a density dependence of the value of the slope in the linear regime. The density dependent correction becomes practically insignificant at higher densities and the hydrodynamic formula found in the literature is still accurate. However, with decreasing density the density dependence of the size correction cannot be neglected, which indicates that other sources of N-dependence, apart from those derived on purely hydrodynamic grounds, may also be important (and as yet unaccounted for).

The fitted dissociation energy (D(e)) is compared with the precisely known value based on the recent analysis of data from a two-photon transfer process (STIRAP) in ultracold Cs atoms. It is concluded that hyperfine effects in the X (1)Sigma(g)(+) state are not negligible, and that the estimate of D(e)=3649.84(7) cm(-1) obtained in this work represents an effective dissociation limit lying between the two lowest hyperfine limits. Precise rotational and centrifugal distortion constants for the ground electronic state have also been calculated through conventional perturbation theory. These estimates are fully consistent with the derived potential function and the experimental spectroscopic information.",

To each subsystem associated is a set of partner subsystems defined by a vicinity criterion. In the independent calculations of intra- and intersystem energies, the calculations are performed on model subsystems defined by the subsystems considered and their partner subsystems. A small and a large basis set are associated with each subsystem. For partner subsystems in a model system, the small basis set is adopted. By introducing a particular decomposition scheme, the intermolecular potential is written as a sum of effective one-body potentials. The binding energy per atom in an infinite crystal of atoms is the negative value of this one-body potential. The one-body potentials for hcp and fcc structures are calculated for the following nearest neighbor distances (d0): 4.6, 5.1, 5.4, 5.435, 5.5, 5.61, and 6.1 a.u.

The 3Q0+ state converging to the excited I(2P1/2o) limit is found to possess a shallow minimum of 850 cm(-1) strongly shifted to larger internuclear distances (RC-I approximately 6.5a0) relative to the ground state. This makes a commonly employed single-exponent approximation for analysis of the CH3I fragmentation dynamics unsuitable. The 4E(3A1) state dissociating to the same atomic limit is calculated to lie too high in the Franck-Condon region to have any significant impact on the A-band absorption. The computed vertical excitation energies for the 3Q1, 3Q0+, and 1Q states indicate that the A-band spectrum must lie approximately between 33,000 and 44,300 cm(-1), i.e., between 225 and 300 nm. This result is in very good agreement with the experimental findings. The lowest Rydberg states are computed to lie at &gt;or=49,000 cm(-1) and correspond to the ...a(1)2n3a1(6sI) leading configuration. They are responsible for the vacuum ultraviolet absorption lines found experimentally beyond the A-band spectrum at 201.1 nm (49,722 cm(-1)) and higher.",

In this case, the predominant coefficient of the expansion assumes its maximum value when S=M.

A three-dimensional potential-energy surface is determined by a least-squares fitting with initial values of the parameters for the potential obtained by ab initio calculations at the RCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The potential well reproduces all the observed data in the microwave and millimeter wave regions with parity doublings and hyperfine splittings.

The analysis includes channels occurring entirely on either the singlet or the triplet surface as well as those involving an intersystem crossing. RRKM-based multiple well calculations allow the prediction of rate constants in the temperature range of 300-2000 K between 0.1 and 10 bar. Of the SH recombined on the singlet surface, the stabilization of the rovibrationally excited adduct HSSH is at the low-pressure limit at 1 bar, but it has a rate comparable to that forming another major set of products H(2)S + S (via an intersystem crossing) at temperatures below 1000 K; at higher temperatures, HSS + H becomes the dominant product. For the reaction H(2)S + S, the presence of an intersystem crossing allows the formation of the singlet excited adduct H(2)SS, most of which rearranges and stabilizes as HSSH under atmospheric conditions. At high temperatures, the majority of excited HSSH dissociates to SH + SH and HSS + H. Compared to reported shock tube measurements of the reaction H(2)S + S, most of the S atom consumption can be described by the triplet abstraction route H(2)S + S --&gt; SH + SH, especially at high temperatures, but inclusion of the singlet insertion channel provides a better description of the experimental data. The reaction HSS + H was found to proceed predominantly on the singlet surface without a chemical barrier. The formation of the major product channel SH + SH is very fast at room temperature (approximately 4 x 10(15) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)). While the formation of H(2)S + S or S(2) + H(2) via an isomerization or an intersystem crossing, respectively, are minor product channels, their rates are significantly higher than those of the corresponding direct triplet channels, except at elevated temperatures. Finally, due to the relatively shallow nature of its well, the stabilization of H(2)SS is negligible under conditions of likely interest.",

Here, we describe a study of the N2 + N2⟶N2 + 2N and N2 + N2⟶4N nitrogen dissociation reactions using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. The simulations used a new potential energy surface for the N4 system; the surface is an improved version of one that was presented previously. In the QCT calculations, initial conditions were determined based on a two-temperature model that approximately separates the translational-rotational temperature from the vibrational temperature of the N2 diatoms. Five values from 8000 K to 30,000 K were considered for each of the two temperatures. Over 2.4 × 10(9) trajectories were calculated. We present results for ensemble-averaged dissociation rate constants as functions of the translational-rotational temperature T and the vibrational temperature T(v). The rate constant depends more strongly on T when T(v) is low, and it depends more strongly on T(v) when T is low. Quasibound reactant states contribute significantly to the rate constants, as do exchange processes at higher temperatures. We discuss two sets of runs in detail: an equilibrium test set in which T = T(v) and a nonequilibrium test set in which T(v) &lt; T. In the equilibrium test set, high-v and moderately-low-j molecules contribute most significantly to the overall dissociation rate, and this state specificity becomes stronger as the temperature decreases. Dissociating trajectories tend to result in a major loss of vibrational energy and a minor loss of rotational energy. In the nonequilibrium test set, as T(v) decreases while T is fixed, higher-j molecules contribute more significantly to the dissociation rate, dissociating trajectories tend to result in a greater rotational energy loss, and the dissociation probability's dependence on v weakens. In this way, as T(v) decreases, rotational energy appears to compensate for the decline in average vibrational energy in promoting dissociation. In both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium test sets, in every case, the average total internal energy loss in the dissociating trajectories is between 10.2 and 11.0 eV, slightly larger than the equilibrium potential energy change of N2 dissociation.",

The vibration-rotation energy levels of the perturbed A 2Pi and B' 2Sigma+ states were fitted as individual term values, while those of the X 2Sigma+ ground state were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach.

The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote.

In order to guarantee a computationally efficient treatment, those gradient terms are neglected which would require the exchange of orbital information. This approach allows for geometry optimizations of single molecules surrounded by numerous molecules with fixed nuclei at RICC2-in-RICC2, RICC2-in-DFT, and DFT-in-DFT FDE level of theory using a dispersion correction, required due to the DFT-based treatment of the interaction in FDE theory. Accuracy and applicability are assessed by the example of two case studies: (a) the Watson-Crick pair adenine-thymine, for which the optimized structures exhibit a maximum error of about 0.08 Å for our best scheme compared to supermolecular reference calculations, (b) carbon monoxide on a magnesium oxide surface model, for which the error amount up to 0.1 Å for our best scheme.

Furthermore, the collision energy dependence of the total cross sections obtained in the present CC calculation only exhibits minor oscillations, indicating that the chance is slim for reactive resonances in total cross sections to survive through the partial-wave averaging.

The objective was to assess the frequency and magnitude of combing forces on individual hairs against a hypothesis that fibres on a consumer's head rarely experience significant loads during routine combing. Single fibres were removed from a tress, attached to a load cell and replaced in the tress. Combing of tresses, guided by in-vivo measurements, measured the frequency of significant loads defined as 'events' ≥1 g over 30 combing sets (set = 10 comb strokes @~25 cm s<sup-1</sup ) with intermediate tangling. Asian and Caucasian hair was assessed by dry, wet, bleached-wet and bleached-dry combing. A questionnaire of 231 Asian and Caucasian women established daily frequency and number of comb strokes for the whole head. In-vivo combing videos of 10 women (five Asian, five Caucasian) were used to establish in-vivo and tress combing speeds. The questionnaires returned an average combing frequency of 1.7×/day (range 0-5) and average number of strokes 16 ± 2.3 per head/day (95% CI). Video analysis measured combing speeds of 22-35 cm s<sup-1</sup across hair types. Tress data confirmed individual fibres are unlikely to experience repeated loading or significant loads in all but wet combed persulphate bleached hair. 'Events' of ≥1 g - dry combing gave an event probability of 0.2 and average load of 1.7 g over 30 comb sets. Dry combed bleached samples returned a probability of 0.23 and 0.3 respectively. Wet combed virgin Asian and Caucasian hair gave a probability of 0.1 and 0.47 respectively. Wet combed bleached hair gave a probability of one. The addition of a conditioner to bleached hair reduced the event probability to &lt;0.1. During combing, individual fibres may not experience any significant loads and are unlikely to experience repetitive loads &gt;10 g. The low number of comb strokes and low event probability is in keeping with consumers growing their hair long and in good condition. The data indicates the need for a significant rethink of methods used for product evaluation and claim substantiation.",

A 8, 423 (1973)] address the closure problem of a statistical treatment of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) based on techniques primarily developed for quantum field theory. In the Wyld formalism, there is a well-known double-counting problem, for which an ad hoc solution was suggested by Lee [Ann. Phys. 32, 292 (1965)]. We show how to implement this correction in a more natural way from the basic equations of the formalism. This leads to what we call the Improved Wyld-Lee Renormalized Perturbation Theory. MSR had noted that their formalism had more vertex functions than Wyld's formalism and based on this felt Wyld's formalism was incorrect. However a careful comparison of both formalisms here shows that the Wyld formalism follows a different procedure to that of the MSR formalism and so the treatment of vertex corrections appears in different ways in the two formalisms. Taking that into account, along with clarifications made to both formalisms, we find that they are equivalent and we demonstrate this up to fourth order.",

We consider two statistics (with and without the logarithmic transformation) for testing the equality of two Poisson rates. Two methods for implementing these statistics are reviewed. They are (1) the sample-based method, and (2) the constrained maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the performance of different statistics and methods. Generally, we find that the CMLE method works satisfactorily only for the statistic without the logarithmic transformation (denoted as W(2)) while sample-based method performs better for the statistic using the logarithmic transformation (denoted as W(3)). It is noteworthy that both statistics perform well for moderate to large Poisson rates (e.g. &gt; or =10). For small Poisson rates (e.g. &lt;10), W(2) can be liberal (e.g. actual type I error rate/nominal level &gt; or =1.2) while W(3) can be conservative (e.g. actual type I error rate/nominal level &lt; or =0.8). The corresponding sample size formulae are provided and valid in the sense that the simulated powers associated with the approximate sample size formulae are generally close to the pre-chosen power level.

Specifically, the optimal rate for distillation to specified parties has been previously shown to be 0.92 EPR pairs per W, while our protocol can asymptotically distill 1 EPR pair per W between random pairs of parties, which we conjecture to be optimal. We thus demonstrate a tradeoff between overall distillation rate and final distribution of EPR pairs.

One hundred and twenty-four patients were examined by HSN and vestibular bithermal test. The latency and duration of HSN were observed and the dynamic changes of HSN were also investigated. The results of bithermal test were clarified by the values of canal paresis (CP). There were 3 types of HSN, including 41 monophasic HSN, 11 biphasic HSN and 7 perverted HSN. The latency of monophasic HSN was (2.75 +/- 1.41) ms and the duration of it was (32.16 +/- 20.30) ms; as for the biphasic HSN, the first phase had no latency and the duration was (12.33 +/- 4.42) ms which was shorter than that of the second phase (57.00 +/- 17.19) ms (P &lt; 0.01) and the latency of second phase was (57.00 +/- 17.19) ms. The value of canal paresis in the patients without HSN was lower than that in the patients with HSN. The existence of HSN was dependent on the loss of the function horizontal canal and also on the stage of vestibular compensation. The variation of duration of HSN among individuals was great. In the acute stage of unilateral vestibular function loss, there appeared to be prominent HSN, and the direction of HSN is the same as that of spontaneous nystagmus. With the development of vestibular compensation, biphasic nystagmus would appear instead of monophasic HSN and the direction of first phase represent the direction of un-lesioned side. After compensation, HSN would not be elicited. However,when HSN existed, it suggested that the value of CP should exceed 25%. Perverted nystagmus pointed to central abnormality.",

Since data that are collected by wireless sensor nodes exhibit the characteristics of temporal association, data fusion has also become a very important means of reducing network traffic as well as eliminating data redundancy as far as data transmission is concerned. Another reason for data fusion is that, in many applications, only some of the data that are collected can meet the requirements of the sink node. In this paper, we propose a method to calculate the number of cluster heads or data aggregators during data fusion based on the rate-distortion function. In our discussion, we will first establish an energy consumption model and then describe a method for calculating the number of cluster heads from the point of view of reducing energy consumption. We will also show through theoretical analysis and experimentation that the network topology design based on the rate-distortion function is indeed more energy-efficient. ",

The coiled-coil helical dimer is the structure of a class of proteins also called leucine zipper, which has been studied intensively in recent years. Our model, which is appropriate particularly for short peptides, is an alternative to the theory developed by Skolnick and Holtzer. Using the present formalism, we discuss the multi-equilibriatory nature of this transition and provide an explanation for the apparent two-state behavior of coiled-coil formation when the helix-coil transition is coupled to dimerization. It is found that such coupling between multi-equilibria and a true two-state transition can simplify the data analysis, but care must be taken in using the overall association constant to determine helix propensities (w) of single residues. Successful use of the two-state model does not imply that the helix-coil transition is all-or-none. The all-or-none assumption can provide good numerical estimates when w is around unity (0.35 &lt; or = w &lt; or = 1.35), but when w is small (w &lt; 0.01), similar estimations can lead to large errors. The theory of the helix-coil transition in denaturation experiments is also discussed.",

No multi-atom gates, quantum memories or quantum non-demolition measurements are required, greatly simplifying the experimental realization of the scheme. The feasibility analysis shows that our expansion scheme can be implemented with state-of-the-art technologies.

Such scaling is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), with &lt;W2&gt; inversely proportional to ξ, the typical size of the domain that can break symmetry in unison. (The dependence of ξ on quench rate is predicted by KZM from critical exponents of the phase transition.) Thus, according to KZM, the dispersion √&lt;W2&gt; scales as √C/ξ for large W. By contrast, a distribution of individual vortices with randomly assigned topological charges would result in the dispersion scaling with the square root of the area inside C (i.e., ≈√&lt;W2&gt; ≈C). Scaling of the dispersion of W as well as of the probability of detection of non-zero W with C and ξ can be also studied for loops so small that non-zero windings are rare. In this case I show that dispersion varies not as 1/√ξ, but as 1/ξ, which results in a doubling of the scaling of dispersion with the quench rate when compared to the large |W| regime. Moreover, the probability of trapping of non-zero W becomes approximately equal to &lt;W2&gt;, and scales as 1/ξ2. This quadruples--as compared with √&lt;W2&gt;≃ √C/ ξ valid for large W--the exponent in the power law dependence of the frequency of trapping of |W| = 1 on ξ when the probability of |W| &gt; 1 is negligible. This change of the power law exponent by a factor of four--from 1√ξ for the dispersion of large W to 1/ξ2 for the frequency of non-zero W when |W| &gt; 1 is negligibly rare--is of paramount importance for experimental tests of KZM.",

WGD produces two copies of every chromosome, namely two identical copies of a sequence of genes. We assume deletion events excise a geometrically distributed number of consecutive genes with mean µ ≥ 1, and these events can combine to produce single-copy runs of length l. If µ = 1, the process is gene-by-gene. If µ &gt; 1, the process at least occasionally excises more than one gene at a time. In the latter case if deletions overlap, the later one simply extends the existing run of single-copy genes. We explore aspects of the predicted distribution of the lengths of single-copy regions analytically, but resort to simulations to show how observing run lengths l allows us to discriminate between the two hypotheses. Deletion run length distributions can discriminate between gene-by-gene fractionation and deletion of segments of geometrically distributed length, even if µ is only slightly larger than 1, as long as the genome is large enough and fractionation has not proceeded too far towards completion.",

Fusion technology has been proven to be a good candidate for preparing a large-size W state from two or more small-size W states in linear optical system. It is of great importance to study how to fuse W states via light-matter interface. Here we show that it is possible to prepare large-size W-state networks using a fusion mechanism in cavity QED system. The detuned interaction between three atoms and a vacuum cavity mode constitute the main fusion mechanism, based on which two or three small-size atomic W states can be fused into a larger-size W state. If no excitation is detected from those three atoms, the remaining atoms are still in the product of two or three new W states, which can be re-fused. The complicated Fredkin gate used in the previous fusion schemes is avoided here. W states of size 2 can be fused as well. The feasibility analysis shows that our fusion processes maybe implementable with the current technology. Our results demonstrate how the light-matter interaction based fusion mechanism can be realized, and may become the starting point for the fusion of multipartite entanglement in cavity QED system. ",

For two well known SLOCC inequivalent three-qubit states |GHZ⟩=(1/2)(|000⟩+|111⟩) and |W⟩=(1/3)(|100⟩+|010⟩+|001⟩), we show that the entanglement transformation rate from |GHZ⟩ to |W⟩ is exactly 1.

We then apply similar techniques to obtain a lower bound on the entanglement transformation rates from an N-partite GHZ state to a class of Dicke states, and prove the tightness of this bound for some special cases which naturally generalize the |W⟩ state.

Two forms of the structure can thus be expected for all the members of the series: a low-temperature form (LT) corresponding to the CDW state and a high-temperature form (HT) corresponding to a normal metallic state. The HT form is described here for m = 9 and compared with that of the m = 5 and m = 7 counterparts. It is shown that a systematic twin phenomenon must be taken into account for HT members because of two possible configurations of the tilting mode of WO6 octahedra, The structure is also compared with that of m = 10, which exhibits the modulated CDW-LT form at room temperature. Owing to two possible polarization directions of the segments built of m WO6 octahedra, a twin phenomenon is also encountered in the LT forms. A review of all the structures known at present (m = 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12) leads us to propose a structural law based on the building mode of W06 octahedra in W03-type slabs to explain the symmetry changes observed between even and odd members of the series.",

Representations in brain stem and thalamus.\nHow does processing of information change the internal representations used in subsequent stages of sensory pathways? To approach this question, we studied the representations of whisker movements in the lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways of the rat vibrissal system. We recently suggested that these two pathways encode movement frequency in different ways. We proposed that paralemniscal thalamocortical circuits, functioning as phase-locked loops (PLLs), translate temporally coded information into a rate code. Here we focus on the two major trigeminal nuclei of the brain stem, nucleus principalis and subnucleus interpolaris, and on their thalamic targets, the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) and the medial division of the posterior nucleus (POm). This is the first study in which these brain stem and thalamic nuclei were explored together in the same animals and using the same stimuli. We studied both single- and multi-unit activity. We moved the whiskers both mechanically and by air puffs; here we present air-puff-induced movements because they are more similar to natural movements than movements induced by mechanical stimulations. We describe the basic properties of the responses in these brain stem and thalamic nuclei. The responses in both brain stem nuclei were similar; responses to air puffs were mostly tonic and followed the trajectory of whisker movement. The responses in the two thalamic nuclei were similar during low-frequency stimulations or during the first pulses of high-frequency stimulations, exhibiting more phasic responses than those of brain stem neurons. However, with frequencies &gt;2 Hz, VPM and POm responses differed, generating different representations of the stimulus frequency. In the VPM, response amplitudes (instantaneous firing rates) and spike counts (total number of spikes per stimulus cycle) decreased as a function of the frequency. In the POm, latencies increased and spike count decreased as a function of the frequency. Having described the basic response properties in the four nuclei, we then focus on a specific test of our PLL hypothesis for coding in the paralemniscal pathway. We used short-duration air puffs, much shorter than whisker movements during natural whisking. The activity in this situation was consistent with the prediction we made on the basis of the PLL hypothesis.",

Reactions with D(2)O proceed at a rate that is on the order of 10(2) higher than for CO(2). The pattern of reaction products reveals composition-dependent chemical properties of these group six unary and binary clusters. At the core of this variation is the difference in Mo-O and W-O bond energies, the latter of which is significantly higher. This results in a larger thermodynamic drive to higher oxidation states in clusters with more tungsten atoms. However, addition products for more oxidized W-rich clusters are not observed, while they are observed for the more Mo-rich clusters. This is attributed to the following: In the higher oxides (e.g., y=8), addition reactions require distortion of local metal-oxygen bonding, and will necessarily have higher activation barriers for W-O bonds, since the vibrational potentials will be narrower. The binary (x=1,2) clusters generally show sequential oxidation to higher values of y. This again is attributed to higher W-O bond energy, the result being that stable binary structures have W atoms in higher oxidation states, and Mo centers both in more reduced states and sterically unhindered. The reduced Mo center provides a locus of higher reactivity. An unusual result that is not readily explained is the chemically inert behavior of Mo(3)O(6) (-).",

However, it critically disregards an interesting third outcome: the possibility of the coin coming at rest on its edge. Provided this evident yet elusive possibility, previous works have already focused on capturing all three landing probabilities of thick coins, but have only succeeded computationally. Hence, an exact analytical solution for the toss of bouncing objects still remains an open problem due to the strongly nonlinear processes induced at each bounce.

In a previous investigation, [F.G. Mitri, Acoustic radiation force on a sphere in standing and quasi-standing zero-order Bessel beam tweezers, Annals of Physics 323 (2008) 1604-1620] an expression for the radiation force of a zero-order Bessel beam standing wave experienced by a sphere was derived. The present work extends the analysis of the radiation force to the case of a high-order Bessel beam (HOBB) of positive order m having an angular dependence on the phase phi. The derivation for the general expression of the force is based on the formulation for the total acoustic scattering field of a HOBB by a sphere [F.G. Mitri, Acoustic scattering of a high-order Bessel beam by an elastic sphere, Annals of Physics 323 (2008) 2840-2850; F.G. Mitri, Equivalence of expressions for the acoustic scattering of a progressive high order Bessel beam by an elastic sphere, IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control 56 (2009) 1100-1103] to derive the general expression for the radiation force function YJm,st(ka,beta,m)&lt;0), which is the radiation force per unit characteristic energy density and unit cross-sectional surface. The radiation force function is expressed as a generalized partial wave series involving the half-cone angle beta of the wave-number components and the order m of the HOBB. Numerical results for the radiation force function of a first and a second-order Bessel beam standing wave incident upon a rigid sphere immersed in non-viscous water are computed. The rigid sphere calculations for YJm,st(ka,beta,m)&lt;0), show that the force is generally directed to a pressure node when m is a positive even integer number (i.e. YJm,st(ka,beta,m)&lt;0), whereas the force is generally directed toward a pressure antinode when m is a positive odd integer number (i.e. YJm,st(ka,beta,m)&lt;0). An expression is derived for the radiation force on a rigid sphere placed along the axis of an ideal non-diffracting HOBB of acoustic standing (or stationary) waves propagating in an ideal fluid. The formulation includes results of a previous work done for a zero-order Bessel beam standing wave (m=0). The proposed theory is of particular interest essentially due to its inherent value as a canonical problem in particle manipulation using the acoustic radiation force of a HOBB standing wave on a sphere. It may also serve as the benchmark for comparison to other solutions obtained by strictly numerical or asymptotic approaches.",

A mixed-physics approach is taken for accurate modeling of low-energy photon interactions in the different regions of the model using Geant4-DNA physics within the cell, and Livermore physics within gold. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), a clustering algorithm, is used to directly quantitate DNA DSBs after irradiation. The simulation was run using different sizes of GNPs, different distances of GNPs from the cell nucleus, and several combinations of these two conditions. Four types of radiation were simulated in the work: 80-keV monoenergetic photons, 100-keV monoenergetic photons, a 250-kVp photon spectrum, and a 6-MV flattening filter free (FFF) photon spectrum. A variable enhancement in DSB yield, nucleus dose, and cell dose was observed when there are GNPs in the cell cytoplasm, and increases with larger GNPs and proximity to the nucleus. The distance of the GNPs from the nucleus has a large impact on the DSB yield and nucleus dose, but little to no effect on the cell dose. The cell dose enhancement factor of 80 keV photons varies from 1.037-1.125 at 0.2 µm for 30-100 nm GNPs to 1.040-1.127 at 4 μm. The DSB enhancement factor varies from 1.050 to 1.174 at 0.2 µm to a marginal effect of &lt;1.01 at 4 μm. For 100 keV, the dose enhancement factor is from 1.142-1.470 at 0.2 µm to 1.106-1.371 at 4 μm. The DSB enhancement factor varies from 1.249-1.813 at 0.2 µm to almost no effect at 4 μm. For 250 kVp, the dose enhancement factor is from 1.117-1.393 at 0.2 μm to 1.110-1.342 at 4 μm. The DSB enhancement factor varies from 1.183-1.600 at 0.2 μm to a marginal effect of ~1.03 at 4 μm. A 6-MV FFF shows a dose enhancement factor of 1.061-1.103 at 0.2 μm and 1.053-1.107 at 4 μm. The DSB yield varies from 1.070-1.143 at 0.2 μm to a marginal effect at 4 μm. The stark difference in behavior for DSB yield when compared to cell dose highlights the importance of evaluating more complex radiobiological quantities rather than dose alone when evaluating the radiosensitization properties from metallic nanomaterials. The nucleus dose showed similar characteristics to the DSB yield demonstrating the ability of the method to predict DNA damage and its relationship with nuclear dose. The proposed method provides a way to explore the radiobiological mechanisms of radiation-induced DNA damages, and it aids to evaluate the physical radiosensitization properties of GNP-aided radiotherapy, which can be easily combined with radiochemical DSB quantitation in order to better understand the intricate DNA damage induction mechanisms that are involved in GNP-aided radiotherapy.",

Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus in 1911, and the large body of knowledge about the nuclear force that has since been acquired was derived from studies made on nucleons or nuclei. Although antinuclei up to antihelium-4 have been discovered and their masses measured, little is known directly about the nuclear force between antinucleons. Here, we study antiproton pair correlations among data collected by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), where gold ions are collided with a centre-of-mass energy of 200 gigaelectronvolts per nucleon pair. Antiprotons are abundantly produced in such collisions, thus making it feasible to study details of the antiproton-antiproton interaction. By applying a technique similar to Hanbury Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry, we show that the force between two antiprotons is attractive. In addition, we report two key parameters that characterize the corresponding strong interaction: the scattering length and the effective range of the interaction. Our measured parameters are consistent within errors with the corresponding values for proton-proton interactions. Our results provide direct information on the interaction between two antiprotons, one of the simplest systems of antinucleons, and so are fundamental to understanding the structure of more-complex antinuclei and their properties.

The procedure is based on that of O'Brien (R.W. O'Brien, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 92 (1983) 204). The advantage of the present procedure over existing BE methodologies that are applicable to rigid model macroions in general (S. Allison, Macromolecules 29 (1996) 7391) is that computationally time consuming integrations over a large number of volume elements that surround the model particle are completely avoided. The procedure is tested by comparing the mobilities derived from it with independent theory of the mobility of spheres of radius a in a salt solution with Debye-Huckel screening parameter, kappa. The procedure is shown to yield accurate mobilities provided (kappa)a exceeds approximately 50. The methodology is most relevant to model macroions of mean linear dimension, L, with 1000&gt;(kappa)L&gt;100 and reduced absolute zeta potential (q|zeta|/k(B)T) greater than 1.0. The procedure is then applied to the compact form of high molecular weight, duplex DNA that is formed in the presence of the trivalent counterion, spermidine, under low salt conditions. For T4 DNA (166,000 base pairs), the compact form is modeled as a sphere (diameter=600 nm) and as a toroid (largest linear dimension=600 nm). In order to reconcile experimental and model mobilities, approximately 95% of the DNA phosphates must be neutralized by bound counterions. This interpretation, based on electrokinetics, is consistent with independent studies.",

The second relied on the number of chemically etched alpha-particle tracks developed on a solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) that was irradiated by an alpha-particle source. The etching efficiencies (defined as percentages of latent tracks created by alpha particles from the source that could develop to become visible tracks upon chemical etching) were computed through Monte Carlo simulations, which when multiplied by the experimentally counted number of visible tracks would also give the fluence at the target.

A two-dimensional (or transverse) acoustic trapping was demonstrated by directly applying the acoustic radiation force on lipid spheres and leukemia cells that were individually moved towards the focus. Only longitudinal waves were then considered because both target and propagation media involved were fluid e.g., water or phosphate buffer saline. In order for our current technique to be applicable to bead-based assay approaches using micron-sized polystyrene spheres as in optical tweezers, the possibility of microbead trapping must first be investigated from theoretical perspective. In this paper, a simulation study in the ray acoustics regime (bead diameter D&gt;ultrasonic wavelength λ of trapping beam) is thus undertaken by calculating the acoustic radiation force on a polystyrene bead generated from 30 MHz focused beam of Gaussian intensity profile. Analytical trapping models for a bead located in the near-/far fields and on the focal plane are derived by incorporating both longitudinal- and shear force terms into our existing ray acoustics model for liquid targets. The net radiation force is computed by adding the two terms, and the resultant trapping force is defined as a negative net radiation force in the positive transverse direction (y&gt;0). The magnitude of the trapping force and its spatial range are evaluated in the same direction by varying bead size (D=2 λ=100 μm or 3 λ=150 μm), location, and transducer's f-number (= 1 or 2). When the bead size is increased, all force components exerted on the bead is increased in the near field of ultrasound for both f-numbers. With f-number=1 being used, the peak longitudinal-, shear- , and net forces are -3.1 nN, -9.8 nN, and -12.7 nN for D=2 λ, whereas the forces are increased to -5.3 nN, -21.0 nN, and -25.7 nN for D=3 λ. In case of f-number=2, the peak magnitudes of the forces are 1.2 nN, -7.8 nN, and -6.6 nN for D=2 λ, whereas they are increased to 5.9 nN, -17.1 nN, and -12.0 nN for D=3 λ. With f-number=1, the net trapping forces at (0, y, -2 λ) can be reached to -39.8 nN for D=2 λ and -65.2 nN for D=3 λ, and -7.8 nN for D=2 λ and -15.2 nN for D=3 λ at (0, y, -14 λ). When f-number=2 is used, the peak trapping forces at (0, y, -2 λ) can be -3.4 nN for D=2 λ and -5.9 n N for D=3 λ, while they are -6.3 nN for D=2 λ and -12.0 nN for D=3 λ at (0, y, -14 λ). In the near filed, the bead can be trapped in the range from 0 to 340 μm for D=2 λ, and from 0 to 380 μm for D=3 λ. The trapping range Rtrap with f-number=2 lies from 0 to 295 μm for D=2 λ, and from 0 to 340 μm for D=3 λ. As either a larger bead or a lower f-numbered trapping beam is used, a stronger trapping force can be produced in the region. When a bead is more closely positioned to the focus, the trapping occurs in multiple locations and the net force variation becomes more complicated. In the far field, with f-number=1 being used, the peak longitudinal-, shear- , and net forces are 4.6 nN, 6.8 nN, and 11.4 nN for D=2 λ, whereas the forces are increased to 11.4 nN, 12.1 nN, and 23.6 nN for D=3 λ. In case of f-number=2, the maximum value of each force is 4.4 nN, 1.8 nN, and 5.0 nN for D=2 λ, respectively, whereas it becomes 12.3 nN, -0.7 nN, and 10.6 nN for D=3 λ. The bead is forced to move away from the beam axis by a positive net force for y&gt;0 and a negative net force for y&lt;0. With f-number=1, the peak repulsive forces at (0, y, 5 λ) can be 25.8 nN for D=2 λ and 49.9 nN for D=3 λ, and 3.4 nN for D=2 λ and 7.5 nN for D=3 λ at (0, y, 20 λ). When f-number=2 is used, the forces at (0, y, 5 λ) can be 3.9 nN for D=2 λ and 9.5 nN for D=3 λ, while they are 3.7 nN for D=2 λ and 7.8 nN for D=3 λ at (0, y, 20 λ). As the bead is placed farther away from the focus, the net repulsive force is reduced and yet the bead trapping is difficult throughout the far-field region. On the focal plane, with f-number=1, the peak longitudinal-, shear- , and net trapping forces are 31.8 nN, -36.2 nN, and -16.5 nN for D=2 λ, whereas the forces are changed to 73.9 nN, -58.2 nN, and -42.7 nN for D=3 λ. In case of f-number=2, the peak magnitudes of the forces are 6.4 nN, -7.0 nN, and -1.6 nN for D=2 λ, whereas they are increased to 18.1 nN, -15.8 nN, and -3.9 nN for D=3 λ.

Our calculations show that the ligand density along a radius emanating from the core of an isolated AuNP has the same gross features for all values of the coverage; it oscillates around a constant value up to a distance along the chain corresponding to the position of the fourth pseudo-atom and then smoothly decays to zero, reflecting both the restricted conformations of the chain near the core surface and the larger numbers of conformations available further from the core. Interaction between two AuNPs generates changes in the ligand distributions of each. We examine the structure and general shape of the ligand envelope as a function of the coverage and demonstrate that the equilibrium structure of the envelope and the deformation of that envelope generated by interaction between the NPs are coverage-dependent so that the shape, depth, and position of the minimum of the potential of mean force display a systematic dependence on the ligand coverage. We propose an accurate analytical description of the calculated potential of mean force as a function of a set of parameters that scale linearly with the ligand coverage. Noting that the conformational freedom of the ligands implies that multiparticle induced deviations from additivity of the pair potential of mean force are likely important; we define and calculate a \"bond stretching\" effective pair potential of mean force for a square lattice of particles that contains, implicitly, both the three- and four-NP contributions. We find that the bond stretching effective pair potential of mean force in this cluster has a different minimum and a different well depth from the isolated pair potential of mean force. Previous work has found that the three-particle contribution to deviation from pair additivity is monotonically repulsive, whereas we find that the combined three- and four-particle contributions have an attractive well, implying that the three- and four-particle contributions are of comparable magnitude but opposite sign, thereby suggesting that even higher order correction terms likely play a significant role in the behavior of dense assemblies of many nanoparticles.",

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists.

In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects.

Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

The ground state NO(2) is promoted to populate in the S(NP1) (Ã(2)A\", (2)nπ*) intermediate state by one photon absorption at ~440 nm, one thousandth of which is further excited to S(PP) (Ẽ(2)A', (2)ππ*) state and undergoes a medium-sized barrier (~11.0 kcal/mol) to give rise to OH radicals. In comparison with the hydrogen abstraction reaction in highly vibrationally excited NO(2) ground state, two photon absorption facilitates NO(2) dissociation to O ((1)D) and O ((1)D) + H(2)O → 2OH (X(2)Π) but results in low quantum yield of NO(2)** since there is a weak absorption upon the second beam light at ~440 nm.

The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote.

Furthermore, the bending excitations of C2H, compared to the ground state reaction probability, hinder the reactivity.

This study shows that vibrational excitations of H(2) enhance the reaction probability, whereas the stretching vibrational excitations of C(2)H have only a small effect on the reactivity. Furthermore, the bending excitation of C(2)H, compared to the ground-state reaction probability, hinders the reactivity. A comparison of the rate constant between the 7DOF calculation and the present 8DOF results has been made. The theoretical and experimental results agree with each other very well when the present 8DOF results are adjusted to account for the lower transition state barrier heights found in recent ab initio calculations.",

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study.

The potential function yields an accurate representation of spectroscopic data that span 99.24% of the well depth and the number of fitted parameters is significantly less than half the number of parameters determined in conventional Dunham analyses.

Supersonically cooled formaldehyde was excited into selected J(Ka,Kc) rotational states of six vibrational levels (1(1)4(1), 5(1), 2(2)6(1), 2(2)4(3), 2(3)4(1), and 2(4)4(1)) in the A((1)A2) state.

When formaldehyde was excited into the low-lying levels 1(1)4(1), 5(1), and 2(2)6(1), at E(avail)&lt;1120 cm(-1), the product state distribution can be modeled qualitatively by phase space theory. These dynamics are interpreted as arising from a reaction path on the barrierless S0 surface. When the initial states 2(2)4(3) and 2(3)4(1) were excited (E(avail)=1120-1500 cm(-1)), a second type of product state distribution appeared. This second distribution peaked sharply at low N, Ka and was severely truncated in comparison with those obtained from the lower lying states. At the even higher energy of 2(4)4(1) (E(avail) approximately 2600 cm(-1)) the sharply peaked distribution appears to be dominant. We attribute this change in dynamics to the opening up of the triplet channel to produce HCO. The theoretical height of the barrier on the T1 surface lies between 1700 and 2100 cm(-1) and so we consider the triplet reaction to proceed via tunneling at the intermediate energies and proceed over the barrier at the higher energies. Considerable population was observed in the excited (0,0,1) state for all initial H(2)CO states that lie above the appearance energy. Rotational populations in the (0,0,1) state dropped more rapidly with (N,Ka) than did the equivalent populations in (0,0,0). This indicates that, although individual rotational states are highly populated in (0,0,1), the total v3=1 population might not be so large. Specific population was also measured in the almost isoenergetic Kc and J states. No consistent population preference was found for either asymmetry or spin-rotation component.",

The aim is to investigate the signature in the excitation spectra of intermediate resonances lying in the lower v&lt;v' vibrational manifolds in order to elucidate their role in the intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) mechanisms in Ne-Br(2). By increasing v('), the energy position of the Ne-Br(2)(B,v') initial state probes the whole range of the spectrum of v'-1 intermediate resonances, from the continuum resonance states above the Ne+Br(2)(B,v'-1) dissociation threshold to the resonances below that threshold. In general, the results show that the Ne-Br(2)(B,v') initial state couples more strongly to the energetically nearby v'-1 resonances, although coupling to farther away resonances also occurs with appreciable intensity. The excitation spectra reveal a strong overlapping between spectral features, indicating that the intermediate resonances are coupled and interfere between themselves. This coupling generates an interconnected network of intermediate resonances, through which an efficient flow of the initial population leading to IVR takes place. It is found that the density of continuum resonances reaches a maximum in the region just above the Ne+Br(2)(B,v'-1) threshold, and it decreases gradually with increasing energy above this threshold, as suggested in a previous work. An upper energy limit for the spectrum of v'-1 continuum resonances has been estimated to be about 23-29 cm(-1) above the v'-1 dissociation threshold. The excitation spectra reflect that coupling of the initial state with intermediate resonances lying below the Ne+Br(2)(B,v'-1) threshold can occur in a remarkably wide range of the resonance spectrum.",

It is shown that absorption in the A-band is dominated by the parallel A(1)Sigma(+)&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) transition. In the low-energy part of the band (&lt;95 x 10(3) cm(-1)) the absorption is caused by the perpendicular B(1)Pi&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) excitation, but transitions to the b(3)Pi(0(+),1) states are also not negligible. The branching ratio Gamma for the final photodissociation products is calculated and it is shown to increase smoothly from 0 in the red tail of the band to 1 at E&gt;or= 10(5) cm(-1). The latter value corresponds to the exclusive formation of the spin-excited Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)) ions, and thus leads to the inverse population of the Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)-(2)P(3/2)) ion states.",

In this Rapid Communication, we validate their hypothesis by deriving an explicit formula for the local box-counting dimension of a countably-infinite discrete quantum spectrum. This formula expresses the local box-counting dimension of a spectrum in terms of single and double integrals of the NNSD of the spectrum. As applications, we derive an analytical formula for Poisson spectra and closed-form approximations to the local box-counting dimension for spectra having Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), and Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE) spacing statistics. In the Poisson and GOE cases, we compare our theoretical formulas with the published numerical data of Wang and Ong and observe excellent agreement between their data and our theory. We also study numerically the local box-counting dimensions of the Riemann zeta function zeros and the alternate levels of GOE spectra, which are often used as numerical models of spectra possessing GUE and GSE spacing statistics, respectively. In each case, the corresponding theoretical formula is found to accurately describe the numerically computed local box-counting dimension.",

A gravity induced dynamical phase (accrued solely on the spin state, and measured through a Ramsey scheme) is used to reveal the above spatially delocalized superposition of the spin-nano-object composite system that arises during our scheme.

We show, by solving the nonstationary problem of a free particle in a 1D hard-wall box, that the single-particle state recurs in time, signaling the intuitively expected back-and-forth motion of a free particle moving in a confined space. Under suitable conditions, the state of the whole gas can then be made to recur if all the particles are put in the same initial momentum superposition. We introduce this problem here as a modern instance of the discussions giving rise to the famous recurrence paradox in statistical mechanics: on one hand, our results may be used to develop a poor man's interpretation of the recurrence of the initial state observed [T. Kinoshita et al., Nature 440, 900 (2006)] in trapped 1D Bose gases of cold atoms, for which our estimated recurrence time is in fair agreement with the period of the oscillations observed; but this experiment, on the other hand, has been substantially influential on the belief that an isolated quantum many-body system can equilibrate as a consequence of its own unitary nonequilibrium dynamics.

The teleportation of a quantum state between two single material particles (trapped ions) has now also been achieved. Here we demonstrate teleportation between objects of a different nature--light and matter, which respectively represent 'flying' and 'stationary' media. A quantum state encoded in a light pulse is teleported onto a macroscopic object (an atomic ensemble containing 10 caesium atoms). Deterministic teleportation is achieved for sets of coherent states with mean photon number (n) up to a few hundred.

Besides being of fundamental interest, teleportation using a macroscopic atomic ensemble is relevant for the practical implementation of a quantum repeater. An important factor for the implementation of quantum networks is the teleportation distance between transmitter and receiver; this is 0.5 metres in the present experiment.

A fundamental and controversially debated question-whether this process can continue ad infinitum, or has to slow down-stands unresolved. Current experimental devices are not capable to even reach 1/10^{4} of the reported computational horizons. With our toolbox, we outperform previous computational results and observe that the universal subdiffusion persists over an additional four decades reaching \"astronomic\" times 2×10^{12}. Such a dramatic extension of previous computational horizons suggests that subdiffusion is universal, and that the toolbox can be efficiently used to assess other hard computational many-body problems.",

Each bacterium is understood as a carrier of a phenotypic parameter p. The central objective is the calculation of the probability density with respect to p, Phi(p,t;p(0)), of the carriers living at time t&gt;0, provided that initially at t(0)=0, all bacteria carried the phenotypic parameter p(0)=0. The theory involves two small parameters: the mutation probability mu and a parameter gamma involved in a function w(p) defining the fitness of the bacteria to survive the generation time tau and give birth to an offspring. The mutation from a state p to a state q is defined by a Gaussian with a dispersion sigma(2)(m). The author focuses our attention on a function phi(p,t) which determines uniquely the function Phi(p,t;p(0)) and satisfies a linear equation (Waxman's equation). The Green function of this equation is mathematically identical with the one-particle Bloch density matrix, where mu characterizes the order of magnitude of the potential energy. (In the x representation, the potential energy is proportional to the inverted Gaussian with the dispersion sigma(2)(m)). The author solves Waxman's equation in the standard style of a perturbation theory and discusses how the solution depends on the choice of the fitness function w(p). In a sense, the function c(p)=1-w(p)/w(0) is analogous to the dispersion function E(p) of fictitious quasiparticles. In contrast to Waxman's approximation, where c(p) was taken as a quadratic function, c(p) approximately gammap(2), the author exemplifies the problem with another function, c(p)=gamma[1-exp(-ap(2))], where gamma is small but a may be large. The author shows that the use of this function in the theory of the population genetics is the same as the use of a nonparabolic dispersion law E=E(p) in the density-matrix theory. With a general function c(p), the distribution function Phi(p,t;0) is composed of a delta-function component, N(t)delta(p), and a blurred component. When discussing the limiting transition for t--&gt; infinity, the author shows that his function c(p) implies that N(t)--&gt;N( infinity ) not equal 0 in contrast with the asymptotics N(t)--&gt;0 resulting from the use of Waxman's function c(p) approximately p(2).",

For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images. In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) &gt; or = 1% (&gt; or = 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF). Moreover, the error in co-localizing two or more single emitters is notably worse, remaining greater than 5-10% (5-10 nm) of the PSF size. Here we report a distance resolution of s(reg) = 0.50 nm (1sigma) and an absolute accuracy of s(distance) = 0.77 nm (1sigma) in a measurement of the separation between differently coloured fluorescent molecules using conventional far-field fluorescence imaging in physiological buffer conditions. The statistical uncertainty in the mean for an ensemble of identical single-molecule samples is limited only by the total number of collected photons, to s(loc) approximately 0.3 nm, which is approximately 3 x 10(-3) times the size of the optical PSF.

The simplest problem involves quantum particles localized within the 'groove', a quasi-1D region created by two adjacent, identical and parallel nanotubes. At low temperature (T), the transverse motion of the adsorbed gas, in the plane perpendicular to the axes of the tubes, is frozen out. Then, the low T heat capacity C(T) of N particles is that of a 1D classical gas: C(*)(T) = C(T)/(Nk(B)) --&gt; 1/2. The dimensionless heat capacity C(*) increases when T ≥ 0.1T(x, y) (transverse excitation temperatures), asymptoting at C(*) = 2.5. The second problem involves a gas localized between two nearly parallel, co-planar nanotubes, with small divergence half-angle γ. In this case, too, the transverse motion does not contribute to C(T) at low T, leaving a problem of a gas of particles in a 1D harmonic potential (along the z axis, midway between the tubes). Setting ω(z) as the angular frequency of this motion, for T ≥ τ(z) ≡ ω(z)ħ/k(B), the behavior approaches that of a 2D classical gas, C(*) = 1; one might have expected instead C(*) = 1/2, as in the groove problem, since the limit γ ≡ 0 is 1D. For T &lt;&lt; τ(z), the thermal behavior is exponentially activated, C(*) ∼ (τ(z)/T)(2)e(-τ(z)/T). At higher T (T ≈ ε(y)/k(B) ≡ τ(y) &gt;&gt; τ(z)), motion is excited in the y direction, perpendicular to the plane of nanotubes, resulting in thermal behavior (C(*) = 7/4) corresponding to a gas in 7/2 dimensions, while at very high T (T &gt; ħω(x)/k(B) ≡ τ(x) &gt;&gt; τ(y)), the behavior becomes that of a D = 11/2 system. The third problem is that of a gas of particles, e.g. (4)He, confined in the interstitial region between four square parallel pores.

All available spectroscopic data then provide the basis for generating an accurately determined vibrationally complete semiempirical intermolecular potential function using a four-dimensional potential coordinate morphing methodology. These results are consistent with the existence of four bound isomers: OC-HI, OC-IH, CO-HI, and CO-IH. Analysis also leads to unequivocal characterization of the common isotopic ground state as having the OC-HI structure and with the first excited state having the OC-IH structure with an energy of 3.4683(80) cm(-1) above the ground state. The potential is consistent with the following barriers between the pairs of isomers: 382(4) cm(-1) (OC-IH/OC-HI), 294(5) cm(-1) (CO-IH/CO-HI), 324(3) cm(-1) (OC-IH/CO-IH), and 301(2) cm(-1) (OC-HI/CO-HI) defined with respect to each lower minimum.

A fundamentally new molecular phenomenon - ground state isotopic isomerization is proposed based on the generated semiempirical potential. The protonated ground state hydrogen-bonded OC-HI structure is predicted to be converted on deuteration to the corresponding ground state van der Waals OC-ID isomeric structure. This results in a large anomalous isotope effect in which the R(0) center of mass distance between monomeric components changes from 4.895(1) to 4.286(1) Å. Such a proposed isotopic effect is demonstrated to be a consequence of differential zero point energy factors resulting from the shallower nature of hydrogen bonding at a local potential minimum (greater quartic character of the potential) relative to the corresponding van der Waals global minimum.

The importance of including the CC quantum scattering calculation has been revealed by the comparison between the CC calculation and the previous coupled state (CS) calculation. The CC total cross sections for the v = 2, 4, and 6 states show collision energy-dependent behaviors different from those based on the CS calculation. Furthermore, the collision energy dependence of the total cross sections obtained in the present CC calculation only exhibits minor oscillations, indicating that the chance is slim for reactive resonances in total cross sections to survive through the partial-wave averaging.

Based on multireference configuration interaction (MRCISD+Q) results with a correlation-consistent polarized valence quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) basis set, appended with core correlation and relativistic corrections, we propose the relative energies: T(e)(FeNC), (6)Delta(0)&lt;(6)Pi (2300 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Delta (2700 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Pi (4200 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Sigma(-); and T(e)(FeCN), (6)Delta(0)&lt;(6)Pi (1800 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Delta (2500 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Pi (2900 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Sigma(-). The (4)Delta and (4)Pi states have massive multireference character, arising mostly from 11sigma--&gt;12sigma promotions, whereas the sextet states are dominated by single electronic configurations. The single-reference CCSDT-3 (coupled cluster singles and doubles with iterative partial triples) method appears to significantly overshoot the stabilization of the quartet states provided by both static and dynamical correlation. The (4,6)Delta and (4,6)Pi states of both isomers are rather ionic, and all have dipole moments near 5 D. On the ground (6)Delta surface, FeNC is predicted to lie 0.6 kcal mol(-1) below FeCN, and the classical barrier for isocyanide/cyanide isomerization is about 6.5 kcal mol(-1). Our data support the recent spectroscopic characterization by Lei and Dagdigian [J. Chem.

Their assignments for the ground term symbol, isotopomeric rotational constants, and the Fe-N omega(3) stretching frequency are confirmed; however, we find rather different structural parameters for (6)Delta FeNC:r(e)(Fe-N)=1.940 A and r(N-C)=1.182 A at the cc-pVQZ MRCISD+Q level. Our results also reveal that the observed band of FeNC originating at 27 236 cm(-1) should have an analog in FeCN near 23 800 cm(-1) of almost equal intensity.

In addition, the interaction energy of the (HI)(2) dimer has been calculated using the coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level of theory. A four-dimensional morphed intermolecular potential has been generated and then morphed using available near infrared and submillimeter spectroscopic data recorded in supersonic jet expansions. The morphed potential is found to have a single global minimum with a symmetric structure having C(2h) symmetry. The equilibrium dissociation energy is found to be 359 cm(-1) with the geometry in Jacobi coordinates of R(e) = 4.35 Å, θ(1) = 43°, θ(2) = 137°, and φ = 180°. The infrared spectrum is characterized by pairs of excited vibrational states resulting from the coupling of the two HI stretching modes. A qualitative model using a quadratic approximation has been fitted to obtain an estimate of this coupling. Furthermore, a morphed intermolecular potential for the vibrationally excited system was also obtained that gives a quantitative estimate of the shift in the potential due to the excitation.

This is especially the case for energies representing electron transitions between two separated regions of space or between orbitals of different spatial extents. It will be shown that these limitations can be attributed to the electronic ground state Hessian G(GGA). Specifically, we shall demonstrate that the Hessian G(GGA) can be used to describe changes in energy due to small perturbations of the electron density (Deltarho), but it should not be applied to one-electron excitations involving the density rearrangement (Deltarho) of a full electron charge. This is in contrast to Hartree-Fock theory where G(HF) has a trust region that is accurate for both small perturbations and one-electron excitations. The large trust radius of G(HF) can be traced back to the complete cancellation of Coulomb and exchange terms in Hartree-Fock (HF) theory representing self-interaction (complete self-interaction cancellation, CSIC). On the other hand, it is shown that the small trust radius for G(GGA) can be attributed to the fact that CSIC is assumed for GGA in the derivation of G(GGA) although GGA (and many other approximate DFT schemes) exhibits incomplete self-interaction cancellation (ISIC). It is further shown that one can derive a new matrix G(R-DFT) with the same trust region as G(HF) by taking terms due to ISIC properly into account. Further, with TD-DFT based on G(R-DFT), energies for state-to-state transitions represented by a one-electron excitation (psi(i)--&gt;psi(a)) are approximately calculated as DeltaE(ai). Here DeltaE(ai) is the energy difference between the ground state Kohn-Sham Slater determinant and the energy of a Kohn-Sham Slater determinant where psi(i) has been replaced by psi(a). We make use of the new Hessian in two numerical applications involving charge-transfer excitations. It is concluded that higher than second order response theory (involving ISIC terms) must be used in approximate TD-DFT, in order to describe charge-transfer excitations.",

A curvilinear coordinate system to describe reactions of the type X+YCH(3)--&gt;XY+CH(3) is developed which facilitates efficient calculations using the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) approach. To describe the bending motion of the X and Y atoms relative to the axis defined by the CH(3) fragment, coordinates based on stereographic projection are introduced. These coordinates yield a kinetic energy operator free of singularities within the dynamically relevant region. Employing this curvilinear coordinate system, full-dimensional and reduced dimensional MCTDH calculations study the cumulative reaction probability (for J=0) and the thermal rate constant for the H+CH(4) reaction on the Jordan-Gilbert potential energy surface [J.

The dynamical observables considered include specific rate coefficients as a function of the translational energy, E(T), thermal rate coefficients in the 100-500 K temperature range. In addition, kinetic energy spectra (KES) of the D(+) ions reactively scattered in H(+) + D(2) collisions are also presented for translational energies between 0.4 eV and 2.0 eV. For the two reactions, the best global agreement between experiment and theory over the whole energy range corresponds to the QCT calculations using a gaussian binning (GB) procedure, which gives more weight to trajectories whose product vibrational action is closer to the actual integer QM values. The QM calculations also perform well, although somewhat worse over the more limited range of translational energies where they are available (E(T) &lt; 0.6 eV and E(T) &lt; 0.2 eV for the H(+) + D(2) and D(+) + H(2) reactions, respectively). The worst agreement is obtained with the SQCT method, which is only adequate for low translational energies. The comparison between theory and experiment also suggests that the most reliable rate coefficient measurements are those obtained with the merged beams technique. It is worth noting that none of the theoretical approaches can account satisfactorily for the experimental specific rate coefficients of H(+) + D(2) for E(T)≤ 0.2 eV although there is a considerable scatter in the existing measurements. On the whole, the best agreement with the experimental laboratory KES is obtained with the simulations carried out using the state resolved differential cross sections (DCSs) calculated with the QCT-GB method, which seems to account for most of the observed features. In contrast, the simulations with the SQCT data predict kinetic energy spectra (KES) considerably cooler than those experimentally determined.",

Reaction probabilities and integral cross sections (ICSs) between a collisional energy of 10(-4) eV and 0.1 eV have been calculated and compared with previously reported results of a time independent quantum mechanical (TIQM) approach. The TIQM results exhibit a dense profile with numerous narrow resonances down to Ec ~ 10(-2) eV and for the case of H2(v = 0, j = 0) a prominent peak is found at ~2.5 × 10(-4) eV. The analysis at the state-to-state level reveals that this feature is originated in those processes which yield the formation of rotationally excited HD(v' = 0, j' &gt; 0). The statistical predictions reproduce reasonably well the overall behaviour of the TIQM ICSs at the larger energy range (Ec ≥ 10(-3) eV). Thermal rate constants are in qualitative agreement for the whole range of temperatures investigated in this work, 10-100 K, although the SQM values remain above the TIQM results for both initial H2 rotational states, j = 0 and 1. The enlargement of the asymptotic region for the statistical approach is crucial for a proper description at low energies.

These processes represent important steps in a model that explains the enhanced 4.3 microm emission from CO(2) in the nocturnal mesosphere. The calculated energy transfer is mediated by weak long-range dipole-quadrupole interaction. The results of this calculation are very sensitive to the strength of the two transition moments. Because of the long range of the intermolecular potential, the resonance function, a measure of energy that can be efficiently exchanged between translation and vibration-rotation degrees of freedom, is rather narrow. A narrow resonance function coupled with the large rotational constant of OH is shown to render the results of the calculation very sensitive to the rotational distribution, or the rotational temperature if one exists, of this molecule. The calculations are carried out in the first and second orders of perturbation theory with the latter shown to give ET probabilities that are an order of magnitude larger than the former. The reasons for the difference in magnitude and temperature dependence of the first- and second-order calculations are discussed. The results of the calculations are compared with room temperature measurements as well as with an earlier calculation. Our calculated results are in good agreement with the room temperature measurements for the transfer of vibrational energy for the exothermic OH(nu=9) ET process but are about an order lower than the room temperature measurements for the exothermic OH(nu=8) ET process. The cause of this discrepancy is explored. This calculation does not give the large values of the rate coefficients needed by the model that explains the enhanced 4.3 microm emission from CO(2) in the nocturnal mesosphere.",

The primary relaxation pathway is towards local translation, followed by energy transfer to rotation through hindered-to-free rotational transitions. Free-to-free rotational transitions are found to be unimportant. All pathways are accompanied by the propagation of energy to argon phonon modes.

This occurs despite rotation and vibration distributions being close to Boltzmann from early in ensemble evolution. In this work, the study is extended to include H2 (0;0), O2 (0;0), and HF (0;0) in a wide range of atomic bath gases comprising some 22 ensembles in all. Translation-to-internal energy conversion in the systems studied was found to be relatively inefficient, falling approximately with (√μ')(-1) as bath gas mass increases, where μ' is the reduced mass of the diatomic-bath gas pair. In all 22 systems studied, T(v) exceeds T(r)--by a factor &gt; 4 for some pairs. Analysis of the constraints that influence (0;0) → (1;j) excitation for each diatomic-atom pair in momentum-angular momentum space demonstrates that a vibrational preference results from energy constraints that limit permitted collision trajectories to those of low effective impact parameter, i.e., to those that are axial or near axial on impact with the Newton surface. This implies that a steric constraint is an inherent feature of vibration-rotation excitation and arises because momentum and energy barriers must be overcome before rotational states may be populated in the higher vibrational level.",

For the vibrational energy transfer (VET) measurements, the time-resolved fluorescence of the B-X(0,0) band is monitored following the (1,0) band excitation.

In general, the propensity rules obeyed in the v=0 collision with Ar are valid in v=1, but the latter case shows a weaker tendency. It might be caused by the anisotropy difference of interaction potential when vibrational excitation is considered.

The principal focus is on the vibronic contributions, and the correlated distortions of the bipyridine ligand in the emitting MLCT excited state. To address the issues that are involved, the emission band shape at 77 K is interpreted as the sum of a fundamental component, corresponding to the {e,0'} --&gt; {g,0} transition, and progressions in the ground-state vibrational modes that correlate with the excited-state distortion. Literature values of the vibrational parameters determined from the resonance-Raman (rR) for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ are used to model the emission spectra and to evaluate the spectral analysis. The Gaussian fundamental component with an energy Ef and bandwidth Deltanu1/2 is deconvoluted from the observed emission spectrum. The first-, second-, and third-order terms in the progressions of the vibrational modes that contribute to the band shape are evaluated as the sums of Gaussian-shaped contributions of width Deltanu1/2. The fundamental and the rR parameters give an excellent fit of the observed emission spectrum of [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+, but not as good for the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ emission spectrum probably because the Franck-Condon excited state probed by the rR is different in symmetry from the emitting MLCT excited state. Variations in vibronic contributions for the series of complexes are evaluated in terms of reorganizational energy profiles (emreps, Lambdax) derived from the observed spectra, and modeled using the rR parameters. This modeling demonstrates that most of the intensity of the vibronic envelopes obtained from the frozen solution emission spectra arises from the overlapping of first-order vibronic contributions of significant bandwidth with additional convoluted contributions of higher order vibronic terms. The emrep amplitudes of these complexes have their maxima at about 1500 cm(-1) in frozen solution, and Lambdax(max) decreases systematically by approximately 2-fold as Ef decreases from 17,220 for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to 12,040 cm(-1) for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ through the series of complexes. Corrections for higher order contributions and bandwidth differences based on the modeling with rR parameters indicate that the variations in Lambdax(max) imply somewhat larger decreases in first-order bpy vibrational reorganizational energies. The large attenuation of vibrational reorganizational energies of the [Ru(Am)6-2n(bpy)n]2+ complexes contrasts with the apparent similarity of reorganizational energy amplitudes for the absorption and emission of [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+. These observations are consistent with increasing and very substantial excited-state/ground-state configurational mixing and decreasing excited-state distortion as Ef decreases, but more severe attenuation for singlet/singlet than triplet/singlet mixing (alphage &gt; alphaeg for the configurational mixing coefficients at the ground-state and excited-state potential energy minima, respectively); it is inferred that 0.18 &gt; or = alphage2 &gt; or = 0.09 for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and 0.37 &gt; or = alphage2 &gt; or = 0.18 for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ in DMSO/water glasses, where the ranges are based on models that there is or is not a spin restriction on configurational mixing (alphage &gt; alphaeg and alphage = alphaeg), respectively, for these complexes.",

For the intermolecular VRT levels we used a 6 + 6d model in which the fast intramolecular vibrations are adiabatically separated from the much slower intermolecular vibrations, tunneling motions, and overall rotations. We also tested two six-dimensional (6d) rigid monomer models in which the monomers were frozen either at their equilibrium geometry or at their ground state vibrationally averaged geometry. All the results from the 6 + 6d model agree well with the large amount of detailed experimental data available from high-resolution spectroscopy. For most of the parameters characterizing the spectra the results of the two 6d rigid monomer models do not significantly differ from the 6 + 6d results. An exception is the relatively large acceptor tunneling splitting, which was the only quantity for which the 6d model with the monomers frozen at their equilibrium geometry was not in good agreement with the experimental data. The 6d model with monomers at their vibrationally averaged geometry performs considerably better, and the full 6 + 6d results agree with the measurements also for this quantity. For the excited intramolecular vibrations we tested two 6 + 6d models. In the first model the excitation was assumed to be either on the donor in the hydrogen bond or on the acceptor, and to hop from one monomer to the other upon donor-acceptor interchange. In the second model the monomer excitation remains localized on a given monomer for all dimer geometries. Almost the same frequencies of the intramolecular vibrations were found for the two models. The calculations show considerable variations in the frequencies of the intramolecular modes for transitions involving different tunneling levels and different values of the rotational quantum number K. For K = 0 --&gt; 0 transitions these variations largely cancel, however. A comparison with experimental data is difficult, except for the acceptor asymmetric stretch mode observed in high-resolution spectra, because it is not clear how much the different transitions contribute to the (unresolved) peaks in most of the experimental spectra. The large red shift of the donor bound OH stretch mode is correctly predicted, but the value calculated for this red shift is too small by more than 20%. Also in the smaller shifts of the other modes we find relatively large errors. It is useful, however, that our detailed calculations including all ground and excited state tunneling levels provide an explanation for the splitting of the acceptor asymmetric stretch band observed in He nanodroplet spectra, as well as for the fact that the other bands in these spectra show much smaller or no splittings.",

Specifically, competing H-bond structures (HBSs) may differ in the quantitative proportion between one-point and multiple-point H-bond connections. For an assessment of such HBSs, the effects of their internal as well as external (packing) interactions need to be taken into consideration. The semi-classical density sums (SCDS-PIXEL) method, which enables the calculation of interaction energies for molecule-molecule pairs, was used to investigate six polymorphs of phenobarbital (Pbtl) with different quantitative proportions of one-point and two-point H-bond connections. The structures of polymorphs V and VI of Pbtl were determined from single crystal data. Two-point H-bond connections are inherently inflexible in their geometry and lie within a small PIXEL energy range (-45.7 to -49.7 kJ mol(-1)). One-point H-bond connections are geometrically less restricted and subsequently show large variations in their dispersion terms and total energies (-23.1 to -40.5 kJ mol(-1)). The comparison of sums of interaction energies in small clusters containing only the strongest intermolecular interactions showed an advantage for compact HBSs with multiple-point connections, whereas alternative HBSs based on one-point connections may enable more favourable overall packing interactions (i.e. V vs. III). Energy penalties associated with experimental intramolecular geometries relative to the global conformational energy minimum were calculated and used to correct total PIXEL energies. The estimated order of stabilities (based on PIXEL energies) is III &gt; I &gt; II &gt; VI &gt; X &gt; V, with a difference of just 1.7 kJ mol(-1) between the three most stable forms. For an analysis of competing HBSs, one has to consider the contributions from internal H-bond and non-H-bond interactions, from the packing of multiple HBS instances and intramolecular energy penalties. A compact HBS based on multiple-point H-bond connections should typically lead to more packing alternatives and ultimately to a larger number of viable low-energy structures than a competing one-point HBS (i.e. dimer vs. catemer). Coulombic interaction energies associated with typical short intermolecular C-H···O contact geometries are small in comparison with dispersion effects associated with the packing complementary molecular shapes.Graphical abstractCompeting H-bond motifs can differ markedly in their energy contributions.",

Seven of these compounds have not been studied before. The compounds are arranged in seven groups, which illustrate different cases of the internal heavy atom effect. The quantum yield of fluorescence, gamma and fluorescence decay time, tau(f) of deaerated and non-deaerated cyclohexane or ethanol solutions are measured. The oscillator strength, f(e), fluorescence rate constant, k(f), natural lifetime, tau(0)t, and intersystem crossing rate constant, kST, were calculated for each compound. The orbital nature of the lowest excited singlet state and direction of polarization of the S0 --&gt; S1 transitions are determined using the PPP-Cl method for each molecule. The investigation shows that substitution of a heavy atom(s) (Cl, S, Br, I etc.) into an aromatic or heteroaromatic molecule may produce different changes in all the fluorescence parameters (sometimes dramatically) and not necessarily lead to the quenching of fluorescence. Substitution of a heavy atom(s) may increase the value of the spin-orbit operator, Hso, if the S0 --&gt; S1 excitation is localized to some extent on a carbon atom bonded to a heavy atom(s) or on the heavy atom itself (O or S). Such substitution may change the symmetry of a molecule and hence the values of the [psiS1/Hso/psi'T1] matrix elements would change (in molecules of higher symmetry groups not all Ti states are able to mix with the perturbing S1 state). Such substitution may change the arrangement of Ti states below the S1, state and hence, the Franck-Condon factors would change. Such substitution may also change the value of the [psiS0/Mj/psiS1] matrix element and, consequently, the oscillator strength of the S0 --&gt; S1 transition would change. A combination of all these possible changes determines the value of k(f) and kST and, consequently, determines the value of gamma and tau(f). It is observed that in many cases, the value of the spin-orbit operator is related to the dipole moment operator, e.g. if the introduction of a heavy atom increases kST then, as a rule, it decreases f(e)(1A --&gt; 1La).",

The calculated energy transfer averages are confirmed to be sensitive to the shape of the repulsive wall of the intermolecular potential, with an exponential repulsive wall required for quantitative predictions.

Quasi-classical trajectory calculations were performed on an analytical potential energy surface constructed previously by our group. The strong coupling between different vibrational modes in the entry channel makes the reaction non-adiabatic and the reactant vibrational excitation increases the reactivity of the vibrational ground-state by factors of approximately 2-3 depending on the excited mode. While the H2 and CH2Cl products appear with similar moderate amounts of internal energy, about 25% of the total available energy, most of this energy appears as translational energy, and the reactant vibrational excitation has little influence. The two products appear vibrationally cold, and in the case of the H2 product, also rotationally cold. The product angular distribution is predominantly sideways-backward, the sideways component increasing with the vibrational excitation of the H2 product.

Five mixed quantum/classical methods are tested: one mean-field approach (the coherent switching with decay of mixing method), two surface-hopping methods [the fewest switches with time uncertainty (FSTU) and FSTU with stochastic decay (FSTU/SD) methods], and two surface-hopping methods with zero-point energy (ZPE) maintenance [the FSTUSD+trajectory projection onto ZPE orbit (TRAPZ) and FSTUSD+minimal TRAPZ (mTRAPZ) methods].

At low E(col) the distributions are compatible with mediation by a short-lived collision complex.

Solutions are described with molecular dynamics simulations in combination with the OPLS-aa force field for solvents and customized force field for solutes. V(i) is determined with the direct method, while the composition of V(i) is studied with Kirkwood-Buff integrals (KBIs).

Calculated V(i) deviate only 3.4 cm(3) mol(-1) (7.1%) from experimental literature values. Experimental V(i) variations across solutions are reproduced qualitatively and also quantitatively in most cases. The KBI analysis identifies differences in solute induced solvent reorganization in the immediate vicinity of H2 (&lt;0.7 nm) and solvent reorganization up to the third solvation shell of CO and CO2 (&lt;1.6 nm) as the origin of V(i) variations. In all solutions, larger V(i) are found in solvents that exhibit weak internal interactions, low cohesive energy density and large compressibility. Weak internal interactions facilitate solvent displacement by thermal solute movement, which enhances the size of solvent cages and thus V(i). Additionally, attractive electrostatic interactions of CO2 and the solvents, which do not depend on internal solvent interactions only, partially reversed the V(i) trends observed in H2 and CO solutions where electrostatic interactions with the solvents are absent. More empty space and larger pre-formed cavities are found in solvents with weak internal interactions, however, no evidence is found that solutes in any considered solvent are accommodated in pre-formed cavities. Individual solvent cages are found to be elongated in the negative direction of solute movement. This wake behind the moving solute is more pronounced in case of mobile H2 and in solvents with weaker internal interactions. However, deviations from a spherical solvent cage shape do not influence solute-solvent radial distribution functions after averaging over all solvent cage orientations and hence do not change V(i). Overall, the applied methodology reproduces V(i) and its variations reliably and the used V(i) decompositions identify the underlying reasons behind observed V(i) variations.",

Data were acquired over the range from 20-110 eV, and this wide spectral coverage highlighted that alternative vibrational modes exhibit contrasting behavior, even over a range usually considered to be dominated by atomic effects. Alternative vibrational modes exhibit qualitatively distinct energy dependences, and this contrasting mode-specific behavior underscores the point that vibrationally resolved measurements reflect the sensitivity of the electron scattering dynamics to well-defined changes in molecular geometry. In particular, such energy-dependent studies help to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for populating the symmetry forbidden vibrational levels [i.e., v+ =( 010), (001), (030), and (110)]. This is the first study in which vibrationally resolved data have been acquired as a function of energy for all of the vibrational modes of a polyatomic system.

Generally, the energy dependent trends are reproduced well by theory, but a notable exception is the symmetric stretch vibrational branching ratio. The calculated results display a strong peak in the vibrational branching ratio while the experimental data show a pronounced minimum. This suggests an interference mechanism that is not accounted for in the single-channel adiabatic-nuclei calculations.

Following vibrational excitation of the asymmetric CH stretch fundamental, ammonia fragments were detected by 2 + 1 REMPI via the B1E'' &lt;-- X1A1' and C'1A1' &lt;-- X1A1' transitions. The fragments' center-of-mass (c.m.) translational energy distributions were determined from images of selected rotational levels of ammonia with one or two quanta in the symmetric bend (nu2 umbrella mode) and were converted to rotational-state distributions of the acetylene co-fragment. The latter is always generated with one or two quanta of bending excitation. All the distributions could be fit well when using a dimer dissociation energy of D0 = 900 +/- 10 cm(-1). Only channels with maximum translational energy &lt;150 cm(-1) are observed. The rotational excitation in the ammonia fragments is modest and can be fit by temperatures of 150 +/- 50 and 50 +/- 20 K for 1nu2 and 2nu2, respectively. The rotational distributions in the acetylene co-fragment pair-correlated with specific rovibrational states of ammonia appear statistical as well. The vibrational-state distributions, however, show distinct state specificity among channels with low translational energy release. The predominant channel is NH3(1nu2) + C2H2(2nu4 or 1nu4 + 1nu5), where nu4 and nu5 are the trans- and cis-bend vibrations of acetylene, respectively. A second observed channel, with much lower population, is NH3(2nu2) + C2H2(1nu4). No products are generated in which the ammonia is in the vibrational ground state or the asymmetric bend (1nu4) state, nor is acetylene ever generated in the ground vibrational state or with CC stretch excitation. The angular momentum (AM) model of McCaffery and Marsh is used to estimate impact parameters in the internal collisions that give rise to the observed rotational distributions. These calculations show that dissociation takes place from bent geometries, which can also explain the propensity to excite fragment bending levels. The low recoil velocities associated with the observed channels facilitate energy exchange in the exit channel, which results in statistical-like fragment rotational distributions.",

These levels were observed by double resonance, using 1+1' two-color pulsed-field ionization zero-kinetic-energy photoelectron spectroscopy. The intermediate states were single rovibrational levels chosen from the A1Au, 4nu3 (K = 1-2), 5nu3 (K = 1), nu2+4nu3 (K = 0), and 47,206 cm(-1) (K = 1) levels of C2H2. Seven of the trans-bending levels of C2H2+ (upsilon4 = 0-3, K = 0-2) had been reported previously by Pratt et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 99, 6233 (1993)]; our results for these levels agree well with theirs. A full analysis has been carried out, including the Renner-Teller effect and the vibrational anharmonicity for both the trans- and cis-bending vibrations. The rotational structure of the lowest 16 vibronic levels (consisting of the complete set of levels with upsilon4 + upsilon5 &lt; or = 2, except for the unobserved upper (2Pi u component of the 2nu4 overtone) could be fitted by least squares using 16 parameters to give an rms deviation of 0.21 cm(-1). The vibronic coupling parameter epsilon5 (about whose magnitude there has been controversy) was determined to be -0.0273(7). For the higher vibronic levels, an additional parameter, r45, was needed to allow for the Darling-Dennison resonance between the two bending manifolds. Almost all the observed levels of the upsilon4 + upsilon5 = 3 and 4 polyads (about half of the predicted number) could then be assigned. In a final fit to 39 vibronic levels with upsilon4 + upsilon5 &lt; or = 5, an rms deviation of 0.34 cm(-1) was obtained using 20 parameters. An interesting finding is that Hund's spin-coupling cases (a) and (b) both occur in the Sigmau components of the nu4 + 2nu5 combination level. The ionization potential of C2H2 (from the lowest rotational level of the ground state to the lowest rotational level of the cation) is found to be 91,953.77 +/- 0.09 cm(-1) (3sigma).",

Our method constructs a triangular g-matrix from the matrix representation of the total electron magnetic moment in the basis of the spin-orbit coupled wave functions by means of a projection technique. Principal g-values are obtained in the standard fashion by forming from the triangular matrix g the tensor G=gg(t) and diagonalizing it. In principle, the scheme allows to calculate the spin-orbit orbital Zeeman cross term which usually gives the dominating contribution to the EPR g-shifts for any multiplicity. We have implemented this approach into a multireference spin-orbit configuration interaction (MRSOCI) program [M. Kleinschmidt et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 124101 (2006)]. Test applications are carried out for various triplet state sytems. The g-shifts of several of main group diatomics with X (3)Sigma(g)(-) ground state are investigated at the level of ab initio MRSOCI. We obtain perpendicular g-shifts which underestimate experimental Delta g(perpendicular) values from literature by approximately 13% on the average. For a set of organic triplet state molecules we employ the combined density functional theory/multireference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) technique [S. Grimme and M. Waletzke, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 5645 (1999)] to reduce the computational costs of the spin-free correlation problem. This approach yields principal g-values that match experiment well in many cases. Due to the small absolute g-shifts, a rigorous comparison will require the inclusion of first-order contributions such as the relativistic mass correction and gauge correction terms which have not been included here. For the triplet state dication trans-(CNSSS)(2)(2+) the principal g-shifts Delta g(a)=-0.3 ppt, Delta g(b)=17.5 ppt, and Delta g(c)=26.6 ppt are significantly larger and compare rather well to the experimental values Delta g(1)=-0.1+/-0.2 ppt, Delta g(2)=14.8+/-0.2 ppt, and Delta g(3)=24.8+/-0.1 ppt [A. Berces et al., Magn. Reson. Chem. 37, 353 (1999)]. In comparison to conventional truncated sum-over state techniques based on Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, our new variational approach shows, in practice, robust and advantageous convergence characteristics with respect to the size of the many-particle basis set. We demonstrate that the DFT/MRSOCI technology is a very feasible means to compute reliable g-shifts for large organic triplet systems at low computational cost.",

The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)+U method is used and its effluence on the magnetic moment is emphasized. We find that without inclusion of the Coulomb interaction U, the spin (orbital) moments have an average value between 2.69 and 3.50 μB/atom (0.04 and 0.08 μB/atom). With inclusion of U, the magnetic value is between 2.75 and 3.80 μB/atom (0.10 and 0.30 μB/atom), which provide an excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. Our results confirm that the spin moments are less quenched, while the orbital moments are strongly quenched in small Fe clusters.

We drive proton-spin quantum jumps by a magnetic radio-frequency field in a Penning trap with a homogeneous magnetic field. The induced spin transitions are detected in a second trap with a strong superimposed magnetic inhomogeneity. This enables the measurement of the spin-flip probability as a function of the drive frequency. In each measurement the proton's cyclotron frequency is used to determine the magnetic field of the trap. From the normalized resonance curve, we extract the particle's magnetic moment in terms of the nuclear magneton: μp = 2.792847350(9)μN.

It improves the precision of the forty-year-old indirect measurement, in which significant theoretical bound state corrections were required to obtain µp, by a factor of 3.

The longer this precession evolves coherently, the higher the precision of the measurement. For molecules in a trap, this coherence time could be very long indeed. We evaluate the sensitivity of an experiment where neutral molecules are trapped electrically, and compare this to an equivalent measurement in a molecular beam. We consider the use of a Stark decelerator to load the trap from a supersonic source, and calculate the deceleration efficiency for YbF molecules in both strong-field seeking and weak-field seeking states. With a 1 s holding time in the trap, the statistical sensitivity could be ten times higher than it is in the beam experiment, and this could improve by a further factor of five if the trap can be loaded from a source of larger emittance. We study some effects due to field inhomogeneity in the trap and find that rotation of the electric field direction, leading to an inhomogeneous geometric phase shift, is the primary obstacle to a sensitive trap-based measurement.",

The eigensolutions of the pair Hamiltonian provide a spectrum of pair states. Each pair state defines the distance of the two electrons involved in this state.

The pair states have to be occupied under consideration of the Pauli exclusion principle, which differs from that for one-electron states and depends on the total spin S and the total orbital angular momentum [Formula: see text] (the sum over all pair angular momenta).

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists. As yet, the complete set of bound vibrational energy levels is far from being known, experimentally as well as theoretically. In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)Σ(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128].

In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state.

Evaluation of the properties in an infinite crystal.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and precise evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Nguyen, Macchi &amp; Volkov (2020), Acta Cryst. A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

The density-dependence alone significantly enriches the equation of state. Furthermore, an additional \"landscape\" contribution to the pressure is found at lower T.

The ET dependencies of the integral cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v=0-4)+He collisions in the ET range of 0-3 eV have also been measured using the VUV photoionization guided ion beam mass spectrometric technique, in which vibrationally selected HD+(v) reactant ions were prepared via excitation of selected autoionization resonances of HD. At low total energies, a pronounced isotope effect is observed in absolute integral cross sections for the HeH++D and HeD++H channels with significant favoring of the deuteron transfer channel. As v is increased in the range of v=0-9, the integral cross sections of the HeH++D channel are found to approach those of HeD++H. The observed velocity distributions of products HeD+ and HeH+ are consistent with an impulsive or spectator-stripping mechanism. Detailed quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations are also presented for HD+(v,j=1)+He collisions at the same energies of the experiment. The QCT calculations were performed on the most accurate ab initio potential energy surface available. If the zero-point energy of the reaction products is taken into account, the QCT cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v)+He are found to be significantly lower than the experimental results at ET values near the reaction thresholds. The agreement between the experimental and QCT cross sections improves with translational energy. Except for prethreshold reactivity, QCT calculations ignoring the zero-point energy in the products are generally in good agreement with experimental absolute cross sections. The experimental HeH+/HeD+ branching ratios for the HD+(v=0-9)+He collisions are generally consistent with QCT predictions. The observed isotope effects can be rationalized on the basis of differences in thermochemical thresholds and angular momentum conservation constraints.",

Special treatment of integrals is needed only for functions with n = l and n = l + 1 at r = 0.

Application to crystal structures via the Ewald and direct summation methods.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and accurate evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Volkov, Koritsanszky &amp; Coppens (2004). Chem. Phys. Lett. 391, 170-175; Nguyen, Kisiel &amp; Volkov (2018). Acta Cryst. A74, 524-536; Nguyen &amp; Volkov (2019). Acta Cryst. A75, 448-464] is extended to the calculation of electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using two newly developed implementations: (i) the Ewald summation (ES), which includes interactions up to the hexadecapolar level and the EP correction to account for short-range electron-density penetration effects, and (ii) the enhanced EP/MM-based direct summation (DS), which at sufficiently large intermolecular separations replaces the atomic multipole moment approximation to the electrostatic energy with that based on the molecular multipole moments. As in the previous study [Nguyen, Kisiel &amp; Volkov (2018). Acta Cryst. A74, 524-536], the EP electron repulsion integral is evaluated analytically using the Löwdin α-function approach. The resulting techniques, incorporated in the XDPROP module of the software package XD2016, have been tested on several small-molecule crystal systems (benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and the crystal structure of a 181-atom decapeptide molecule (Z = 4) using electron densities constructed via the University at Buffalo Aspherical Pseudoatom Databank [Volkov, Li, Koritsanszky &amp; Coppens (2004). J. Phys. Chem. A, 108, 4283-4300]. Using a 2015 2.8 GHz Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5 computer processor, a 64-bit implementation of the Löwdin α-function and one of the higher optimization levels in the GNU Fortran compiler, the ES method evaluates the electrostatic interaction energy with a numerical precision of at least 10<sup-5</sup kJ mol<sup-1</sup in under 6 s for any of the tested small-molecule crystal structures, and in 48.5 s for the decapeptide structure. The DS approach is competitive in terms of precision and speed with the ES technique only for crystal structures of small molecules that do not carry a large molecular dipole moment. The electron-density penetration effects, correctly accounted for by the two described methods, contribute 28-64% to the total electrostatic interaction energy in the examined systems, and thus cannot be neglected.",

Dosimetric Characteristics.\nTo study the dosimetric characteristics of a commercial three-dimensional water scanner (3D SCANNER, Sun Nuclear Corp). The novel cylindrical scanner uses a compact electrometer mounted on the side of the tank, eliminating the need for chamber extension cables. The electrometer has a wide dynamic range, requiring no gain adjustment as scanning conditions change, e.g., field size, dose rate, wedge field, etc. Measurements from the 3D SCANNER were compared against those from another commercial scanner (Blue Phantom, IBA Dosimetry). Comparable collection intervals and scanning speeds were used on both systems. Profile and depth measurements were performed for open field beams (6 and 18 MV; 10-cm and 30-cm squared fields; depths of dmax, 10, and 30 cm) and wedged fields (6 and 18 MV; 30-cm squared field; depth of 10 cm). Electron beam profile and depth measurements were performed for a 20-cm squared applicator (6, 12, and 20 MeV; depth of dmax). The root mean square (RMS) values were determined for each scanner's measurements. The measured field sizes were within 0.06 cm and 0.05 cm for photon and electron beams, respectively. The photon D10/D20 ratios differed by &lt; 0.4% and the electron I50 values were within 0.02 cm. The RMS of the profiles was approximately 0.1% for both the 3D SCANNER and Blue Phantom measurements. Between the two scanners, all measurements agreed within RMS, excluding the penumbra region. Two exceptions occurred: a 0.5% difference was observed in the shoulder of the 12 MeV profiles, and a 0.8% difference was observed in the 6 MeV depth measurements near the surface. The quality of the scanned profile and depth measurements from the 3D SCANNER is comparable to that of another commercial scanner. Both scanning systems have similar levels of scanning noise.

Sensitivity to symmetry and spin forbidden transitions as well as correlations to the triplet states of benzene make it possible to ascribe the main features, below 7 eV in the electronic part of the EEL spectrum, to triplet transitions. The lowest EEL feature with an energy onset at 3.5 eV is attributed to a transition to the (3)B(1)(n--&gt;pi(*)) valence electronic state and the next triplet n--&gt;pi(*) transition to a (3)A(2) state located around 4.5 eV.

It is difficult to obtain a relation between R50 and Eo for all electrons at the surface because the number of scattered lower-energy electrons varies with the machine design. However, using only direct electrons to calculate Eo, there is a relationship which is in close agreement with that calculated using monoenergetic beams by Rogers and Bielajew [Med. Phys. 13, 687-694 (1986)]. We show that the empirical formula Eo,p = 0.22 + 1.98Rp + 0.0025R2p describes accurately the relationship between Rp and Eo,p for clinical beams of energies from 5 to 50 MeV with an accuracy of 3%. The electron mean energy, Ed, is calculated as a function of depth in water as well as plastic phantoms and is compared both with the relation, Ed = Eo (1-d/Rp), employed in AAPM protocols and with values in the IAEA Code of Practice. The conventional relations generally overestimate Ed over the entire therapeutic depth, e.g., the AAPM and IAEA overestimate Ed at dmax by up to 20% for an 18 MeV beam from a Clinac 2100C. It is also found that at all depths mean energies are 1%-3% higher near the field edges than at the central axis. We calculated depth-scaling factors for plastic phantoms by scaling the depth in plastics to the water-equivalent depth where the mean energies are equal. The depth-scaling factor is constant with depth in a given beam but there is a small variation ( &lt; 1.5%) depending on the incident beam energies. Depth-scaling factors as a function of R50 in plastic or water are presented for clear polystyrene, white polystyrene and PMMA phantom materials. The calculated depth-scaling factor is found to be equal to R50water/R50plastic. This is just the AAPM definition of effective density but there are up to 2% discrepancies between our calculated values and those recommended by the AAPM and the IAEA protocols. We find that the depth-scaling factors obtained by using the ratio of continuous-slowing-down ranges are inaccurate and overestimate our calculated values by 1%-2% in all cases.

Lett. 248, 409), which was determined by fits to vibrational term values alone and was claimed to be more accurate than other published spectroscopically determined potentials for this system, actually gives unacceptably poor results for rotationally excited water. Reasons for this failure are discussed and the dangers of relying on vibrational term values alone are emphasized. Previous spectroscopic potentials for ground state NO2 are all found to have problems with unphysical minima (\"holes\"). Starting from the potential energy surface for the ground (&amp;Xtilde;2A1) electronic state of NO2 constructed by S. A. Tashkun and P. Jensen (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 173) using the approximate MORBID approach a suitable starting point for fits using an exact kinetic energy operator approach was constructed. Least-squares fits to 17 potential parameters gives a potential which reproduces 173 vibrational term values with a standard deviation of only 2.8 cm-1 in the low-energy region (&lt;10 000 cm-1). For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state. We were unable to fit these levels.

Because of the lack of inversion symmetry the B20 structure exists in two enantiomorphic forms denoted as A and B. The threefold {111} surfaces have polar character. In both nonequivalent (111) and (111) directions several surface terminations differing in structure and chemical composition are possible. The formation of the threefold surfaces has been studied by simulated cleavage experiments and by calculations of the surface energies. Because of the polar character of the threefold surfaces calculations for stoichiometric slabs permit only the determination of the average energy of the surfaces exposed on both sides of the slab. Calculations for nonstoichiometric slabs performed in the grand canonical ensemble yield differences of the surface energies for the possible terminations as a function of the chemical potential in the reactive atmosphere above the surface and predict a transition between Ga- and Pd-terminated surfaces as a function of the chemical potential. The {100} surfaces are stoichiometric and uniquely defined. The calculated surface energies are identical to the average energies of the {100} surfaces of the pure metals. The {210} surfaces are also stoichiometric, with an energy very close to that of the {100} surfaces. Assuming that for the {111} surfaces the energies of different possible terminations are in a proportion equal to that of the concentration-weighted energies of the {111} surfaces of the pure metals, surface energies for all possible {111} terminations may be calculated. The preferable termination perpendicular to the A&lt;111&gt; direction consists of a bilayer with three Ga atoms in the upper and three Pd atoms in the lower part. The surface energy of this termination further decreases if the Pd triplet is covered by additional Ga atom. Perpendicular to the A&lt;111&gt; direction the lowest energy has been found for a bilayer with three Ga atoms per surface cell in the upper layer and one Ga and one Pd in the lower part. The calculated surface energies are in agreement with a simulated cleavage experiment. However, cleavage does not result in the formation of the lowest-energy surfaces, because all possible {111} cleavage planes expose a low-energy surface on one, and a high-energy surface on the other side. The prediction of Ga-terminated surfaces has been tested against the available experimental information. The calculated surface electronic density of states is in very good agreement with photo-emission spectroscopy. Calculated STM images of the most stable surfaces agree with all details of the available experimental images. The chemical reactivity of the most stable surfaces has been studied by the adsorption of CO molecules. The adsorption energies and maximum coverages calculated for the Ga-terminated surfaces permit a reasonable interpretation of the observed thermal desorption spectra, whereas for the Pd-terminated surfaces the calculated adsorption energies are far too high.",

Proper analysis of transport for these conditions requires a kinetic approach to resolve the dynamics of the electron energy distribution (EED) and its non-Maxwellian character. To facilitate such an investigation, a method was developed for modeling electron-electron collisions in a Monte Carlo simulation and the method was incorporated into a two-dimensional plasma equipment model. Electron temperatures, electron densities, and EEDs obtained using the model were compared with measurements for ICPs sustained in argon. It was found that EEDs were significantly depleted at low energies in regimes dominated by noncollisional heating, typically within the classical electromagnetic skin depth.

The density-dependence alone significantly enriches the equation of state. Furthermore, an additional \"landscape\" contribution to the pressure is found at lower T.

By the addition of a narrow (typically 1 cm wide) photon beam near the field edge, the 50-90% penumbra width of the electron beam is reduced, yielding a significantly increased effective field size. For rectangular electron beams in a water phantom (energies 25 and 40 MeV, field sizes 5 x 5-15 x 15 cm2) a computer program was used to optimize the photon beam parameters (position, weight and width) to obtain a combined beam with the sharpest penumbra at the optimization depth and a beam flatness within certain constraints.

These hourglass-like figures that join two fusing membranes have high bending energies, which can be estimated using continuum elasticity models. Fusion pore bending energies depend strongly on shape, and the present study developed a method for determining the shape that minimizes bending energy. This was first applied to a fusion pore modeled as a single surface and then extended to a more realistic model treating a bilayer as two monolayers. For the two-monolayer model, fusion pores were found to have metastable states with energy minima at particular values of the pore diameter and bilayer separation. Fusion pore energies were relatively insensitive to membrane thickness but highly sensitive to spontaneous curvature and membrane asymmetry. With symmetrical bilayers and monolayer spontaneous curvatures of -0.1 nm(-1) (a typical value) separated by 6 nm (closest distance determined by repulsive hydration forces), fusion pore formation required 43-65 kT. The pore radius of approximately 2.25 nm fell within the range estimated from conductance measurements. With bilayer separation &gt;6 nm, fusion pore formation required less energy, suggesting that protein scaffolds can promote fusion by bending membranes toward one another. With nonzero spontaneous monolayer curvature, the shape that minimized the energy change during fusion pore formation differed from the shape that minimized its energy after it formed. Thus, a nascent fusion pore will relax spontaneously to a new shape, consistent with the experimentally observed expansion of nascent fusion pores during viral fusion.",

In the medium-energy range (&gt; or = 100 kV), variations are limited to, at most, 1.5% for 120 kV-150 kV when comparing the most extreme variations in field size and depth (i.e., 2-cm depth; 20-cm2 area compared to 5 cm depth; 200-cm2 area). Depth variations most importantly affect the overall correction factor by hardening of the photon fluence spectrum, whereas field diameter variations affect the factor by increase or decrease of contributions of photon scattering.

To bolster stability, researchers have developed low-dimensional perovskites wherein bulky organic ligands terminate the perovskite lattice, forming quantum wells (QWs) that are protected by the organic layers. In thin films, the width of these QWs exhibits a distribution that results in a spread of bandgaps in the material arising due to varying degrees of quantum confinement across the population. Means to achieve refined control over this QW width distribution, and to examine and understand its influence on photovoltaic performance, are therefore of intense interest. Here we show that moving to the ligand allylammonium enables a narrower distribution of QW widths, creating a flattened energy landscape that leads to ×1.4 and ×1.9 longer diffusion lengths for electrons and holes, respectively. We attribute this to reduced ultrafast shallow hole trapping that originates from the most strongly confined QWs. We observe an increased PCE of 14.4% for allylammonium-based perovskite QW photovoltaics, compared to 11-12% PCEs obtained for analogous devices using phenethylammonium and butylammonium ligands. We then optimize the devices using mixed-cation strategies, achieving 16.5% PCE for allylammonium devices.

The energy response factor for a given radiation quality relative to 60Co was determined for BeO and compared to the Al2O3:C and LiF:Mg,Ti dosemeters. Burlin cavity theory calculations were done using mean photon energy (MPE) of the beam spectra, while EGSnrc software package was used to carry out MC simulation of full spectra. The cavity theory and MC methods agreed well within the 0.7%. Energy response of x-ray beams at MV range showed a maximum of 1.5% under-response. At energies higher than 150 kV (105 keV MPE) showed no significant difference while a significant under-response were observed at 100 kV (53 keV MPE) and 50 kV (29 keV MPE), ~8 and ~12%, respectively. BeO, Al2O3:C and LiF:Mg,Ti dosemeters exhibited very similar energy response at higher energies mainly in the MeV range. At 50 kV (29 keV MPE), however, BeO dosemeter under responded by a factor of 0.878, while Al2O3:C and LiF:Mg,Ti dosemeters over responded by a factor of 3.2 and 1.44, respectively. Furthermore, at low energies, BeO energy response showed dependence on photon spectra. For instance, at 100 kV, the difference was ~8, ~6 and 2% for 53, 60 and 83 keV MPE (ISO 4037N-100), respectively. Furthermore, calibration with 137Cs instead of 60Co resulted up to 1.8% differences in energy response. Both energy spectrum and calibration methods make considerable differences in energy response of OSLDs. This study concludes that BeO chips are nearly energy independent at energies higher than 100 keV MPE, while Al2O3:C dosemeters show an extremely enhanced energy-response ranging between 1.44 and 3.2 at energies between 170 and 29 keV MPE mainly due to dominance of photoelectric effect.",

Three potential energy surfaces (PES) are studied, namely, those of Bradley and Schatz (BS), Yu, Muckerman, and Sears (YMS), and Lakin, Troya, Schatz, and Harding (LTSH). 6-D calculations are performed only for the BS PES, while 5-D results are reported for all three PES'. The 6-D results obtained in the present work improve on those previously reported, since a larger vibrational basis and a better representation of the OH and CO bonds has been introduced. In particular, we now employ a generalized Lanczos-Morse discrete variable representation for both the OH and CO vibrations. In a further improvement, the generalized discrete variable representation of the CO vibration is based on different CO intramolecular potentials for the asymptotic and product grids employed in our projection formalism. This new treatment of the vibrational bases allows for a large reduction in computation time with respect to our previous implementation of the wave packet method, for a given level of accuracy. As a result, we have been able to extend the range of collision energies for which we can obtain converged 6-D results to a higher energy (0.8 eV) than was possible before (0.5 eV). The comparison of the new 6-D and previous 5-D results for the BS PES shows good agreement of the general trend in the reaction probabilities over all collision energies considered (0.1-0.8 eV), while our previous 6-D calculation showed reaction probabilities that differed from the 5-D results by up to 10% between 0.5 and 0.8 eV. The 5-D reaction probabilities reveal interesting trends for the different PES'. In particular, at low energies (&lt; 0.2 eV) the LTSH PES gives rise to much larger reactivity than the other PES', while at high energies (&gt; 0.3 eV) its reaction probability decreases with respect to the BS and YMS PES', being more than a factor of 2 smaller at 0.8 eV. A 5-D calculation on a modified version of the LTSH surface shows that the van der Waals interaction in the entrance channel, which is not correctly described in the other PES' is largely responsible for its larger reactivity at low energies. The large difference between the 5-D reaction probabilities for the YMS and LTSH PES' serves to emphasize the importance of the van der Waals interaction for the reactivity at low energies, because most of the stationary point energies on the YMS and LTSH PES are rather similar, being in line with high-level ab initio information.",

Relative to central-axis ionization maximum in solid water, the maximum leakage in air observed with a cylindrical ion chamber with 1 cm solid water buildup cap at a lateral distance of 2 cm from the front and right sidewalls of applicators were 17% and 14%, respectively; these maxima were recorded for 18 MeV electron beams and applicator sizes of &gt;or=20 x 20 cm2.

Using a wide spectrum of properties of the reactive system (equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies, and relative energies of the stationary points, topology of the reaction paths, and points on the reaction swaths) as reference, the resulting analytical PES reproduces reasonably well the input ab initio information obtained at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level, which represents a severe test for the new surface. As a first application, on this analytical PES we perform an extensive kinetics study using variational transition-state theory with semiclassical transmission coefficients over a wide temperature range, 200-2000 K. For the hydrogen abstraction reaction, the forward rate constants reproduce the experimental measurements, while the reverse ones are slightly underestimated. Another severe test of the new surface is the analysis of the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). The KIEs between unsubstituted and all deuterated reactions agree with experiment in the common temperature range. For the ammonia inversion reaction, the splitting of the degenerate vibrational levels of the double well due to the tunneling contribution, which is very important in this reaction representing 93% of the reactivity at 200 K, was calculated for the NH(3) and ND(3) species.

The comparison was performed at fixed and constant values of the total angular momentum from 0 to 110 and relative translational energy up to 0.8 eV. The reaction presents a dynamical barrier, essentially due to the zero-point energy for the bending vibration near the saddle point. This determines two different reaction mechanisms. At energies higher than approximately 0.125 eV the reaction is direct, while below that value it is indirect and mediated by heavy-light-heavy resonances.

ATOMIC(hc) Enthalpies of Formation for a Large Set of Hydrocarbons.\nATOMIC is a thermochemistry protocol geared toward larger molecules with first-row atoms. It implements Pople's concept of bond separation reactions in an <iab initio</i fashion and so enhances the accuracy of midlevel composite models for atomization energies. Recently we have introduced ATOMIC(hc), a model for applications to hydrocarbons, that estimates bias and uncertainty for each of the components contributing to the ATOMIC bottom-of-the-well atomization energy ( Bakowies , D. <iJ. Chem. Theory Comput.</i 2019 , 15 , 5230 - 5251 ). Here we scrutinize the remaining components of the ATOMIC protocol, including midlevel composite models to approximate the complete-basis set (CBS) limit of CCSD(T) as well as zero-point energies (ZPEs) and thermal enthalpy increments that are evaluated from scaled harmonic MP2 frequencies. Potential errors relating to imperfections in MP2 geometries and ZPEs are estimated using auxiliary information obtained from geometry optimizations and frequency calculations at the density functional (B3LYP) level. Overall corrections to and uncertainties of enthalpies of formation are obtained from summation and error propagation, respectively. The error and uncertainty model is validated with accurate data from the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) and compared to earlier statistical assessments for the G3/99 benchmark. The proposed model is a welcome alternative to statistical assessment, first because it does not depend on comparison with experiment, second because it recognizes the expected scaling of error with system size, and third because it provides a detailed account of the importance of various contributions to overall error and uncertainty. The evaluation of ZPEs from scaled harmonic frequencies expectedly emerges as the leading source of uncertainty if highly accurate composite models are used to treat the electronic problem, but uncertainties are usually balanced with those arising from computationally more attractive B level (B<sub1</sub...B<sub6</sub) models to estimate the CBS limit of CCSD(T). ATOMIC(hc) enthalpies of formation, complete with uncertainty estimates, are reported for 161 hydrocarbons ranging in size from methane (CH<sub4</sub) to [8]circulene (C<sub32</subH<sub16</sub) and tetra-<itert</i-butyltetrahedrane (C<sub20</subH<sub36</sub).

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J.

We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT).

By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

Reaction probabilities and integral cross sections (ICSs) between a collisional energy of 10(-4) eV and 0.1 eV have been calculated and compared with previously reported results of a time independent quantum mechanical (TIQM) approach. The TIQM results exhibit a dense profile with numerous narrow resonances down to Ec ~ 10(-2) eV and for the case of H2(v = 0, j = 0) a prominent peak is found at ~2.5 × 10(-4) eV. The analysis at the state-to-state level reveals that this feature is originated in those processes which yield the formation of rotationally excited HD(v' = 0, j' &gt; 0). The statistical predictions reproduce reasonably well the overall behaviour of the TIQM ICSs at the larger energy range (Ec ≥ 10(-3) eV). Thermal rate constants are in qualitative agreement for the whole range of temperatures investigated in this work, 10-100 K, although the SQM values remain above the TIQM results for both initial H2 rotational states, j = 0 and 1. The enlargement of the asymptotic region for the statistical approach is crucial for a proper description at low energies. In particular, we find that the SQM method leads to rate coefficients in terms of the energy in perfect agreement with previously reported measurements if the maximum distance at which the calculation is performed increases noticeably with respect to the value employed to reproduce the TIQM results.",

We have examined several alternative approaches for calculating rate constants, namely, IRCmax, IRCmax at 0 K (ZK-IRCmax, with zero-point vibration energies (ZPVEs) incorporated), variational transition-state theory (VTST), and VTST with the inclusion of an Eckart tunneling correction (VTST+E). We find that the low level gives reasonable values for the ZPVEs and thermal enthalpy and entropy corrections that are required in such approaches.

Typical operating pressure of H2 was 60-300 Pa. The cross section for Li(2P)+H2--&gt;LiH+H reaction was measured using method of atomic fluorescence. The decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 2P--&gt;2S transition was monitored. The decay curve of the Li(2P) can be treated as a single exponential function. The effective lifetimes of the 2P state was obtained. According to the Stern-Volmer equation, a plot of reciprocal of effective lifetimes of the 2P state quenched by H2 against its densities yielded a slope that indicated the total cross section for deactivation and an intercept (at which the H2 pressure is zero) that provided the information about the radiative lifetime of the state. The total quenching (reactive+nonreactive) cross section for deactivation of the 2P state by means of collisions with H2 is (25.1 +/- 4.0) x 10(-16) cm2. The reactive cross section could be obtained using results of the recording of the fluorescence signals with rapid rise in transient regime (&lt;10 ns) Li(2P--&gt;2S) at the different H2 densities. The authors fitted a two-state rate equation model to obtain the cross section sigma (Li(2P)+H2--&gt;LiH+H) = (0.2 +/- 0.1) x 10(-16) cm2. The authors' results imply that reactive collisions occur on average 1/125 as often as quenching collisions. The cross section for reaction is small but not negligible.",

The same basis sets were used in symmetry-adapted perturbation theory calculations performed mainly for larger separations to provide an independent check of the supermolecular approach. The contributions beyond CCSD(T) were computed using the full configuration interaction method and basis sets up to augmented triple zeta plus midbond size. All the calculations were followed by extrapolations to complete basis set limits. For two representative points, calculations were also performed using basis sets with the cardinal number increased by one or two. For the same two points, we have also solved the Schrodinger equation directly using four-electron explicitly correlated Gaussian (ECG) functions. These additional calculations allowed us to estimate the uncertainty in the interaction energies used to fit the potential to be about 0.15 K or 0.3% at the minimum of the potential well. This accuracy is about an order of magnitude better than that achieved by earlier potentials for this system. For a near-minimum T-shaped configuration with the center-of-mass distance R=6.4 bohrs, the ECG calculations give the interaction energy of -56.91+/-0.06 K, whereas the orbital calculations in the basis set used for all the points give -56.96+/-0.16 K.
