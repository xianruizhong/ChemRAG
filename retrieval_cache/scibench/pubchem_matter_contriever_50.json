For example, they found that the complex of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ and $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ has the carbon atom nearest the nitrogen (299 pm away): the $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ molecule is at right angles to the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{N}$ 'bond', and the $\\mathrm{H}$ atoms of $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ are pointing away from the $\\mathrm{CO}_2$. The magnitude of the permanent dipole moment of this complex is reported as $1.77 \\mathrm{D}$.
