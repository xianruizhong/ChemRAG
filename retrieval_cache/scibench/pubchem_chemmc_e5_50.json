Secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, circulating ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete adrenocortical steroids, especially cortisone, which elevate blood pressure in response to stress. With normally functioning adrenal glands, recombinant corticotropin could be used to achieve pharmacologic effects similar to those from cortisone administration.",

Upon intravenous administration of BLZ-100, the CTX moiety of BLZ-100 specifically binds to and is internalized by cancer cells of neuroectodermal origin. Using a NIR imaging system, the ICG, which emits light in the NIR range, permits the intraoperative visualization of tumor cells.

Inulin stimulates the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, thereby modulating the composition of microflora. This creates an environment that protects against pathogens, toxins and carcinogens, which can cause inflammation and cancer. In addition, fermentation of inulin leads to an increase in short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid production, thereby reducing colonic pH, which may further control pathogenic bacteria growth and may contribute to inulin's cancer protective properties.",

                    "contents": "Name: Tungsten\nDescription: [\"Tungsten is a transition metal found, along with chromium, molybdenum and seaborgium, in Group VI of the Periodic Table of elements. Since its discovery in the last quarter of 18th century, tungsten-based products have been in use in a wide range of applications stretching from daily household necessities to highly specialized components of modern science and technology. As new applications and uses are discovered continuously, interest on and demand for tungsten, already an essential commodity, are projected to increase steadily in the years to come. Unavoidably, as is the case with other natural materials and/or non-renewable resources, increased demand and use of tungsten will spawn (a) increased interactions with other materials and/or non-sustainable practices, (b) a greater number of possible entry points into the natural and human environment and (c) a higher probability of deliberate or accidental releases. Currently, the existing knowledge base does not provide clear information about the behavior of tungsten-based products in the environment. The toxicological profile of tungsten, including possible effects on living organisms and exposure pathways, remains rather sketchy, narrow and fragmentary. Regulation of tungsten, both in terms of environmental and occupational safety and health, is at present limited in comparison with other metals. This pattern of environmental obscurity has been unequivocally disrupted by the events of Fallon, Nevada and the possible implication of tungsten to an acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cluster. Tungsten is now the focus of scrutiny as it currently occupies the top of 'to do' lists of various regulatory, health and environmental agencies. The occurrence of a childhood leukemia cluster in Fallon, Nevada prompted a wide investigation that involved several local, state and federal agencies led by the Centers of Disease Control (CDC). In essence, the objective of this investigation was to assess whether environmental causes were responsible for the cluster. The 16 reported leukemia cases within the time frame of 1997-2001, were well above the average for Nevada (3.0 cases/100,000 children/5 years). Several possible causes were proposed, such as jet fuel (JP-8) from a nearby military base or from a JP-8 pipeline running through the city, high levels of arsenic and other metals in the drinking water supplies, industrial pollution from a local tungsten smelting facility, and agrochemical contamination resulting from agricultural pesticide/fungicide use. Although the exact causes of leukemia are not well known, genetic and/or environmental factors may trigger the disease including ionizing and electromagnetic radiation, infectious and chemical agents. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. (A3184).\"]",

The pure metal is silvery white in color, fairly soft, and has one of the highest melting points of all pure elements. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. It is an essential trace element, being a component of the enzymes xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and nitrate reductase. There is a trace requirement for molybdenum in plants, and soils can be barren due to molybdenum deficiencies. Plants and animals generally have molybdenum present in amounts of a few parts per million. In animals molybdenum is a cofactor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase which is involved in the pathways of purine degradation and formation of uric acid. In some animals, adding a small amount of dietary molybdenum enhances growth. Francis Crick suggested that since molybdenum is an essential trace element that plays an important role in many enzymatic reactions, despite being less abundant than the more common elements, such as chromium and nickel, that perhaps this fact is indicative of Panspermia. Crick theorized that if it could be shown that the elements represented in terrestrial living organisms correlate closely with those that are abundant in some class of star - molybdenum stars, for example, that this would provide evidence of such Directed Panspermia. In small quantities, molybdenum is effective at hardening steel. Molybdenum is important in plant nutrition, and is found in certain enzymes, including xanthine oxidase. Molybdenum is used to this day in high-strength alloys and in high-temperature steels. Special molybdenum-containing alloys, such as the Hastelloys, are notably heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant. Molybdenum is used in oil pipelines, aircraft and missile parts, and in filaments. Molybdenum finds use as a catalyst in the petroleum industry, especially in catalysts for removing organic sulfurs from petroleum products. It is used to form the anode in some x-ray tubes, particularly in mammography applications. And is found in some electronic applications as the conductive metal layers in thin-film transistors (TFTs). Molybdenum disulfide is a good lubricant, especially at high temperatures. And Mo-99 is used in the nuclear isotope industry. Molybdenum pigments range from red-yellow to a bright red orange and are used in paints, inks, plastics, and rubber compounds.']",

The pure metal is silvery white in color, fairly soft, and has one of the highest melting points of all pure elements. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. It is an essential trace element, being a component of the enzymes xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and nitrate reductase. There is a trace requirement for molybdenum in plants, and soils can be barren due to molybdenum deficiencies. Plants and animals generally have molybdenum present in amounts of a few parts per million. In animals molybdenum is a cofactor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase which is involved in the pathways of purine degradation and formation of uric acid. In some animals, adding a small amount of dietary molybdenum enhances growth. Francis Crick suggested that since molybdenum is an essential trace element that plays an important role in many enzymatic reactions, despite being less abundant than the more common elements, such as chromium and nickel, that perhaps this fact is indicative of Panspermia. Crick theorized that if it could be shown that the elements represented in terrestrial living organisms correlate closely with those that are abundant in some class of star - molybdenum stars, for example, that this would provide evidence of such Directed Panspermia. In small quantities, molybdenum is effective at hardening steel. Molybdenum is important in plant nutrition, and is found in certain enzymes, including xanthine oxidase. Molybdenum is used to this day in high-strength alloys and in high-temperature steels. Special molybdenum-containing alloys, such as the Hastelloys, are notably heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant. Molybdenum is used in oil pipelines, aircraft and missile parts, and in filaments. Molybdenum finds use as a catalyst in the petroleum industry, especially in catalysts for removing organic sulfurs from petroleum products. It is used to form the anode in some x-ray tubes, particularly in mammography applications. And is found in some electronic applications as the conductive metal layers in thin-film transistors (TFTs). Molybdenum disulfide is a good lubricant, especially at high temperatures. And Mo-99 is used in the nuclear isotope industry. Molybdenum pigments range from red-yellow to a bright red orange and are used in paints, inks, plastics, and rubber compounds.",

Thorium is used to make ceramics, gas lantern mantles, and metals used in the aerospace industry and in nuclear reactions. Thorium can also be used as a fuel for generating nuclear energy. Thorium has been linked to increased risk of liver cancer. (L1094, L1838)",

Upon intravenous administration of BLZ-100, the CTX moiety of BLZ-100 specifically binds to and is internalized by cancer cells of neuroectodermal origin. Using a NIR imaging system, the ICG, which emits light in the NIR range, permits the intraoperative visualization of tumor cells.

Inulin stimulates the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, thereby modulating the composition of microflora. This creates an environment that protects against pathogens, toxins and carcinogens, which can cause inflammation and cancer. In addition, fermentation of inulin leads to an increase in short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid production, thereby reducing colonic pH, which may further control pathogenic bacteria growth and may contribute to inulin's cancer protective properties.",
