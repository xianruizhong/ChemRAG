We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments.

The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL.

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10 keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000 nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions. This paper proposes a back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by the mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA) to construct a prediction model and evaluate the corresponding prediction effect. The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$. The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between SAEM and FOCEi using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status. Under the fasted state, the first-order absorption into the central compartment was preceded by zero-order infusion into the depot compartment, whereas for the fed state, the absorption into the depot was instantaneous followed by first-order absorption from depot into the central compartment.

However, classical methods that use least-squares (LS) or maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are unsatisfactory at higher noise levels because the underlying inverse problem is ill-posed. This article provides a pipeline to enhance the synthesis of such images in three-dimensional (3D) using a deep learning (DL) neural network architecture for spatial regularization in a personalized setting where having more than a few training images is impractical. Our DL enhancements employ a Deep Image Prior (DIP) with a U-net type denoising architecture that includes situations with minimal training data, such as personalized syn-MRI. We provide a general workflow for syn-MRI from three or more training images. Our workflow, called DIPsyn-MRI, uses DIP to enhance training images, then obtains parametric images using LS or MLE before synthesizing images at desired design parameter settings. DIPsyn-MRI is implemented in our publicly available Python package DeepSynMRI available at: https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI. We demonstrate feasibility and improved performance of DIPsyn-MRI on 3D datasets acquired using the Brainweb interface for spin-echo and FLASH imaging sequences, at different noise levels. Our DL enhancements improve syn-MRI in the presence of different intensity nonuniformity levels of the magnetic field, for all but very low noise levels. This article provides recipes and software to realistically facilitate DL-enhanced personalized syn-MRI.",

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The results showed that of all these gases, only the CH$_4$ gas molecule was the electron acceptor with significant charge transfer on the VO$_2$ sheet. The adsorption energies of CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O are -229.5 meV, -239.1 meV and -388.3 meV, respectively. We have also compared the adsorption energy of three different gas molecules on the VO$_2$ surface, our calculation results show that when the three kinds of gases are adsorbed on the VO$_2$ surface, the order of the surface adsorption energy is H$_2$O$&gt;$ CO$&gt;$ CH$_4$. It is also found that after adsorption of CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O molecules, the electronic properties of VO$_2$ sheet changed obviously. However, due to the strong adsorption of H$_2$O molecule on VO$_2$ sheet, it is difficult to desorption, which hinders its application in gas molecular sensors. The optical properties of VO$_2$ sheet are further calculated. The absorption of CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O molecules is introduced to red-shift the dielectric function of the thin film, which indicates that the optical properties of the thin film have changed significantly. According to the change of optical properties of VO$_2$ sheet before and after molecular adsorption, VO$_2$ can be used as a highly selective optical gas sensor for CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O detection. These results provide a new approach for the potential application of VO$_2$ based optical gas sensors.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05).

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids.

We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p &lt; 0.001). The expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p &lt; 0.05).

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10 keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000 nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions.

The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$. The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins differed significantly and amounted to $0.18$ % (red wine) and $0.23$ % (red grape juice) of the administered dose. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity increased to higher levels after juice ingestion compared to wine. The intestinal absorption of the anthocyanins of red grape juice seemed to be improved compared to red wine, suggesting a possible synergistic effect of the glucose content of the juice.

The purpose of this paper is to experimentally optimize the energy thresholds and tube voltage for single-exposure DE x-ray angiography. We optimized single-exposure DE x-ray angiography using the iodine signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) per root patient air kerma (κ) as a figure of merit. We measured the iodine SDNR by imaging an iodine stepwedge immersed in a water tank with a depth of 30 cm in the direction of x-ray propagation. The stepwedge was imaged using tube voltages ranging from 90 to 150 kV and a cadmium telluride (CdTe) x-ray detector with two energy bins and analog charge summing for charge sharing suppression. The energy threshold that separates the two energy bins was varied from approximately 35 keV to approximately 75% of the maximum energy of the x-ray beam.

Using the optimal parameters, we imaged a phantom with vessel-simulating structures and background clutter. The optimal energy thresholds increased monotonically from ∼50 to ∼85 keV over the range of tube voltages considered. For tube voltages greater than 90 kV, the optimal energy thresholds consistently allocated approximately two thirds of all detected primary photons to the low energy bin; this ratio was preserved without scatter.

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039 kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57 $\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mol}/{\\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30 000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",

We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO).

We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

The proposed system incorporates all aspects of a conventional tethered fiber-based biophotometry system encompassed into a wireless microsystem. The interface includes an LED as excitation light source, a custom designed CMOS biosensor, a multimode fiber, a microcontroller (MCU), and a wireless data transceiver enclosed within a 3D-printed, small and light weight, plastic housing. Precisely, the system incorporates a new optoelectronic biosensor merging two individual building blocks, namely a low-noise sensing front-end and $\\mathrm {a}2 ^{nd}$ order continuous-time $\\Sigma \\Delta $ modulator (CTSDM), into a single module for enabling high-sensitivity and high energy-efficiency photo-sensing. The proposed CMOS biosensor is implemented in $\\mathrm {a}0 .18- \\mu m$ CMOS technology, consuming $41 \\mu W$ from $\\mathrm {a}1 .8- V$ supply voltage, while achieving a peak dynamic range of $86 dB$ over a $50- Hz$ input bandwidth at a 20-kS/s sampling rate.

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors. To account for this, this work proposes a sensor interface with $\\mathrm {C}_{P}$ canceller. By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface.

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the \"portullugo\" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (~ 2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with ~ 50% matrix completeness across data sets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support: Anacampserotaceae $+$ Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees.

Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected.

We applied this methodology to study a particular case of interest: the angular dynamics of spherical nanoparticles with homogeneous and isotropic electromagnetic responses. We analytically calculate the total angular momentum transferred from a swift electron to such nanoparticles, finding that it is electric in nature and it is always in a direction determined by the electron trajectory relative to the center of the nanoparticle. We realize that it is possible to represent the angular momentum transferred as the product of two functions: the extinction cross-section of the nanoparticle and a function that only contains information about the swift electron. We present numerical results for the total angular momentum transferred from a swift electron to an aluminum and a gold nanoparticle. We also present an analysis of the temporal behavior of the torque and the electric dipole moment induced within the nanoparticle by the swift electron. We compare the angular momentum transfer calculated in this work with a previously reported case of vortex beams, finding that, for both aluminum and gold nanoparticles, our results are two orders of magnitude smaller.

In addition to the dipole-dipole interactions often discussed in the literature, these parameters give, in particular, access to the spin-lattice effects controlled by spin-orbit coupling. By treating changes in the spin configuration and atomic positions at the same level, closed expressions for the atomic spin-lattice coupling parameters can be derived in a coherent manner up to any order. Analyzing the properties of these parameters, in particular their dependence on spin-orbit coupling, we find that even in bcc Fe the leading term for the angular momentum exchange between the spin system and the lattice is a Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya-type interaction, which is due to the symmetry breaking distortion of the lattice.",

In contrast, spontaneous spin-up is virtually absent for such flows in a circular domain with a no-slip boundary. In order to acquire an understanding of this strikingly different behavior observed on the square and the circle, we consider a set of elliptic geometries with a gradual increase of the eccentricity. It is shown that a variation of the eccentricity can be used as a control parameter to tune the relative contribution of the pressure and viscous stresses in the angular momentum balance. Direct numerical simulations demonstrate that the magnitude of the torque can be related to the relative contribution of the pressure. As a consequence, the number of spin-up events in an ensemble of slightly different initial conditions depends strongly on the eccentricity. For small eccentricities, strong and rapid spin-up events are observed occasionally, whereas the majority of the runs do not show significant spin-up. Small differences in the initial condition can result in a completely different evolution of the flow and an appearance of the end state of the decay process. For sufficiently large eccentricities, all the runs in the ensemble demonstrate strong and rapid spin-up, which is consistent with the flow development on the square. It is verified that the number of spin-up events for a given eccentricity does not depend on the Reynolds number of the flow. This observation is consistent with the conjecture that it is the pressure on the domain boundaries that drives the spin-up processes.",

In this work, we show that these solutions can be unstable when the spin of the higher-mass black hole is aligned with the orbital angular momentum and the spin of the lower-mass black hole is antialigned. Spins in these configurations are unstable to precession to large misalignment when the binary separation r is between the values r(ud±)=(√(χ(1))±√(qχ(2)))(4)(1-q)(-2)M, where M is the total mass, q≡m(2)/m(1) is the mass ratio, and χ(1) (χ(2)) is the dimensionless spin of the more (less) massive black hole.

We describe the origin and nature of the instability using recently developed analytical techniques to characterize fully generic spin precession.

Their dispersion profiles are found to be qualitatively very different, and the R(1F) in particular shows significant dispersion (varying over two orders of magnitude) in the entire isotropic range, unlike R(1H). The proton spin-lattice relaxation, as has been established, is mediated by time modulation of magnetic dipolar interactions with other protons (case of like spins), and the discernable dispersion in the mid-frequency range, observed as the isotropic to nematic transition is approached on cooling, is indicative of the critical slowing of the time fluctuations of the nematic order. Significant dispersion seen in the R(1F) extending to very low frequencies suggests a distinctly different relaxation path which is exclusively sensitive to the ultra slow modes apparently present in the system. We find that under the conditions of our experiment at low Zeeman fields, spin-rotation coupling of the fluorine with the molecular angular momentum is the dominant mechanism, and the observed dispersion is thus attributed to the presence of slow torques experienced by the molecules, arising clearly from collective modes. Following the arguments advanced to explain similar slow processes inferred from earlier detailed ESR measurements in liquid crystals, we propose that slowly relaxing local structures representing such dynamic processes could be the likely underlying mechanism providing the necessary slow molecular angular momentum correlations to manifest as the observed low frequency dispersion.

The improved scattering power is T(dM)[triple band]f(dM)(pv,p1v1) x (E(s)/pv)(2)1/X(s) where fdM 0.5244+0.1975 lg(1-(pv/p1v1)2)+0.2320 lg(pv)-0.0098 lg(pv)lg(1-(pv/p1v1)2), P1v1 (MeV) is the initial product of proton momentum and speed, pv is the same at the point of interest, and E(s) = 15.0 MeV. T(dM) is easily computed and generalizes readily to mixed slabs because fdM is not material dependent. Whether an accurate formula for T is required depends very much on the problem at hand. For beam spreading in water, five of the six formulas for T give almost identical results, suggesting that patient dose calculations are insensitive to T. That is not true, however, of beam spreading in Pb. At the opposite extreme, the projected rms beam width at the end of a Pb/Lexan/air stack, analogous to the upstream modulator in a passive beam spreading system, is sensitive to T. In this case a simple experiment would discriminate between all but two of the six formulas discussed. Scattering power applies as much to Monte Carlo as to deterministic transport calculations. Using T in any of its forms will avoid step size dependence. Using the best available T could be important in general purpose Monte Carlo codes, which are expected to give the correct answer to many different problems.",

We demonstrate that the unphysical states arise due to the incompleteness of the space-fixed total angular momentum basis caused by using a fixed cutoff value J<submax</sub for the total angular momentum of the collision complex J. As a result, certain orbital angular momentum (l) basis states lack the full range of J values required by the angular momentum addition rules, resulting in the appearance of unphysical states. We find that by augmenting the basis with a full range of J-states for every l, it is possible to completely eliminate the unphysical states from quantum scattering calculations on molecular collisions in external magnetic fields. To illustrate the procedure, we use the augmented basis sets to calculate the state-to-state cross sections for rotational and spin relaxation in cold collisions of <sup40</supCaH(X<sup2</supΣ<sup+</sup, v = 0, N = 1, M<subN</sub = 1, M<subS</sub = 1/2) molecules with <sup4</supHe atoms in a magnetic field.

The large g-anisotropy is shown to result in large dipolar couplings near g( parallel) and uniquely anisotropic (14)N Fermi couplings, which arise from spin transferred to the nitrogen 2s orbital (2.2%) via antibonding interactions with singly occupied metal d(x(2)-y(2)) and d(z(2)) orbitals.

The parametrization is consistent with the framework of 3OB for main group elements (ONCHPS) and can be readily used for biological applications that involve copper proteins/peptides. The key to our parametrization is to introduce orbital angular momentum dependence of the Hubbard parameter and its charge derivative, thus allowing the 3d and 4s orbitals to adopt different sizes and responses to the change of charge state. The parametrization has been tested by applying to a fairly broad set of molecules of biological relevance, and the properties of interest include optimized geometries, ligand binding energies, and ligand proton affinities. Compared to the reference QM level (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ, which is shown here to be similar to the B97-1 and CCSD(T) results, in terms of many properties of interest for a set of small copper containing molecules), our parametrization generally gives reliable structural properties for both Cu(I) and Cu(II) compounds, although several exceptions are also noted.

The issues of their computation and characterization for large values of their entries are a challenge for diverse fields, such as spectroscopy and quantum chemistry, molecular and condensed matter physics, quantum computing, and the geometry of space time. Here we record progress both in their efficient calculation and in the study of the large j asymptotics.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery.

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the \"portullugo\" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (~ 2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with ~ 50% matrix completeness across data sets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support: Anacampserotaceae $+$ Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees.

In cortex of PD monkey, Neurons discharged from single-spike mode to burst-firing mode compared to normal monkey; Mean amplitude was $197 \\mu \\mathrm{V}$ that was twice of mean amplitude of normal monkey, and mean firing rate was 82Hz; burst-firing activity showed distinctive, stereotypic periods of oscillatory lasted for $20 \\pm 5\\mathrm{s}$ occurring ever 30-40 seconds, which was consistent with local field potential (LFP) oscillating at 4.79Hz related to PD tremor; neuronal discharge were approximately synchronous from four channels, that were consistent with local field potential fluctuating greatly with a correlation coefficient of 0.99997, and the main frequency of local field potential had a good respond to firing rate of spike with a correlation coefficient of 0.9891. In striatum of PD monkey, two types of neurons were detected with mean amplitude of $102 \\mu \\mathrm{V}$ and $296 \\mu \\mathrm{V}$ respectively; the mean firing rate was 62 Hz significantly higher than that in normal monkey; as for one representative type of neurons, with respect to local field potential oscillating at a period in cortex, local field potential continuously oscillated in striatum at low frequency at the range of 4-7Hz which was constituent with neuronal burst firing rate, while single neuron discharged at the range of 10-32Hz, almost at beta frequencies.

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation. A first study ($\\mathrm{N}=30$) that focused on displaying cardiac activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort. A second study ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) that focused on respiratory activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort as well as two sub-components of the sense of embodiment. Interestingly, the user's actual breathing tended to synchronize with the simulated breathing, especially with the multi-sensory and haptic displays. A third study ($\\mathrm{N}=18$) that focused on the combination of cardiac and respiratory activity showed that combining both rendering techniques significantly enhances the sensation of effort. Taken together, our results promote the use of our novel breathing display technique and multi-sensory rendering of physiological parameters in VR applications where effort sensations are prominent, such as for rehabilitation, sport training, or exergames.",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean (±standard deviation) ages: 47.4 ± 9.5 years).

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest. LSCI was used to measure the area of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miarea</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{area}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and the perfusion level of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and normal skin ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miN</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${N}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ).

We compared the perfusion and expression levels of intrinsic cytokines between keloids and normal skin. We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p &lt; 0.001). The expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p &lt; 0.05).

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles. As the FEV(1) quartile worsened (mean, 62%, 49%, 39%, and 27% predicted), functional residual capacity increased (144%, 151%, 164%, and 185% predicted), IC decreased (86%, 81%, 69%, and 60% predicted), and peak incremental cycle work rate decreased (66%, 55%, 50%, and 44% predicted); CWR endurance time was 9.7, 9.3, 8.2, and 7.3 min, respectively.

Dyspnea intensity at this inflection point was also similar across quartiles (3.1-3.7 Borg units) but accelerated steeply to intolerable levels thereafter. Progressive reduction of the resting IC with increasing disease severity was associated with the appearance of critical constraints on Vt expansion and a sharp increase in dyspnea to intolerable levels at a progressively lower ventilation during exercise.",

For electron scattering, new total electron scattering cross sections (e-TCS) have been measured with a high resolution magnetically confined electron beam transmission system from 1 to 200 eV. Dissociative electron attachment processes for electron energies from 3 to 52 eV have been analyzed by measuring the relative O<sup-</sup anion production yield. In addition, elastic, inelastic, and total scattering cross section calculations have been carried out in the framework of the Independent Atom Model by using the Screening Corrected Additive Rule, including interference effects (IAM-SCARI). Based on the previous cross section compilation from Itikawa ( <iJ. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data</i, 2002, 31, 749-767) and the present measurements and calculations, an updated recommended e-TCS data set has been used as reference values to obtain a self-consistent integral cross section data set for the elastic and inelastic (vibrational excitation, electronic excitation, and ionization) scattering channels. A similar calculation has been carried out for positrons, which shows important differences between the electron scattering behavior: e.g., more relevance of the target polarization at the lower energies, more efficient excitation of the target at intermediate energies, but a lower total scattering cross section for increasing energies, even at 5000 eV. This result does not agree with the charge independence of the scattering cross section predicted by the first Born approximation (FBA). However, we have shown that the inelastic channels follow the FBA's predictions for energies above 500 eV while the elastic part, due to the different signs of the scattering potential constituent terms, remains lower for positrons even at the maximum impact energy considered here (5000 eV). As in the case of electrons, a self-consistent set of integral positron scattering cross sections, including elastic and inelastic (vibrational excitation, electronic excitation, positronium formation, and ionization) channels is provided. Again, to derive these data, positron scattering total cross sections based on a previous compilation from Brunger et al. ( <iJ. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data</i, 2017, 46, 023102) and the present calculation have been used as reference values. Data for the main inelastic channels, i.e. direct ionization and positronium formation, derived with this procedure, show excellent agreement with the experimental results available in the literature. Inconsistencies found between different model potential calculations, both for the elastic and inelastic collision processes, suggest that new calculations using more sophisticated methods are required.",

The electron-electron and electron-positron correlation can be treated in the NEO framework with second-order perturbation theory (NEO-MP2) or multiconfigurational methods such as the full configuration interaction (NEO-FCI) and complete active space self-consistent-field (NEO-CASSCF) methods.

Using the convergent close-coupling method for the atomic hydrogen target, we examine cross sections at near-threshold energies for electron and positron impact. Contrary to the experiment, the calculated cross sections are found to behave differently for the two projectiles and consistently with the aforementioned threshold laws, despite the entirely quantum nature of these problems.

Such metastable matter-positron complexes are stabilized by a variety of mechanisms, which can have both covalent and noncovalent character. Specifically, electron-positron binding often involves strong many-body correlation effects, posing a substantial challenge for quantum-chemical methods based on atomic orbitals. Here we propose an accurate, efficient, and transferable variational ansatz based on a combination of electron-positron geminal orbitals and a Jastrow factor that explicitly includes the electron-positron correlations in the field of the nuclei, which are optimized at the level of variational Monte Carlo (VMC). We apply this approach in combination with diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to calculate binding energies for a positron <ie</i<sup+</sup and a positronium Ps (the pseudoatomic electron-positron pair), bound to a set of atomic systems (H<sup-</sup, Li<sup+</sup, Li, Li<sup-</sup, Be<sup+</sup, Be, B<sup-</sup, C<sup-</sup, O<sup-</sup and F<sup-</sup). For PsB, PsC, PsO, and PsF, our VMC and DMC total energies are lower than that from previous calculations; hence, we redefine the state of the art for these systems.

Measurements of the mass composition of cosmic rays with energies of 10(17)-10(18) electronvolts are essential to understanding whether they have galactic or extragalactic sources. It has also been proposed that the astrophysical neutrino signal comes from accelerators capable of producing cosmic rays of these energies. Cosmic rays initiate air showers--cascades of secondary particles in the atmosphere-and their masses can be inferred from measurements of the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum (Xmax; the depth of the air shower when it contains the most particles) or of the composition of shower particles reaching the ground. Current measurements have either high uncertainty, or a low duty cycle and a high energy threshold. Radio detection of cosmic rays is a rapidly developing technique for determining Xmax (refs 10, 11) with a duty cycle of, in principle, nearly 100 per cent. The radiation is generated by the separation of relativistic electrons and positrons in the geomagnetic field and a negative charge excess in the shower front. Here we report radio measurements of Xmax with a mean uncertainty of 16 grams per square centimetre for air showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies of 10(17)-10(17.5) electronvolts. This high resolution in Xmax enables us to determine the mass spectrum of the cosmic rays: we find a mixed composition, with a light-mass fraction (protons and helium nuclei) of about 80 per cent. Unless, contrary to current expectations, the extragalactic component of cosmic rays contributes substantially to the total flux below 10(17.5) electronvolts, our measurements indicate the existence of an additional galactic component, to account for the light composition that we measured in the 10(17)-10(17.5) electronvolt range.",

The calculations indicate that the binding energy (positron affinity PA) of a single positron to these systems increases by an increment of 0.2-0.3 eV as the atomic number of the alkali atom is increased. It is found that the positron prefers a location in the more electronegative regions of such molecules, similarly as has been found in earlier calculations for the urea and acetone molecules. The positron orbital itself possesses a diffuse charge distribution with relatively small expectation values of the kinetic energy in all four systems considered. Each of the four positronic molecules is stable with respect to formation of either positronium (Ps) or HPs according to the present calculations. Relatively large changes in the equilibrium bond distance of the hydrides occur as a result of the positron interaction.

Relativistic effects influence the electronic structure of heavy elements in the sixth row of the periodic table, and these effects increase dramatically in the seventh row--including the actinides--even affecting ground-state configurations. Atomic s and p1/2 orbitals are stabilized by relativistic effects, whereas p3/2, d and f orbitals are destabilized, so that ground-state configurations of heavy elements may differ from those of lighter elements in the same group. The first ionization potential (IP1) is a measure of the energy required to remove one valence electron from a neutral atom, and is an atomic property that reflects the outermost electronic configuration. Precise and accurate experimental determination of IP1 gives information on the binding energy of valence electrons, and also, therefore, on the degree of relativistic stabilization. However, such measurements are hampered by the difficulty in obtaining the heaviest elements on scales of more than one atom at a time. Here we report that the experimentally obtained IP1 of the heaviest actinide, lawrencium (Lr, atomic number 103), is 4.96(+0.08)(-0.07) electronvolts. The IP1 of Lr was measured with (256)Lr (half-life 27 seconds) using an efficient surface ion-source and a radioisotope detection system coupled to a mass separator. The measured IP1 is in excellent agreement with the value of 4.963(15) electronvolts predicted here by state-of-the-art relativistic calculations. The present work provides a reliable benchmark for theoretical calculations and also opens the way for IP1 measurements of superheavy elements (that is, transactinides) on an atom-at-a-time scale.",

In 1946, Wheeler speculated that two Ps atoms may combine to form the di-positronium molecule (Ps2), with a binding energy of 0.4 eV. More recently, this molecule has been studied theoretically; however, because Ps has a short lifetime and it is difficult to obtain low-energy positrons in large numbers, Ps2 has not previously been observed unambiguously. Here we show that when intense positron bursts are implanted into a thin film of porous silica, Ps2 is created on the internal pore surfaces. We found that molecule formation occurs much more efficiently than the competing process of spin exchange quenching, which appears to be suppressed in the confined pore geometry. This result experimentally confirms the existence of the Ps2 molecule and paves the way for further multi-positronium work. Using similar techniques, but with a more intense positron source, we expect to increase the Ps density to the point where many thousands of atoms interact and can undergo a phase transition to form a Bose-Einstein condensate. As a purely leptonic, macroscopic quantum matter-antimatter system this would be of interest in its own right, but it would also represent a milestone on the path to produce an annihilation gamma-ray laser.",

Non-Born-Oppenheimer electron-nuclear interactions in molecules, electron-hole interactions in electronically excited nanoparticles, and electron-positron interactions are examples of physical systems that require a multicomponent quantum mechanical formalism. The central challenge in the theoretical treatment of multicomponent systems is capturing the many-body correlation effects that exist not only between particles of identical types (electron-electron) but also between particles of different types (electron-nuclear and electron-hole). In this work, the development and implementation of multicomponent coupled-cluster (mcCC) theory for treating particle-particle correlation in multicomponent systems are presented. This method provides a balanced treatment of many-particle correlation effects in a general multicomponent system while maintaining a size-consistent and size-extensive formalism. The coupled-cluster ansatz presented here is an extension of the electronic structure CCSD formulation for multicomponent systems and is defined as |ΨmcCC⟩ = eT1I+T2I+T1II+T2II+T11I,II+T12I,II+T21I,II+T22I,II|0I0II⟩. The cluster amplitudes in the mcCC wave function were obtained by projecting the mcCC Schrödinger equation onto a direct product space of singly and doubly excited states of type I and II particles and then solving the resulting mcCC equations iteratively. These equations were derived using an automated application of the generalized Wick’s theorem and were implemented using a computer-assisted source code generation approach. The applicability of the mcCC method was demonstrated by calculating ground state energies of multicomponent Hooke's atom and positronium hydride systems as well as by calculating exciton and biexciton binding energies in multiexcitonic systems. For each case, the mcCC results were benchmarked against full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations and were found to be in excellent agreement with the FCI results. The effect of neglecting certain classes of multicomponent connected excitation terms from the mcCC wave function was also investigated. The results from this study demonstrate that connected cluster operators that generate simultaneous excitation in type I and type II space are critical for capturing electron-hole correlation in multiexcitonic systems.",

Electronic structure calculations were used to examine properties of complexes, transition states and products that might be important along the reaction coordinate. For CysH(+) + (1)O(2), the product channel corresponds to C(α)-C(β) bond rupture of a hydroperoxide intermediate CysOOH(+) accompanied by intramolecular H atom transfer, and subsequent dissociation to H(2)NCHCO(2)H(+), CH(3)SH and ground triplet state O(2). The reaction is driven by the electronic excitation energy of (1)O(2), the so-called dissociative excitation energy transfer. Quasi-classical direct dynamics trajectory simulations were calculated for CysH(+) + (1)O(2) at E(col) = 0.2 and 0.3 eV, using the B3LYP/6-21G method. Most trajectories formed intermediate complexes with significant lifetime, implying the importance of complex formation at the early stage of the reaction.

In contrast to CysOOH(+), TrpOOH(+) dissociates into a glycine molecule and charged indole side chain in addition to ground-state O(2) because this product charge state is energetically favorable. The reactions of CysH(+) + (1)O(2) and TrpH(+) + (1)O(2) present similar E(col) dependence, i.e., strongly suppressed by collision energy and becoming negligible at E(col) &gt; 0.5 eV.

Coupled dipole method application.\nA numerical program calculating the energy of a positron or/and an electron near the free volume in solid n-alkanes has been built. The theory of the interaction of e(+) or/and e(-) with this non-polar medium based on polarizability has been introduced. The energy of the e(+)-e(-) pair in the bulk was compared to that calculated when the pair forms a positronium (Ps) inside the free volume. The calculations are based on the coupled dipole method and the dipole-dipole interaction energy for induced dipoles is taken into account. Furthermore, a correction for the local permittivity for the e(+)-e(-) interaction is calculated taking into account the non-isotropic medium between them. The method is a step toward more accurate calculations of energetic conditions during Ps formation in matter. The possibility of the emission of the excess energy of the Ps formation as electromagnetic radiation is discussed. It is argued that if this radiation is observed, it can be used as a new spectroscopic tool providing information about the microscopic properties of media. ",

We developed a Lennard-Jones force field to account for Ps-water interactions in the MM step. The repulsive term was obtained from a previously reported model for the solvated electron, while the dispersion constant was derived from the Slater-Kirkwood formula. The force field was employed in classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to generate Ps-solvent configurations in the <iNpT</i ensemble, while the quantum properties were computed with the any-particle molecular orbital method in the subsequent QM step. Our approach is general, as it can be applied to other liquids and materials. One basically needs to describe the solvated electron in the environment of interest to obtain the Ps solvation model. The thermodynamical properties computed from the MC simulations point out similarities between the solvation of Ps and noble gas atoms, hydrophobic solutes that form clathrate structures. We performed convergence tests for the QM step, with particular attention to the choice of basis set and expansion centers for the positronic and electronic subsystems. Our largest model was composed of the Ps atom and 22 water molecules in the QM region, corresponding to the first solvation shell, surrounded by 128 molecules described as point charges. The mean electronic and positronic vertical detachment energies were (4.73 ± 0.04) eV and (5.33 ± 0.04) eV, respectively. The latter estimates were computed with Koopmans' theorem corrected by second-order self-energies, for a set of statistically uncorrelated MC configurations. While the Hartree-Fock wave functions do not properly account for the annihilation rates, they were useful for numerical tests, pointing out that annihilation is more sensitive to the choice of basis sets and expansion centers than the detachment energies. We further explored a model with reduced solute cavity size by changing the Ps-solvent force field. Although the pick-off annihilation lifetimes were affected by the cavity size, essentially the same conclusions were drawn from both models.",

Metastable antiprotonic helium (pHe(+)) is a three-body atom consisting of a normal helium nucleus, an electron in its ground state and an antiproton (p) occupying a Rydberg state with high principal and angular momentum quantum numbers, respectively n and l, such that n ≈ l + 1 ≈ 38.

No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions.

The hyperfine structure in l=0-3 Rydberg states of H2 located below the X 2Sigmag+(v+=0,N+=1) ground state of ortho H2+ has been measured in the range of principal quantum number n=50-65 at sub-MHz resolution by millimeter wave spectroscopy following laser excitation to np and nd Rydberg states using a variety of single-photon and multiphoton excitation sequences. The np1(1), nd1(1), and the nf1(0-3) Rydberg states were found to be metastable and to have lifetimes of more than 5 micros beyond n=50. Members of other series, such as the nd1(2), nd1(3), and the np1(0) series, were found to have lifetimes of more than 1 mus. Local perturbations induced by low-n Rydberg states belonging to series converging on rovibrationally excited levels of H2+ reduce the lifetimes in narrow ranges of n values. The hyperfine structure is strongly dependent on the value of the orbital angular momentum l. In the penetrating s and p states at n approximately 50 the exchange interaction dominates over the hyperfine interaction and the levels can be labeled by the total electron spin angular momentum quantum number S (S=0 or 1). In the less penetrating d and f Rydberg states, the hyperfine interaction between the core nuclear and electron spins is larger than the exchange interaction and the Rydberg states are of mixed singlet and triplet character. A procedure based on the Stark effect and on the systematic analysis of selection rules and combination differences was developed to determine the orbital and the total angular momentum quantum numbers l and F and to construct an energy map of p and f Rydberg levels between n=54 and 64 with relative positions of an accuracy of better than 1 MHz. Multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) was extended to treat the hyperfine structure in molecular Rydberg states and was used to analyze the observed hyperfine structure of the p and f Rydberg states of H2. The frame transformation between the Born-Oppenheimer channels described by the angular momentum coupling scheme (abetaJ) and the asymptotic channels described by the (e[bbetaS+]) coupling scheme was derived and enables an elegant treatment of all intermediate coupling cases. Purely ab initio quantum defect theory reproduced the experimentally determined positions to within 40 MHz for the p levels and 13 MHz for the f levels. By slight adjustments of the quantum defect functions and their energy dependences and by consideration of the p-f interaction, of the singlet-triplet splittings of the f levels, and of the departure of the ionic levels from pure coupling case (bbetaS+), the agreement between theory and experiment could be improved to 600 kHz. By comparing the results of MQDT calculations of the hyperfine structure of f Rydberg levels with those of coupled equations calculations, the frame transformation approximation of MQDT was shown to be accurate to within 300 kHz. The extrapolated ionic hyperfine structure of the X 2Sigmag+(v+=0,N+=1) ionic level corresponds to the ab initio prediciton of Babb and Dalgarno [Phys. Rev. A 46, R5317 (1992)] within the experimental error.",

We demonstrate that the unphysical states arise due to the incompleteness of the space-fixed total angular momentum basis caused by using a fixed cutoff value J<submax</sub for the total angular momentum of the collision complex J. As a result, certain orbital angular momentum (l) basis states lack the full range of J values required by the angular momentum addition rules, resulting in the appearance of unphysical states. We find that by augmenting the basis with a full range of J-states for every l, it is possible to completely eliminate the unphysical states from quantum scattering calculations on molecular collisions in external magnetic fields. To illustrate the procedure, we use the augmented basis sets to calculate the state-to-state cross sections for rotational and spin relaxation in cold collisions of <sup40</supCaH(X<sup2</supΣ<sup+</sup, v = 0, N = 1, M<subN</sub = 1, M<subS</sub = 1/2) molecules with <sup4</supHe atoms in a magnetic field.

Compact expressions are derived using a rigorous quantum mechanical analysis for the angular momentum anisotropy of either of the products (C or D) arising from an initially polarized distribution of the reactant angular momentum. The angular momentum distribution of the product is expressed in terms of canonical spherical tensors multiplied by anisotropy-transforming coefficients c(K(i)q(k))(K)(K(r),L). These coefficients act as transformation coefficients between the angular momentum anisotropy of the reactants and that of the product. They are independent of scattering angle but depend on the details of the scattering dynamics.

A key aspect of the theory is the use of projections of both reactant and product angular momenta onto the product recoil vector direction.

These elements-SAM-to-orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters-are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in optical communication.",

We compare the expressions for densities of AM in general three-dimensional modes and in paraxial modes. Despite their classical nature, these expressions have a suggestive quantum mechanical appearance, in terms of linear operators acting on mode functions. In addition, paraxial wave optics has several analogies with real quantum mechanics, both with the wave function of a free quantum particle and with a quantum harmonic oscillator.

Furthermore, entangled-photon-based decision-making has managed to solve a competitive multi-armed bandit problem in such a way that conflicts of decisions among players are avoided while ensuring equality. However, as these studies are based on the polarization of light, the number of available choices is limited to two, corresponding to two orthogonal polarization states. Here we propose a scalable principle to solve competitive decision-making situations by using the orbital angular momentum of photons based on its high dimensionality, which theoretically allows an unlimited number of arms. Moreover, by extending the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to more than two states, we theoretically establish an experimental configuration able to generate multi-photon states with orbital angular momentum and conditions that provide conflict-free selections at every turn. We numerically examine total rewards regarding three-armed bandit problems, for which the proposed strategy accomplishes almost the theoretical maximum, which is greater than a conventional mixed strategy intending to realize Nash equilibrium. This is thanks to the quantum interference effect that achieves no-conflict selections, even in the exploring phase to find the best arms.",

The optical properties of ECM-excited SPs are the same as those of SPs that are excited by electron straight motion (ESM). For operating at the flat band of SPs' dispersion curve on the Ge film, changing the electron energy will only change the wavevector of SPs and hence the number of periods of SPs on the circular orbital. When the periodic gratings are deposited on the Ge film along the circular orbital of electrons, the emitted SPE contains the orbital angular momentum (OAM). The number of arms and chirality of the spiral patterns in phase map (i.e. the quantum number of OAM) of SPE are determined by the difference between the number of SPs' periods and the number of gratings. Manipulations of the quantum number of OAM by changing the number of gratings for a fixed electron energy and by changing the electron energy for a fixed number of gratings are also demonstrated.

The dissociation of halide from an 18-electron half-sandwich complex (that is, with a single cyclopentadienyl ligand) of the type [CpRu(P-P')Hal] leaves an unsaturated 16-electron intermediate [CpRu(P-P')](+), which is then ready for subsequent addition reactions. Does the intermediate maintain its structure with a vacant site in place of the dissociated ligand, or does it rearrange, either concurrent with its formation or subsequently? In other words, are the 16-electron species planar or pyramidal? The outcome is relevant for chiral-at-metal compounds [CpML(1)L(2)L(3)] because an intermediate [CpML(1)L(2)] retains its chirality with respect to the metal atom as long as it is pyramidal, whereas it loses its chiral information if it becomes planar. In this Account, we address experimental results and theoretical calculations that help illuminate the energetics of structural rearrangements after halide dissociation. The rate-determining step in the halide exchange and racemization reactions of (R(Ru))- and (S(Ru))-[CpRu(P-P')Cl] is the cleavage of the Ru-Cl bond to give pyramidal intermediates (R(Ru))- and (S(Ru))-[CpRu(P-P')](+), which have kept the original metal configurations. These unsaturated intermediates can react with added ligands, such as Br(-) or I(-) (k(2) paths). The substitution products form with retention of the metal configuration. However, the pyramidal intermediates (R(Ru))- and (S(Ru))-[CpRu(P-P')](+) can also invert to their mirror images (k(3) paths). For (R(Ru))- and (S(Ru))-[CpRu(P-P')](+), the barrier of the pyramidal inversion (k(3)) is much higher than that of the halide addition (k(2)). The competition ratio k(3)/k(2) determines how much racemization occurs in a ligand exchange reaction. The competition ratio k(3)/k(2) can be determined from the ratio of the (R(Ru))- and (S(Ru))-products, which is constant throughout the course of the reaction. For compounds like [CpRu(P-P')Hal], k(3)/k(2) is much smaller than 1, resulting in an energy profile that resembles a basilica. These results, established with chiral-at-metal compounds, are supported by calculations that show that 16-electron half-sandwich intermediates with sigma-donating ligands, such as [CpM(NH(3))(2)], adopt planar structures, whereas strongly pi-bonding ligands, as in [CpM(CO)(2)], lead to pyramidal intermediates. The computed activation energies for the pyramidal inversion are on the order of 10 kcal/mol, with the planar species being transition states. The ligand dissociation behavior of 18-electron transition metal complexes is compared with nucleophile dissociation in main group compounds with octet configurations; here we include new computational results. Without exception, unsaturated main group intermediates, such as the carbenium ions formed in S(N)1 reactions, are planar. Our results and analysis help put transition metal chemistry on a firmer mechanistic foundation, and chiral-at-metal compounds are invaluable to this end.",

The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one.

These complexes exhibit the spin states ranging from an essentially pure high-spin (S = 5/2) to an essentially pure intermediate-spin (S = 3/2) state depending on the field strength of the axial ligands and the structure of the porphyrin rings. Reed and Guiset reported that the pyrrole-H chemical shift is a good probe to determine the spin state in the spin admixed S = 5/2,3/2 complexes (Reed, C. A.; Guiset, F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 3281-3282). In this paper, we report that the chemical shifts of the alpha- and beta-pyrrole carbons can also be good probes to determine the spin state because they have shown good correlation with those of the pyrrole-H or pyrrole-C(alpha). By putting the observed or assumed pyrrole-H or pyrrole-C(alpha) chemical shifts of the pure high-spin and pure intermediate-spin complexes into the correlation equations, we have estimated the carbon chemical shits of the corresponding complexes. The orbital interactions between iron(III) and porphyrin have been examined on the basis of these chemical shifts, from which we have found that both the d(xy)-a(2u) interaction in the ruffled Fe(T(i)PrP)L2+ and d(xy)-a(1u) interaction in the saddled Fe(OETPP)L2+ are quite weak in the high-spin and probably in the intermediate-spin complexes as well. Close inspection of the correlation lines has suggested that the electron configuration of an essentially pure intermediate-spin Fe(T(i)PrP)L2+ changes from (d(xy), d(yz))3(d(xy))1(d(z)2)1 to (d(xy))2(d(xz), d(yz))2(d(z)2)1 as the axial ligand (L) changes from DMF to MeOH, THF, 2-MeTHF, and then to dioxane. Although the DFT calculation has indicated that the highly saddled intermediate-spin Fe(OETPP)(THF)2+ should adopt (d(xy), d(yz))3(d(xy))1(d(z)2)1 rather than (d(xy))2(d(xz), d(yz))2(d(z)2)1 because of the strong d(xy)-a(1u) interaction (Cheng, R.-J.; Wang, Y.-K.; Chen, P.-Y.; Han, Y.-P.; Chang, C.-C. Chem. Commun. 2005, 1312-1314), our 13C NMR study again suggests that Fe(OETPP)(THF)2+ should be represented as (d(xy))2(d(xz), d(yz))2(d(z)2)1 because of the weak d(xy)-a(1u) interaction. The contribution of the S = 3/2 state in all types of the spin admixed S = 5/2,3/2 six-coordinate complexes has been determined on the basis of the (13)C NMR chemical shifts.",

These complexes have been shown to exist as an equilibrium mixture of two populations, one exhibiting an S = (1)/(2), (d(xy))(2)(d(xz), d(yz))(3) electron configuration and planar heme and a second with a novel S = (3)/(2), (d(xz), d(yz))(3)(d(xy))(1)(d(z)(2))(1) spin state and nonplanar heme. At physiologically relevant temperatures, the equilibrium shifts in the direction of the population exhibiting the latter electron configuration and nonplanar heme, whereas at temperatures approaching the freezing point of water, the equilibrium shifts in the direction of the population with the former electronic structure and planar heme. These findings indicate that the microenvironment of the distal pocket in heme oxygenase is unique among heme-containing proteins in that it lowers the sigma-donating (field strength) ability of the distal ligand and, therefore, promotes the attainment of heme electronic structures thus far only observed in heme oxygenase. When the field strength of the distal ligand is slightly lower than that of azide, such as OH(-) (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 11842), the corresponding complex exists as a mixture of populations with nonplanar hemes and electronic structures that place significant spin density at the meso positions. The ease with which these unusual heme electronic structures are attained by heme oxygenase is likely related to activation of meso carbon reactivity which, in turn, facilitates hydroxylation of a meso carbon by the obligatory ferric hydroperoxide intermediate.",

There are three chiral carbons in 1, so eight optically active isomers are possible. Respective reaction of optically active 3-methyl-N-phenyl-4 -piperidinamines (5a-d) with (R)- or (S)-styrene oxide produced eight optically active intermediates which were subsequently converted to eight optically active isomers of 1 (1a-h). The absolute configurations of 1a-h were determined by X-ray analysis of (3R,4S,2'R)-(-)-cis-1a and (3R,4R,2'S)-(-)-trans-1g. The analgesic activity (mice, ip, hot plate) revealed their extreme stereodifferences; the ED50 values of (3R,4S,2'R)-(-)-cis-1a and (3R,4S,2'S)-(+)-cis-1b, which are the most potent isomers among eight isomers, were 0.004 65 (2990 times that of morphine) and 0.001 06 mg/kg (13 100 times that of morphine), respectively, while the corresponding antipodes 1d,c were the least potent compounds among the eight isomers. In agreement with pharmacological results, both 1a,b also had the highest receptor affinity and selectivity for the opioid mu receptor. The ratio of K(i)(DPDPE)&amp;K(i)(DAMGO) was 22 800 for 1a and 22 500 for 1b. All isomers except 1c,d strongly inhibited the electrically evoked smooth muscle contraction of GPI and MVD but not that of RVD, and the inhibitory effects could be reversed by naloxone, which indicated that these compounds were potent mu agonists in GPI and MVD. There was a good linear correlation between the analgesic potencies (ED50) and the receptor affinities (K(i)(DAMGO)) or inhibitory effects (IC50) to GPI and MVD. These results suggested that the analgesic effects of ohmefentanyl are mediated by interaction between the agents and opioid mu receptors in the central nervous system and the 3R,4S configuration at the piperidine 3- and 4-carbon atoms and the S configuration at the phenylethyl 2-carbon atom are beneficial for analgesic potency and inhibitory effects in GPI and MVD and the same for an S or R configuration at the phenylethyl 2-carbon atom besides the 3R,4S configuration for receptor mu affinity and selectivity.",

Because the covalent bond was found to be broken and replaced by 2-pyridinaldoxime methiodide (2PAM), we employed a peptidyl derivative bearing diphenyl 1-amino-2-phenylethylphosphonate moiety (Phe(p) (OPh)2 ) to target the active site of chymotrypsin and to selectively anchor to Lys175 in the vicinity of the active site. Previously, it was reported that the configuration of the α-carbon of phosphorus in diphenyl (α-aminoalkyl)phosphonates affects the inactivation reaction of serine proteases, i.e., the (R)-enantiomeric diphenyl phosphonate is comparable to l-amino acids and it effectively reacts with serine proteases, whereas the (S)-enantiomeric form does not. In this study, we evaluated the stereochemical effect of the phosphonate moiety on the selective chemical modification. Epimeric dipeptidyl derivatives, Ala-(R or S)-Phe(p) (OPh)2 , were prepared by separation with RP-HPLC. A tripeptidyl (R)-epimer (Ala-Ala-(R)-Phe(p) (OPh)2 ) exhibited a more potent inactivation ability against chymotrypsin than the (S)-epimer. The enzyme inactivated by the (R)-epimer was more effectively reactivated with 2PAM than the enzyme inactivated by the (S)-epimer. Finally, N-succinimidyl (NHS) active ester derivatives, NHS-Suc-Ala-Ala- (R or S)-Phe(p) (OPh)2 , were prepared, and we evaluated their action when modifying Lys175 in chymotrypsin. We demonstrated that the epimeric NHS derivative that possessed the diphenyl phosphonate moiety with the (R)-configuration effectively modified Lys175 in chymotrypsin, whereas that with the (S)-configuration did not.

The strong attractive electron-electron interaction (U(eff) = -0.44 eV ∼ -5000 K) originates from the purely electronic mechanism. The closed shell of the d(10) electronic configuration is more stable than the d(9) electronic configuration, since the first excited state with the d(9)s(1) electronic configuration and the ground state with the d(10) electronic configuration are very close, then these two states repel very strongly through the second order perturbation.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the presence of a noninnocent macrocycle (corrolate (2-*)) for the chloroiron corrolate, with strong antiferromagnetic coupling to the S = 3/2 Fe(III) center, while those for the phenyliron corrolate are not conclusive as to the electron configuration. Temperature- and field-dependent Mössbauer spectroscopic investigations of these two complexes yielded spectra that could be simulated with either electron configuration, except that the isomer shift of the phenyl-iron complex is -0.10 mm/s while that of the chloroiron complex is +0.21 mm/s, suggesting that the iron in the former is Fe(IV) while in the latter it is Fe(III). 1H NMR spectroscopic studies of both axial ligand complexes show large negative spin density at the meso carbons, with those of the chloroiron complex (Cai, S.; Walker, F. A.; Licoccia, S. Inorg. Chem. 2000, 39, 3466) being roughly four times larger than those of the phenyliron complex. The temperature dependence of the proton chemical shifts of the phenyliron complex is strictly linear. DFT calculations are consistent with the chloroiron complex being formulated as S1 = 3/2 Fe(III)-corrolate (2-*) S2 = 1/2, with negative spin density at all nitrogens and meso carbons, and a net spin density of -0.79 on the corrolate ring and positive spin density (+0.17) on the chloride ion and +2.58 on the iron. In contrast, the phenyliron complex is best formulated as S = 1 Fe(IV)-corrolate (3-), but again with negative spin density at all nitrogens and meso carbons of the macrocycle, yet with the net spin density on the corrolate ring being virtually zero; the phenyl carbanion carbon has relatively large negative spin density of -0.15 and the iron +2.05.

The calculated vertical excitation energies lie within 0.1 eV of the observed values. Many more singlet and weaker triplet excitations are predicted. Although most excited states have small oscillator strengths, that of 3(1)B(2) is very large. Vertical excitation energies were also calculated at the 1(1)A' ground state geometry of the BrBrO isomer. Using DFT/B3LYP and CCSD(T) (CC) methods with the 6-311+G(3df) basis set, geometries were optimized for about 12 excited singlet and triplet states of BrOBr in C(2v) symmetry. Frequency analysis showed that many states, including 1(1)B(1), 1(1)B(2), 1(3)B(1), and 1(3)B(2), are not stable. C(s) structures corresponding to 1(1)B(1), 1(3)B(1), and 1(3)B(2) were optimized.

In contrast to the halide-ligated complexes, the ClO4(-) complex shows a quite pure intermediate-spin state. The 13C NMR spectra of [Fe(TEtPrP)ClO4] are characterized by the downfield and upfield shifts of the meso and pyrrole-alpha carbon signals, respectively: delta(meso) = +342 and delta(alpha-py) = -287 ppm at 298 K. The data indicate that the meso carbon atoms of [Fe(TEtPrP)ClO4] have considerable amounts of positive spin, which in turn indicate that the iron has an unpaired electron in the d(xy) orbital; the unpaired electron in the d(xy) orbital is delocalized to the meso positions due to the iron(d(xy))-porphyrin(a(2u)) interaction. Similar results have been obtained in analogous [Fe(TiPrP)X] though the intermediate-spin character of [Fe(TiPrP)X] is much larger than that of the corresponding [Fe(TEtPrP)X].

Conformational differences between the stereoisomers were found to be restricted to the different orientation of the C3'-O3'-P bond. The NMR data reflected the preferred epsilon(-) conformation for the S(p) isomers, while in the R(p) isomers the conformational equilibrium was shifted toward the epsilon(t) domain.

This intermediate molecule, diabatically correlated with the Ga((2)S:4s(2)5s(1))+SiH(4) fragments, which lies 1.5 kcal/mol above the ground state reactants leads to the GaH+SiH(3) or H+GaSiH(3) products through the dissociation channels.

In many cases, alkyllithium compounds are key intermediates for the generation of these stereogenic substances. In recent years, the lithiated carbon atom in silicon-substituted benzyllithium compounds has become a focus of interest because it is possible to maintain its stereogenic information. Starting from a highly enantiomerically enriched benzylsilane, (R,S)-2 x quinuclidine could be obtained, and the absolute configuration at the metalated carbon atom was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. In solution, a quartet was found in the (13)C NMR spectrum for the metalated carbon atom because of coupling between carbon and lithium, indicating a fixed lithium carbon contact at room temperature. After reaction of (R,S)-2 x quinuclidine with trimethylchlorostannane, the trapped product (S,S)-4 was obtained with a dr &gt; or = 98:2 with inversion of the configuration at the metalated carbon. Multipole refinement against high-resolution diffraction data and subsequent topological analysis of the benchmark system (R,S)-2 x quinuclidine provide insight in the electronic situation and thus the observed stereochemical course of the transformations. Surprisingly, the negative charge generated at the carbanion hardly couples into the phenyl ring. The neighboring silicon atom counterbalances this charge by a pronounced positive charge. Therefore, the alpha-effect of the silicon atom is caused not just by a polarization of the electron density but also by an electrostatic bond reinforcement. Furthermore, the experimentally determined electrostatic potential unequivocally explains the observed back side attack of an electrophile under inversion of the stereogenic center with high diastereomeric ratios.",

We propose that the highly organized network of water molecules in the distal pocket of heme oxygenase, by virtue of donating a hydrogen bond to the coordinated hydroxide ligand, lowers its ligand field strength, thereby increasing the field strength of the porphyrin (equatorial) ligand, which results in nonplanar deformations of the macrocycle. This tendency to deform from planarity, which is imparted by the ligand field strength of the coordinated OH(-), is likely reinforced by the flexibility of the distal pocket in HO. These findings suggest that if the ligand field strength of the coordinated OOH(-) in heme oxygenase is modulated in a similar manner, the resultant large spin density at the meso carbons and nonplanar deformations of the pophyrin ring prime the macrocycle to actively participate in its own hydroxylation.",

A number of EPR-detectable intermediates are associated with this critical state. The preceding paper examined mainly the decay of S(3) at cryogenic temperatures leading to the formation of a proton-deficient configuration of S(2) termed S(2)'. This second paper examines all intermediates formed by the near-IR light (NIR) excitation of the S(3) state and compares these with the light-excitation products of the S(2)' state. The rather complex set of observations is organized in a comprehensive flowchart, the central part of which is the S(3)...Q(A)(-) state. This state can be converted to various intermediates via two main pathways: (A) Excitation of S(3) by NIR light at temperatures below 77 K results presumably in the formation of an excited S(3) state, S(3), which decays via either of two pathways. Slowly at liquid helium temperatures but much faster at 77 K, S(3) decays to an EPR-silent state, denoted S(3)' ', which by raising the temperature to ca. 190 K converts to a spin configuration of the Mn cluster, characterized by g = 21, 3.7 in perpendicular and g = 23 in parallel mode EPR, denoted S(3)'. Upon further warming to 220 K, S(3)' relaxes to the untreated S(3) state. Below about 77 K and more favorably at liquid helium temperatures, an alternative pathway of S(3) decay via the metallo-radical intermediate S(2)'Z*...Q(A)(-) can be traced. This leads to the metastable state S(2)'Z...Q(A) via charge recombination. S(2)'Z* is characterized by a split-radical signal at g = 2, while all S(2)' transients are characterized by the same g = 5/2.9 (S = (7)/(2)) configuration of the Mn cluster with small modifications, reflecting an influence of the tyr Z oxidation state on the crystal-field symmetry at the Mn cluster. (B) S(2)'...Q(A) can be reached alternatively by the slow charge recombination of S(3) and Q(A)(-) at 77 K. White-light illumination of S(2)'.Q(A) below about 20 K results in charge separation, reforming the intermediate S(2)'Z*...Q(A)(-). Thermally activated branches to the main pathways are also described, e.g., at elevated temperatures tyr Z* reoxidizes S(2)' to the S(3) state. The above observations are discussed in terms of a molecular model of the S(3) state of the OEC. Main aspects of the model are the following. Intermediates, isoelectronic to S(3), are attributed to the NIR-induced translocation of the positive hole to different Mn ligands, or to tyr Z. On the basis of a comparison of the electron-donating efficiency of tyr Z and tyr D at cryogenic temperatures, it is inferred that the Mn cluster acts as the main proton acceptor from tyr Z. Water associated with the Mn cluster is assumed to be in hydrogen-bonding equilibrium with tyr Z, and an array comprising this water and adjacent water (or OH or O) ligands to Mn followed by a sequence of proton acceptors is proposed to act as an efficient proton translocation pathway. Oxidation of the tyrosine by P(680)(+) repels protons to and out from the Mn cluster. This proposed role of tyr Z in the water-splitting process is described as a proton repeller/electron abstractor.",

This result would seem to rule out a radical mechanism for the hydroxylation chemistry, at least as mediated by this enzyme. The interpretation of subsequent experiments on n-propane, n-butane, and n-pentane has been complicated by hydroxylation at both the pro-R and pro-S secondary C-H bonds, where the hydroxylation takes place. It has been suggested that these results merely reflect presentation of both the pro-R and pro-S C-H bonds to the hot \"oxygen atom\" species generated at the active site, and that the oxo-transfer chemistry, in fact, proceeds concertedly with retention of configuration. In the present work, we have augmented these earlier studies with experiments on [2,2-2H2]butane and designed d,l form chiral dideuteriobutanes. Essentially equal amounts of (2R)-[3,3-2H2]butan-2-ol and (2R)-[2-2H1]butan-2-ol are produced upon hydroxylation of [2,2-2H2]butane. The chemistry is stereospecific with full retention of configuration at the secondary carbon oxidized. In the case of the various chiral deuterated butanes, the extent of configurational inversion has been shown to be negligible for all the chiral butanes examined. Thus, the hydroxylation of butane takes place with full retention of configuration in butane as well as in the case of ethane. These results are interpreted in terms of an oxo-transfer mechanism based on side-on singlet oxene insertion across the C-H bond similar to that previously noted for singlet carbene insertion (Kirmse, W., and Ozkir, I. S. (1992) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114, 7590-7591). Finally, we discuss how even the oxene insertion mechanism, with \"spin crossover\" in the transition state, could lead to small amounts of radical rearrangement products, if and when such products are observed. A scheme is described that unifies the two extreme mechanistic limits, namely the concerted oxene insertion and the hydrogen abstraction radical rebound mechanism within the same over-arching framework.",

The reactions occur as single-stage conversions from the substrate to the product. There is no evidence by UV and by low-temperature (1)H and (31)P NMR spectroscopy for the presence of significant amounts of Pt(II) or Pt(IV) intermediate species. Reactions are first order with respect to complex and proton concentrations and are strongly retarded by steric congestion at the Pt-C bond, varying from k(2) = (2.65 +/- 0.08) x 10(5) M(-)(1) s(-)(1) for R = R' = Et to k(2) = 9.80 +/- 0.44 M(-)(1)s(-)(1) for R = R'= CH(2)Si(Me)(3). Low enthalpies of activation and largely negative volumes of activation are associated with the process. The mechanism involves a rate-determining proton transfer either to the metal-carbon sigma bond (S(E)2 mechanism) or to the metal center (S(E)(oxidative) mechanism), followed by fast extrusion of the alkane and simultaneous blocking of the vacant coordination site by the solvent to generate cis-[Pt(R)(PEt(3))(2)(MeOH)](+) species. The subsequent slower process, cis to trans isomerization of cis-[Pt(R)(PEt(3))(2)(MeOH)](+), is characterized by high values of enthalpies of activation, positive entropies of activation, and largely positive volumes of activation. The reaction is shown to proceed through the dissociative loss of the weakly bonded molecule of solvent and the interconversion of two geometrically distinct T-shaped 14-electron 3-coordinate intermediates. The presence of beta-hydrogens on the residual alkyl chain produces a great acceleration of the rate (R = Me, k(i) = 0.0026 s(-)(1); R = Et, k(i) = 44.9 s(-)(1)) as a consequence of the stabilization of the 3-coordinate [Pt(R)(PEt(3))(2)](+) transition state through an incipient agostic interaction. The results of this work, together with those of a previous paper, give a rationale of the \"elusive\" nature of these compounds. The following factors concur: (i) electron release by the phosphine ligands, (ii) steric repulsion and distortion of the square-planar configuration, and (iii) interaction of the metal with beta-hydrogens.",

Pathways to the formation of the S = 7/2 S(2) state configuration.\nThe water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II cycles through five oxidation states, denoted S(i)() (i = 0-4), during water oxidation to molecular oxygen, which appears at the (transient) S(4) state. The recent detection of bimodal EPR signals from the S(3) state [Matsukawa, T., Mino, H., Yoneda, D., Kawamori, A. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 4072-4077] has drawn significant attention to this critical state. An interesting property of the S(3) state is the sensitivity to near-IR (NIR) light excitation. Excitation of the S(3) state by near-IR light at cryogenic temperatures induces among other signals a derivative-shaped EPR signal at g= 5 [Ioannidis, N., and Petrouleas, V. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 5246-5254]. The signal bears unexpected similarities to a signal observed earlier in samples that had undergone multiple turnovers and subsequently had been stored at 77 K for a week or longer [Nugent, J. H. A., Turconi, S., and Evans, M. C. W. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 7086-7096]. Recently, both signals were assigned to an S = 7/2 configuration of the Mn cluster [Sanakis, Y., Ioannidis, N., Sioros, G., and Petrouleas, V. (2001) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123, 10766-10767]. In the present study, we employ bimodal EPR spectroscopy to investigate the pathways of formation of this unusual state. The following observations are made: (i) The g = 5 signal evolves in apparent correlation with the diminution of the S(3) state signals during the slow (tens of hours to several days range) charge recombination of S(3) with Q(A)(-) at 77 K. The tyrosyl radical D* competes with S(3) for recombination with Q(A)(-), the functional redox couple at cryogenic temperatures inferred to be D*/D(-). Transfer to -50 degrees C and above results in the relaxation of the g = 5 to the multiline and g = 4.1 signals of the normal S(2) state. (ii) The transition of S(3) to the state responsible for the g = 5 signal can be reversed by visible light illumination directly at -30 degrees C or by illumination at 4.2 K followed by brief (2 min) transfer to -50 degrees C in the dark. The latter step is required in order to overcome an apparent thermal activation barrier (charge recombination appears to be faster than forward electron transfer at 4.2 K). (iii) The \"g = 5\" state can be reached in a few tens of minutes at 4.2 K by near-IR light excitation of the S(3) state. This effect is attributed to the transfer of the positive hole from the Mn cluster to a radical (probably tyr Z), which recombines much faster than the Mn cluster with Q(A)(-). (iv) The above properties strongly support the assignment of the configuration responsible for the g = 5 signal to a modified S(2) state, denoted S(2)'. Evidence supporting the assignment of the S(2)' to a proton-deficient S(2) configuration is provided by the observation that the spectrum of S(2) at pH 8.1 (obtained by illumination of the S(1) state at -30 degrees C) contains a g = 5 contribution.",

The present work addresses the following questions that could not be answered in the initial report: How many P(4)S(3) cages can be bound to a Ag(+) ion? Why are these complexes completely dynamic in solution in the (31)P NMR experiments? Can these dynamics be frozen out in a low-temperature (31)P MAS NMR experiment? What are the principal binding sites of the P(4)S(3) cage towards the Ag(+) ion? What are likely other isomers on the [Ag(P(4)S(3))(n)](+) potential energy surface? Counterion influence: Reactions of P(4)S(3) with Ag[Al{OC(CH(3))(CF(3))(2)}(4)] (Ag[hftb]) and Ag[{(CF(3))(3)CO}(3)Al-F-Al{OC(CF(3))(3))}(3)] (Ag[al-f-al]) gave [(P(4)S(3))Ag[hftb]](infinity) (7) as a molecular species, whereas [Ag(2)(P(4)S(3))(6)](2+)[al-f-al](-) (2) (8) is an isolated 2:1 salt. We suggest that a maximum of three P(4)S(3) cages may be bound on average to an Ag(+) ion. Only isolated dimeric dications are formed with the largest cation, but polymeric species are obtained with all other smaller aluminates. Thermodynamic Born-Haber cycles, DFT calculations, as well as solution NMR and ESI mass spectrometry indicate that 8 exhibits an equilibrium between the dication [Ag(2)(P(4)S(3))(6)](2+) (in the solid state) and two [Ag(P(4)S(3))(3)](+) monocations (in the gas phase and in solution). Dynamics: (31)P MAS NMR spectroscopy showed these solid adducts to be highly dynamic, to an extent that the (2)J(P,P) coupling within the cages could be resolved (J-res experiment). This is supported by DFT calculations, which show that the extended PES of [Ag(P(4)S(3))(n)](+) (n=1-3) and [Ag(2)(P(4)S(3))(2)](+) is very flat. The structures of alpha- and gamma-P(4)S(3) were redetermined.

In uracil, a three-state degeneracy between the S(0), S(1), and S(2) states has been located at 6.2 eV above the ground-state minimum energy.

Using ab initio G3 theory, the infinite cumulenic chain (:C[double bond]C[double bond]C[double bond]C:) is found to be 1.9+/-0.4 kcal/mol per carbon less stable in free energy at room temperature than the acetylenic chain (.C[triple bond]C-C[triple bond]C.) which is 24.0 kcal/mol less stable than graphite. The difference between carbon-carbon triple, double, and single bond lengths (1.257, 1.279, and 1.333 A, respectively) in infinite chains is evident but much less than with small hydrocarbon molecules.

In bulk studies, due to limited ways to control applied force, they are thought to be mechanically inert and not to contribute to the extensibility of polymers. Here, we report a single molecule force spectroscopy study on a polymer containing C═C bonds using atomic force microscope. Surprisingly, we found that it is possible to directly observe the cis-to-trans isomerization of C═C bonds at the time scale of ∼1 ms at room temperature by applying a tensile force ∼1.7 nN. The reaction proceeds through a diradical intermediate state, as confirmed by both a free radical quenching experiment and quantum chemical modeling. The force-free activation length to convert the cis C═C bonds to the transition state is ∼0.5 Å, indicating that the reaction rate is accelerated by ∼10<sup9</sup times at the transition force. On the basis of the density functional theory optimized structure, we propose that because the pulling direction is not parallel to C═C double bonds in the polymer, stretching the polymer not only provides tension to lower the transition barrier but also provides torsion to facilitate the rotation of cis C═C bonds. This explains the apparently low transition force for such thermally \"forbidden\" reactions and offers an additional explanation of the \"lever-arm effect\" of polymer backbones on the activation force for many mechanophores. This work demonstrates the importance of precisely controlling the force direction at the nanoscale to the force-activated reactions and may have many implications on the design of stress-responsive materials.",

The stretching force constants were used to derive a relative bond strength order (RBSO) parameter n. As alternative bond strength descriptors, bond dissociation energies (BDE) were calculated at the G3 level or at the two-component NESC (normalized elimination of the small component)/CCSD(T) level of theory for molecules with X = Br, I or E = Se, Te. RBSO values reveal that both bond lengths and BDE values are less useful when a quantification of the bond strength is needed. CX double bonds can be realized for Br- or I-substituted carbenium ions where as suitable reference the double bond of the corresponding formaldehyde homologue is used. A triple bond cannot be realized in this way as the diatomic CX(+) ions with a limited π-donor capacity for X are just double-bonded. The stability of halonium ions increases with the atomic number of X, which is reflected by a strengthening of the fractional (electron-deficient) CX bonds.

One of the methanol molecules is tagged, and its hydroxyl stretch is treated quantum-mechanically, while the remaining degrees of freedom are treated classically. The adiabatic Hamiltonian of the quantum-mechanical hydroxyl is diagonalized on-the-fly to obtain the corresponding adiabatic energy levels and wave functions which depend parametrically on the instantaneous configuration of the classical degrees of freedom. The dynamics of the classical degrees of freedom are in turn affected by the quantum-mechanical state of the tagged hydroxyl stretch via the corresponding Hellmann-Feynman forces. The ability of five different force-field combinations to reproduce the experimental absorption infrared spectrum of the hydroxyl stretch is examined for different isotopomers and on a wide range of compositions. It is found that, in addition to accounting for the anharmonic nature of the hydroxyl stretch, one also has to employ polarizable force fields and account for the damping of the polarizability at short distances. The equilibrium ground-state hydrogen-bonding structure and dynamics is analyzed, and its signature on the absorption infrared spectrum of the hydroxyl stretch is investigated in detail. Five different hydroxyl stretch subpopulations are identified and spectrally assigned: monomers (α), hydrogen-bond acceptors (β), hydrogen-bond donors (γ), simultaneous hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors (δ), and simultaneous hydrogen-bond donors and double-acceptors (ε). The fundamental transition frequencies of the α and β subpopulations are found to be narrowly distributed and to overlap, thereby giving rise to a single narrow band whose intensity is significantly diminished by rotational relaxation. The fundamental transition frequency distributions of the γ, δ, and ε subpopulations are found to be broader and to partially overlap, thereby giving rise to a single broad band which is red-shifted relative to the αβ band. The γδε band is also found to be inhomogeneously broadened and unaffected by rotational relaxation. The exchange rates between the different subpopulations and corresponding branching ratios are reported and explained. Finally, nonlinear mapping relations between the hydroxyl transition frequency and bond length and the electric field along the hydroxyl bond axis are established, which can be used to reduce the computational cost of the mixed quantum-classical treatment to that of a purely classical molecular dynamics simulation.",

The nature of the PES for stretched n-butane depends on the extent of stretching. If it is less than that required to reach the inflection points in the C[Single Bond]C stretch potentials and the C[Single Bond]C torsions are considered free rotors, there is only one potential energy minimum, with each bond elongated. However, for stretching past these inflection points, the PES has three minima and each has one bond longer than the other two, i.e., C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C, C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C, and C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C. There are three transition states (TSs) connecting these minima. A linear alkane, consisting of n carbon atoms and stretched past its C[Single Bond]C inflection points, has (n-1) minima and (n-1)(n-2)2 TSs connecting them. For stretching less than that required to reach the C[Single Bond]C inflection points, the only unimolecular pathways are dissociations to form the C+C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C, C[Single Bond]C+C[Single Bond]C, and C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C+C products. However, with stretching past the C[Single Bond]C inflection points, isomerizations between the three potential energy minima may also occur. The relative importance of isomerization versus dissociation depends on the relative size of their barriers. For slight stretching past the C[Single Bond]C inflection points, the isomerization barriers are much lower than those for dissociation and relaxation between the minima is much faster than dissociation. Thus, the molecule samples these minima randomly during its dissociation, with a density of states that comprises the complete PES. With extensive stretching past the inflection points, isomerizations between the potential energy minima do not occur and only dissociation for the excited minima occurs, e.g., C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C--&gt;C+C[Single Bond]C[Single Bond]C. For intermediate stretching past the C[Single Bond]C inflection points, the rates for the isomerization and dissociation pathways are competitive and both must be considered in modeling the dissociation kinetics. Microcanonical chemical dynamics simulations are performed to study the unimolecular kinetics of n-butane in three stretched configurations: Stretched less than the C[Single Bond]C inflection point; stretched slightly beyond the C[Single Bond]C inflection point; and stretched significantly beyond the C[Single Bond]C inflection point. The resulting unimolecular dynamics were found to be in excellent agreement with RRKM theory. Frequency nu factors, determined by fitting the trajectory unimolecular rate constants to the classical harmonic RRKM rate constant expression, depend upon the extent of stretching and vary from 1.0 x 10(12)-8.4 x 10(16) s(-1).

The length of the Ag-I bond, r(AgI), is 0.013 Å shorter than in free AgI. χ(aa)(I) is determined to be -769.84(22) MHz for OC···(107)AgI implying an ionic character of 0.66 for the metal halide bond. Attachment of carbon monoxide to the isolated AgI molecule results in an increase of the ionic character of AgI of 0.12. The molecular structure and spectroscopic parameters determined from the experimental data are presented alongside the results of calculations at the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster singles, doubles and perturbative triples level. Vibrational frequencies, the electric dipole moment, the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant, and the dissociation energy of the molecule have been calculated.",

The model is based on a coarse-grained graphene sheet, represented by a two-dimensional simply connected triangular mesh, with parameters for the surface curvature, bond stretching, carbon-carbon interaction, and carbon-catalyst interaction determined by classical molecular dynamics simulations using a bond-order potential derived from ab initio calculations. The mesoscale simulations show that the initial type of CNT growth is strongly influenced by the surface interaction energy between the graphene sheet and metal catalyst particle, rate of carbon deposition, and particle size. As expected, single wall tubes are produced from small catalyst particles at low deposition rates, but increasing the strength of carbon-catalyst interaction energy or carbon deposition rate results in double or even multiwall CNT structures, formed by folding or involution of the graphene sheet. For the range of model parameters investigated, all single wall CNTs with a diameter greater than 6.6 nm exhibited a kink-collapse transition once a certain critical tube length was reached.",

However those bonds near the end of the chain continue to be influenced by the end, even in the long-chain limit. We have determined optimized geometries for polyene oligomers with up to n=11 repeat units at the MP2/cc-pVTZ level. At this length the central-most bonds are almost converged to the long chain limit, for which we estimate R(C[Double Bond]C)=1.3652 A and R(C[Single Bond]C)=1.4238 A.

We find that a given bond is significantly influenced by conjugation paths through up to six neighboring conjugated double bonds. End effects can also be monitored by examining the energy increment per added monomer as the oligomer length is increased. This analysis also indicates that significant conjugation effects extend out through approximately six neighboring double bonds.

New complexes E-Cp*(PMe3)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFC2F5 and E-Cp*(CO)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFC6F5 have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies, and a comparison of metric parameters with previously reported analogues is reported. Experimental NMR and computational DFT (B3LYP/LACV3P**++) studies agree that for Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFRF complexes (RF = CF3, CF2CF3) the thermodynamic preference for the E or Z isomer depends on the steric requirements of ligand L; when L = CO the Z-isomer (F cis to Cp*) is preferred and for L = PMe3 the E-isomer is preferred. When reduction of the precursors is carried out in the dark the reaction is completely selective to produce E- or Z-isomers. Exposure of solutions of these compounds to ambient light results in slow conversion to a photostationary non-equilibrium mixture of E and Z isomers. In the dark, these E/Z mixtures convert thermally to their preferred E or Z equilibrium geometries in an even slower reaction. A study of the temperature dependent kinetics of this dark transformation allows ΔG(‡)298 for rotation about the Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFCF3 double bond to be experimentally determined as 25 kcal mol(-1); a DFT/B3LYP/LACV3P**++ calculation of this rotation barrier is in excellent agreement (27 kcal mol(-1)) with the experimental value. Reaction of HCl with toluene solutions of Cp*(L)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFRF (L = CO, PMe3) or Cp*(CO)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]C(CF3)2 at low temperature resulted in regiospecific addition of HCl across the metal carbon double bond, ultimately yielding Cp*(L)Ir(CHFRF)Cl and Cp*(CO)Ir[CH(CF3)2]Cl. Reaction of HCl with single E or Z diastereomers of Cp*(L)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFRF gives stereospecific cis-addition to give single diastereomers of Cp*Ir(L)(CHFRF)Cl; addition of HCl to several different E/Z ratios of Cp*(L)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFRF affords ratios of diastereomeric products Cp*(L)Ir(CHFRF)Cl identical to the original ratio of starting material isomers. The addition of HCl is therefore demonstrated to be unambiguously regio- and stereo-specific. The observed product regiochemistry of addition of HCl to Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CF2, Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFRF, and Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]C(CF3)2 ligands is the same and is not dependent on the ground state energy preference (singlet or triplet) for the free perfluorocarbene. DFT calculations on model HCl addition reactions indicate that this regiochemistry is strongly preferred thermodynamically, but predict that in H(δ+)-Cl(δ-) addition to Cp(PH3)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CF2, H(δ+) attack at Ir has a lower energy transition state, while for Cp(PH3)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFCF3 and Cp(PH3)Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]C(CF3)2, H(δ+) attack at C is the kinetically preferred pathway. The carbene carbon atoms in Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CFCF3 and Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]C(CF3)2 complexes are unambiguously basic towards HCl, while in the Ir[double bond, length as m-dash]CF2 analogues the carbene carbon is less basic than its Ir partner, and the eventual regiochemistry of HCl addition arises from thermodynamic control.

Elongated phenoxide C-O bonds associated with the formation of 3-fold hydrogen bonds were also observed in the X-ray structures of proton-transfer complexes (2X-O(-))(TEAH(+))s derived from 5'-X-substituted 5,5''-dimethyl-1,1':3',1''-terphenyl-2,2',2''-triols (2X-OHs, where X = NO(2), CN, COOCH(3), Cl, F, H, and CH(3)) and triethylamine (TEA).

This along with strong bathochromic shifts of N-H(···O(-)) and O-H(···O(-)) stretching vibrations in the IR spectra indicates that the elongated C-O bonds in (2X-O(-))(TEAH(+))s essentially have single-bond character. This is further confirmed by molecular orbital calculations on a model complex, showing that the negatively charged phenoxide oxygen atom is no longer conjugated to the central benzene ring, and the NICS values of the three benzene rings are virtually identical. However, C-O bond elongation in (2X-O(-))(TEAH(+))s was considerably influenced by a change in the hydrogen-bond geometry. This also suggests that hydrogen bonds significantly affect phenoxide C-O bond elongation.",

According to the results of experimental charge density studies and QTAIM analysis, the BN bond/contact shows good separation of the respective atomic basins and significant flexibility. The source function and NBO analyses indicate an evident involvement of the oxygen atoms in the creation of the B-N bonding.

The constrained energy scans reveal an E(d(B-N)) potential energy surface which depends strongly on the nature of the substituents at the nitrogen and aromatic carbon atoms. It appears that an appropriate substitution can produce either conformer. A dipole moment analysis provides a good insight into the reactivity properties of the compound in solution. The opening of the azaester cage is associated with a breaking of the B-N bond, thus decreasing the magnitude of the dipole moment. The existence of the open conformer is confirmed by multi-temperature NMR studies.

PhCO(+)-L dimers are produced by electron ionization of benzaldehyde in a supersonic plasma expansion. IR photodissociation (IRPD) spectra of PhCO(+)-L with L = Ar and H(2)O are analyzed in the C-O, C-H, and O-H stretch ranges (2000-3900 cm(-1)). The potential energy surface of the PhCO(+)-L dimers is characterized at the MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) level to locate the various minima and determine their energetic and vibrational properties. PhCO(+)-Ar prefers intermolecular π-bonding to the aromatic ring with a bond energy of D(0) = 6 kJ mol(-1). The weak interaction implies that the IRPD spectrum of PhCO(+)-Ar is very close to the IR spectrum of bare PhCO(+). The detection of the C-H and C-O stretch fundamentals provides valuable information about the C-O and C-H bond strengths in this prototypical aromatic acylium ion. Moreover, a variety of weak combination and overtone bands are assigned. The global minimum on the PhCO(+)-H(2)O potential has a planar charge-dipole configuration with D(0) = 41 kJ mol(-1) (with only the two H(2)O protons being out-of-plane), in which the lone pairs of H(2)O interact with the positive partial charges on the carbonyl carbon atom and the proton of the CH group in ortho position. The experimental IRPD spectra are in accord with the calculated global minima. The analysis of the charge distribution shows that the PhCO(+) cation is best represented as an oxocarbenium ion (Ph-C(+)[double bond, length as m-dash]O) with smaller contributions of the ketene structure (Ph(+)[double bond, length as m-dash]C[double bond, length as m-dash]O).

Here we apply the first-order 2-RDM method to the potential energy surfaces of the nitrogen and carbon dimers in polarized valence double-zeta basis sets for which benchmark full-configuration-interaction calculations exist. In a wave function formalism accurately stretching the triple bond of the nitrogen dimer requires at least six-particle excitations from the Hartree-Fock reference. Furthermore, cleaving the double bond of C2 should produce a \"non-Morse\"-like potential curve because the ground state near equilibrium (X 1sigma(g)+) has an avoided crossing with the second excited state (B' 1sigma(g)+) and a level crossing with the first excited state (B 1delta(g)). Because the 2-RDM method variationally optimizes the energy over correlated 2-RDMs on the two-electron space without parametrization of the many-electron wave function, it captures multireference correlations that are difficult to describe with approximate wave functions. The 2-RDM method yields for N2 a potential energy surface with features and spectroscopic constants that are more accurate than those from single-reference methods and similar in accuracy to multireference techniques, and it describes the non-Morse-like behavior of C2 which is not captured by single-reference methods.",

These spectra distinguish among isomeric unsaturated fatty acids and permit assignment of double-bond location. Informative fragment ions reflect cleavage of bonds remote from the charge site on the dilithiated carboxylate moiety. The spectra contain radical cations reflecting cleavage of bonds between the first and second and between the second and third carbon atoms in the fatty acid chain. These ions are followed by a closed-shell ion series with members separated by 14 m/z units that reflect cleavage of bonds between the third and fourth and then between subsequent adjacent pairs of carbon atoms. This ion series terminates at the member reflecting cleavage of the carbon-carbon single bond vinylic to the first carbon-carbon double bond. Ions reflecting cleavages of bonds distal to the double bond are rarely observed for monounsaturated fatty acids and are not abundant when they occur. For polyunsaturated fatty acids that contain double bonds separated by a single methylene group, ions reflecting cleavage of carbon-carbon single bonds between double bonds are abundant, but ions reflecting cleavages distal to the final double bond are not. Cleavages between double bonds observed in these spectra can be rationalized by a scheme involving a six-membered transition state and subsequent rearrangement of a bis-allylic hydrogen atom to yield a terminally unsaturated charge-carrying fragment and elimination of a neutral alkene.

The results demonstrate that the σ(iso)(r) values can be used not only to distinguish between aromatic and antiaromatic systems but also to characterize chemical bonds and investigate the extents to which these bonds are affected by the aromatic or antiaromatic nature of the molecule in which they reside. The strong bonding interactions within the benzene ring are highlighted by the fact that the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are wrapped up within a doughnut-shaped region of increased shielding, which is especially high along the carbon-carbon bonds, with protrusions marking the carbon-hydrogen bonds. The antiaromatic destabilization in square cyclobutadiene is seen as the consequence of the presence of a markedly deshielded dumbbell-shaped region in the center of the molecule, which disrupts the connections between the shielded regions outlining individual carbon-carbon bonds, decreases the shielding within these regions, and displaces them to off-bond locations outside the ring. The well-known deshielding of aromatic protons and increased shielding of antiaromatic protons are shown to be accompanied by analogous shielding differences along the whole lengths of the carbon-hydrogen bonds, as a result of which the carbon-hydrogen bonds should become slightly weaker in aromatic systems as opposed to the corresponding bonds in antiaromatic systems.",

It is demonstrated that bond dissociation energies (BDEs), bond lengths, vibrational stretching frequencies, and bond densities are not reliable descriptors of the bond strength. The latter is related to the intrinsic BDE, which corresponds to nonrelaxed dissociation products retaining the electronic structure and geometry they have in the molecule. It is shown that the harmonic stretching force constants k(a) of the localized internal coordinate vibrations (adiabatic vibrational modes) reflect trends in the intrinsic BDEs. The k(a) values of both CO and CF bonds are related to the bond lengths through a single exponential function. This observation is used to derive a common bond order n for 46 CO- and CF-containing molecules that reliably describes differences in bonding.

Such polyene defects occur in the form of conjugated aliphatic chains with different lengths and contents, and their sensitive and length-specific monitoring is important for the assessment of PVC degradation. Here, we report on the resonance-enhanced Raman signatures of polyene sequences of varying lengths in photo- and thermally degraded PVC films. The lengths of polyene segments have been estimated based on their selectively enhanced and spectrally resolved contributions to the Raman bands assigned to the stretching vibrations of conjugated double carbon bonds. Using deconvolution analysis of a characteristic Raman band of polyenes, we especially demonstrate that the spectral signatures of polyene segments corresponding to other various electronic resonances contribute to the Raman spectral envelope observed at a given resonant excitation. In most cases, we observe an asymmetric band profile, indicating an asymmetric length distribution of polyene defects formed in PVC films upon a mild degradation extent less than 1% mass loss. We also demonstrate that the wavenumber (ν<sub1</sub) of the stretching vibrations of single carbon bonds in the polyene sequences of degraded PVC is inversely related to the number (n) of double carbon bonds by an empirical equation n=476·cm<sup-1</sup/ν<sub1</sub-1082·cm<sup-1</sup. To the best of our knowledge, while considering different laser excitations spanning the range of possible electronic resonances from blue to near-infrared for Raman investigations, the present work includes (i) the first Raman spectral deconvolution study for the 532.0 nm excitation wavelength used in most portable Raman probes nowadays and (ii) the screening of polyene defects also beyond the red edge of the visible spectrum and the evidence of a resonance-enhanced polyene signal at 647.1 nm. Important new information has been obtained about polyene lengths and spectral distribution for PVC, whose critical physical properties ranging from flexibility to electrical resistance are severely affected by polyene formation.",

DFT calculations were carried out on oxophlorin 1, 5-hydroxyporphyrin 2, and two isomers of oxophlorin 3 and 4 (the proton added at the tetrahedral C(15) or the C(10) meso-carbon, respectively). The oxophlorin-hydroxyporphyrin structural changes are appropriately reflected by the significant changes of the meso carbon-oxygen bond lengths, which are in the limits of typical C=O and C-O distances. The rearrangement that creates the iso-oxophlorin macrocycle 3 (4) results in near tetrahedral geometry around the C(15) (C(10)) carbon atom, with the C(14)-C(15) and C(15)-C(16) (C(9)-C(10) and C(10)-C(11)) bond lengths corresponding to a single C-C bond. 5-Hydroxyporphyrin 2 is aromatic and has a bond pattern resembling that of regular porphyrin. In 1, 3, and 4, a localization of single and double bonds was seen, which agrees with the nonaromatic nature of oxophlorin, or isooxophlorin. The relative stability decreases in the order: 2 (0) &gt; 3 (4.85) &gt; 1 (5.11) &gt; 4 (10.04) &gt; 3-cis (12.89) (the number in parentheses is the relative energy, in kcal mol-1). The energy difference between the NH-cis and NH-trans tautomers, which is 8.04 kcal mol-1 for 3, results from a destabilizing NH-NH cis-interaction. DFT calculations were performed on the oxophlorin dianion radical (OP.)2- and a series of metallooxophlorin radicals ([(OP.)LiI]-, [(OP.)ZnII], [(OP.)GaIII]+, and (OP.)GaIIIF, in order to assess their electronic structures. Typically, the largest atomic spin density was found at the C(10) (C(20)) and C(15) meso positions, with the spin density at C(15) being twice as large as that at C(10). The spin density at the C(5) atom is negligible. A large spin density was found at the O(5) oxygen atom. The amount of spin density at the meso positions decreased as the cationic charge increased. When considering the absolute values of the spin densities, the opposite trend was observed at the pyrrolic carbon atoms. The spin density at the nucleus (Fermi contact terms) has also been analyzed. The spin distributions of iron oxophlorins determined by NMR were attributed to an oxophlorin radical electronic structure. The calculated spin density maps accounted for the essential NMR spectroscopic features of important intermediates in the heme degradation process--iron oxophlorin complexes.

Twelve diacyl PCs were chosen: eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from one double bond (C18:1/0, C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid (diC18:3), two with short saturated carbon chains (diC13:0, diC14:0), and two with long unsaturated carbon chains (diC20:4, diC22:1). Bending moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle surface area under very low tensions (0.001-0.5 mN/m), which is dominated by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under high tensions (&gt;0.5 mN/m), which involve an increase in area per molecule and a small-but important-contribution from smoothing of residual thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (&lt; +/-10%) with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243 mN/m. On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated chain PCs increased progressively with chain length from 0.56 x 10(-19) J for diC13:0 to 1.2 x 10(-19) J for diC22:1. However, quite unexpectedly for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to approximately 0.4 x 10(-19) J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain (C18:0/2, diC18:2, diC18:3, diC20:4). Given nearly constant area stretch moduli, the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis, peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses h(pp) of bilayers were obtained from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances h(pp) increased smoothly from diC13:0 to diC22:1 as expected. Moreover, the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio (k(c)/K(A))(1/2) = (h(pp) - h(o))/24, where h(o) approximately 1 nm accounts for separation of the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However, the elastic ratios and thicknesses for diC18:2, diC18:3, and diC20:4 fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.",

Classically, this effect has envisioned enzymatic compression of the axial Co-N bond in the ground state to cause upward folding of the corrin ring and subsequent sterically induced distortion of the Co-C bond leading to its destabilization. The models of this process show that in both methylcobalamin (CH3Cbl) and AdoCbl, compression of the axial Co-N bond does engender upward folding of the corrin ring, and that the extent of such upward folding is smaller in an analog in which the normal 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole axial ligand is replaced by the sterically smaller ligand, imidazole (CH3(lm)Cbl and Ado(lm)Cbl). Furthermore, in AdoCbl, this upward folding of the corrin is accompanied by increases in the carbon-cobalt bond length and in the Co-C-C bond angle (which are also less pronounced in Ado(Im)Cbl), and which indicate that the Co-C bond is indeed destabilized by this mechanism. However, these effects on the Co-C bond are small, and destabilization of this bond by this mechanism is unlikely to contribute more than ca. 3 kcal mol(-1) towards the enzymatic catalysis of Co-C bond homolysis, far short of the observed ca. 14 kcal mol(-1). A second version of mechanochemical triggering, in which compression of the axial Co-N bond in the transition state for Co-C bond homolysis stabilizes the transition state by increased Co-N orbital overlap, has also been investigated. Stretching the Co-C bond to simulate the approach to the transition state was found to result in an upward folding of the corrin ring, a slight decrease in the axial Co-N bond length, a slight displacement of the metal atom from the plane of the equatorial nitrogens towards the \"lower\" axial ligand, and a decrease in strain energy amounting to about 8 kcal mol(-1) for both AdoCbl and Ado(Im)Cbl. In such modeled transition states, compression of the axial Co-N bond to just below 2.0 A (the distance subsequently found to provide maximal stabilization of the transition state by increased orbital overlap) required about 4 kcal mol(-1) for AdoCbl, and about 2.5 kcal mol(-1) for Ado(Im)Cbl. ZINDO/1 calculations on slightly simplified structures showed that maximal electronic stabilization of the transition state by about 10 kcal mol(-1) occurred at an axial Co-N bond distance of 1.96 A for both AdoCbl and Ado(Im)Cbl. The net result is that this type of transition state mechanochemical triggering can provide 14 kcal mol(-1) of transition state stabilization for AdoCbl, and about 15.5 kcal mol(-1) for the Ado(Im)Cbl, enough to completely explain the observed enzymatic catalysis. These results are discussed in the light of current knowledge about class I AdoCbl-dependent enzymes, in which the coenzyme is bound in its \"base-off\" conformation, with the lower axial ligand position occupied by the imidazole moiety of an active site histidine residue, and the class II enzymes, in which AdoCbl binds to the enzyme in its \"base-on\" conformation, and the pendent 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole base remains coordinated to the metal during Co-C bond activation.",

Two variants of CP (α-CP and β-CP) were studied and two types of carbon and phosphorous vacancies (single and double) were considered. It was found that carbon monovacancies have the lowest formation energy, while phosphorous divacancies have the highest one in both CP allotropes. A strong mechanical anisotropy for CP was found with the Young's modulus and the failure stress along ZZ direction being an order of magnitude larger than those along AC direction. In both allotropes, the Young's modulus, failure stress and strain are considerably affected by vacancies, especially along AC direction. Fracture of pristine CP monolayer occurred via the rupture of phosphorous-phosphorous bonds when CP monolayer is stretched along AC direction, while via the rupture of carbon-phosphorous bonds when stretched along ZZ direction. Defective α-CP and β-CP monolayers both undergo a brittle-like failure initiated around the hosted vacancies at a lower critical strain. The failure strain and stress along the AC direction are affected only by phosphorous vacancies, while along the ZZ direction, they are almost equally affected by both phosphorous and carbon vacancies.

These species were created in an AC discharge of Cr(CO)6 and either methane or acetylene, diluted in argon. Spectra of the CrCCD were also recorded for the first time using deuterated acetylene as the carbon precursor. Seven rotational transitions of CrC were measured, each consisting of three widely spaced, fine structure components, arising from spin-spin and spin-rotation interactions. Eleven rotational transitions were recorded for CrCCH and five for CrCCD; each transition in these cases was composed of a distinct fine structure sextet. These measurements confirm the respective (3)Σ(-) and (6)Σ(+) ground electronic states of these radicals, as indicated from optical studies. The data were analyzed using a Hund's case (b) Hamiltonian, and rotational, spin-spin, and spin-rotation constants have been accurately determined for all three species.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36).

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

In considering the hydrophobicity of intramembranous protein (IMP) H-bonds which cross the phospholipid bilayer of plasma membranes, and the necessity for photonic recycling in cell surface interactions after dissipation of energetic states, present models lack structure and thermodynamic properties to maintain (DeltaE) sufficient energy sources necessary for amplifications by factors of 10(12). Even though one accepts that the ligand-receptor association alters the conformation of extracellular, extruding portions of IMP's at the cell surface, and that this change can be transmitted to the cytoplasm by the transmembranous helical segments by nonlinear vibrations of proteins with generation of soliton waves, one is still unable to account for repair and balanced function. Indeed, responses of critical molecules to certain magnetic field signals may include enhanced vibrational amplitudes, increased quanta of thermal energies and order inducing interactions. We may accept that microtrabecular reticulum-receptor is associated with actin filaments and ATP molecules which contribute to the activation of the cyclase enzyme system through piezoelectricity. Magnetic fields will pass through the membrane which sharply attenuates the electric field component of an EM field, due to its high impedance. Furthermore, EM oscillations are converted to mechanical vibrations; i.e., photon-phonon transduction, to induce molecular vibrations of frequencies specifically responsible for bioamplifications of weak triggers at the membrane surface, as well as GAP junctions. The hydrogen bonds of considerable importance are those in proteins (10(12)Hz) and DNA (10(11)Hz) and may be viewed as centers of EM radiation emission in the range from the mm microwaves to the far IR. However, classical electrodynamical theory does not yield a model for biomolecular resonant responses which are integrated over time and account for the connection between the phonon field and photons. Jacobson Resonance does supply an initial physical mechanism, as equivalencies in energy to that of Zeeman Resonance (i.e., zero-order magnetic resonance) and cyclotron resonance may be derived from the DeBroglie wave particle equation. For the first time, we view the introduction of Relativity Theory to biology in the expression, mc(2)=BvLq, where m is the mass of a particle in the 'box' or 'string' (molecule in a biosystem), c is the velocity of electromagnetic field in space, independent of its inertial frame of reference, B is the magnetic flux density,v is the velocity of the carrier or 'string' (a one or two dimensional 'box') in which the particle exists, L is its dimension (length) and q represents a unit charge q=1C, by defining electromotive force as energy per unit charge. Equivalencies suggest that qvBL is one of the fundamental expressions of energy of a charged wave-particle in magnetic fields, just as Zeeman and cyclotron resonance energy expressions, gbetaB and qhB/2pim, and is applicable to all charged particles (molecules in biological systems). There may exist spontaneous, independent and incessant interactions of magnetic vector B and particles in biosystems which exert Lorentz forces. Lorentz forces may be transmitted from EM field to gravitational field as a gravity wave which return to the phonon field as microgravitational fluctuations to therein produce quantum vibrational states that increase quanta of thermal energies integrated over time. This may account for the differential of 10(12) between photonic energy of ELF waves and the Boltzman energy kT. Recent data from in vivo controlled studies are included as empirical support for the various hypotheses presented.",

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05).

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician. In a cohort of 28 subjects with a history of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, we compared the PeriVib performance with two established threshold sensing systems: (1) a Biothesiometer device and (2) a tuning fork. We found that the sensation threshold estimated by PeriVib correlated well with the Biothesiometer ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.68) but less well with the tuning fork ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.15).

In 2003, several rule changes for the sport of pole vaulting were mandated, including enlarging the minimum dimensions of the landing pad. Our goals were to (1) identify the post-2003 rule change incidence and profile of catastrophic pole vaulting injuries through 2011 and compare them, where possible, with the prior incidence and profile and (2) determine, via a questionnaire, the frequency with which pole vaulters land in the vault box. We hypothesized that the new, larger landing pads would reduce the number of catastrophic injuries. Descriptive epidemiology study. We prospectively reviewed all catastrophic pole vaulting injuries (ie, brain hemorrhage; skull, spine, or pelvic fracture; substantial pulmonary or intra-abdominal injury) in the United States from 2003 through 2011, surveyed 3335 pole vaulters to determine the frequency of landing in the vault box, and compared results with those in the literature. From 2003 to 2011, 19 catastrophic injuries occurred (average of 2.1 per year), with the majority (n = 14, 74%, 1.55 per year) landing in or around the vault box. Four (21%, 0.44 per year) injuries occurred when an athlete landed off the sides or back of the landing pad and 1 (5%) when the pole broke. There were 11 (58%) major head injuries (1 fatality), 4 (21%) spine fractures (1 with paraplegia), 2 (11%) pelvic fractures (both with intra-abdominal injuries), 1 (5%) brain stem injury (fatal), and 1 (5%) thoracic injury (rib fractures and pneumothorax). The annual fatality rate fell from 1.0 in the prior study to 0.22 in the current study. According to the pole vaulters survey, during their careers, 77.12% (n = 2572) landed in the vault box 1 to 3 times, 15.92% (n = 531) never landed in the vault box, 6.12% (n = 204) landed in the vault box 4 to 6 times, and 0.84% (n = 28) landed in the vault box 7 or more times. The 2003 rule changes have markedly reduced the number of catastrophic injuries, especially fatalities, from pole vaulters missing the back or sides of the landing pads; however, the average annual rate of catastrophic injuries from pole vaulters landing in the vault box has more than tripled over the past decade and remains a major problem.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot).

However, dosimetric characteristics in small animal PET imaging are usually overlooked, though the radiation dose may not be negligible. In this work, we constructed 17 mouse models of different body mass and size based on the realistic four-dimensional MOBY mouse model. Particle (photons, electrons and positrons) transport using the Monte Carlo method was performed to calculate the absorbed fractions and S-values for eight positron-emitting radionuclides (C-11, N-13, O-15, F-18, Cu-64, Ga-68, Y-86 and I-124). Among these radionuclides, O-15 emits positrons with high energy and frequency and produces the highest self-absorbed S-values in each organ, while Y-86 emits γ-rays with high energy and frequency which results in the highest cross-absorbed S-values for non-neighbouring organs. Differences between S-values for self-irradiated organs were between 2% and 3%/g difference in body weight for most organs. For organs irradiating other organs outside the splanchnocoele (i.e. brain, testis and bladder), differences between S-values were lower than 1%/g. These appealing results can be used to assess variations in small animal dosimetry as a function of total-body mass. The generated database of S-values for various radionuclides can be used in the assessment of radiation dose to mice from different radiotracers in small animal PET experiments, thus offering quantitative figures for comparative dosimetry research in small animal models.",

However, the radiation dose from positron-emitting radionuclide to the pediatric population is a matter of concern since children are at a particularly high risk when exposed to ionizing radiation. The authors evaluate the absorbed fractions and specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) of monoenergy photons/electrons as well as S-values of 9 positron-emitting radionuclides (C-11, N-13, O-15, F-18, Cu-64, Ga-68, Rb-82, Y-86, and I-124) in 48 source regions for 10 anthropomorphic pediatric hybrid models, including the reference newborn, 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-yr-old male and female models, using the Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended general purpose Monte Carlo transport code. The self-absorbed SAFs and S-values for most organs were inversely related to the age and body weight, whereas the cross-dose terms presented less correlation with body weight. For most source/target organ pairs, Rb-82 and Y-86 produce the highest self-absorbed and cross-absorbed S-values, respectively, while Cu-64 produces the lowest S-values because of the low-energy and high-frequency of electron emissions. Most of the total self-absorbed S-values are contributed from nonpenetrating particles (electrons and positrons), which have a linear relationship with body weight. The dependence of self-absorbed S-values of the two annihilation photons varies to the reciprocal of 0.76 power of the mass, whereas the self-absorbed S-values of positrons vary according to the reciprocal mass. The produced S-values for common positron-emitting radionuclides can be exploited for the assessment of radiation dose delivered to the pediatric population from various PET radiotracers used in clinical and research settings. The mass scaling method for positron-emitters can be used to derive patient-specific S-values from data of reference phantoms.",

The apparatus employs one variant of cavity enhanced detection, specifically cavity attenuated phase shift spectroscopy, using a near-confocal arrangement of two high reflectivity (R approximately 0.9999) mirrors in tandem with an enclosed cell 26 cm in length, a light emitting diode (LED), and a vacuum photodiode detector. The square wave modulated light from the LED passes through the absorption cell and is detected as a distorted wave form which is characterized by a phase shift with respect to the initial modulation. The amount of that phase shift is a function of fixed instrument properties-cell length, mirror reflectivity, and modulation frequency-and of the presence of a scatterer or absorber (air, particles, trace gases, etc.) within the cell. The specific implementation reported here employs a blue LED; the wavelength and spectral bandpass of the measurement are defined by the use of an interference filter centered at 440 nm with a 20 nm wide bandpass. The monitor is enclosed within a standard 19 in. rack-mounted instrumentation box, weighs 10 kg, and uses 70 W of electrical power including a vacuum pump.

In the native strain, as in the heterologous host S. lividans, expression of xlnC was detectable in the presence of xylan but not in the presence of glucose. Induction by xylan was shown to take place at the transcriptional level. The transcriptional start site of xlnC was mapped and likely -35 (5'-TTGACA-3') and -10 (5'-GAGAAC-3') motifs were identified. In order to localise putative conserved regulatory sequences, the promoter regions of xylanase-encoding genes from various Streptomyces species were aligned. This alignment revealed the existence of three sets of quite well conserved palindromic AT rich sequences called boxes 1, 2 and 3. Box 3 (5'-CGAAA N TTTCG-3') is the farthest away from the promoter region (150-200 bp). A shorter version of this palindrome (5'-GAAA NN TTTC-3') or (5'-CGAAA-3') constitutes box 1, which is located just upstream of the putative -35 promoter sequence. Box 2, located 5-7 bp upstream of box 1, comprises a shorter palindrome than box 3, with inverted polarity [5'-(G/C)TTTC (N) GAAA(G/C)-3']. The putative regulatory role of the conserved inverted repeats in boxes 2 and 3 in the promoter region of the xlnC gene from Streptomyces sp. EC3, was assessed. These boxes were modified by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant promoter regions, as well as the wild-type promoter region, were separately fused to a beta-lactamase reporter gene. Analysis of the expression patterns of these fusions in cultures grown in the presence of glucose, xylan or both carbon sources demonstrated that these motifs were cis -acting negative regulatory elements, each playing a specific role in the regulation of xlnC expression. Box 3 was shown to be critical for the establishment of repression of xlnC expression by glucose, whereas box 2 was shown to play an important role in the induction of xlnC expression by xylan.",

(ref 19d) has been reinvestigated using combined ac and dc susceptibility measurements. The strong frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility and the slow relaxation of the magnetization show that 1 behaves as a single-molecule magnet with an S(T) = (9)/(2) spin ground state. Its relaxation time (tau) follows an Arrhenius law with tau(0) = 2.5 x 10(-)(7) s and Delta(eff)/k(B) = 14 K. Moreover, below 0.3 K, tau saturates around 470 s, indicating that quantum tunneling of the magnetization becomes the dominant process of relaxation.

Compound 2 has two types of bridges, a cyano bridge (-NC-) and a biphenolate bridge (-(O)(2)-), connecting Mn(III) and Fe(III) ions and the two Mn(III) ions, respectively. Both bridges mediate ferromagnetic interactions, as shown by modeling the magnetic susceptibility above 10 K with g(av) = 2.03, J(Mn)(-)(Fe)/k(B) = +6.5 K, and J'/k(B) = +0.07 K, where J' is the exchange coupling between the trimer units. The dc magnetic measurements of a single crystal using micro-SQUID and Hall-probe magnetometers revealed a uniaxial anisotropy (D(T)/k(B) = -0.94 K) with an easy axis lying along the chain direction. Frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility and time dependence of the dc magnetization have been performed to study the slow relaxation of the magnetization. A mean relaxation time has been found, and its temperature dependence has been studied. Above 1.4 K, both magnetic susceptibility and relaxation time are in agreement with the dynamics described in the 1960s by R. J. Glauber for one-dimensional systems with ferromagnetically coupled Ising spins (tau(0) = 3.7 x 10(-)(10) s and Delta(1)/k(B) = 31 K). As expected, at lower temperatures below 1.4 K, the relaxation process is dominated by the finite-size chain effects (tau'(0) = 3 x 10(-)(8) s and Delta(2)/k(B) = 25 K). The detailed analysis of this single-chain magnet behavior and its two regimes is consistent with magnetic parameters independently estimated (J'and D(T)) and allows the determination of the average chain length of 60 nm (or 44 trimer units). This work illustrates nicely a new strategy to design single-chain magnets by coupling ferromagnetically single-molecule magnets in one dimension.",

The 26.5 eV/photon laser (pulse time duration of approximately 1 ns) is employed as a single photon ionization source for the detection of these clusters. Only a small fraction of the photon energy is deposited in the cluster for metastable dissociation of cluster ions, and most of it is removed by the ejected electron. Protonated water, methanol, and ammonia clusters dominate the cluster mass spectra. Unprotonated ammonia clusters are observed in the protonated cluster ion size range 2&lt; or =n&lt; or =22. The unimolecular dissociation rate constants for reactions involving loss of one neutral molecule are calculated to be (0.6-2.7)x10(4), (3.6-6.0)x10(3), and (0.8-2.0)x10(4) s(-1) for the protonated water (9&lt; or =n&lt; or =24), methanol (5&lt; or =n&lt; or =10), and ammonia (5&lt; or =n&lt; or =18) clusters, respectively.

Products with losses of up to five H atoms are observed in the mass spectrum of the neutral ammonia dimer.

For all three cluster systems studied, single photon ionization with a 26.5 eV photon yields near threshold ionization.

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots.

Although this method is very useful and reliable its application has been rather infrequent up to now. This is mainly due to the need to measure the m/z 30 in addition to the usually measured m/z 28 and 29 for dinitrogen, because the (15)N in the enriched air sample taken from an enclosure (cover box) at the soil surface is nonrandom. The signal from the m/z 30 is very low and difficult to measure with sufficient precision because other species (e.g. NO) also having the m/z 30 often interfere with its measurement. In this study the accuracy and precision of an easy to use CF-IRMS with sample batch operation to measure the ratio 30/28 was investigated. The relative standard deviation (RSD = precision) from natural abundance up to 2 at.% was always &lt;1%. After correction of the mass ratio 30/28 (R30), by means of a formula obtained by linear regression of theoretical R30 against measured R30, the accuracy of the abundance calculated from this corrected R30 was very high. From the achieved precision and assuming a cover box height of 10 cm (headspace volume of 7 1), and a collection time of 2 h, a limit of detection for N(2) losses by denitrification equivalent to 16 g N/ha*d or 6 kg N/ha*a can be estimated. The performance of the (15)N dilution method using the equipment and procedure described is demonstrated by means of results from an incubation experiment with [(15)N]nitrate-amended soils.",

In the D-pi-A-pi-D-type dyes 1-6, a central BTD core was connected with two terminal N,N-disubstituted amino groups via various pi-conjugated spacers. The star-burst-type dyes 8 and 10 have a three-branched structure composed of a central core (benzene core in 8 and triphenylamine core in 10) and three triphenylamine-containing BTD branches. All the BTD-based dyes displayed intense orange-red color fluorescence in a region of 550-689 nm, which was obtained by single-photon excitation with good fluorescent quantum yield up to 0.98 as well as by two-photon excitation. Large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections (110-800 GM) of these BTD dyes were evaluated by open aperture Z-scan technique with a femtosecond Ti/sapphire laser. The TPA cross-sections of D-pi-A-pi-D-type dyes 2-6 with a benzene, thiophene, ethene, ethyne, and styrene moiety, respectively, as an additional pi-conjugated spacer are about 1.5-2.5 times larger than that of 1c with only a benzene spacer. The TPA cross-sections significantly increased in three-branched star-burst-type BTDs 8 (780 GM) with a benzene core and 10 (800 GM) with a triphenylamine core, which are about 3-5 times larger than those of the corresponding one-dimensional sub-units 9 (170 GM) and 11 (230 GM), respectively. The ratios of sigma/e(pi) between three-branched and one-dimensional dyes were 6.5:3.8 (for 8 and 9) and 6.0:4.0 (for 10 and 11), which are larger than those predicted simply on the basis of the chromophore number density (1:1), according to a cooperative enhancement of the two-photon absorbing nature in the three-branched system.",

In the absence of histology, the interpretation of the appearances of the struts by OCT remains speculative. We therefore report OCT findings with corresponding histology in the porcine coronary artery model immediately after and at 28 days and 2, 3, and 4 years after BVS implantation. Thirty-five polymeric BVS (3.0×12.0 mm) were singly implanted in the main coronary arteries of 17 pigs that underwent OCT and were then euthanized immediately (n=2), at 28 days (n=2), at 2 years (n=3), at 3 years (n=5), or at 4 years (n=5) after implantation. All BVS-implanted arteries in these animals were evaluated by histology except for 5 arteries examined at 2 years with gel permeation chromatography to assess the biodegradation of the polymeric device. Fourteen arteries with BVS from an additional 6 pigs were examined by gel permeation chromatography at 1 (n=1), 1.5 (n=2), and 3 (n=2) years. Corresponding OCT and histology images were selected with the distal and proximal radiopaque markers used as landmarks. At 28 days, by OCT, 82% of struts showed sharply defined, bright reflection borders, best described as a box-shaped appearance. Histologically, all struts appeared intact with no evidence of resorption. At 2 years, by OCT, 60±20 struts were discernible per BVS with 80.4% of the strut sites as a box-shaped appearance. Despite their defined appearance by OCT, by histology, these structures appeared to be composed of proteoglycan, with polymeric material being at such low level as to be no longer quantifiable by chromatography. At 3 years, by OCT, recognizable struts decreased to 28±9 struts per BVS: 43.7% showed dissolved black box; 34.8%, dissolved bright box; 16.1%, open box; and 5.4%, preserved box appearance. Histology shows that connective tissue cells within a proteoglycan-rich matrix replaced the areas previously occupied by the polymeric struts and coalesced into the arterial wall. At 4 years, by OCT, 10±6 struts were recognizable as either dissolved black or dissolved bright box. In histology, these struts are minimally discernible as foci of low-cellular-density connective tissue. Relative to the prediction of histological type by OCT appearance, the preserved box appearance of OCT corresponds well with 2-year histology (86.4%), whereas the dissolved bright and black box appearances correspond to 3-year histology (88.0% and 90.7%, respectively). Struts indiscernible by OCT correspond to the integrated strut footprints seen at 4 years (100%). Struts that are still discernible by OCT at 2 years are compatible with largely bioresorbed struts, as demonstrated by histological and gel permeation chromatography analysis. At 3 and 4 years, both OCT and histology confirm complete integration of the struts into the arterial wall.",

We obtain an exact expression for the conditional probability density function rhoT(yT,t|yT,0) that a tagged particle T (T=1,...,N) is at position yT at time t given that it at time t=0 was at position yT,0. Using a Bethe ansatz we obtain the N -particle probability density function and, by integrating out the coordinates (and averaging over initial positions) of all particles but particle T , we arrive at an exact expression for rhoT(yT,t|yT,0) in terms of Jacobi polynomials or hypergeometric functions. Going beyond previous studies, we consider the asymptotic limit of large N , maintaining L finite, using a nonstandard asymptotic technique.

The motion of a stiff, approximately spherical particle is tracked in both passive and active modes. We demonstrate that the dynamic modulus of the melt can be extracted under certain limitations using this technique. As shown before for unentangled chains [Karim et al., Phys. Rev. E 86, 051501 (2012)PLEEE81539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.86.051501], the frequency range of applicability is substantially expanded when both particle and medium inertia are properly accounted for by using our inertial version of the generalized Stokes-Einstein relation (IGSER). The system used here introduces an entanglement length d_{T}, in addition to those length scales already relevant: monomer bead size d, probe size R, polymer radius of gyration R_{g}, simulation box size L, shear wave penetration length Δ, and wave period Λ. Previously, we demonstrated a number of restrictions necessary to obtain the relevant fluid properties: continuum approximation breaks down when d≳Λ; medium inertia is important and IGSER is required when R≳Λ; and the probe should not experience hydrodynamic interaction with its periodic images, L≳Δ. These restrictions are also observed here. A simple scaling argument for entangled polymers shows that the simulation box size must scale with polymer molecular weight as M_{w}^{3}. Continuum analysis requires the existence of an added mass to the probe particle from the entrained medium but was not observed in the earlier work for unentangled chains. We confirm here that this added mass is necessary only when the thickness L_{S} of the shell around the particle that contains the added mass, L_{S}&gt;d. We also demonstrate that the IGSER can be used to predict particle displacement over a given timescale from knowledge of medium viscoelasticity; such ability will be of interest for designing nanoparticle-based drug delivery.

Providing opportunities to hide can significantly reduce behavioural stress in cats, but confirmation with physical parameters is needed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of a hiding box on behavioural stress levels (scored by means of the Cat-Stress-Score) and a physical parameter, namely body weight, during the first 12 days in quarantine for cats newly arrived cats at a Dutch animal shelter. Twenty-three cats between 1 and 10 years of age were randomly divided between the experimental (N = 12) and control group (N = 11) with and without a hiding box. Stress levels were assessed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 according to the non-invasive Cat-Stress-Score (CSS). Body weights were measured on days 0, 7 and 12. Finally, adoption rates and length of stay (LOS) were determined. Major findings of the study are: (1) the mean Cat-Stress-Score decreased with time for all cats, but cats with a hiding box showed a significant faster decrease in the CSS, reaching a lower CSS-steady state seven days earlier than the control group; (2) nearly all cats in both groups lost significant body weight during the first two weeks; (3) hiding boxes did not significantly influence weight loss; (4) no differences were found in the adoption rates and the LOS between both groups. Hiding enrichment reduces behavioural stress in shelter cats during quarantine situations and can therefore be a relatively simple aid to shelter adaptation. It offers no prevention however against feline weight loss, which indicates a serious health risk for shelter cats.",

In this study, we used two approaches to compute measures of sensitivity of the baroreflex (BRS), a time domain sequence approach and frequency domain transfer functions. Subjects listened to slow and fast tempo songs during the study. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and non-invasive continuous BP were recorded in 14 subjects (7 males and females). From these signals, either beat by beat or equi-sampled in time RR intervals and systolic BP (SBP) were computed. BRS was then estimated using RR and SBP. Our results show that the sequence method consistently provided higher values of BRS than the transfer function method (up to two fold). The two measures were reasonably well correlated $( \\mathrm {R}&gt;0.84)$ during control and the slow song, but not during the fast song.

Forty-eight Landrace x Yorkshire gilts were randomly assigned to groups (G) of 4 per pen (n = 8 pens; 3.9 m x 2.4 m) or to individual stalls (S; n = 16 stalls; 2.21 m x 0.61 m). Gilts were moved into individual farrowing crates 5 d before the expected farrowing date. Piglets were weighed at birth, d 14, and d 35. Two barrows from each litter were weaned at d 14 (early weaning) and housed together in pens. Maintenance behaviors (head in feeder, drinking, lying, eating mash) were videotaped and observed for the first 3 d after weaning using a 10-min interval scan sampling. Belly nosing and play/fight interactions were recorded from video observations for 3 d postweaning. An isolation test (30-min duration) was performed on one piglet from each pen of barrows on d 35. Time spent lying, the number of jumps against test box walls, and grunts and squeals were recorded in real time. Salivary cortisol was collected at 30-min intervals from baseline, and 0, 30, 60, and 90 min posttest. Jugular blood was collected from 2 barrows from each litter on d 1, 7, 14, 17, 21, and 28. Plasma TNF-alpha was analyzed by ELISA, and haptoglobin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, and immunoglobulin G were analyzed by radial immunodiffusion. More piglets from the S treatment needed to be fed a liquid feed at weaning and drank more frequently on d 2 postweaning (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, by d 35 piglets from S gilts had a lighter BW (10.3 kg) than G piglets (12.8 kg; P &lt; 0.01).

Salivary cortisol and immune measures were not different. These data show some behavioral and production differences between piglets from individually stalled gilts and group-housed gilts.

The electric field can be accurately described by mathematical formalisms, and the population-based neural responses to the electrical stimulation can be investigated at resolutions well beyond those achievable by current state-of-the-art biological techniques.

It is well known that the late-time density of surviving particles goes as t^{-1/4} with random initial conditions, and as t^{-1/2} with alternating initial conditions (ABABAB⋯). We show that the decay for periodic i.c.'s made of longer blocks (A^{n}B^{n}A^{n}B^{n}⋯) do not show a pure power-law decay when n is even.

We relate this kinetic symmetry breaking in the Glauber Ising model.

For isotropic scattering, Raman and Tyndall intensities are predicted to decay according to t((1-n)) and t(-n), respectively, where the value of n depends on the ratio of the optical collection aperture to the mean scattering length. The simulation correctly reproduced the analytical results of n = 3/2 and n = 5/2 for a point source in infinite and semi-infinite media, respectively. In addition the model can be used to relate the time at which a Raman photon exits the sample to the mean depth at which it was generated. This could provide a useful tool for depth profiling the chemical composition of turbid systems, and hence be a useful addition to the established array of photon-migration techniques. The model was applied to analyze experimentally observed Raman and Tyndall decay profiles from powdered trans-stilbene. The transport mean free path (l(t)) was calculated to be approximately 400 microm, which was significantly larger than the particle sizes present in the sample (approximately 10-100 microm). This implies that the particles were highly forward scattering, as would be expected for this size range. When highly anisotropic scattering was introduced into the model a much more reasonable scattering length (l(s) approximately 40 microm) was obtained. Finally, a simple analytical model was developed that gives the correct relationship between the Raman and Tyndall decay exponents for isotropic scattering.

Potential curves and transition dipole moment functions were determined along the normal mode coordinates of the electronic ground state. These functions were employed to determine vibronic absorption spectra. The intensities of dipole forbidden but vibronically allowed transitions were calculated by explicitly evaluating integrals over the vibrational wave functions and the transition dipole functions of the involved electronic states. By this method the oscillator strengths of the dipole allowed (2)A(1)&lt;--(2)B(2) and the dipole forbidden (2)B(1)&lt;--(2)B(2) bands were computed.

We investigate these ISC rates experimentally and theoretically as a function of S1 state vibrational excess energy Eexc. The S1 vibronic levels are pumped with a ∼5 ns UV laser, the S1 and triplet state ion signals are separated by prompt or delayed ionization with a second UV laser pulse. After correcting the raw ISC yields for the relative S1 and T1 ionization cross sections, we obtain energy dependent ISC quantum yields QISC (corr)=1%-5%. These are combined with previously measured vibronic state-specific decay rates, giving ISC rates kISC = 0.4-1.5 ⋅ 10(9) s(-1), the corresponding S1⇝S0 internal conversion (IC) rates are 30-100 times larger. Theoretical ISC rates are computed using SCS-CC2 methods, which predict rapid ISC from the S1; v = 0 state with kISC = 3 ⋅ 10(9) s(-1) to the T1((3)ππ(∗)) triplet state. The surprisingly high rate of this El Sayed-forbidden transition is caused by a substantial admixture of (1)nOπ(∗) character into the S1((1)ππ(∗)) wave function at its non-planar minimum geometry. The combination of experiment and theory implies that (1) below Eexc = 550 cm(-1) in the S1 state, S1⇝S0 internal conversion dominates the nonradiative decay with kIC ≥ 2 ⋅ 10(10) s(-1), (2) the calculated S1⇝T1 ((1)ππ(∗)⇝(3)ππ(∗)) ISC rate is in good agreement with experiment, (3) being El-Sayed forbidden, the S1⇝T1 ISC is moderately fast (kISC = 3 ⋅ 10(9) s(-1)), and not ultrafast, as claimed by other calculations, and (4) at Eexc ∼ 550 cm(-1) the IC rate increases by ∼50 times, probably by accessing the lowest conical intersection (the C5-twist CI) and thereby effectively switching off the ISC decay channels.

In the present study this phenomenon was successfully explained for the first time, employing an explicit consideration of solute-solvent interactions in combination with modern grid-based methods to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The capabilities of this framework of (i) not requiring any assumptions on the form of the resulting wave function, (ii) focusing the description on the vibrational mode of interest and (iii) taking solute-solvent interactions explicitly into account are a particularly lucid example of the advantages in applying state-of-the-art approaches in investigations of challenging vibrational quantum problems. The property of grid-based methods being directly applied onto any given potential energy grid together with point (i) enable to analyse the impact of mechanical- and electrical anharmonicity independently. Especially the detailed investigation of the latter contribution when moving from a harmonic to an anharmonic potential in conjunction with the explicit consideration of solvent effects at the example of an actual chemical system (i.e. not discussing these effects employing mere model potentials) demonstrate the manifold benefit achieved using the applied DFT/Numerov strategy.",

The influence of a large-amplitude wave (in the presence of chaos) on the stability of the ground state is analyzed for different parameters of the model in both the quantum and classical cases.

In this work, we use ab initio methods to evaluate the radiative lifetimes of the six vibrational levels of the a (3)Σ(+) of HeH(+). The transition a (3)Σ(+)→X (1)Σ(+) is spin-forbidden, but acquires intensity through spin-orbit interaction with the singlet and triplet Π states. Large scale CASSCF/MRCI calculations using an adapted basis set were performed to determine the potential energy curves of the relevant states of HeH(+) as well as the matrix elements of the dipole and spin-orbit operators. The wave functions and energies of the vibrational levels of the a (3)Σ(+) and X (1)Σ(+) states are obtained using a B-spline method and compared to previous works. We find that the radiative lifetime of the vibrational levels increases strongly with v, the lifetime of the v=0 state being 150 s. We also analyze the contributions from discrete and continuum parts of the spectrum. With such a long lifetime, the a (3)Σ(+) state could have astrophysical implications.",

It is shown that there is a quantum-classical correspondence in terms of mean displacement, mean-squared displacement, and the corresponding variance in the first-order perturbation theory, provided that the amplitude of the classical oscillator is fixed at the zeroth-order energy of quantum mechanics EQM (0). This correspondence condition is realized by proposing the extended Langevin dynamics (XLD), where the key is to construct a proper driving force. It is assumed that the driving force adopts a simple harmonic form with its amplitude chosen according to EQM (0), while the driving frequency chosen as the harmonic frequency. The latter can be improved by using the natural frequency of the system in response to the potential if its anharmonicity is strong. By comparing to the accurate numeric results from discrete variable representation calculations for a set of diatomic species, it is shown that the present method is able to capture the large part of anharmonicity, being competitive with the wave function-based vibrational second-order perturbation theory, for the whole frequency range from ∼4400 cm(-1) (H2 ) to ∼160 cm(-1) (Na2 ).

The results are compared with numerically exact quantum mechanical wave packet propagation and with results of the time-independent WKB method. The wave functions for the metastable states in the region over the well are reproduced very accurately by the SWP; in the classically forbidden region and outside of the centrifugal barrier, the SWP wave functions are qualitatively correct.

The reaction time durations of radiationless decays in the wave-packet dynamics are found to be generally consistent with the femtosecond time-resolution experimental observations.

Although the earlier PHHJ3 PES performs rather well, the LZHH PES QCT results show a better agreement with the experiment. On the other hand, some artifacts were found in recently reported QCT calculations (unphysical oscillations in σ(QCT) as a function of v), and the present study shows that special care is needed when carrying out QCT calculations involving highly excited vibrational states.

In this study, we investigate oscillatory changes in infant fNIRS signals by using the oscillator decompisition method (OSC-DECOMP), which is a statistical method for extracting oscillators from time series data based on Gaussian linear state space models. OSC-DECOMP provides a natural decomposition of fNIRS data into oscillation components in a data-driven manner and does not require the arbitrary selection of band-pass filters. We analyzed 18-ch fNIRS data (3 minutes) acquired from 21 sleeping 3-month-old infants. Five to seven oscillators were extracted on most channels, and their frequency distribution had three peaks in the vicinity of 0.01-0.1 Hz, 1.6-2.4 Hz and 3.6-4.4 Hz. The first peak was considered to reflect hemodynamic changes in response to the brain activity, and the phase difference between oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb for the associated oscillators was at approximately 230 degrees. The second peak was attributed to cardiac pulse waves and mirroring noise. Although these oscillators have close frequencies, OSC-DECOMP can separate them through estimating their different projection patterns on oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. The third peak was regarded as the harmonic of the second peak. By comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of two state space models, we determined that the time series of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb on each channel originate from common oscillatory activity. We also utilized the result of OSC-DECOMP to investigate the frequency-specific functional connectivity. Whereas the brain oscillator exhibited functional connectivity, the pulse waves and mirroring noise oscillators showed spatially homogeneous and independent changes.

Landau and Lifshitz stated that the probability of transition in a pulsed perturbation is given by |b<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup, rather than by |c<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup. We use the term \"transition probability\" to refer to the probability that a true excited-state component is present in the time-evolved wave function, as opposed to a smooth modification of the initial state. In recent work, we have examined the differences between |b<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup and |c<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup when a system is perturbed by a harmonic wave in a Gaussian envelope. We showed that significant differences exist when the frequency of the harmonic wave is off-resonance with the transition frequency. In this paper, we consider Gaussian perturbations and pulses that rise via a half Gaussian shoulder to a level plateau and later return to zero via a down-going half Gaussian. While the perturbation is constant, the transition probability |b<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup does not change. By contrast, |c<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup continues to oscillate while the perturbation is constant, and its time averaged value differs from |b<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup. We suggest a general type of experiment to prove that the transition probability is given by |b<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup, not |c<subk</sub(t)|<sup2</sup.

The reaction probability shows a strong oscillatory behavior vs E(col) and the presence of sharp resonances, arising from metastable NeH(2)(+) states. The behavior of the reaction cross section σ vs E(col) depends on the vibrational level and can in general be interpreted in terms of the late barrier character of the potential energy surface and the existence (or not) of threshold energy. The situation is particularly complex for v(0) = 2, as σ(v0=2, j0=1) presents significant oscillations with E(col) up to ≈0.33 eV, which probably reflect the resonances found in the reaction probability.

Rhythms in different frequency bands have often been assumed to be independent and their occurrence was interpreted as a sign of different functional operations. Independence has scarcely been proved because of conceptual and computational difficulties. It is, on the other hand, probable that different rhythmic brain processes are coupled because of the broad recurrent connectivity among brain structures. We, therefore, set out to find interactions among rhythmic signals at different frequencies. We were particularly interested in interactions between lower frequency bands and gamma-activities (30-90 Hz), because the latter have been analysed in our laboratory in great detail and had properties suggesting their involvement in perceptual feature linking. Fast oscillations occurred synchronized in a stimulus-specific way in the visual cortex of cat and monkey. Their presence was often accompanied by lower frequency components at considerable power. Such multiple spectral peaks are known from many cortical and subcortical structures. Despite their well known occurrence, coupling among different frequencies has not been established, apart from harmonic components. For the present investigation we extended existing analytical tools to detect non-linear correlations among signal pairs at any frequency (including incommensurate ones). These methods were applied to multiple microelectrode recordings from visual cortical areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats and V1 of awake monkeys. In particular, we assessed non-linear correlations by means of higher order spectral analysis of multi-unit spike activities (MUA) and local slow wave field potentials (LFP, 1-120 Hz) recorded with microelectrodes. Non-linear correlations among signal components at different frequencies were investigated in the following steps. First, the frequency content of short (approximately 250 ms) sliding window signal epochs was analyzed for simultaneously occurring rhythms of significant power at different frequencies. This was done by a newly developed method derived from the trispectrum using separate averaging of the products of short-epoch power spectra for any possible combination of frequency pairs. Second, non-linear (quadratic) phase coupling between different frequencies was assessed by the methods of bispectrum and bicoherence. We found phase correlations at different frequencies in the visual cortex of the cat and monkey. These couplings were significant in about 60% of the investigated MUA and LFP recordings, including several cases of coupling among incommensurate (i.e. non-harmonic) frequencies. Significant phase correlations were present: (1) within the gamma-frequency range; (2) between gamma- and low frequency ranges (1-30 Hz, including alpha- and beta-rhythms); and (3) within the low frequency range. Phase correlations depended, in most cases, on specific visual stimulation. We discuss the possible functional significance of phase correlations among high and low frequencies by including proposals from previous work about potential roles of single-frequency rhythms of the EEG. Our suggestions include: (1) visual feature linking across different temporal and spatial scales provided by coherent oscillations at high and low frequencies; (2) linking of visual cortical representations (high frequencies) to subcortical centers (low frequencies) like the thalamus and hippocampus; and (3) temporal segmentation of the sustained stream of incoming visual information into separate frames at different temporal resolutions in order to prevent perceptual smearing due to shifting retinal images. These proposals are, at present, merely speculative. However, they can, in principle, be proved by microelectrode recordings from trained behaving animals.",

The technique is a general one and it is possible to state a step by step procedure for its application. It has a substantial advantage in producing results which are immediately valid for arbitrary dimension. As the accuracy of the method increases with dimension, it complements classical small dimension methods. The results obtained by harmonic balancing analysis are compared with those obtained by studying the local stability properties of the singular points of the differential equation. A general theorem is derived which identifies those special cases where the results of first order harmonic balancing are identical to those of local stability analysis, and a necessary condition for this equivalence is derived. As a concrete example, the n-dimensional Goodwin oscillator is considered where p, the Hill coefficient of the feedback metabolite, is equal to three and four. It is shown that for p = 3 or 4 and n less than or equal to 4 the approximation indicates that it is impossible to construct a set of physically permissible reaction constants such that the system possesses a periodic solution.

However, since these oscillations are out of phase as a function of vibrational excitation, they have limited effect on the oscillatory behavior of the total predissociation rate. Comparison between exact quantum and perturbative golden rule calculations shows that vibrational predissociation has some impact on the electronic predissociation process and affects the final electronic distributions. On the contrary, vibrational product distributions are not significantly affected by the electronic predissociation.

Harmonic motion elastography (HME) is a technique for the localized estimation of tumor stiffness. This harmonic motion imaging (HMI)-based technique is designed to map the tissue Young's modulus or stiffness noninvasively. A focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer generates an oscillating, acoustic radiation force in its focal region. The two-dimensional (2D) shear wave speed, and consequently the Young's modulus maps, is generated by tracking the radio frequency (RF) signals acquired at high frame rates. By prolonging the sonication for more than 50 s using the same methodology, the 2D Young's modulus maps are reconstructed while HIFU is applied and ablation is formed on PDA murine tumors. The feasibility of this technique in measuring the regional Young's modulus was first assessed in tissue-mimicking phantoms.

Then HME was applied on two transgenic mice with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors. The Young's modulus median value of this tumor at the start of the HIFU application was equal to 2.1 kPa while after 45 s of sonication it was found to be approximately three times stiffer (6.7 kPa). The HME was described herein and showed its capability of measuring tissue stiffness noninvasively by measuring the shear wave speed propagation inside the tissue and reconstructing a 2D Young's modulus map. Application of the methodology in vivo and during HIFU were thus reported here for the first time.",

A bimane probe was covalently attached to a cysteine residue in a series of single-cysteine mutant proteins to scan each helix in a residue-by-residue fashion. A variety of fluorescence properties of the bimane fluorophore were measured for both the soluble and membrane-bound states of the channel peptide, including the fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence anisotropy, and membrane bilayer penetration depth. The fluorescence properties were collated for construction of a membrane-bound topology model of helices 4 and 5 of the channel domain. Finally, the data reveal that both helices 4 and 5 are two separate amphipathic alpha-helices that are situated parallel to the membrane surface. Dual fluorescence quencher analysis shows that helix 4 adopts a tilted topology in which its C-terminus is more buried than its N-terminus within the bilayer. In contrast, helix 5 is relatively solvent-exposed and located parallel to the interfacial region of the membrane surface. However, the loop region of both helices 4 and 5 was shown to be relatively buried within the bilayer. In addition, a least-squares fit of the data to a harmonic wave function indicated that both periodicity and frequency are typical for an amphipathic alpha-helix (3.75 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 4 and 3.70 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 5). Squared residual plots of the harmonic wave function also reveal that the N-terminus of helix 4 is elongated by two residues from Lys-406 to Phe-404, while the C-terminus of helix 5 is elongated by three residues from Tyr-434 to Ile-437 upon membrane association.",

They exploit recent advances in the Padé reconstruction of a scattering (S) matrix in a region surrounding the ReJ axis, where J is the total angular momentum quantum variable, starting from the discrete values, J = 0, 1, 2, .... In particular, use is made of Padé continuations obtained by Sokolovski, Castillo, and Tully [Chem. Phys. Lett. 313, 225 (1999)] for the S matrix of the benchmark F + H2(v(i) = 0, j(i) = 0, m(i) = 0) → FH(v(f) = 3, j(f) = 3, m(f) = 0) + H reaction. Here v(i), j(i), m(i) and v(f), j(f), m(f) are the initial and final vibrational, rotational, and helicity quantum numbers, respectively. The three contributions are: (1) A new exact decomposition of the partial wave (PW) S matrix is introduced, which is called the QP decomposition. The P part contains information on the Regge poles. The Q part is then constructed exactly by subtracting a rapidly oscillating phase and the PW P matrix from the input PW S matrix. After a simple modification, it is found that the corresponding scattering subamplitudes provide insight into the angular-scattering dynamics using simple partial wave series (PWS) computations. It is shown that the leading n = 0 Regge pole contributes to the small-angle scattering in the centre-of-mass frame. (2) The Q matrix part of the QP decomposition has simpler properties than the input S matrix. This fact is exploited to deduce a parametrized (analytic) formula for the PW S matrix in which all terms have a direct physical interpretation. This is a long sort-after goal in reaction dynamics, and in particular for the state-to-state F + H2 reaction. (3) The first definitive test is reported for the accuracy of a uniform semiclassical (asymptotic) CAM theory for a DCS based on the Watson transformation. The parametrized S matrix obtained in contribution (2) is used in both the PW and semiclassical parts of the calculation. Powerful uniform asymptotic approximations are employed for the background integral; they allow for the proximity of a Regge pole and a saddle point. The CAM DCS agrees well with the PWS DCS, across the whole angular range, except close to the forward and backward directions, where, as expected, the CAM theory becomes non-uniform. At small angles, θ(R) ≲ 40°, the PWS DCS can be reproduced using a nearside semiclassical subamplitude, which allows for a pole being close to a saddle point, plus the farside surface wave of the n = 0 pole sub-subamplitude, with the oscillations in the DCS arising from nearside-farside interference. This proves that the n = 0 Regge resonance pole contributes to the small-angle scattering.",

With infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, the weak, torsional overtone (v(6) = 2 &lt;-- 0) has been studied leading to the measurement of 382 frequencies between 405 and 440 cm(-1) at a resolution of 0.005 cm(-1). Torsional splittings on the order of 0.03 cm(-1) were observed. With mm-wave methods, a total of 669 rotational transitions between 50 and 360 GHz have been measured at Doppler-limited resolution in the four lowest torsional states v(6) = 0, 1, 2, 3. The experimental uncertainty attained for an isolated line was better than 10 kHz below 150 GHz, and somewhat larger at higher frequencies. For v(6) = 3, torsional splittings as large as 8.7 MHz were observed. The global data set consisted of the current frequency determinations and the 443 measurements with molecular beam, microwave, and mm-wave methods analyzed by I. Ozier, J. Schroderus, S.-X. Wang, G. A. McRae, M. C. L. Gerry, B. Vogelsanger, and A. Bauder [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 190, 324-340 (1998)]. The observation of mm-wave R-branch transitions for v(6) = 1 led to a change in the J-assignment of the forbidden (Deltak = +/-3) transitions reported earlier for this torsional state. A good fit was obtained by varying 24 parameters in a Hamiltonian that represented both the torsional effects and the sextic splittings. In the earlier work, the large reduced barrier height led to high correlations among several of the torsional distortion constants. With the current measurements, many of these correlations are substantially reduced. Improved effective values were determined for the height V(3) of the hindering barrier and the first-order correction V(6) in the Fourier expansion of the potential function. The dipole function which characterizes the transition moment of the torsional overtone (v(6) = 2 &lt;-- 0) can be written as the product of a single effective dipole constant µ(T)(0,eff) and the appropriate off-diagonal matrix element of (1 - cos 3alpha)/2, where alpha is the torsional angle. From an intensity analysis of the infrared spectrum, it has been determined that |µ(T)(0,eff)| = 85.3(62) mD. A novel approach based on a simple regrouping of angular momentum operators is introduced for decoupling the torsional and rotational degrees of freedom. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.",

Owing to the practical difficulties associated with obtaining higher order exact moments these methods have been largely eclipsed by molecular dynamics. In this paper we develop the formalism for extracting trajectory moments from a molecular dynamics trajectory and compare the performance of the two methods. We begin by using the classical phase space analogs of quantum wave functions to obtain matrix representations (transition matrices) of the Lie group of time displacement operators. The group elements for small time displacements, which correspond to a step of the trajectory, are approximated by using Trotter's theorem. The method is applied to the linear harmonic oscillator, the Morse oscillator and the Lennard-Jones potential and the resulting moments compared to those obtained by the Taylor expansion of a truncated continued fraction. We find that in the case of the harmonic oscillator the results from the continued fraction are much better than those from molecular dynamics. In the latter two cases, while the truncated fraction performs better than molecular dynamics both methods produce poor quality higher order moments. However, we are able to show the criterion whereby the overall error introduced by the truncated continued fraction is smaller than that introduced by molecular dynamics. From this work we conclude that the moment based methods produce good results, they are analytic in nature rather than numerical and should not be rejected but can be used to complement molecular dynamics.",

The grid-based Numerov procedure in one and two dimensions is then applied to an adequate scan of the respective potential surface yielding the associated vibrational wave functions and energy eigenvalues. This not only provides a detailed description of anharmonic effects but also an accurate inclusion of the coupling between the investigated vibrational states on a quantum mechanical level.

The behavior in the considered energy range can be understood on average in terms of a classical Langevin (capture) model, where the centrifugal barriers determine the amount of reactive flux which reaches the barrierless transition state. Additionally, the structure of the van der Waals well provides temporal trapping at intermediate intermolecular distances thus allowing the system to find its way to the reaction at some classically-forbidden energies. Interestingly, the cross-section for para-hydrogen shows clearly oscillating features associated with the opening of new partial waves and with shape resonances which may be amenable to experimental detection.",

This is due to the fact that this imaging principle requires the emission of laser pulses at a certain frequency in relation to this speed. To know the limits, the radial velocity of the object was supposed to go up to relativistic speeds. From a theoretical approach, some temporal behaviors leading to the Doppler effect were shown. To validate this effect experimentally, a setup based on the fictional positions (represented by mirrors) of an object moving at extreme speeds was performed. The results obtained with WRAI confirmed the presence of the Doppler effect, which must be taken into account when the radial velocity of the object is extreme. In this case, some conditions must be met as in the period and the time of the shutter aperture. Singular behaviors have also been shown in the case of relativistic speeds.

UGED is a promising method to investigate molecular dynamics in the gas phase because electron pulses can probe the structure with a high spatial resolution. Until recently, however, it was not possible for UGED to reach the relevant timescale for the motion of the nuclei during a molecular reaction. Using MeV electron pulses has allowed us to overcome the main challenges in reaching femtosecond resolution, namely delivering short electron pulses on a gas target, overcoming the effect of velocity mismatch between pump laser pulses and the probe electron pulses, and maintaining a low timing jitter. At electron kinetic energies above 3 MeV, the velocity mismatch between laser and electron pulses becomes negligible. The relativistic electrons are also less susceptible to temporal broadening due to the Coulomb force. One of the challenges of diffraction with relativistic electrons is that the small de Broglie wavelength results in very small diffraction angles. In this paper we describe the new setup and its characterization, including capturing static diffraction patterns of molecules in the gas phase, finding time-zero with sub-picosecond accuracy and first time-resolved diffraction experiments. The new device can achieve a temporal resolution of 100 fs root-mean-square, and sub-angstrom spatial resolution. The collimation of the beam is sufficient to measure the diffraction pattern, and the transverse coherence is on the order of 2 nm. Currently, the temporal resolution is limited both by the pulse duration of the electron pulse on target and by the timing jitter, while the spatial resolution is limited by the average electron beam current and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detection system. We also discuss plans for improving both the temporal resolution and the spatial resolution.",

The correlation between the de Broglie wavelength related to the thermal motion and the potential barrier width and height is reported. The stochastic jumps of light atoms (hydrogen, deuterium) between two equilibrium sites A and B (identical geometry) occur via different pathways; one pathway is over the barrier (classical dynamics), and the other one is through the barrier (tunneling). On the over-the-barrier pathway, there are no obstacles for the de Broglie waves, and this pathway exists from high to low temperatures up to 0 K because the thermal energy is subjected to the Maxwell distribution and a certain number of particles owns enough energy for the hopping over the barrier. On the tunneling pathway, the particles pass through the barrier, or they are reflected from the barrier. Only particles with the energy lower than barrier heights are able to perform a tunneling hopping. The de Broglie waves related to these energies are longer than the barrier width. The Schrödinger equation is applied to calculate the rate constant of tunneling dynamics. The Maxwell distribution of the thermal energy has been taken into account to calculate the tunneling rate constant. The equations for the total spectral density of complex motion derived earlier by us together with the expression for the tunneling rate constant, derived in the present paper, are used in analysis of the temperature dependence of deuteron spin-lattice relaxation of the ammonium ion in the deuterated analogue of ammonium hexachloroplumbate ((ND4)2PbCl6). It has been established that the equation CpTtun = EH (thermal energy equals activation energy), where Cp is the molar heat capacity (temperature-dependent, known from literature), determines directly the low temperature Ttun at which the de Broglie wavelength, lambdadeBroglie, related to the thermal energy, CpT, is equal to the potential barrier width, L. Above Ttun, the lambdadeBroglie wavelength related to the CpT energy is shorter than the potential barrier width and not able to overcome the barrier. The activation energy EH equals 7.5 kJ/mol, and therefore, the Ttun temperature for deuterons in ((ND4)2PbCl6 is 55.7 K. The agreement between the potential barrier width following from the simple geometrical calculations (L = 0.722 A) and de Broglie wavelength at Ttun (L = 0.752 A) is good. The temperature plots of the deuteron correlation times for (ND4)2PbCl6 reveal comparable values of the correlation times of the tunneling, (tau(T)), and over-the-barrier jumps (tau(H)) near 34.8 K. Matsuo, on the basis of the molar heat capacity study, found the first-order phase transition at this temperature.",

The charge carrier required for the emissions is determined to be an accelerating electron driven by an ATP-induced reverse electron transfer. The radial velocity component, the emission trajectory, of the moving charges traversing helical protein structures in a cyclotron-type mechanism is proposed to be imposed by the ferromagnetic field components of the iron in the iron-sulfur proteins.

Potentials calculated from the axial velocity components for the riboflavin and NADH systems were found to equal the standard redox potentials of these systems as measured electrochemically and enzymatically. The mechanics for the three systems determined the magnetic moments, the angular momenta, and the orbital magnetic fluxes to be adiabatic invariant parameters.

Energy band structures [Formula: see text] are considered for various NGS materials and their correspondence to the energy-momentum relation in special relativity is emphasized. It is indicated that special relativity for vacuum is analogous to a two-band [Formula: see text] description for NGS. The maximum electron velocity in NGS is [Formula: see text], which corresponds to the light velocity in vacuum. An effective mass of charge carriers in semiconductors is introduced, relating their velocity to quasimomentum and it is shown that this mass depends on electron energy (or velocity) in a way similar to the mass of free relativistic electrons. In [Formula: see text] alloys one can reach vanishing energy gap at which electrons and light holes become three-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. A wavelength [Formula: see text] is defined for NGS, in analogy to the Compton wavelength in relativistic quantum mechanics. It is estimated that [Formula: see text] is on the order of tens of Angstroms in typical semiconducting materials which is experimentally confirmed in tunneling experiments on energy dispersion in the forbidden gap. Statistical properties of the electron gas in NGS are calculated and their similarity is demonstrated to those of the Juttner gas of relativistic particles. Interband electron tunneling in NGS is described and shown to be in close analogy to the predicted but unobserved tunneling between negative and positive energies resulting from the Dirac equation for free electrons. It is demonstrated that the relativistic analogy holds for orbital and spin properties of electrons in the presence of an external magnetic field. In particular, it is shown that the spin magnetic moment of both NGS electrons and relativistic electrons approaches zero with increasing energy. This conclusion is confirmed experimentally for NGS. Electrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields are described theoretically and experimentally. It is only the two-band description for NGS, equivalent to the Dirac or Klein-Gordon equations for free particles, that gives a correct account of experimental results in this situation. A transverse Doppler shift in the cyclotron resonance observed in crossed fields in InSb indicates that there exists a time dilatation between an oscillating electron and an observer. The phenomenon of Zitterbewegung (ZB, trembling motion) for electrons in NGS is considered theoretically, following the original proposition of Schrödinger for free relativistic electrons in vacuum. The two descriptions are in close analogy, but the frequency of ZB for electrons in NGS is orders of magnitude lower and its amplitude orders of magnitude higher making possible experimental observations in semiconductors considerably more favorable. Finally, graphene and carbon nanotubes, as well as topological insulators are considered in the framework of relativistic analogy. These systems, with their linear energy-quasimomentum dispersions, illustrate the extreme semirelativistic regime. Experimental results for the energy dispersions and the Landau quantizations in the presence of a magnetic field are quoted and their analogy to the behavior of free relativistic electrons is discussed. Approximations and restrictions of the relativistic analogy are emphasized. On the other hand, it is indicated that in various situations it is considerably easier to observe semirelativistic effects in semiconductors than the relativistic effects in vacuum.",

Because the strong electromagnetic coupling between the electron and light leads to the collective excitation of plasmon polaritons, it is hypothesized that Fizeau drag in electron flow systems manifests as a plasmonic Doppler effect. Experimental observation of the plasmonic Doppler effect in electronic systems has been challenge because the plasmon propagation speed is much faster than the electron drift velocity in conventional noble metals. Here we report direct observation of Fizeau drag of plasmon polaritons in strongly biased monolayer graphene by exploiting the high electron mobility and the slow plasmon propagation of massless Dirac electrons. The large bias current in graphene creates a fast-drifting Dirac electron medium hosting the plasmon polariton. This results in non-reciprocal plasmon propagation, where plasmons moving with the drifting electron media propagate at an enhanced speed. We measure the Doppler-shifted plasmon wavelength using cryogenic near-field infrared nanoscopy, which directly images the plasmon polariton mode in the biased graphene at low temperature. We observe a plasmon wavelength difference of up to 3.6 per cent between a plasmon moving with and a plasmon moving against the drifting electron media.

It is found that both the spin and relativistic degeneracy at high densities tend to slow down the magnetoacoustic wave due to the Pauli paramagnetic effect and relativistic electron mass increase. The present study outlines the theoretical framework for the investigation of linear and nonlinear behaviors of electromagnetic waves in dense astrophysical systems.

Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields. This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects, with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets. Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries, apparent superluminal motions, and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies. Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism.

Chem. Phys. 90, 4916 (1989)] localization of molecular orbitals in the framework of a four-component relativistic molecular electronic structure theory. We have used an exponential parametrization of orbital rotations which allows the use of unconstrained optimization techniques. We demonstrate the strong basis set dependence of the Pipek-Mezey localization criterion and how it can be eliminated. We have employed localization in conjunction with projection analysis to study the bonding in the water molecule and its heavy homologues. We demonstrate that in localized orbitals the repulsion between hydrogens in the water molecule is dominated by electrostatic rather than exchange interactions and that freezing the oxygen 2s orbital blocks polarization of this orbital rather than hybridization. We also point out that the bond angle of the water molecule cannot be rationalized from the potential energy alone due to the force term of the molecular virial theorem that comes into play at nonequilibrium geometries and which turns out to be crucial in order to correctly reproduce the minimum of the total energy surface. In order to rapidly assess the possible relativistic effects we have carried out the geometry optimizations of the water molecule at various reduced speed of light with and without spin-orbit interaction. At intermediate speeds, the bond angle is reduced to around 90 degrees , as is known experimentally for H(2)S and heavier homologues, although our model of ultrarelativistic water by construction does not allow any contribution from d orbitals to bonding. At low speeds of light the water molecule becomes linear which is in apparent agreement with the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) model since the oxygen 2s12 and 2p12 orbitals both become chemically inert. However, we show that linearity is brought about by the relativistic stabilization of the (n + 1)s orbital, the same mechanism that leads to an electron affinity for eka-radon. Actual calculations on the series H2X (X = Te, Po, eka-Po) show the spin-orbit effects for the heavier species that can be rationalized by the interplay between SO-induced bond lengthening and charge transfer. Finally, we demonstrate that although both the VSEPR and the more recent ligand close packing model are presented as orbital-free models, they are sensitive to orbital input. For the series H2X (X = O, S, Se, Te) the ligand radius of the hydrogen can be obtained from the covalent radius of the central atom by the simple relation r(lig)(H) = 0.67r(cov)(X) + 27 (in picometers).",

Molecular dynamics simulations, within the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, require the definition of a force field. The ability to calculate the forces on the nuclei in bio-systems when autoionization takes place seems to rely on an understanding of radiative damages in RNA and DNA arising from the release of slow moving electrons which have long de Broglie wavelengths. This work addresses calculation of the real forces on the nuclei moving on the CPES. By using the transformation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, previously used by Madelung, we proved that the classical forces on nuclei moving on the CPES correlated with the gradient of the real part of the CPES. It was proved that the force on the nuclei of the metastable molecules is time independent although the probability to detect metastable molecules exponentially decays. The classical force is obtained from the transformed Schrödinger equation when ℏ=0 and the Schrödinger equation is reduced to the classical (Newtonian) equations of motion.

Systematically, off-diagonal Hamiltonian matrix blocks can be subjected to a unitary transformation to yield relativistically corrected matrix elements. The full hierarchy is investigated with respect to the accuracy reached for the electronic energy and for selected molecular properties on a balanced test molecule set that comprises molecules with heavy elements in different bonding situations. Our atomic (local) assembly of the unitary exact-decoupling transformation--called local approximation to the unitary decoupling transformation (DLU)--provides an excellent local approximation for any relativistic exact-decoupling approach. Its order-N(2) scaling can be further reduced to linear scaling by employing a neighboring-atomic-blocks approximation. Therefore, DLU is an efficient relativistic method well suited for relativistic calculations on large molecules. If a large molecule contains many light atoms (typically hydrogen atoms), the computational costs can be further reduced by employing a well-defined nonrelativistic approximation for these light atoms without significant loss of accuracy. We also demonstrate that the standard and straightforward transformation of only the atomic block-diagonal entries in the Hamiltonian--denoted diagonal local approximation to the Hamiltonian (DLH) in this paper--introduces an error that is on the order of the error of second-order Douglas-Kroll-Hess (i.e., DKH2) when compared with exact-decoupling results.

It is now recognized that Anderson localization is ubiquitous in wave physics because it originates from the interference between multiple scattering paths. Experimentally, localization has been reported for light waves, microwaves, sound waves and electron gases. However, there has been no direct observation of exponential spatial localization of matter waves of any type. Here we observe exponential localization of a Bose-Einstein condensate released into a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of a controlled disorder created by laser speckle. We operate in a regime of pure Anderson localization, that is, with weak disorder-such that localization results from many quantum reflections of low amplitude-and an atomic density low enough to render interactions negligible. We directly image the atomic density profiles as a function of time, and find that weak disorder can stop the expansion and lead to the formation of a stationary, exponentially localized wavefunction-a direct signature of Anderson localization. We extract the localization length by fitting the exponential wings of the profiles, and compare it to theoretical calculations. The power spectrum of the one-dimensional speckle potentials has a high spatial frequency cutoff, causing exponential localization to occur only when the de Broglie wavelengths of the atoms in the expanding condensate are greater than an effective mobility edge corresponding to that cutoff. In the opposite case, we find that the density profiles decay algebraically, as predicted in ref. 13.

In the nonrelativistic domain the correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact eigenvalue of the electronic Hamiltonian and the Hartree-Fock energy. In practice, what is reported is the basis set correlation energy, where the \"exact\" value is provided by a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation with some specified one-particle basis. The extension of this definition to the relativistic domain is not straightforward since the corresponding electronic Hamiltonian, the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian, has no bound solutions. Present-day relativistic calculations are carried out within the no-pair approximation, where the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is embedded by projectors eliminating the troublesome negative-energy solutions. Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the implicit use of such projectors and only positive-energy orbitals are retained at the correlated level, meaning that the Hartree-Fock projectors are frozen at the correlated level. We argue that the projection operators should be optimized also at the correlated level and that this is possible by full Multiconfigurational Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) calculations, that is, MCSCF calculations using a no-pair full CI expansion, but including orbital relaxation from the negative-energy orbitals. We show by variational perturbation theory that the MCSCF correlation energy is a pure MP2-like correlation expression, whereas the corresponding CI correlation energy contains an additional relaxation term. We explore numerically our theoretical analysis by carrying out variational and perturbative calculations on the two-electron rare gas atoms with specially tailored basis sets. In particular, we show that the correlation energy obtained by the suggested MCSCF procedure is smaller than the no-pair full CI correlation energy, in accordance with the underlying minmax principle and our theoretical analysis. We also show that the relativistic correlation energy, obtained from no-pair full MCSCF calculations, scales at worst as X(-2) with respect to the cardinal number X of our correlation-consistent basis sets optimized for the two-electron atoms. This is better than the X(-1) scaling suggested by previous studies, but worse than the X(-3) scaling observed in the nonrelativistic domain. The well-known 1/Z- expansion in nonrelativistic atomic theory follows from coordinate scaling. We point out that coordinate scaling for consistency should be accompanied by velocity scaling. In the nonrelativistic domain this comes about automatically, whereas in the relativistic domain an explicit scaling of the speed of light is required. This in turn explains why the relativistic correlation energy to the lowest order is not independent of nuclear charge, in contrast to nonrelativistic theory. ",

Jets containing a baryonic component should carry significantly more energy than electron-positron jets. Energetic considerations and circular-polarization measurements have provided conflicting circumstantial evidence for the presence or absence of baryons in jets, and the only system in which they have been unequivocally detected is the peculiar X-ray binary SS 433 (refs 4, 5). Here we report the detection of Doppler-shifted X-ray emission lines from a more typical black-hole candidate X-ray binary, 4U 1630-47, coincident with the reappearance of radio emission from the jets of the source. We argue that these lines arise from baryonic matter in a jet travelling at approximately two-thirds the speed of light, thereby establishing the presence of baryons in the jet. Such baryonic jets are more likely to be powered by the accretion disk than by the spin of the black hole, and if the baryons can be accelerated to relativistic speeds, the jets should be strong sources of γ-rays and neutrino emission.

In particular, when a relativistic intense laser focus interacts with a thin solid density target, ionized electrons are accelerated to near the speed of light (c) within an optical cycle and are pushed in the forward and transverse directions away from focus, carrying a significant portion of the laser energy. These relativistic electrons are effectively collisionless, and their interactions with the ions and surrounding cold electrons are predominantly mediated by collective electromagnetic effects of the resulting currents and charge separation. Thus, a deeper understanding of subsequent high energy ions generated from various mechanisms and their optimization requires knowledge of the relativistic electron dynamics and the fields they produce. In addition to producing MV/m quasi-static fields, accelerating the ions and confining the majority of the electrons near the bulk of the laser target, these relativistic electron currents are subject to plasma instabilities like the Weibel instability as they propagate through the thermal population in the bulk target. In this work, we present high temporal (100 fs) and spatial (1 μm) resolution shadowgraphy video capturing relativistic radial ionization front expansion and the appearance of filamentation radiating from the laser spot within a sub-micron thick liquid sheet target. Filamentation within the region persists for several picoseconds and seeds the eventual recombination and heating dynamics on the nanosecond timescale. A large scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of the interaction revealed the presence of strong magnetic fields characteristic of Weibel Instability, and corroborated the relativistic radial expansion of the ionization front, whose speed was determined to be 0.77c. Both the experimental and simulation results strongly point towards the target field ionization and the outward expanding hot electron current as the cause of the radial expansion.",

Here, we use a transmission electron microscope to measure the position-dependent phase shift imparted to a relativistic electron wave function when it traverses a standing laser wave. The kinetic energy of the electrons is varied between 80 and 300 keV, and the laser standing wave has a continuous-wave intensity of 175  GW/cm^{2}. In contrast to the nonrelativistic case, we demonstrate that the phase shift depends on both the electron velocity and the wave polarization, confirming the predictions of a quasiclassical theory of the interaction. Remarkably, if the electron's speed is greater than 1/sqrt[2] of the speed of light, the phase shift at the electric field nodes of the wave can exceed that at the antinodes. In this case there exists a polarization such that the phase shifts at the nodes and antinodes are equal, and the electron does not experience Kapitza-Dirac diffraction.

Because of its robustness and simplicity, the SK method became the workhorse to achieve several breakthroughs in both fundamental and technological areas. The need for specific emission wavelengths or structural and optical properties has nevertheless motivated further research on the DE method and its more recent development, local droplet etching (LDE), as complementary routes to obtain high-quality semiconductor nanostructures. The recent reports on the generation of highly entangled photon pairs, combined with good photon indistinguishability, suggest that DE and LDE QDs may complement (and sometimes even outperform) conventional SK InGaAs QDs as quantum emitters.

In 1992 Beynon and co-workers presented a binary Gabor type zone plate (henceforth referred to as the Beynon Gabor zone plate). Because this zone plate has no higher order foci, it is in principle a very attractive candidate for focusing of de Broglie matter waves and in some cases X-rays.

We show that at integer fractions of the focal length, the beam becomes nearly toroidal (doughnut-shaped). This offers potentially interesting new possibilities for de Broglie matter wave and X-ray optics, for example in STED-like applications. We further show that the increased intensity at the focal point predicted in the literature for a particular Beynon Gabor zone plate transmission function configuration is an artifact due to the lack of sampling nodes.

The extent of this non-scaling depends critically on the pitch and radius of the helix. For spherical scatterers the largest effect is seen when the ratio of the pitch to the radius is ~0.1. Interpreting data from such a system by using a point particle approximation would lead to a sizable underestimate of the speed of the scatterer. In the high q limit the scaling level of the model correlation functions is independent of the product of the curvature of the helix and q. The results for rotating disk-shaped ellipsoidal scatterers parallel those for spheres. The critical parameter for cases where the radius of the disk is large compared with the radius of the helix is the radius of the disk itself.

An EPR spectrum of this state exhibits broad split signals due to the interaction of the tyrosyl radical, Y(Z)(*), with the S = 1/2 S(2) state of the Mn(4) cluster. We present a novel approach to analyze S(2)Y(Z)(*) spectra of one-dimensionally (1-D) oriented acetate-inhibited PS II membranes to determine the magnitude and relative orientation of the S(2)Y(Z)(*) dipolar vector within the membrane. Although there exists a vast body of EPR data on isolated spins in oriented membrane sheets, the present study is the first of its kind on dipolar-coupled electron spin pairs in such systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and establish a rigorous treatment to account for the disorder present in partially oriented 1-D membrane preparations. We find that (i) the point-dipole distance between Y(Z)(*) and the Mn(4) cluster is 7.9 +/- 0.2 A, (ii) the angle between the interspin vector and the thylakoid membrane normal is 75 degrees, (iii) the g(z)()-axis of the Mn(4) cluster is 70 degrees away from the membrane normal and 35 degrees away from the interspin vector, and (iv) the exchange interaction between the two spins is -275 x 10(-)(4) cm(-)(1), which is antiferromagnetic. Due to the sensitivity of EPR line shapes of oriented spin-coupled pairs to the interspin distance, the present study imposes a tighter constraint on the Y(Z)-Mn(4) point-dipole distance than obtained from randomly oriented samples. The geometric constraints obtained from the 1-D oriented sample are combined with published models of the structure of Mn-depleted PS II to propose a location of the Mn(4) cluster. A structure in which Y(Z) is hydrogen bonded to a manganese-bound hydroxide ligand is consistent with available data and favors maximal orbital overlap between the two redox center that would facilitate direct electron- and proton-transfer steps.",

In addition, the effects of the spin axis direction and spin rate on the trajectory of a pitched baseball were evaluated. The trajectories of baseballs pitched by both a pitcher and a pitching machine were recorded using four synchronized video cameras (60 Hz) and were analyzed using direct linear transform (DLT) procedures. A polynomial function using the least squares method was used to derive the time-displacement relationship of the ball coordinates during flight for each pitch. The baseball was filmed immediately after ball release using a high-speed video camera (250 Hz), and the direction of the spin axis and the spin rate (omega) were calculated based on the positional changes of the marks on the ball. The lift coefficient was correlated closely with omegasinalpha (r = 0.860), where alpha is the angle between the spin axis and the pitching direction. The term omegasinalpha represents the vertical component of the velocity vector. The lift force, which is a result of the Magnus effect occurring because of the rotation of the ball, acts perpendicularly to the axis of rotation. The Magnus effect was found to be greatest when the angular and translational velocity vectors were perpendicular to each other, and the break of the pitched baseball became smaller as the angle between these vectors approached 0 degrees. Balls delivered from a pitching machine broke more than actual pitcher's balls. It is necessary to consider the differences when we use pitching machines in batting practice.",

Caused by selective excitation of molecular orientations DEER primary data also depend on the mutual orientation of the spin labels. For a doubly spin labeled variant of the cytoskeletal protein vinculin tail strong orientation selection can be observed already at X-band frequencies, which allows us to reduce the problem to the relative orientation of two molecular axes and the spin-spin axis parameterized by three angles. A full grid search of parameter space reveals that the DEER experiment introduces parameter-space symmetry higher than the symmetry of the spin Hamiltonian. Thus, the number of equivalent parameter sets is twice as large as expected and the relative orientation of the two spin labels is ambiguous. Except for this inherent ambiguity the most probable relative orientation of the two spin labels can be determined with good confidence and moderate uncertainty by global fitting of a set of five DEER experiments at different offsets between pump and observer frequency. The experiment provides restraints on the angles between the z axis of the nitroxide molecular frame and the spin-spin vector and on the dihedral between the two z axes. When using the same type of label at both sites, assignment of the angle restraints is ambiguous and the sign of the dihedral restraint is also ambiguous.",

The magnetic coupling in the dimer is profoundly affected by changes in both the bridging ligands and Mn oxidation state. In particular, change in the bridging structure has a dramatic effect on the nature of the Jahn-Teller distortion observed for the Mn(III) centers in the III/III and III/IV dimers. The principal magnetic interactions in [Mn(2)(mu-O)(2)(O(2)CH)(NH(3))(6)](n+)() involve the J(xz/xz)and J(yz/yz) pathways but due to the tilt of the Mn(2)O(2) core, they are less efficient than in the planar di-mu-oxo structure and, consequently, the calculated exchange coupling constants are generally smaller. In both the III/III and III/IV dimers, the Mn(III) centers are high-spin, and the Jahn-Teller effect gives rise to axially elongated Mn(III) geometries with the distortion axis along the Mn-O(c) bonds. In the III/IV dimer, the tilt of the Mn(2)O(2) core enhances the crossed exchange J(x)()()2(-)(y)()()2(/)(z)()()2 pathway relative to the planar di-mu-oxo counterpart, leading to significant delocalization of the odd electron. Since this delocalization pathway partially converts the Mn(IV) ion into low-spin Mn(III), the magnetic exchange in the ground state can be considered to arise from two interacting spin ladders, one is the result of coupling between Mn(IV) (S = 3/2) and high-spin Mn(III) (S = 2), the other is the result of coupling between Mn(IV) (S = 3/2) and low-spin Mn(III) (S = 1). In [Mn(2)(mu-O)(O(2)CH)(2)(NH(3))(6)](n+)(), both the III/III dimer and the lowest energy structure for the III/IV dimer involve high-spin Mn(III), but the Jahn-Teller axis is now orientated along the Mn-oxo bond, giving rise to axially compressed Mn(III) geometries with long Mn-O(c) equatorial bonds. In the IV/IV dimer, the ferromagnetic crossed exchange J(yz)()(/)(z)()()2 pathway partially cancels J(yz/yz) and, as a consequence, the antiferromagnetic J(xz/xz) pathway dominates the magnetic coupling. In the III/III dimer, the J(yz/yz) pathway is minimized due to the smaller Mn-O-Mn angle, and since the ferromagnetic J(yz)()(/)(z)()()2 pathway largely negates J(xz/xz), relatively weak overall antiferromagnetic coupling results. In the III/IV dimer, the structures involving high-spin and low-spin Mn(III) are almost degenerate. In the high-spin case, the odd electron is localized on the Mn(III) center, and the resulting antiferromagnetic coupling is similar to that found for the IV/IV dimer. In the alternative low-spin structure, the odd electron is significantly delocalized due to the crossed J(yz)()(/)(z)()()2 pathway, and cancellation between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic pathways leads to overall weak magnetic coupling. The delocalization partially converts the Mn(IV) ion into high-spin Mn(III), and consequently, the spin ladders arising from coupling of Mn(IV) (S = 3/2) with high-spin (S = 2) and low-spin (S = 1) Mn(III) are configurationally mixed. Thus, in principle, the ground-state magnetic coupling in the mixed-valence dimer will involve contributions from three spin-ladders, two associated with the delocalized low-spin structure and the third arising from the localized high-spin structure.",

A short dc pulse along the z axis rotates the transverse spin components of nuclear species I and S through different angles, converting a portion of the scalar order into vector order. The development of vector order can be described analytically by means of single-transition operators, and it is found to be maximal when the transverse components of I are rotated by an angle of ±π∕2 relative to those of S. A period of free evolution follows the pulse, during which the vector order evolves as a set of oscillating coherences. The imaginary parts of the coherences represent spin order that is not directly detectable, while the real parts can be identified with oscillations in the z component of the molecular spin dipole. The dipole oscillations are due to a periodic exchange between Iz and Sz, which have different gyromagnetic ratios. The frequency components of the resulting spectrum are imaginary, since the pulse cannot directly induce magnetization in the sample; it is only during the evolution under HJ that the vector order present at the end of the pulse evolves into detectable magnetization.

The calculated potential energy curves (PECs) of the 7 Λ-S states are associated with the dissociation limits of Zn(+)((2)Sg)+H((2)Sg), Zn((1)Sg)+H(+)((1)Sg), and Zn(+)((2)Pu)+H((2)Sg), respectively (The Λ-S state is labeled as (2S+1)Λ, in which Λ is the quantum number for the projection along the internuclear axis of the total electronic orbital angular momentum and S is the total electron spin). The spectroscopic constants of the bound states are determined and in good agreement with the available theoretical and experimental results. The permanent dipole moments (PDMs) of Λ-S states and the spin-orbit (SO) matrix elements between Λ-S states are also computed. The results show that the abrupt changes of the PDMs and SO matrix elements come into being for the reason of the avoided crossing between the states with the same symmetry. In addition, the non-adiabatic couplings matrix elements between Λ-S states are also evaluated. Finally, the spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) for the low-lying states are considered with Breit-Pauli operator.

These complexes exhibit the spin states ranging from an essentially pure high-spin (S = 5/2) to an essentially pure intermediate-spin (S = 3/2) state depending on the field strength of the axial ligands and the structure of the porphyrin rings. Reed and Guiset reported that the pyrrole-H chemical shift is a good probe to determine the spin state in the spin admixed S = 5/2,3/2 complexes (Reed, C. A.; Guiset, F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 3281-3282). In this paper, we report that the chemical shifts of the alpha- and beta-pyrrole carbons can also be good probes to determine the spin state because they have shown good correlation with those of the pyrrole-H or pyrrole-C(alpha). By putting the observed or assumed pyrrole-H or pyrrole-C(alpha) chemical shifts of the pure high-spin and pure intermediate-spin complexes into the correlation equations, we have estimated the carbon chemical shits of the corresponding complexes. The orbital interactions between iron(III) and porphyrin have been examined on the basis of these chemical shifts, from which we have found that both the d(xy)-a(2u) interaction in the ruffled Fe(T(i)PrP)L2+ and d(xy)-a(1u) interaction in the saddled Fe(OETPP)L2+ are quite weak in the high-spin and probably in the intermediate-spin complexes as well. Close inspection of the correlation lines has suggested that the electron configuration of an essentially pure intermediate-spin Fe(T(i)PrP)L2+ changes from (d(xy), d(yz))3(d(xy))1(d(z)2)1 to (d(xy))2(d(xz), d(yz))2(d(z)2)1 as the axial ligand (L) changes from DMF to MeOH, THF, 2-MeTHF, and then to dioxane. Although the DFT calculation has indicated that the highly saddled intermediate-spin Fe(OETPP)(THF)2+ should adopt (d(xy), d(yz))3(d(xy))1(d(z)2)1 rather than (d(xy))2(d(xz), d(yz))2(d(z)2)1 because of the strong d(xy)-a(1u) interaction (Cheng, R.-J.; Wang, Y.-K.; Chen, P.-Y.; Han, Y.-P.; Chang, C.-C. Chem. Commun. 2005, 1312-1314), our 13C NMR study again suggests that Fe(OETPP)(THF)2+ should be represented as (d(xy))2(d(xz), d(yz))2(d(z)2)1 because of the weak d(xy)-a(1u) interaction. The contribution of the S = 3/2 state in all types of the spin admixed S = 5/2,3/2 six-coordinate complexes has been determined on the basis of the (13)C NMR chemical shifts.",

The ring-shaped molecules, which are aligned in a parallel fashion in the unit cell, form almost perfectly planar, regular octagons. The interaction between the CrIII ions is antiferromagnetic (J = 12 cm(-1)) which results in a S = 0 spin ground state.

A spin Hamiltonian analysis of these data revealed a spin S = 2 system with uniaxial magnetization properties, arising from a quasi-degenerate M(S) = +/-2 doublet that is separated from the next magnetic sublevels by very large zero-field splittings (3/D/ &gt; 150 cm(-1)). The ground levels give rise to positive magnetic hyperfine fields of unprecedented magnitudes, B(int) = +82, +78, +72, and +62 T for 1.CH(3), 1.NHTol, 1.NHtBu, and 1.Cl, respectively. Parallel-mode EPR measurements at X-band gave effective g values that are considerably larger than the spin-only value 8, namely g(eff) = 10.9 (1.Cl) and 11.4 (1.CH(3)), suggesting the presence of unquenched orbital angular momenta. A qualitative crystal field analysis of g(eff) shows that these momenta originate from spin-orbit coupling between energetically closely spaced yz and z(2) 3d-orbital states at iron and that the spin of the M(S) = +/-2 doublet is quantized along x, where x is along the Fe-X vector and z is normal to the molecular plane. A quantitative analysis of g(eff) provides the magnitude of the crystal field splitting of the lowest two orbitals, /epsilon(yz) - epsilon(2)(z)/ = 452 (1.Cl) and 135 cm(-1) (1.CH(3)). A determination of the sign of the crystal field splitting was attempted by analyzing the electric field gradient (EFG) at the (57)Fe nuclei, taking into account explicitly the influence of spin-orbit coupling on the valence term and ligand contributions. This analysis, however, led to ambiguous results for the sign of epsilon(yz) - epsilon(2)(z). The ambiguity was resolved by analyzing the splitting Delta of the M(S) = +/-2 doublet; Delta = 0.3 cm(-1) for 1.Cl and Delta = 0.03 cm(-)(1) for 1.CH(3). This approach showed that z(2) is the ground state in both complexes and that epsilon(yz) - epsilon(2)(z) approximately 3500 cm(-1) for 1.Cl and 6000 cm(-1) for 1.CH(3). The crystal field states and energies were compared with the results obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The isomer shifts and electric field gradients in 1.X exhibit a remarkably strong dependence on ligand X. The ligand contributions to the EFG, denoted W, were expressed by assigning ligand-specific parameters: W(X) to ligands X and W(N) to the diketiminate nitrogens. The additivity and transferability hypotheses underlying this model were confirmed by DFT calculations. The analysis of the EFG data for 1.X yields the ordering W(N(diketiminate)) &lt; W(Cl) &lt; W(N'HR), W(CH(3)) and indicates that the diketiminate nitrogens perturb the iron wave function to a considerably lesser extent than the monodentate nitrogen donors do. Finally, our study of these synthetic model complexes suggests an explanation for the unusual values for the electric hyperfine parameters of the iron sites in the Fe-Mo cofactor of nitrogenase in the M(N) state.",

The geometry optimization process shows that the alloys are more stable in Cu<sub2</subMnAl type structure than in Hg<sub2</subCuTi one. To find a magnetic ground state, the total energy of the alloys is calculated in the non-magnetic (NM), ferromagnetic (FM) and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) ordering.

Spin polarized band structures and density of states (DOS) demonstrate that the CsCrO<sub2</sub, CsCrS<sub2</sub and CsCrSe<sub2</sub alloys are true half-metals with 100% spin-polarization at the Fermi level, while the CsCrTe<sub2</sub alloy is predicted as highly spin polarized material.

Optimal 3-D range exceeds that predicted by 2-D models because, although angle of attack and lift are negative initially, 3-D motion allows advantageous orientation of lift later in flight, with tilt of the axis of symmetry from vertical becoming much smaller at landing. Optimal strategies are discontinuous with wind speed, resulting in slicing and kiting strategies in large head and tail winds, respectively.

Compact expressions are derived using a rigorous quantum mechanical analysis for the angular momentum anisotropy of either of the products (C or D) arising from an initially polarized distribution of the reactant angular momentum. The angular momentum distribution of the product is expressed in terms of canonical spherical tensors multiplied by anisotropy-transforming coefficients c(K(i)q(k))(K)(K(r),L). These coefficients act as transformation coefficients between the angular momentum anisotropy of the reactants and that of the product. They are independent of scattering angle but depend on the details of the scattering dynamics. The relationship between the coefficients c(K(i)q(k))(K)(K(r),L) and the body-fixed scattering S matrix is given and the methodology for the quantum mechanical calculation of the anisotropy-transforming coefficients is clearly laid out. The anisotropy-transforming coefficients are amenable to direct experimental measurement in a similar manner to vector correlation and alignment parameters in photodissociation processes. A key aspect of the theory is the use of projections of both reactant and product angular momenta onto the product recoil vector direction. An important new conservation rule is revealed through the analysis, namely that if the state multipole for reactant angular momentum distribution has a projection q(k) onto the product recoil vector the state multipoles for the product angular momentum distribution all have this same projection. Expressions are also presented for the distribution of the product angular momentum when its components are evaluated relative to the space-fixed Z-axis.

Abragam and B. Bleaney, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Metal Ions, 1970; J. R. Pilbrow, J. Magn. Reson., 1978, 31, 479; F. Trandafir et al., Appl. Magn. Reson., 2007, 31, 553; M. Fittipaldi et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2008, 112, 3859), in which the E(S<subx</sub<sup2</sup - S<suby</sub<sup2</sup) term is putatively treated to the second order. To show the usefulness of the present approach, we exploit Fe<supIII</sup(Cl)OEP (S = 5/2) (OEP: 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin) and Co<supII</supOEP (S = 3/2) well magnetically diluted in the diamagnetic host crystal lattice of Ni<supII</supOEP. The advantage of single-crystal ESR spectroscopy lies in the fact that the molecular information on the principal axes of the magnetic tensors is crucial in comparing with reliable theoretical results. In high spin states of metallocomplexes with sizable ZFS in pseudo-octahedral symmetry, their fine-structure ESR transitions for the principal z-axis orientation appear in the lower field far from g = 2 at the X-band, disagreeing with the putative intuitive picture obtained using relevant ESR spectroscopy. A Re<supIII,IV</sup dinuclear complex in a mixed valence state exemplifies the cases, whose fine-structure/hyperfine ESR spectra of the neat crystals have been analyzed in their principal-axis system. The DFT-based/ab initio MO calculations of the magnetic tensors for all the high spin entities in this work were carried out.",

We consider the common case where such functionals are applied in relativistic density functional calculations. In scalar-relativistic calculations, the spin density can be defined conventionally, but if spin-orbit coupling is taken into account, spin is no longer a good quantum number and it is not clear what the \"spin density\" is. In many applications, a fixed quantization axis is used to define the spin density (\"collinear approach\"), but one can also use the length of the local spin magnetization vector without any reference to an external axis (\"noncollinear approach\"). These two possibilities are compared in this work both by formal analysis and numerical experiments. It is shown that the (nonrelativistic) exchange-correlation functional should be invariant with respect to rotations in spin space, and this only holds for the noncollinear approach. Total energies of open shell species are higher in the collinear approach because less exchange energy is assigned to a given Kohn-Sham reference function. More importantly, the collinear approach breaks rotational symmetry, that is, in molecular calculations one may find different energies for different orientations of the molecule. Data for the first ionization potentials of Tl, Pb, element 113, and element 114, and for the orientation dependence of the total energy of I+2 and PbF indicate that the error introduced by the collinear approximation is approximately 0.1 eV for valence ionization potentials, but can be much larger if highly ionized open shell states are considered. Rotational invariance is broken by the same amount. This clearly indicates that the collinear approach should not be used, as the full treatment is easily implemented and does not introduce much more computational effort.",

The typical feature of tert-butyl nitroxide radical creates spin delocalization along with spin polarization within the coupler. The J values of all the diradicals strongly depend on the dihedral angle between radical center and coupler.

Herein, we present a novel BDPA biradical, where two BDPA (α,α,γ,γ-bisdiphenylene-β-phenylallyl) radicals are covalently tethered by a saturated biphenyl acetylene linker. The inter-spin distance between the two spin carrier fragments was measured using double quantum coherence (DQC) ESR methodology. The DQC experiment revealed a mean distance of only 1.8 nm between the two unpaired electron spins. This distance is shorter than the predictions based on a simple modelling of the biradical geometry with the electron spins located at the central carbon atoms. Therefore, DFT (density functional theory) calculations were performed to obtain a picture of the spin delocalization, which may give rise to a modified dipolar interaction tensor, and to find those conformations that correspond best to the experimentally observed inter-spin distance. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the attachment of the biphenyl acetylene linker at the second position of the fluorenyl ring of BDPA did not affect the spin population or geometry of the BDPA radical. Therefore, spin delocalization and geometry optimization of each BDPA moiety could be performed on the monomeric unit alone. The allylic dihedral angle θ<sub1</sub between the fluorenyl rings in the monomer subunit was determined to be 30° or 150° using quantum chemical calculations. The proton hyperfine coupling constant calculated from both energy minima was in very good agreement with literature values.

We have designed a series of elemental 0 degrees pulses for the recoupling sequences with the rf phase rotation about the z-axis, known as CN. The proposed 0 degrees pulses whose total flip angle &gt;/=360 degrees provide spin rotation vectors in the xy-plane. Thus, the residual spin rotation can be canceled by rf phase rotation about the z-axis. An analysis by the coherent averaging theory showed that effective bandwidths of the recoupling sequences are limited not by the reduction in the dipolar scaling factor but by the increase in the residual spin rotation due to offset. A CN sequence with these elemental pulses provides an effective bandwidth of DQ-dipolar recoupling from ca. 0.5nu(R) to 4nu(R) for numerical simulations. Here, nu(R) is the sample spinning frequency. The 0 degrees pulses were applied to band-selective recoupling for the magnetization transfer in uniformly 13C-labeled molecules. Narrow-band recoupling enhances the magnetization transfer between spins within the effective range by decoupling the dipolar interactions between spins one of which is outside the range. The narrow band operation reduces rf field strength, which improves the CH decoupling.

Oxidation of the Ni(II) complex with I2 produces a novel Ni(II) macrocyclic cationic complex containing a monodentate disulfide ligand (2). Crystals of the I3- salt of the complex form in the triclinic space group P(1) with cell dimensions a=8.508(3) A, b=9.681(2) A, c=14.066(4) A, angles alpha=90.97(2) degrees , beta=91.61(3) degrees , gamma=90.83(2) degrees , and Z=2. The structure was refined to R=6.31% and Rw=16.63% (I &gt; 2sigma(I)). Oxidation of the Ni(II) complex with O2 leads to the formation of a novel pentadentate bis-iminothiocarboxylate complex with trigonal-bipyramidal geometry (3). This neutral product crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c with cell dimensions a=13.625(3) A, b=7.605(5) A, c=14.902(4) A, angles alpha=gamma=90 degrees, beta=102.81(2) degrees , and Z=4. The structure was refined to R=7.18% and Rw=17.86% (I &gt; 2sigma(I)). Oxidation of the Zn(II) dithiolate analogue with O2 leads to the formation of the Zn(II) complex of the pentadentate bis-iminothiocarboxylate ligand. The neutral complex is isomorphous with the Ni(II) complex and crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c with cell dimensions a=13.8465(4) A, b=7.6453(2) A, c=15.0165(6) A, angles alpha=gamma=90 degrees , beta=103.2140(11) degrees , and Z=4. The structure was refined to R=3.96% and Rw=9.45% (I &gt; 2sigma(I)). Details of the crystal structures are reported. Kinetics of the O2 reactions show that the reactions of the Ni(II) and Zn(II) dithiolates follow the rate law, Rate=k2[1][O2], with k2=1.81 M(-1) s(-1) for the Ni(II) complex and k2=1.93 x 10(-2) M(-1) s(-1) for the Zn(II) complex. The O2 oxidation of the high-spin Ni(II) thiolate complex was found to follow a similar oxidation mechanism to those of low-spin Ni(II) complexes, which form transient persulfoxide intermediates that yield S-oxidation products. In the case of the high-spin system reported here, the transient persulfoxide intermediate gives rise to an alternative ligand oxidation product, a bis-iminothiocarboxylate complex, because of the reactivity of the ligand, which contains a methylene with acidic H atoms alpha to the thiolate sulfur. The proposed mechanism is supported by studies of the analogous Zn dithiolate complex, which gives rise to the analogous bis-iminothiocarboxylate product (5).",

Septet 1-bromo-3,5-dichloro-2,4,6-trinitrenobenzene (S-1) was generated in a solid argon matrix by ultraviolet irradiation of 1,3,5-triazido-2-bromo-4,6-dichlorobenzene. This trinitrene displays an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum that drastically differs from ESR spectra of all previously studied septet trinitrenes. The zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters, derived from the experimental spectrum, show the parameter |D| = 0.1237 cm(-1) and the unprecedentedly large ratio of E/D = 0.262 that is close to the rhombic limit E/D = 1/3 for high-spin molecules. The CASCI (based on state-averaged CASSCF) and DFT methods were applied to calculate the ZFS tensor focusing on the heavy (bromine) atom effects on the spin-orbit term. These calculations show that the multiconfigurational ab initio formalism and the CASCI method are the most successful for accurate predictions of the spin-orbit term in the ZFS tensor of high-spin nitrenes containing heavy bromine atoms. Due to the presence of the bromine atom in S-1, the contribution of the spin-orbit term to the total parameter D is dominant and responsible for the unusual orientation of the easy Z-axis lying in the molecular plane perpendicular to the C-Br bond. As a result, the principal values D(XX), D(YY), and D(ZZ) of the total tensor D̂(Tot) have such magnitudes and signs for which the ratio E/D is close to the rhombic limit, and the total parameter D is large in magnitude and positive in sign.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36).

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between SAEM and FOCEi using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status.

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery.

For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The content of anthocyanin glucosides was detected in plasma and urinary excretion. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity was assessed after intake.

The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins differed significantly and amounted to $0.18$ % (red wine) and $0.23$ % (red grape juice) of the administered dose. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity increased to higher levels after juice ingestion compared to wine. The intestinal absorption of the anthocyanins of red grape juice seemed to be improved compared to red wine, suggesting a possible synergistic effect of the glucose content of the juice. The improved absorption resulted in an enhanced plasmatic bioactivity.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest. LSCI was used to measure the area of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miarea</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{area}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and the perfusion level of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and normal skin ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miN</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${N}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ). The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and pruritus were also used to assess each keloid. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of various internal cytokines in keloids and normal skin. We compared the perfusion and expression levels of intrinsic cytokines between keloids and normal skin. We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p &lt; 0.001). The expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p &lt; 0.05). RPI was defined as: <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:mrow<mml:mo[</mml:mo <mml:mrow<mml:mo(</mml:mo <mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub <mml:mo-</mml:mo <mml:msub<mml:miN</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub <mml:mo)</mml:mo</mml:mrow <mml:mo×</mml:mo <mml:mn0.03</mml:mn <mml:mo+</mml:mo <mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miarea</mml:mi</mml:msub <mml:mo×</mml:mo <mml:mn0.001</mml:mn <mml:mo]</mml:mo</mml:mrow <mml:mo.</mml:mo</mml:mrow <mml:annotation$[({K}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}-{N}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}})\\times 0.03+{K}_{\\mathrm{area}}\\times 0.001].$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math The severity of keloids could be divided into five grades based on RPI. The RPI had a higher correlation with the pain-VAS, pruritus-VAS, and the expression levels of internal cytokines in keloids than blood perfusion levels and the VSS. T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) was also used to verify the clinical discriminatory abilities of this RPI model. The proposed RPI based on LSCI showed the highest accuracy, unlike the VSS and assessment of perfusion, and can be utilized as a reliable, objective, quantitative, and noninvasive tool to evaluate the severity of keloids.",

However, the indirect effects of differences in light requirements on the growth of mid- and late-successional tree species are unclear, and this potential growth effect has not been explained at the transcriptome level. Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the expression changes in genes related to growth and photoprotection under different light environments. The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL. There was no significant difference in photosynthetic capacity between mature leaves in contrasting light environments. Although the biomass of C. concinna under LL was less than that under FL, the height of C. concinna under LL was higher than that under FL, indicating that C. concinna could grow well under the two light environments. Our results describing the acclimatization of light at the physiological, molecular and transcriptome levels are important for a complete understanding of successional mechanisms.",

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

If this is the case, we should describe the relationship among proportions of face components quantitatively. This study aims to develop a mathematical model of facial proportions to provide a quantitative description of facial attractiveness. Furthermore, we expect that plastic surgeons can use models in clinical work to enhance communication efficiency between doctors and patients. Face alignment technique was used to analyse 5500 frontal faces with diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) to obtain the ratios among the nose length ($ {N}_{L} $), the nasal base width ($ N $), and the inner canthus width ($ {E}_{I} $). A mathematical model ($ {N}_{L}^{2} = a{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L}+b{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}N+cN\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L} $) was developed to describe the relationship among these proportions. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated the post-operative photos using Adobe Photoshop. Our findings show that the ratio of nose length to nose width, the ratio of inner canthus width to nose length and the ratio of inner canthus to nose width play a significant role in determining facial attractiveness. These results provide a possible strategy to quantitatively describe the relationship among human face proportions.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

Our DL enhancements employ a Deep Image Prior (DIP) with a U-net type denoising architecture that includes situations with minimal training data, such as personalized syn-MRI. We provide a general workflow for syn-MRI from three or more training images. Our workflow, called DIPsyn-MRI, uses DIP to enhance training images, then obtains parametric images using LS or MLE before synthesizing images at desired design parameter settings. DIPsyn-MRI is implemented in our publicly available Python package DeepSynMRI available at: https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI. We demonstrate feasibility and improved performance of DIPsyn-MRI on 3D datasets acquired using the Brainweb interface for spin-echo and FLASH imaging sequences, at different noise levels. Our DL enhancements improve syn-MRI in the presence of different intensity nonuniformity levels of the magnetic field, for all but very low noise levels.

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

In spite of multiple quasidegeneracies (particularly for the cases of Sc(2) and Mn(2)), the GVVPT2 PECs are smooth with no discontinuities. Since these molecules have been identified as ones that widely used perturbative methods are inadequate for describing well, due to intruder state problems, unless shift parameters are introduced that can obfuscate the physics, this study suggests that the conclusion about the inadequacy of multireference perturbation theory be re-evaluated. The ground state of Sc(2) is predicted to be X(5)∑(u)(-), and its spectroscopic constants are close to the ones at the MRCISD level. Near equilibrium geometries, the 1(3)∑(u)(-) electronic state of Sc(2) is found to be less stable than the quintet ground state by 0.23 eV. The Cr(2) PEC has several features of the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) experimental curve (e.g., the pronounced shelf at elongated bond lengths), although the predicted bond length is slightly long (R(e) = 1.80 Å with cc-pVQZ compared to the experimental value of 1.68 Å). The X(1)∑(g)(+) ground state of Mn(2) is predicted to be a van der Waals molecule with a long bond length, R(e), of 3.83 Å using a cc-pVQZ basis set (experimental value = 3.40 Å) and a binding energy, D(e), of only 0.05 eV (experimental value = 0.1 eV). We obtained R(e) = 3.40 Å and D(e) = 0.09 eV at the complete basis set (CBS) limit for ground state Mn(2). Low lying excited state curves have also been characterized for all three cases (Cr(2), Mn(2), and Sc(2)) and show similar mathematical robustness as the ground states. These results suggest that the GVVPT2 multireference perturbation theory method is more broadly applicable than previously documented.",

However, the indirect effects of differences in light requirements on the growth of mid- and late-successional tree species are unclear, and this potential growth effect has not been explained at the transcriptome level. Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the expression changes in genes related to growth and photoprotection under different light environments. The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL. There was no significant difference in photosynthetic capacity between mature leaves in contrasting light environments. Although the biomass of C. concinna under LL was less than that under FL, the height of C. concinna under LL was higher than that under FL, indicating that C. concinna could grow well under the two light environments.

However, the relative importance of different age groups in propagating epidemics is uncertain. During a communicable disease outbreak, some groups may be disproportionately represented during the outbreak's ascent due to increased susceptibility and/or contact rates. Such groups or subpopulations can be identified by considering the proportion of cases within the subpopulation occurring before (Bp) and after the epidemic peak (Ap) to calculate the subpopulation's relative risk, RR=Bp/Ap. We estimated RR for several subpopulations (age groups) using data on laboratory-confirmed US influenza hospitalizations during epidemics between 2009-2014. Additionally, we simulated various influenza outbreaks in an age-stratified population, relating the RR to the impact of vaccination in each subpopulation on the epidemic's initial effective reproductive number R_e(0). We found that children aged 5-17 had the highest estimates of RR during the five largest influenza A outbreaks, though the relative magnitude of RR in this age group compared to other age groups varied, being highest for the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. For the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 influenza B epidemics, adults aged 18-49, and 0-4 year-olds had the highest estimates of RR respectively. For 83% of simulated epidemics, the group with the highest RR was also the group for which initial distribution of a given quantity of vaccine would result in the largest reduction of R_e(0). In the largest 40% of simulated outbreaks, the group with the highest RR and the largest vaccination impact was children 5-17. While the relative importance of different age groups in propagating influenza outbreaks varies, children aged 5-17 play the leading role during the largest influenza A epidemics. Extra vaccination efforts for this group may contribute to reducing the epidemic's impact in the whole community.",

This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot).

We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art.

Chemically motivated incomplete model spaces, of the style previously shown to describe complicated first-row transition metal diatoms well, were used and again shown to be effective.

These states, together with 1(1)Σ(g)(+), are relevant to discussion of controversial results in the literature that suggest dissociation asymptotes that violate the noncrossing rule. The ground state of Y(2) was found to be X(5)Σ(u)(–) (similar to Sc(2)) with bond length R(e) = 2.80 Å, binding energy D(e) = 3.12 eV, and harmonic frequency ω(e) = 287.2 cm(–1), whereas the lowest 1(1)(g)(+) state of Y(2) was found to lie 0.67 eV above the quintet ground state and had spectroscopic constants R(e) = 3.21 Å, D(e) = 0.91 eV, and ω(e) = 140.0 cm(–1).

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation. A first study ($\\mathrm{N}=30$) that focused on displaying cardiac activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort. A second study ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) that focused on respiratory activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort as well as two sub-components of the sense of embodiment. Interestingly, the user's actual breathing tended to synchronize with the simulated breathing, especially with the multi-sensory and haptic displays. A third study ($\\mathrm{N}=18$) that focused on the combination of cardiac and respiratory activity showed that combining both rendering techniques significantly enhances the sensation of effort.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The electric field can be accurately described by mathematical formalisms, and the population-based neural responses to the electrical stimulation can be investigated at resolutions well beyond those achievable by current state-of-the-art biological techniques. In this study, we used a biophysically-and morphologically-detailed RGC model to explore the ability of high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) to preferentially activate ON and OFF RGC subtypes, the two major information pathways of the retina. The performance of a wide range of electrical stimulation amplitudes (0 - $100~\\mu \\mathbf {A}$) and frequencies (1 - 10 kHz) on functionally-distinct RGC responses were evaluated.

The content of anthocyanin glucosides was detected in plasma and urinary excretion. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity was assessed after intake.

The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins differed significantly and amounted to $0.18$ % (red wine) and $0.23$ % (red grape juice) of the administered dose. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity increased to higher levels after juice ingestion compared to wine. The intestinal absorption of the anthocyanins of red grape juice seemed to be improved compared to red wine, suggesting a possible synergistic effect of the glucose content of the juice.

Because the nickel atom has an excitation energy of only 0.025 eV to its first excited state (the least in the first row of transition elements), Ni<sub2</sub has a particularly large number of low-lying states. Full potential energy curves (PECs) of more than a dozen low-lying electronic states of Ni<sub2</sub, resulting from the atomic combinations <sup3</supF<sub4</sub + <sup3</supF<sub4</sub and <sup3</supD<sub3</sub + <sup3</supD<sub3</sub, were computed. In agreement with previous theoretical studies, we found the lowest lying states of Ni<sub2</sub to correlate with the <sup3</supD<sub3</sub + <sup3</supD<sub3</sub dissociation limit, and the holes in the d-subshells were in the subspace of delta orbitals (i.e., the so-dubbed δδ-states).

Inclusion of scalar relativistic effects through the spin-free exact two component (sf-X2C) method reduced the bond lengths of both of these two states to 2.20 Å, and increased their binding energies to 1.95 eV and harmonic frequencies to 296.0 cm<sup-1</sup for X <sup1</supΓ<subg</sub and 297.0 cm<sup-1</sup for 1 <sup1</supΣ<subg</sub <sup+</sup.

Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure neuronal activities. A new software algorithm was developed to process fNIRS signals and to derive the parameters of functional connectivity. The synchronization of oxygenated hemoglobin signals from paired channels was evaluated using their temporal correlation. Results from 61 subjects of experiment show that a general decline in functional connectivity from NA (edge count $=$ 307) to AD (edge count $=$170), and the laterality between left and right PFC became insignificant $( \\mathrm {p}&gt;0.01)$ at AD stage. Moreover, the NA group demonstrated a significantly higher clustering coefficient than the AD group $( \\mathrm {p}&lt; 0.01)$, indicating the NA has higher regularity in brain network.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation. Stimulus-induced cortical hyperactivity persisted up to 1.5 h and decayed to baseline after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ indicated by c-Fos expression.

Spine density and spine head volume were also increased at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and decreased at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$.

The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05).

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean (±standard deviation) ages: 47.4 ± 9.5 years).

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and pruritus were also used to assess each keloid.

We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p &lt; 0.001). The expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p &lt; 0.05).

The RPI had a higher correlation with the pain-VAS, pruritus-VAS, and the expression levels of internal cytokines in keloids than blood perfusion levels and the VSS. T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) was also used to verify the clinical discriminatory abilities of this RPI model. The proposed RPI based on LSCI showed the highest accuracy, unlike the VSS and assessment of perfusion, and can be utilized as a reliable, objective, quantitative, and noninvasive tool to evaluate the severity of keloids.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation. A first study ($\\mathrm{N}=30$) that focused on displaying cardiac activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort. A second study ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) that focused on respiratory activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort as well as two sub-components of the sense of embodiment. Interestingly, the user's actual breathing tended to synchronize with the simulated breathing, especially with the multi-sensory and haptic displays. A third study ($\\mathrm{N}=18$) that focused on the combination of cardiac and respiratory activity showed that combining both rendering techniques significantly enhances the sensation of effort.

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

However, the indirect effects of differences in light requirements on the growth of mid- and late-successional tree species are unclear, and this potential growth effect has not been explained at the transcriptome level. Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the expression changes in genes related to growth and photoprotection under different light environments. The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL. There was no significant difference in photosynthetic capacity between mature leaves in contrasting light environments. Although the biomass of C. concinna under LL was less than that under FL, the height of C. concinna under LL was higher than that under FL, indicating that C. concinna could grow well under the two light environments.

This article provides a pipeline to enhance the synthesis of such images in three-dimensional (3D) using a deep learning (DL) neural network architecture for spatial regularization in a personalized setting where having more than a few training images is impractical. Our DL enhancements employ a Deep Image Prior (DIP) with a U-net type denoising architecture that includes situations with minimal training data, such as personalized syn-MRI. We provide a general workflow for syn-MRI from three or more training images. Our workflow, called DIPsyn-MRI, uses DIP to enhance training images, then obtains parametric images using LS or MLE before synthesizing images at desired design parameter settings. DIPsyn-MRI is implemented in our publicly available Python package DeepSynMRI available at: https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI. We demonstrate feasibility and improved performance of DIPsyn-MRI on 3D datasets acquired using the Brainweb interface for spin-echo and FLASH imaging sequences, at different noise levels. Our DL enhancements improve syn-MRI in the presence of different intensity nonuniformity levels of the magnetic field, for all but very low noise levels.

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots.

For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status.

In this paper, we have developed a state-space framework to sequentially segment the carotid IM borders in each image throughout the cardiac cycle. In this framework, an ${\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{\\infty }}$ filter is used to solve the state-space equations, and a grayscale-derivative constraint snake is used to provide accurate measurements for the ${\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{\\infty }}$ filter. We have evaluated the performance of our approach by comparing our segmentation results to the manually traced contours of ultrasound image sequences of three synthetic models and 156 real subjects from four medical centers.

The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the \"portullugo\" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (~ 2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with ~ 50% matrix completeness across data sets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support: Anacampserotaceae $+$ Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees. Our results add to the growing number of examples illustrating the complexity of phylogenetic signals in genomic-scale data.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

While the role of Ω in addressing static (strong) correlation problem has been addressed in numerous previous studies, the usefulness of seniority number in describing weak (dynamic) correlation has not been investigated in a systematic way. Thus, the overall objective in the present work is to investigate the role of Ω in addressing also dynamic electron correlation in addition to the static correlation. Two systematic CI truncation strategies are compared beyond minimal basis sets and full valence active spaces. One approach is based on the seniority number (defined as the total number of singly occupied orbitals in a determinant) and another is based on an excitation-level limitation. In addition, molecular orbitals are energy-optimized using multiconfigurational-self-consistent-field procedure for all these wave functions. The test cases include the symmetric dissociation of water (6-31G), N2 (6-31G), C2 (6-31G), and Be2 (cc-pVTZ). We find that the potential energy profile for H2O dissociation can be reasonably well described using only the Ω = 0 sector of the CI wave function. For the Be2 case, we show that the full CI potential energy curve (cc-pVTZ) is almost exactly reproduced using either Ω-based (including configurations having up to Ω = 2 in the virtual-orbital-space) or excitation-based (up to single-plus-double-substitutions) selection methods, both out of a full-valence-reference function. Finally, in dissociation cases of N2 and C2, we shall also consider novel hybrid wave functions obtained by a union of a set of CI configurations representing the full valence space and a set of CI configurations where seniority-number restriction is imposed for a complete set (full-valence-space and virtual) of correlated molecular orbitals, simultaneously. We discuss the usefulness of the seniority number concept in addressing both static and dynamic electron correlation problems along dissociation paths. ",

Methylperoxy radicals are known to be important intermediates in the tropospheric ozone cycle, and the self-reaction of methylperoxy radicals, which is thought to proceed via dimethyl tetraoxide, leads to significant chain radical termination in this process. Dimethyl tetraoxide has five internal rotors, three of them unique; the potential energy profiles are calculated for these rotors, as well as for those in the CH(3)OO, CH(3)OOO, and CH(3)OOOO radicals. The dimethyl tetraoxide internal rotor profiles show barriers to rotation of 2-8 kcal mol(-1). Using B3LYP/6-31(d) geometries, frequencies, internal rotor potentials, and moments of inertia, we determine entropy and heat capacity values for dimethyl tetraoxide and its radicals. Isodesmic work reactions with the G3B3 and CBS-APNO methods are used; we calculate this enthalpy as -9.8 kcal mol(-1). Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) are calculated for all C-O and O-O bonds in dimethyl tetraoxide, again with the G3B3 and CBS-APNO theoretical methods, and we suggest the following BDEs: 46.0 kcal mol(-1) for CH(3)-OOOOCH(3), 20.0 kcal mol(-1) for CH(3)O-OOOCH(3), and 13.9 kcal mol(-1) for CH(3)OO-OOCH(3). From the BDE calculations and the isodesmic enthalpy of formation for dimethyl tetraoxide, we suggest enthalpies of 2.1, 5.8, and 1.4 kcal mol(-1) for the CH(3)OO, CH(3)OOO, and CH(3)OOOO radicals, respectively. We evaluate the suitability of 10 different density functional theory (DFT) methods for calculating thermochemical properties of dimethyl tetraoxide and its radicals with the 6-31G(d) and 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis sets, using a variety of work reaction schemes. Overall, the best-performed DFT methods of those tested were TPSSh, BMK, and B1B95. Significant improvements in accuracy were made by moving from atomization to isodesmic work reactions, with most DFT methods yielding errors of less than 2 kcal mol(-1) with the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set for isodesmic calculations on the dimethyl tetraoxide enthalpy. These isodesmic calculations were basis set consistent, with a considerable reduction in error found by using the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set over the 6-31G(d) basis set. This was not the case, however, for atomization and bond dissociation work reactions, where the two basis sets returned similar results. Improved group additivity terms for the O-O-O moiety (O/O2 central atom group) are also determined.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

If this is the case, we should describe the relationship among proportions of face components quantitatively. This study aims to develop a mathematical model of facial proportions to provide a quantitative description of facial attractiveness. Furthermore, we expect that plastic surgeons can use models in clinical work to enhance communication efficiency between doctors and patients. Face alignment technique was used to analyse 5500 frontal faces with diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) to obtain the ratios among the nose length ($ {N}_{L} $), the nasal base width ($ N $), and the inner canthus width ($ {E}_{I} $). A mathematical model ($ {N}_{L}^{2} = a{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L}+b{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}N+cN\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L} $) was developed to describe the relationship among these proportions. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated the post-operative photos using Adobe Photoshop.

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation. A first study ($\\mathrm{N}=30$) that focused on displaying cardiac activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort. A second study ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) that focused on respiratory activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort as well as two sub-components of the sense of embodiment. Interestingly, the user's actual breathing tended to synchronize with the simulated breathing, especially with the multi-sensory and haptic displays.

This electrification in turn produces some electrostatic forces in addition to the gravitational and fluid friction forces that affect the movement of saltating sand particles, further, the wind-blown sand saltation. To evaluate this effect quantitatively, this paper presents a simulation of evolution of wind-blown sand grains after the electrostatic forces exerted on the grains are taken into account in the wind feedback mechanism of wind-blown saltation. That is, the coupling interaction between the wind flow and the saltating sand particles is employed in the simulation to the non-stationary wind and sand flows when considering fluid drag, gravitation, and a kind of electrostatic force generated from a distribution of electric field changing with time in the evolution process of the sand saltation. On the basis of the proposed simulation model, a numerical program is given to perform the simulation of this dynamic process and some characteristic quantities, e.g., duration of the system to reach the steady state, and curves of the saltating grain number, grain transport rate, mass-flux profile, and wind profile varying with time during the non-stationary evolution are displayed. The obtained numerical results exhibit that the electrostatic force is closely related to the average charge-to-mass ratio of sand particles and has obvious influence on these characteristic quantities. The obtained results also show that the duration of the system to reach the steady state, the sand transport rate and the mass flux profile coincide well with experimental results by Shao and Raupach (1992) when the average charge-to-mass ratio of sand particles is 60 microC/kg for the sand particles with average diameter of 0.25 mm. When the average charge-to-mass ratios of sand particles are taken as some other certain values, the calculation results still show that the mass flux profiles are well in agreement with the experimental data by Rasmussen and Mikkelsen (1998) for another category of sand particles, which tell us that the electrostatic force is one of main factors that have to be considered in the research of mechanism of wind-blown sand saltation.",

This system is an extension of the restricted primitive model for spherical particles, where L/σ = 0, and it is assumed that the ions are immersed in an structureless solvent, i.e., a continuum with dielectric constant D. The system consisted of N = 2000 particles and the Wolf method was implemented to handle the coulombic interactions of the inhomogeneous system. Results are presented for different values of the strength ratio between the gravitational and electrostatic interactions, Γ = (mgσ)/(e(2)/Dσ), where m is the mass per particle, e is the electron's charge and g is the gravitational acceleration value. A semi-infinite simulation cell was used with dimensions Lx ≈ Ly and Lz = 5Lx, where Lx, Ly, and Lz are the box dimensions in Cartesian coordinates, and the gravitational force acts along the z-direction. Sedimentation effects were studied by looking at every layer formed by the CHSC along the gravitational field. By increasing Γ, particles tend to get more packed at each layer and to arrange in local domains with an orientational ordering along two perpendicular axis, a feature not observed in the uncharged system with the same hard-body geometry. This type of arrangement, known as tetratic phase, has been observed in two-dimensional systems of hard-rectangles and rounded hard-squares. In this way, the coupling of gravitational and electric interactions in the CHSC system induces the arrangement of particles in layers, with the formation of quasi-two dimensional tetratic phases near the surface.

The typical harmonic approximation for the D-A potential results in a Gaussian probability distribution, which does not appropriately reflect the electronic repulsion forces that increase the energetic cost of sampling shorter D-A distances. Because these shorter distances are the primary channel for thermally activated tunneling, the analysis of tunneling kinetics depends sensitively on the inherently anharmonic nature of the D-A interaction. Thus, we have used quantum chemical calculations to account for the D-A interaction and developed an improved model for the analysis of experimental tunneling kinetics. Strong internal electric fields are also considered and found to contribute significantly to the compressive forces when the D-A distance distribution is positioned below the van der Waals contact distance. This model is applied to recent experiments on the wild type (WT) and a double mutant (DM) of soybean lipoxygenase-1 (SLO). The compressive force necessary to prepare the tunneling-active distribution in WT SLO is found to fall in the ∼ nN range, which greatly exceeds the measured values of molecular motor and protein unfolding forces. This indicates that ∼60-100 MV/cm electric fields, aligned along the D-A bond axis, must be generated by an enzyme conformational interconversion that facilitates the PCET tunneling reaction. Based on the absolute value of the measured tunneling rate, and using previously calculated values of the electronic matrix element, the population of this tunneling-active conformation is found to lie in the range 10<sup-5</sup-10<sup-7</sup, indicating this is a rare structural fluctuation that falls well below the detection threshold of recent ENDOR experiments. Additional analysis of the DM tunneling kinetics leads to a proposal that a disordered (high entropy) conformation could be tunneling-active due to its broad range of sampled D-A distances.",

The effect of the electrical membrane potential on the H+/e- stoichiometry was investigated. The enzyme was isolated from Neurospora crassa, reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and electrical membrane potentials of various values were generated across the membranes by means of the valinomycin-induced potassium-diffusion method. Using lithium ions as counterions for the intravesicular potassium, the induced membrane potential was stable for minutes and was not significantly changed by the protons ejected by the working enzyme. This allowed the assay of steady-state reaction rates at pre-given values of electrical membrane potential. The rate ratio between electron transfer and proton translocation declined from 1 to 0.6 with increase of the membrane potential from 0 to 100 mV. The activity of the quinol/cytochrome c redox reaction followed a parabolic dependence, being activated by low (less than 50 mV) potential and inhibited by high (greater than 100 mV) potential. This apparent non-linear dependence was interpreted in terms of a linear flow/force relationship plus a membrane-potential-dependent slip. Evaluation of the parabolic course by means of a modified linear flow/force relation also indicated a decline of the H+/e- stoichiometry from 1 to 0.5 with increase of the membrane potential from 0 to 120 mV. These observations suggest that the membrane potential controls a change of ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase between two states that have different reaction routes.",

Using a novel functional lung magnetic resonance imaging technique to measure regional Va/Q ratio, the gravitational gradients in proton density, ventilation, perfusion, and Va/Q ratio were measured in prone and supine posture. Data were acquired in seven healthy subjects in a single sagittal slice of the right lung at functional residual capacity.

Because the larger (n ≥ 10) assemblies are formed with three-dimensional cage morphologies that more closely mimic the bulk environment, we report the spectra of cryogenically cooled (10 K) clusters over the size range 2 ≤ n ≤ 28, over which the structures evolve from two-dimensional arrangements to cages at around n = 10. The clusters that feature a complete second solvation shell around a surface-embedded hydronium ion yield spectral signatures of the proton defect similar to those observed in dilute acids. The origins of the large observed shifts in the proton vibrational signature upon cluster growth were explored with two types of theoretical analyses. First, we calculate the cubic and semidiagonal quartic force constants and use these in vibrational perturbation theory calculations to establish the couplings responsible for the large anharmonic red shifts. We then investigate how the extended electronic wave functions that are responsible for the shapes of the potential surfaces depend on the nature of the H-bonded networks surrounding the charge defect. These considerations indicate that, in addition to the sizable anharmonic couplings, the position of the OH stretch most associated with the excess proton can be traced to large increases in the electric fields exerted on the embedded hydronium ion upon formation of the first and second solvation shells. The correlation between the underlying local structure and the observed spectral features is quantified using a model based on Badger's rule as well as via the examination of the electric fields obtained from electronic structure calculations.

Higher elevated gravitational-force event rates in the past month substantially increased the risk of a crash in the subsequent month (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.12). Although the difference in this relation did not vary significantly by time, it was highest in the first 6 months compared with the second and third 6-month periods. With a receiver operating characteristic curve, the risk models showed relatively high predictive accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.76. The authors conclude that elevated gravitational-force event rates can be used to assess risk and to show high predictive accuracy of a near-future crash.",

The electrical potential was estimated by following the fluorescence of a cyanine dye, 3,3'-dipentyloxadicarbocyanine. Illumination of H. halobium vesicles resulted in a rapid, reversible decrease of the dye fluorescence, by as much as 35%. This effect was not seen in nonvesicular patches of purple membrane. Observation of maximal fluorescence decreases upon ilumination of vesicles required an optimal dye/membrane protein ratio. The pH optimum for the lightinduced fluorescence decrease was 6.0. The decrease was linear with actinic light intensity up to about 4 X 10(5) ergs cn-2 s-1. Valinomycin, gramicidin, and triphenylmethylphosphonium ion all abolished the fluorescence changes. However, the light-induced pH change was enhanced by these agents. Conversely, buffered vesicles showed no pH change but gave the same or larger fluorescence changes. Thus, we have identified the fluorescence decrease with a light-induced membrane potential, inside negative. By using valinomycin-K+-induced membrane potentials, we calibrated the fluorescence decrease with calculated Nernst diffusion potentials. We found a linear dependence between potential and fluorescence decrease of 3 mV/%, up to 90 mV. When the envelope vesicles were illuminated, the total proton-motive force generated was dependent on the presence of Na+ and K+ and their concentration gradients across the membrane. In general, K+ appeared to be more permeable than Na+ and, thus, permitted development of greater pH gradients and lower electrical potentials.

The high conductivity is preserved in a quenched state below approximately 600 degrees C with a reduced activation energy of approximately 0.8 eV. Such complex behavior in electrical conductivity is associated with incorporation of hydride ions (H-) in cages of the lattice framework. Electromotive force measurements reveal that the major carrier for the conductivity is electron with a small contribution by proton (H+), ruling out the possibility of direct intercage migration of the H- ion. A combination of these observations with the ab initio calculations leads to the conclusion that the electrons are thermally generated from the H- ion by the dissociation into two electrons and an proton, which is further converted to an OH- ion via reaction with an extraframework oxide ion (O2-). The energy difference between the initial (H- + O2-) and the final (2e- + OH-) states as evaluated by the theoretical calculation is as small as approximately 1 eV, which agrees well with an experimentally obtained enthalpy change, approximately 1.4 eV. Thus, internal equilibration between the extraframework hydrogen and the oxygen species is responsible for the thermal generation of the carrier electron. It is also suggested that the same conductive (2e- + OH-) state is reached by the photoirradiation of H- -containing C12A7. In this case the photoionization of H- forms an electron and an Ho atom, which then forms an OH- ion and another electron with thermal assistance. The persistence of photoinduced conductivity is explained by the slow kinetics of the reverse process at room temperature.",

The governing fluid dynamic equations were derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid and linked to a simple model of the vessel wall. A closed form of the hyperbolic partial differential equations was found, including a significant source term from the gravitational forces. The inclination of the vessel is modelled using a slope parameter that varied between -1 and 1. The wave speed was shown to be related to the wall thickness, and the time to first shock formation was shown to be directly proportional to this thickness. Two non-dimensional parameters were derived for the ratio of gravitational forces to viscous and momentum forces, respectively, and their values were calculated for the different types of vessel found in the human vasculature, showing that gravitational forces were significant in comparison with either viscous or momentum forces for every type of vessel. The steady-state solution of the governing equations showed that gravitational forces cause an increase in area of approximately 5% per metre per unit slope. Numerical simulations of the flow field in the aorta showed that a positive slope causes a velocity pulse to change in amplitude approximately linearly with distance: -4% per metre and +5% per metre for vessels inclined vertically upwards and downwards, respectively, in comparison with only +0.5% for a horizontal vessel. These simulations also showed that the change relative to the zero slope condition in the maximum rate of change of area with distance, which was taken to be a measure of the rate of shock formation, is proportional to both the slope and the wall thickness-to-inner radius ratio, with a constant of proportionality of 1.2. At a ratio of 0.25, typical of that found in human arteries, the distance to shock formation is thus decreased and increased by 30% for vessels inclined vertically downwards and upwards, respectively. Gravity and wall thickness thus have a significant impact on a number of aspects of the fluid and wall behaviour, despite conventionally being neglected.",

The rate of electron transfer in the re-reduction of photooxidized reaction-center bacteriochlorophyll was used as Je. deltamue was determined from the intensity of the delayed fluorescence from bacteriochlorophyll. deltamue is composed of the redox potential difference and the electrical potential difference between two electron transfer components.

The value of (1--q2) Lee increased with increasing pH in the neutral pH range. Uncouplers and ionophores that dissipate delta-approximately muH+ increased Je and decreased deltamue.

Given the contemporary challenges associated with energy conversion, pollution abatement, and the development of high-performance sensors, a greater understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the practical efficiency of PCETs is a timely research topic. In contrast to hydrogen-atom transfers, proton and electron transfers involve different centers in PCET reactions. The reaction may go through an electron- or proton-transfer intermediate, giving rise to the electron-proton transfer (EPT) and the proton-electron transfer (PET) pathways. When the proton and electron transfers are concerted (the CPET pathway), the high-energy intermediates of the stepwise pathways are bypassed, although this thermodynamic benefit may have a kinetic cost. The primary task of kinetics-based mechanism analysis is therefore to distinguish the three pathways, quantifying the factors that govern the competition between them, which requires modeling of CPET reactivity. CPET models of varying sophistication have appeared, but the large number of parameters involved and the uncertainty of the quantum chemical calculations they may have to resort to make experimental confrontation and inspiration a necessary component of model testing and refinement. Electrochemical PCETs are worthy of particular attention, if only because most applications in which PCET mechanisms are operative involve collection or injection of electricity through electrodes. More fundamentally, changing the electrode potential is an easy and continuous means of varying the driving force of the reaction, whereas the current flowing through the electrode is a straightforward measure of its rate. Consequently, the current-potential response in nondestructive techniques (such as cyclic voltammetry) can be read as an activation-driving force relationship, provided the contribution of diffusion has been taken into account. Intrinsic properties (properties at zero driving force) are consequently a natural outcome of the electrochemical approach. In this Account, we begin by examining the modeling of CPET reactions and then describe illustrating experimental examples inspired by two biological systems, photosystem II and superoxide dismutase. One series of studies examined the oxidation of phenols with, as proton acceptor, either an attached nitrogen base or water (in water as solvent). Another addressed interconversion of aquo-hydroxo-oxo couples of transition metal complexes, using osmium complexes as prototypes. Finally, the reduction of superoxide ion, which is closely related to its dismutation, allowed the observation and rationalization of the remarkable properties of water as a proton donor. Water is also an exceptional proton acceptor in the oxidation of phenols, requiring very small reorganization energies, both in the electrochemical and homogeneous cases. These varied examples reveal general features of PCET reactions that may serve as guidelines for future studies, suggesting that research emphasis might be profitably directed toward new biological systems on the one hand and on the role of hydrogen bonding and hydrogen-bonded environments (such as water or proteins) on the other.",

In the future, planned (space-based) observatories operating in the millihertz band will detect the intricate gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of compact objects into massive black holes residing in galactic centers. Such inspiral events are extremely effective probes of black-hole geometries, offering unparalleled precision tests of general relativity in its most extreme regime. This prospect has in the past two decades motivated a programme to obtain an accurate theoretical model of the strong-field radiative dynamics in a two-body system with a small mass ratio. The problem naturally lends itself to a perturbative treatment based on a systematic expansion of the field equations in the small mass ratio. At leading order one has a pointlike particle moving in a geodesic orbit around the large black hole. At subsequent orders, interaction of the particle with its own gravitational perturbation gives rise to an effective 'self-force', which drives the radiative evolution of the orbit, and whose effects can be accounted for order by order in the mass ratio. This review surveys the theory of gravitational self-force in curved spacetime and its application to the astrophysical inspiral problem. We first lay the relevant formal foundation, describing the rigorous derivation of the equation of self-forced motion using matched asymptotic expansions and other ideas. We then review the progress that has been achieved in numerically calculating the self-force and its physical effects in astrophysically realistic inspiral scenarios. We highlight the way in which, nowadays, self-force calculations make a fruitful contact with other approaches to the two-body problem and help inform an accurate universal model of binary black hole inspirals, valid across all mass ratios.

Comparison of the intrinsic kinetic characteristics (obtained at zero driving force of the CPET reaction) shows that consistency is indeed observed after a careful identification and quantitation of side factors (electrical work terms, image force effects). Water (in water) appears as a better intrinsic proton acceptor than hydrogen phosphate in both cases in terms of reorganization energy and pre-exponential factor, corroborating the mechanism by which electron transfer is concerted with Grotthus-type proton translocation in water. Detailed compared analysis of the approaches also revealed that modest but significant electric field effects may be at work in the electrochemical case. Comparison with phenoxide ion oxidation, taken as a reference outer-sphere electron transfer, points to a CPET precursor complex that possesses a precise spatial structure allowing the formation of one or several H-bonds as required by the occurrence of the CPET reaction, thus decreasing considerably the number of efficient collisions compared with those undergone by structureless spherical reactants.",

The resulting proton motive force that is generated is used to drive the conformational rotation of the transmembrane thylakoid ATPase enzyme which converts ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and Pi (inorganic phosphate) into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of the plant cell required for carbon fixation and other metabolic processes. According to Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis, the proton motive force can be parsed into the transmembrane proton gradient (ΔpH) and the electric field gradient (Δψ), which are thermodynamically equivalent. In chloroplasts, the proton motive force has been suggested to be split almost equally between Δψ and ΔpH (Kramer et al., Photosynth Res 60:151-163, 1999). One of the central pieces of evidence for this theory is the existence of a steady-state electrochromic shift (ECS) absorption signal detected ~515 nm in plant leaves during illumination. The interpretation of this signal is complicated, however, by a heavily overlapping absorption change ~535 nm associated with the formation of photoprotective energy dissipation (qE) during illumination. In this study, we present new evidence that dissects the overlapping contributions of the ECS and qE-related absorption changes in wild-type Arabidopsis leaves using specific inhibitors of the ΔpH (nigericin) and Δψ (valinomycin) and separately using leaves of the Arabidopsis lut2npq1 mutant that lacks qE. In both cases, our data show that no steady-state ECS signal persists in the light longer than ~60 s. The consequences of our observations for the suggesting parsing of steady-state thylakoid proton motive force between (ΔpH) and the electric field gradient (Δψ) are discussed. ",

Both in the ground triplet and the lowest singlet electronic states of C2H2(2+) the proton migration barrier is shown to remain high, in the range of 50 kcal/mol. On the other hand, the barrier in the excited 2 3A\" and 1 3A' states decreases to about 15 and 34 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that the ultrafast proton migration is possible in these states, especially, in 2 3A\", even at relatively low available vibrational energies.

In the lowest singlet state, C2H+(2A1)+C+(2P) are the major dissociation products at low available energies when the other channels are closed, whereas at Eint&gt;5 eV, the CCH+(1A')+H+ products have the largest branching ratio, up to 70% and higher, that of CH+(1Sigma+)+CH+(1Sigma+) is in the range of 25%-27%, and the yield of C2H++C+ is only 2%-3%.

This free boundary problem which is comprised of the surface Bernoulli equation for the transient drop shape and the Laplace equation for the velocity potential inside the drop and the electrostatic potential outside the drop is solved by a method of lines incorporating the finite element method for spatial discretization. The finite element algorithm employed relies on judicious use of remeshing and element addition to a two-region adaptive mesh to accommodate large domain deformations, and allows the computations to proceed until the thickness of the neck connecting an about to form drop to the rest of the liquid in the capillary is less than 0.1% of the capillary radius. The accuracy of the computations is demonstrated by showing that in the absence of an electric field predictions made with the new algorithm are in excellent agreement with boundary integral calculations (Schulkes, R. M. S. M. J. Fluid Mech. 278, 83 (1994)) and experimental measurements on water drops (Zhang, X., and Basaran, O. A. Phys. Fluids 7(6), 1184 (1995)). In the presence of an electric field, the algorithm predicts that as the strength of the applied field increases, the mode of drop formation changes from simple dripping to jetting to so-called microdripping, in accordance with experimental observations (Cloupeau, M., and Prunet-Foch, B. J. Aerosol Sci. 25(6), 1021 (1994); Zhang, X., and Basaran, O. A. J. Fluid Mech. 326, 239 (1996)). Computational predictions of the primary drop volume and drop length at breakup are reported over a wide range of values of the ratios of electrical, gravitational, and inertial forces to surface tension force. In contrast to previously mentioned cases where both the flow rate in the tube and the electric field strength are nonzero, situations are also considered in which the flow rate is zero and the dynamics are initiated by impulsively changing the field strength from a certain value to a larger value. When the magnitude of the step change in field strength is small, the results of the new transient calculations accord well with those of an earlier stability analysis (Basaran, O. A., and Scriven, L. E. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 140(1), 10 (1990)) and thereby provide yet another testament to the accuracy of the new algorithm. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.",

Sugar transport studies performed under nonenergized conditions revealed that, even at high protein to phospholipid ratios, not all vesicles contained a D-galactose-specific transporter. The amount of vesicles containing an active carrier proved to be proportional to the amount of plasma membrane protein present in the fusion mixture. By addition of a suitable electron donor system a proton-motive force of -160 mV could be generated, inside alkaline and negative. Moreover, D-galactose accumulation was observed. It was found that D-galactose accumulation was highly dependent on the phospholipid composition of the vesicles, whereas generation of a proton-motive force was not. Best results were obtained with vesicles prepared with Escherichia coli phospholipid, giving a galactose accumulation of 14 times. Uphill transport could be established under conditions where only the pH gradient or the electrical gradient was present. Moreover, kinetic analysis of the galactose transport activity in energized vesicles revealed influx with a Km value of 540 microM, which is in good agreement with the apparent affinity constant obtained with whole cells. These results establish that galactose transport of K. marxianus is a proton-motive force-driven process.

The Coulomb potentials arising from the two charged Lys residues and dipole potentials arising from the two oppositely directed 72 D dipoles of the α-helices act to stabilize the SS bond's σ* orbital. The Coulomb potentials provide stabilization of 1 eV, while the two large dipoles generate an additional 4 eV. Such stabilization allows the SS σ* orbital to attach an electron and thereby generate disulfide bond cleavage products. Although calculations are performed only on SS bond cleavage, discussion of N-C(α) bond cleavage caused by electron attachment to amide π* orbitals is also presented. The magnitudes of the stabilization energies as well as the fact that they arise from Coulomb and dipole potentials are supported by results on a small model system consisting of a H(3)C-SS-CH(3) molecule with positive and negative fractional point charges to its left and right designed to represent (i) two positive charges ca. 32 Å distant (i.e., the two charged Lys sites of the peptide model) and (ii) two 72 D dipoles (i.e., the two α-helices). Earlier workers suggested that internal dipole forces in polypeptides could act to guide incoming free electrons (i.e., in electron capture dissociation (ECD)) toward the positive end of the dipole and thus affect the branching ratios for cleaving various bonds. Those workers argued that, because of the huge mass difference between an anion donor and a free electron, internal dipole forces would have a far smaller influence over the trajectory of a donor (i.e., in electron transfer dissociation (ETD)). The present findings suggest that, in addition to their effects on guiding electron or donor trajectories, dipole potentials (in combination with Coulomb potentials) also alter the energies of SS σ* and amide π* orbitals, which then affects the ability of these orbitals to bind an electron. Thus, both by trajectory-guiding and by orbital energy stabilization, Coulomb and dipole potentials can have significant influences on the branching ratios of ECD and ETC in which disulfide or N-C(α) bonds are cleaved.",

It has become clear that the response of q(E) to linear electron flow, termed \"q(E) sensitivity,\" must be modulated in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Previously, three mechanisms have been proposed to account for q(E) modulation: (i) the sensitivity of q(E) to the lumen pH is altered; (ii) elevated cyclic electron flow around photosystem I increases proton translocation into the lumen; and (iii) lowering the conductivity of the thylakoid ATP synthase to protons (g(H+)) allows formation of a larger steady-state proton motive force (pmf). Kinetic analysis of the electrochromic shift of intrinsic thylakoid pigments, a linear indicator of transthylakoid electric field component, suggests that, when CO(2) alone was lowered from 350 ppm to 50 ppm CO(2), modulation of q(E) sensitivity could be explained solely by changes in conductivity. Lowering both CO(2) (to 50 ppm) and O(2) (to 1%) resulted in an additional increase in q(E) sensitivity that could not be explained by changes in conductivity or cyclic electron flow associated with photosystem I. Evidence is presented for a fourth mechanism, in which changes in q(E) sensitivity result from variable partitioning of proton motive force into the electric field and pH gradient components.

A gravity-induced pressure mismatch at the interface will gradually drive the denser fluid to occupy the lower portion of the microchannel. The rate of this process is expected to depend on the interplay of viscous forces--which tend to dominate at the microscale-and inertial and gravitational forces. A correlation that relates the position of such a liquid-liquid interface to physical variables and channel dimensions was derived. The extent of reorientation of the streams was then related to two dimensionless numbers: Fr, the square root of the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces; and Re/Fr2, the ratio of gravitational to viscous forces. Further analysis showed that the reorientation of the streams depends only on the gravitational and viscous forces, but not inertia. The quantitative description of the position of the interface between liquids of different densities described in this paper aids in the rational design of the rapidly growing number of microchemical systems that utilize multistream laminar flow for performing spatially resolved chemistry and biology inside microfluidic channels.",

In the presence of an externally applied electric field, this gap distance is determined by balancing the van der Waals, electrical double layer interaction, and gravitational forces with a dielectrophoretic (DEP) force. Here, the DEP force was determined analytically by integration of the Maxwell stress over the surface of the particle. The account of this force showed that its previous omission from the analysis always resulted in underpredicted gap distances. Furthermore, the DEP force dominated under conditions of low particle density or high electric field strength and led to much higher gap distances on the order of a few microns. In one particular case, a combination of low particle density and small particle size produced two possible equilibrium gap distances for the particle. However, the particle was unstable in the second equilibrium position when subjected to small perturbations. In general, larger particles had smaller gap sizes. The effects of four other parameters on gap distance were studied, and gap distances were found to increase with lower particle density, higher electric field strength, higher particle and wall zeta potentials, and lower Hamaker constants. Retardation effects on van der Waals attraction were considered.",

The experimental determination of multipole moments is difficult and therefore the theoretical prediction of these quantities is important. Depending on purposes of the investigation several different definitions of multipole moments and multipole-multipole interactions are used in the literature. Because of this variety of methods it is often difficult to use published results and, therefore, even more new definitions appear. The first goal of this review is to give an overview of mathematical definitions of multipole expansion and relations between different formulations. The second aim is to present a general theoretical description of multipolar ordering on periodic two-dimensional lattices. After a historical introduction in the first part of this manuscript the static multipole expansion in cartesian and spherical coordinates as well as existing coordinate transformations are reviewed. On the basis of the presented mathematical description multipole moments of several symmetric charge distributions are summarized. Next, the established numerical approach for the calculation of multipolar ground states, namely Monte Carlo simulations, are reviewed. Special emphasis is put on the review of ground states in multipolar systems consisting of moments of odd or even order. The last section is devoted to the magnetization reversal in dense packed nanomagnetic arrays, where the magnetic multipole-multipole interactions play an important role. Comparison between the theory and recent experimental results is given.",

In eight healthy volunteers, MR images were obtained in the supine and prone positions using a multiple inversion recovery turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence. The variation in SI along the gravity-dependent direction and within isogravitational planes was measured on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Ratios of slopes were calculated for comparisons among volunteers. Comparisons of ratios were made using Fisher's exact test. Isogravitational variability was compared with the mean SI, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the image noise. The average ratios of slopes showed that the overall SI gradient was steeper in the supine than the prone position, with a substantial difference in the supine/prone ratios between inspiration (1.21) and expiration (1.72). In both the supine and prone positions, gravity-dependent gradients were steeper in expiration than in inspiration (P = 0.001). The SI variability along the gravitational direction was larger than the isogravitational variability. The isogravitational variability in turn was larger than the image noise but smaller than the mean SI of the MR images. Gravity-dependent gradients in proton MR SI are steeper in the supine than in the prone position. The magnitudes of these gradients were larger than the isogravitational signal variability, showing that MRI is sensitive to gravitationally induced effects.",

The hypothesis is that the agent of gravitational force is propagated as if it were scattered with a mean free path of approximately 5 kiloparsecs. As a result, the force between moderately distant masses, separated by more than the mean free path, diminishes as the inverse first power of the distance, following diffusion equations, and describes the flat rotation curves of galaxies. The force between masses separated by &lt;1 kiloparsec diminishes as the inverse square of distance. The excess gravitational force (ratio of 1/r:1/r2) increases with the scale of structures from galaxies to clusters of galaxies. However, there is reduced force at great distances because of the approximately 12 billion years that has been available for diffusion to occur. This model with a mean free path of approximately 5 kiloparsecs predicts a maximum excess force of a few hundredfold for objects the size of galactic clusters a few megaparsecs in size. With only a single free parameter, the predicted curve for excess gravitational force vs. size of structures fits reasonably well with observations from those for dwarf galaxies through galactic clusters.

Although the driving force for efficient charge transfer depends on a favorable offset between the electron donor and acceptor, we demonstrate that the efficacy of doping also relies on structural constraints of incorporating a dopant molecule into the semiconducting polymer film. Here, we report the evolution in spectroscopic and electrical properties of a model conjugated polymer upon exposure to two dopant types: one that directly oxidizes the polymeric backbone and one that protonates the polymer backbone. Through vapor phase infiltration, the common charge transfer dopant, F<sub4</sub-TCNQ, forms a charge transfer complex (CTC) with the polymer poly(3-(2'-ethyl)hexylthiophene) (P3EHT), a conjugated polymer with the same backbone as the well-characterized polymer P3HT, resulting in a maximum electrical conductivity of 3 × 10<sup-5</sup S cm<sup-1</sup. We postulate that the branched side chains of P3EHT force F<sub4</sub-TCNQ to reside between the π-faces of the crystallites, resulting in partial charge transfer between the donor and the acceptor. Conversely, protonation of the polymeric backbone using the strong acid, HTFSI, increases the electrical conductivity of P3EHT to a maximum of 4 × 10<sup-3</sup S cm<sup-1</sup, 2 orders of magnitude higher than when a charge transfer dopant is used. The ability for the backbone of P3EHT to be protonated by an acid dopant, but not oxidized directly by F<sub4</sub-TCNQ, suggests that steric hindrance plays a significant role in the degree of charge transfer between dopant and polymer, even when the driving force for charge transfer is sufficient.",

Mechanical pulling of a single spiropyran molecule drives a switch to a more conducting merocyanine state.

It is of considerable interest and import to investigate the stabilization of zwitterionic structures in the gas phase. Infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy is a very powerful and sensitive technique, which may elucidate clearly the structures of both ions and ionic clusters in the gas phase, since it provides IR vibrational fingerprint information. The structures of the clusters of glycine and ammonium ion and of the betaine proton-bound homodimer have been investigated using IRMPD spectroscopy, in combination with electronic structure calculations. The experimental and calculated results indicate that zwitterionic structure of glycine may be effectively stabilized by an ammonium ion. This is the smallest zwitterionic structure of an amino acid to be demonstrated in the gas phase. On the basis of the experimental IRMPD and calculated results, it is very clear that a zwitterionic structure exists in the proton-bound betaine dimer. The proton is bound to one of the carboxylate oxygens of betaine, rather than being equally shared.

The Pt-O distances to the coordinated glycinato donors in 1 are 2.012(7) and 2.000(8) Å, values very similar to those of trans-[Pt(gly)(2)] (gly = glycinate). The Pt-Cl distance of 2.310(3) Å is in the range of 2.27-2.32 Å observed for other Pt(II)-Cl(-) bonds.

The equatorial site for the most effective pi-donor is preferred over the axial position because the unoccupied d(xy)() orbital lies in the equatorial plane, and may be stabilized via a pi-donor ligand in the equatorial position.

The Pt(II)···Pt(II) separation in the neutral complex [{Pt(bzq)(μ-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-κN,S)}(2)] is 2.910 (2) Å, this being among the shortest observed in half-lantern divalent platinum complexes. Within the complex, the benzo[h]quinoline (bzq) groups lie in close proximity with most C···C distances being between 3.3 and 3.7 Å, which is indicative of significant π-π interactions. The reaction of 1 with halogens X(2) (X(2) = Cl(2), Br(2), or I(2)) proceeds with a two-electron oxidation to give the corresponding dihalodiplatinum(III) complexes [{Pt(bzq)(μ-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-κN,S)X}(2)] (X = Cl 2, Br 3, I 4). Their X-ray structures confirm the retention of the half-lantern structure and the coordination mode of the bzq and the bridging ligand μ-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-κN,S. The Pt-Pt distances (Pt-Pt = 2.6420(3) Å 2, 2.6435(4) Å 3, 2.6690(3) Å 4) are shorter than that in 1 because of the Pt-Pt bond formation. Time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies performed on 1 show a formal bond order of 0 between the metal atoms, with the 6p(z) contribution diminishing the antibonding character of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and being responsible for an attractive intermetallic interaction. A shortening of the Pt-Pt distance from 2.959 Å in the ground state S(0) to 2.760 Å in the optimized first excited state (T(1)) is consistent with an increase in the Pt-Pt bond order to 0.5. In agreement with TD-DFT calculations, the intense, structureless, red emission of 1 in the solid state and in solution can be mainly attributed to triplet metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer ((3)MMLCT) [dσ*(Pt-Pt) → π*(bzq)] excited states. The high quantum yields of this emission measured in toluene (44%) and solid state (62%) at room temperature indicate that 1 is a very efficient and stable (3)MMLCT emitter, even in solution. The high luminescence quantum yield of its red emission, added to its neutral character and the thermal stability of 1, make it a potential compound to be incorporated as phosphorescent dopant in multilayer organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs).",

The fitting of Mössbauer and magnetic data with the Ising-like model allowed us to determine the energy gap between the high-spin and low-spin states (Delta(eff) = 835 K) and to estimate the variation of the thermodynamic parameters upon spin transition. The calculated variations of enthalpy (DeltaH = 6.76 kJ mol(-)(1)) and entropy (DeltaS = 49 J mol(-)(1) K(-)(1)) associated with the spin transition are in agreement with those previously observed for iron(II) spin-crossover compounds.

The mixed-valence states at various temperatures were also determined by (57)Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The Mössbauer spectrum of 1 showed a valence-detrapped state at room temperature. With decreasing temperature the spectrum was abruptly transformed into a valence-trapped state around 129 K, well corresponding to the heat-capacity anomaly due to the phase transition (T(trs) = 128.2 K) observed in the calorimetry. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination revealed that 1 has an equilateral structure at 296 and 135 K, and that the structure changes into an isosceles one at 100 K due to the electron trapping. The crystal system of 1 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 20.026(1) Å, c = 12.292(2) Å; at 135 K, a = 19.965(3) Å, c = 12.145(4) Å; and at 100 K, the crystal system changes into triclinic system, space group P&amp;onemacr;, with Z = 2 and a = 12.094(2) Å, b = 12.182(3) Å, c = 12.208(3) Å, alpha = 110.04(2) degrees, beta = 108.71(2) degrees, gamma = 109.59(2) degrees. The X-ray structure determination at 100 K suggests that the electronically trapped phase of 1 at low temperature is an antiferroelectrically ordered phase, because the distorted Fe(3)O molecules, which are expected to possess a nonzero electronic dipole moment, oriented alternatively in the opposite direction with respect to the center of symmetry. On the other hand, no heat-capacity anomaly was observed in 2 between 7 and 300 K, and X-ray structure determination indicated that 2 shows no structure change when the temperature is decreased from 296 K down to 102 K. The crystal system of 2 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 19.999(1) Å, c = 12.259(1) Å; at 102 K, a = 19.915(2) Å, c = 12.061(1) Å. Even at 102 K the CoFe(2)O complex still has a C(3) axis, and the three metal ion sites are crystallographically equivalent because of a static positional disorder of two Fe(III) ions and one Co(II) ion. The activation energy of intramolecular electron transfer of 1 in the high-temperature disordered phase was estimated to be 3.99 kJ mol(-)(1) from the temperature dependence of the Mössbauer spectra with the aid of the spectral simulation including the relaxation effect of intramolecular electron transfer.

An unusual feature of the structures is disorder in the C ring, consistent with a two-site occupancy in which the major conformation has the C46 methyl group in the usual position, \"upwardly\" axial, and the C47 methyl group equatorial, while in the minor conformation both are pseudoequatorial, above and below the corrin ring. (13)C NMR chemical shifts of C46, C47, C12, and C13 suggest that the C ring disorder may persist in solution as a ring flip. Since molecular dynamics simulations fail to reveal any population of the minor conformation, the effect is likely to be electronic rather than steric. The axial bond lengths in 10-Cl-MeCbl are very similar to those in MeCbl (d(Co)(-)(C) = 1.979(7) vs 1.99(2); to 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, d(Co)(-)(NB3) = 2.200(7) vs 2.19(2)), but the bonds to the four equatorial N donors, d(Co)(-)(N(eq)), are on average 0.05 Å shorter. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, d(Co)(-)(C) and d(Co)(-)(NB3) are longer (by 0.10(2) and 0.03(1) Å, respectively) than the bond lengths observed in CNCbl itself, while conversely, the C-N bond length is shorter by 0.06(2) Å, but there is little difference in d(Co)(-)(N(eq)). The Co-O bond length to coordinated water in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is very similar to that found in H(2)OCbl(+) itself, but the d(Co)(-)(NB3) bond is longer (1.967 vs1.925(2) Å), while the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) is very similar. The coordinated water molecule in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is hydrogen bonded to the c side chain carbonyl oxygen, as in H(2)OCbl(+). NMR observations indicate that the H bond between coordinated H(2)O and the c side chain amide persists in solution. The equilibrium constant, K(Co), for coordination of bzm to Co(III) is smaller in 10-Cl-MeCbl and 10-Cl-CNCbl than in their C10-unsubstituted analogs (181 vs 452; 4.57 x 10(3) vs 3.35 x 10(5)), but could not be determined for 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl because hydrolysis of the phosphodiester is competitive with the establishment of the base-off equilibrium. Substitution of H by Cl at C10 causes the bands in the electronic spectrum of 10-Cl-XCbl complexes to move to lower energy, which is consistent with an increase in electron density in the corrin pi-conjugated system. This increased electron density is not due to greater electron donation from the axial ligand as bonds between these and the metal are either longer (not shorter) or unchanged, and it most probably arises from pi-donation to the corrin by Cl at C10. As the donor power of X increases (H(2)O &lt; CN(-) &lt; Me), the corrin ring becomes more flexible to deformation, and the number of bond lengths and bond angles that are significantly different in XCbl and 10-Cl-XCbl increases; importantly, the C10-Cl bond length, d(C10)(-)(Cl), increases as well. Thus, despite the fact that chlorine is an inductively electron withdrawing substituent, its resonance electron donation is the more important effect on electron distribution in the corrin ring. Mulliken charges obtained from semiempirical RHF-SCF MO calculations using the ZINDO/1 model on XCbl and their 10-Cl analogs at the crystal structure geometry are shown to correlate reasonably well with (13)C NMR shifts and may be used to determine the pattern of electron distribution in these complexes. Substitution by Cl at C10 causes an increase in charge density at Co when X = H(2)O and CN(-), while the charge density on the four equatorial N donors remains virtually unchanged, but a decrease when X = Me, while the charge density on the equatorial N donors also decreases. In response, d(Co)(-)(NB3) increases in the first two complexes but the equatorial bond lengths remain virtually unchanged, while d(Co)(-)(NB3) remains unchanged and the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) decreases in 10-Cl-MeCbl. Furthermore, the partial charge on chlorine increases as the donor power of X increases. The small decrease in the pK(a) of coordinated H(2)O in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) compared to H(2)OCbl(+) itself (7.65 vs 8.09) is due to a decreased charge density on oxygen in 10-Cl-OHCbl compared to OHCbl. The picture that emerges, therefore, is of competitive electron donation by X and Cl toward the corrin system. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, the decrease in the C&amp;tbd1;N bond length as Co-C increases compared to CNCbl suggests that dpi-ppi bonding between cobalt and cyanide is important. (13)C and (15)N NMR observations on 10-Cl-(13)C(15)NCbl are consistent with these effects.",

For polymorph A, variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as Mössbauer spectroscopy have revealed the occurrence of a rather gradual HS if LS transition without hysteresis, centered at about 176 K. The same methods have shown that polymorph B is paramagnetic over the temperature range 4.5-295 K, whereas polymorph C exhibits a very abrupt S = 2 if S = 0 transition with a hysteresis. The hysteresis width is 8 K, the transitions being centered at T(c) downward arrow = 112 K for decreasing and T(c) upward arrow = 120 K for increasing temperatures.

The distorted [FeN(6)] octahedron is formed by four nitrogen atoms belonging to DPPA and two provided by the cis thiocyanate groups. The two pyridine rings of DPPA are in fac positions. The main differences between the structures of the three polymorphs are found in their crystal packing. The stabilization of the high-spin ground state of polymorph B is tentatively explained by the presence of two centers of steric strain in the crystal lattice resulting in the elongation of the Fe-N(aromatic) distance. The observed hysteresis in polymorph C seems to be due to the existence of an array of intermolecular contacts in the crystal lattice making the spin transition more cooperative than in polymorph A.",

We have discovered that 4-fold addition of EtOH to [Pt(N&amp;tbd1;CEt)(4)](2+) proceeds smoothly under basic conditions to yield stable, colorless [Pt(NH=C(OEt)Et)(4)](2+)(CF(3)SO(3)(-))(2) (1), which is the firsthomoleptic imino ether complex reported for any metal ion. The monodentate imino ether ligands are all equivalent in solution, according to (1)H NMR, and prove to have the E isomeric form with cis NH/COEt groups. The IR-active C-N stretching vibration moves from 2330 cm(-1) in the nitrile complex to 1633 cm(-1) in 1, and nu(NH) emerges at 3250 cm(-1). The (195)Pt NMR shift for 1 is found to be -2450 ppm, lying between that for [Pt(NCEt)(4)](2+) at -2409 ppm and that for [Pt(NH(3))(4)](2+) at -2580 ppm (all relative to [PtCl(6)](2-)). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction establishes that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c, with a = 9.026(2) Å, b = 14.838 (1) Å, c = 13.946 (1) Å, beta = 106.328(2) degrees, and Z = 2. The metal ion lies at a center of inversion and displays almost ideal square-planar PtN(4) coordination with mean Pt-N distances of 2.016(4) and N-Pt-N angles of 90 +/- 0.6 degrees. Within the two crystallographically independent NH=C(OEt)Et ligands, the mean N=C distance is 1.283 Å and there is structural evidence of partial pi-delocalization of O lone pairs into the NCO moiety. Nonetheless, according to both structural and (195)Pt NMR data, the imino ether ligand behaves as innocent Nsigma donor toward Pt(2+), with a trans influence similar to that of Cl(-). Due to their extended, asymmetric planar nature, such E-NH=C(OR')R ligands have exceptional steric requirements which control the coordination geometry and prevent unhindered rotation. These requirements are dominated by alkyl tail-to-tail (R/R) clashes that can be accommodated only by systematic twisting of the ligands about their respective Pt-N bonds. The present study reveals that 1 has the Pt(HHTT) C(2)(h)() conformation, where H (head up) and T (tail up) represent mutual NH-up and NH-down orientations of the imino ether ligands, with trans-ligand pairs cooperatively rotated by about 20 degrees with respect to the PtN(4) plane. The alternative Pt(HTHT) conformer of 1, with counterrotated trans ligands, is predicted to exist independently, possibly in the chiral D(2) form, in contrast to unfavored Pt(HHHH).",

Tunneling or hopping?\nTwo competing mechanisms are relevant for long-range electron transfer (ET) in biomolecules: direct electron tunneling between donor (D) and acceptor (A), D → A, and multistep hopping D → X → A, where an electron or an electron hole is transiently localized on intermediate sites X. Which of these mechanisms dominates the ET reaction is determined by the arrangement and electronic properties of the redox centers. For thermal ET, it is shown that single-step tunneling is overcome by hopping when the energy gap E between D and X is smaller than the crossover barrier E(C), E(C) = (ΔG/2) + (3/4)k(B)TβR(DA), where ΔG is the driving force, β the decay parameter, and R(DA) the donor-acceptor distance. In proteins at T = 300 K, hopping will dominate when E &lt; E(C) = (ΔG/2) + (R(DA)/50) (E and ΔG are in eV, R(DA) in Å); single-step tunneling will be operative when E &gt; E(C). Thus, one can explore the ET mechanism using three quantities E, ΔG, and R(DA). When ΔG = 0 and E = 0.5 eV (the difference in redox potentials of D and X is 0.5 V), two-step hopping D → X → A will be favored at R(DA) &gt;25 Å. In protein ET chains, the distance between redox cofactors is often smaller than 20 Å, but the gap E between the cofactors and surrounding amino acid residues is larger than 0.5 eV. Therefore, ET in the systems should occur by single-step tunneling D → A. In the activationless regime (ΔG ≈ -λ, λ is the reorganization energy) often observed for photoinduced ET, the crossing point energy is determined by E(C) = (2λkTβR(DA))(1/2) - λ. The suggested expressions for the threshold barrier may be useful to predict the ET mechanism in natural and artificial redox systems.",

Subsequent removal of the free catechol was achieved by the addition of NaOMe. The complexes were shown by X-ray crystallography to exhibit coordinatively unsaturated M degrees centers. These metal dianions which have formally 16e(-) configurations are stabilized by pi-donation from the oxygen atoms of the catecholate ligand. This is evident from the short M-O bond distances, e.g., for M = W, 2.059(6) Å vs 2.151(4) Å for a single bond. The structures of these five-coordinate dianions can be loosely defined as trigonal bipyramidal with the more electron-rich oxygen donor of the catecholate (ortho to the electron-releasing tert-butyl substituent) occupying an equatorial site as indicated by a shorter M-O bond length. The tungsten derivative was shown to reversibly react with CO or phosphines to afford the 18e(-), saturated complexes.

X-ray diffraction data of these complexes indicate that (PPh(4))(2)[Fe(CN)(5)imidazole]·2H(2)O crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with a = 9.8108(15) Å, b = 11.1655(17) Å, c = 23.848(4) Å, α = 87.219(2)°, β = 85.573(2)°, γ = 70.729(2)°, and Z = 2, while its precursor Na(3)[Fe(CN)(5)(en)]·5H(2)O crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/n with a = 8.3607(7) Å, b = 11.1624(9) Å, c = 17.4233(14) Å, β = 90.1293(9)°, and Z = 4. Spectroscopic and magnetic properties of a series of bimetallic materials were obtained by reaction of the complex [Fe(CN)(5)imidazole](2-) with hydrated transition metal ions [M(H(2)O)(n)](2+) (M = Mn, Co, Zn; n = 4 or 6). The new bimetallic materials obtained are [Co(H(2)O)(2)][Fe(CN)(5)imidazole]·2H(2)O (1), [Mn(CH(3)OH)(2)][Fe(CN)(5)imidazole] (2), Zn[Fe(CN)(5)imidazole]·H(2)O (3), and [Mn(bpy)][Fe(CN)(5)imidazole].H(2)O (4). All of the complexes crystallize in the orthorhombic system.

The structures of 1, 2, and 4 consist of two-dimensional network layers containing, as the repeating unit, a cyclic tetramer [M(2)Fe(2)(CN)(4)] (M = Mn, Co). H bonding between the layers in the structure of 1 results in a quasi-three-dimensional network. The structure of 3 was found to be three-dimensional, where all of the cyano ligands are involved in bridging between the metal centers. The bridging character of the cyano is confirmed spectroscopically. The magnetic properties have been investigated for all of the bimetallic systems. Compound 1 shows ferromagnetic behavior with an ordering temperature at 25 K, which is higher than the corresponding Prussian Blue analogue Co(x)[Fe(CN)(6)](y) ·zH(2)O. Compound 2 shows weak ferromagnetic behavior and an interlayer antiferromagnetic character, while 3, as expected, shows paramagnetic character due to the diamagnetic character of Zn(2+). Compound 4 shows antiferromagnetic behavior.",

The samples with x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2 exhibit an infinite-layer crystal structure where all of the apical O atoms have been selectively removed upon reduction. A selected sample (x = 0.2) has been studied by neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Both techniques indicate that Fe and Mn adopt a divalent oxidation state, although Fe(2+) ions are under tensile stress whereas Mn(2+) ions undergo compressive stress in the structure. The unit-cell parameters progressively evolve from a = 3.9932(4) Å and c = 3.4790(4) Å for x = 0 to a = 4.00861(15) Å and c = 3.46769(16) Å for x = 0.2; the cell volume presents an expansion across the series from V = 55.47(1) to 55.722(4) Å(3) for x = 0 and 0.2, respectively, because of the larger effective ionic radius of Mn(2+) versus Fe(2+) in four-fold coordination. Attempts to prepare Mn-rich compositions beyond x = 0.2 were unsuccessful. For SrFe(0.8)Mn(0.2)O(2), the magnetic properties indicate a strong magnetic coupling between Fe(2+) and Mn(2+) magnetic moments, with an antiferromagnetic temperature T(N) above room temperature, between 453 and 523 K, according to temperature-dependent NPD data. The NPD data include Bragg reflections of magnetic origin, accounted for with a propagation vector k = ((1)/(2), (1)/(2), (1)/(2)). A G-type antiferromagnetic structure was modeled with magnetic moments at the Fe/Mn position. The refined ordered magnetic moment at this position is 1.71(3) μ(B)/f.u. at 295 K. This is an extraordinary example where Mn(2+) and Fe(2+) ions are stabilized in a square-planar oxygen coordination within an infinite-layer structure. The layered SrFe(1-x)Mn(x)O(2) oxides are kinetically stable at room temperature, but in air at ~170 °C, they reoxidize and form the perovskites SrFe(1-x)Mn(x)O(3-δ).

The average N-B-N angle is 108(1) degrees. In 2 the eta(2)-tris(alkylpyrazolyl)borate ligand isomerizes by a 1,2-borotropic shift to give one 5-(t)Bupz fragment that is part of the eta(2)-N,N' aluminum-bonded ligand.

At low temperature there are two ethyl signals, one of which indicates diastereotopic methylene protons, as well as three (t)Bu signals in the ratio 1:1:1. The dynamic behavior of 2 is consistent with an eta(2) right harpoon over left harpoon eta(3) exchange process as opposed to an eta(2) right harpoon over left harpoon eta(1) exchange wherein the Al center is transiently three-coordinate.

It is proposed that the rate-determining 1,2-borotropic shift in the 1 --&gt; 2 reaction occurs in a noncoordinating (t)Bupz group and that this is followed by a rapid associative interchange of pz groups wherein the sterically less demanding 5-(t)Bupz moiety remains bound to the metal.",

By carrying out this very reaction in ethanol solution, a nitrogen-retained product [CpIr(CO)(OEt)(NHNAr)][BF(4)] (7) is obtained, containing an aryldiazene ligand. Deprotonation of 7 gives quantitatively the neutral doubly-bent aryldiazenido complex CpIr(CO)(OEt)(N(2)Ar) (8). The IR nu(CO) absorptions measured for the dinuclear compound 6 indicate no bridging carbonyl, but a (13)C NMR study in solution shows that 6 is stereochemically nonrigid at ambient temperature; its three carbonyl ligands are all involved in a fast exchange process, and this process is frozen at -86 degrees C. Exchange of the CO groups via a terminal-bridging-terminal process accompanied by rotation about the Ir-Ir axis is suggested. The molecular structure of 6 in the solid state has been established by single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis and is consistent with the solution spectra. By reaction of [N(2)Ar][BF(4)] with the dinuclear complex [CpIr(CO)](2) (4) in acetone, the complex [{CpIr(CO)}(2)(1-eta(1)-1,2-eta(2)-p-C(6)H(4)OMe)][BF(4)] (9) with a rare sigma,pi-bridging aryl group has been obtained and crystallized. The molecular structure containing an asymmetric bridging aryl group is established for 9 in the solid state by a single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis.

While there is no theoretical basis for such a correlation between solid-state and solution-phase properties, this relationship demonstrates that CrOCr pi-bonding contributes significantly to antiferromagnetic exchange.

The square grids superpose on each other into a channel structure, in which each layer consists of two pairs of shared edges, perfectly square-planar with an M(II) ion and a 4,4'-bpy at each corner and side, respectively. The square cavity has dimensions of 11.669(2) x 11.788(2) and 11.368(2) x 11.488(2) Å for 1 and 2, respectively. Every two guest 2,4'-bpy molecules are clathrated in each hydrophobic host cavity and are further stabilized by pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. The NMR spectra clearly confirm that both 1 and 2 contain 4,4'-bpy and 2,4'-bpy molecules in a 1:1 ratio, which have stacking interaction with each other in the solution. 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Ibam, with a = 11.1283(5) Å, b = 15.5927(8) Å, c = 22.3178(11) Å, Z = 4. 3 is made up of two-dimensional square [Cu(4)(4,4'-bpy)(4)] grids, where the square cavity has dimensions of 11.13 x 11.16 Å. Each [4,4'-H(2)bpy](2+) cation is clathrated in a square cavity and stacks with one pair of opposite edges of the host square cavity in an offset fashion with the face-to-face distance of ca. 3.95 Å. Within each cavity, the [4,4'-H(2)bpy](2+) cation forms twin three-center hydrogen bonds with two pairs of ClO(4)(-) anions. The results suggest that the guest 2,4'-bpy molecules and protonated [4,4'-H(2)bpy](2+) cations present in the reaction systems serve as structure-directing templates in the formation of the crystal structures and exclude self-inclusion of the networks having larger square cavities.",

The emissions were observed from a fast flow system in which tellurium vapor in argon carrier gas was passed through a microwave discharge and mixed with lithium vapor in an observation tube. Two systems of blue-degraded bands were measured at high spectral resolution in the ranges 8000-9000 and 5700-6700 cm(-1) and vibrational and rotational analyses were performed. In order to aid in the analysis of the experimental data, a series of relativistic configuration interaction calculations has been carried out to obtain potential curves for the low-lying states of TeLi and the isovalent TeH and also electric dipole transition moments connecting them. As in the TeH system, the ground state of TeLi is found to be X(2)Pi(i), but with a remarkably smaller spin-orbit splitting. The TeLi calculations indicate a strongly bound A(2)Sigma(+) state, while in TeH the analogous state is computed to lie significantly higher at approximately 32 000 cm(-1), and it is strongly predissociated. Based on the theoretical analysis, the observed TeLi band systems are assigned to the transitions A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(1)(2)Pi(3/2)(X(1)3/2) and A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(2)(2)Pi(1/2)(X(2)1/2).

Comparison of the isovalent TeLi and TeH systems emphasizes that the difference in bonding character (ionic in TeLi vs covalent in TeH) is responsible for qualitative differences in the electronic spectra of these two molecules.

X-ray analysis of 1-3 revealed trigonal bipyramidal geometries and provided evidence for the first series of complexes in the absence of ring strain in which the least electronegative group, ethyl or phenyl, is located in an axial position, in violation of the electronegativity rule. Thus, the two oxygen-containing ring systems occupied two different sets of positions in the trigonal bipyramid (TBP) with the eight-membered rings at diequatorial sites. X-ray analysis of 4 revealed a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with electron-withdrawing chlorine substituents on each ring assumed the more conventional geometry with the rings occupying axial-equatorial positions and the phenyl group located in the remaining equatorial site. The fact that molecular mechanics calculations favorably reproduced the observed geometries suggests that a steric contribution associated with the ring tert-butyl groups for 1-3 is partly responsible in favoring diequatorial ring occupancy for the eight-membered ring.

The structures contain ribbons of the antiferrodistortive sheets which are six copper atoms wide. The central four Cu(II) ions have the usual elongated octahedral coordination, while on each edge are CuX(4)(2)(-) ions which have a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Long Cu.X interactions (4.000 and 4.124 Å for the Cl and Br salts, respectively) between these terminating anions link the ribbons together into sheets. The organic cations provide overall stability to the lattice and link adjacent sheets together, forcing the existence of short two-halide X.X contacts between sheets (average Cl.Cl = 4.629 Å, Br.Br = 4.425 Å). While the changes in the semicoordinate Cu.X distances upon replacement of Cl by Br mirror the change in ionic radius, the X.X distances actually decrease when the larger bromide ion is introduced. This is because these distances are largely dictated by the size of the organic cation. The magnetic data for both salts show the presence of predominant ferromagnetic interactions at high temperature. The Cl salt orders antiferromagnetically at T(c) = 5.7 K, and the susceptibility data can be fit to a S = (1)/(2) Heisenberg model for antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic layers with a mean in-plane exchange constant of J/k = 8.13 K and an interlayer exchange constant of J'/k = 1.22 K. The corresponding values for the Br salt are T(c) = 18.9 K, J/k = 21.3 K, and J'/k = 5.87 K The increase in magnitude of the exchange constants and ordering temperature of the Br salt relative to the Cl salt is consistent with the increase in ionic radius of Br(-) relative to Cl(-).",

Complex 1 inserts CO(2), COS, or CS(2) to rapidly afford the corresponding bicarbonate or thiocarbonate complexes.

In addition, the rate constant for the decarbonylation of 2 was determined to be 7.60 x 10(-)(3) s(-)(1) at 36.0 degrees C, a value which is somewhat faster than anticipated on the basis of analogous data for a large variety of W(CO)(5)O(2)CR(-) derivatives. This is attributed to a diminution of the electron-withdrawing ability of the OH substituent in O(2)COH as a result of hydrogen bonding to solvent. Nevertheless, it is clear that the rate of decarboxylation of the anion from complex 2 is faster than the rate of CO dissociation. Concomitantly, carboxylation of complex 1 is faster than CO dissociation, since the W(CO)(5)OH(-) is inert toward (13)CO exchange on the time scale of carboxylation at -70.2 degrees C.",

The infrared spectrum of (HI)(2) is also observed to be distinctly different from the other members of the series. In addition, the interaction energy of the (HI)(2) dimer has been calculated using the coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level of theory. A four-dimensional morphed intermolecular potential has been generated and then morphed using available near infrared and submillimeter spectroscopic data recorded in supersonic jet expansions. The morphed potential is found to have a single global minimum with a symmetric structure having C(2h) symmetry. The equilibrium dissociation energy is found to be 359 cm(-1) with the geometry in Jacobi coordinates of R(e) = 4.35 Å, θ(1) = 43°, θ(2) = 137°, and φ = 180°. The infrared spectrum is characterized by pairs of excited vibrational states resulting from the coupling of the two HI stretching modes. A qualitative model using a quadratic approximation has been fitted to obtain an estimate of this coupling. Furthermore, a morphed intermolecular potential for the vibrationally excited system was also obtained that gives a quantitative estimate of the shift in the potential due to the excitation. The submillimeter analysis is consistent with a ground state having its highest probability as a paired hydrogen bond configuration with R(0) = 4.56372(1) Å and an average angle θ=cos(-1)(&lt;cos(2) θ&gt;(1/2)) = 46.40(1)° (between the diatom center of mass∕center of mass axis and direction of each component hydrogen iodide molecule).

The SbBr(4)(+) cation is reported for the first time and is only the second example of a tetrahalostibonium(V) cation. The SbCl(4)(+) cation had been previously characterized as the Sb(2)F(11)(-), Sb(2)Cl(2)F(9)(-), and Sb(2)Cl(0.5)F(10.5)(-) salts. Both Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-) salts have been characterized in the solid state by low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Owing to the weakly coordinating nature of the Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-) anion, both salts are readily soluble in SO(2)ClF and have been characterized in solution by (121)Sb, (123)Sb, and (19)F NMR spectroscopy. The tetrahedral environments around the Sb atoms of the cations result in low electric field gradients at the quadrupolar (121)Sb and (123)Sb nuclei and correspondingly long relaxation times, allowing the first solution NMR characterization of a tetrahalocation of the heavy pnicogens. The following crystal structures are reported: SbCl(4)(+)Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-), trigonal system, space group P&amp;thremacr;, a = 10.022(1) Å, c = 18.995(4) Å, V = 1652.3(6) Å(3), D(calc) = 3.652 g cm(-)(3), Z = 2, R(1) = 0.0461; SbBr(4)(+)Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-), trigonal system, space group P&amp;thremacr;, a = 10.206(1) Å, c = 19.297(3) Å, V = 1740.9(5) Å(3), D(calc) = 3.806 g cm(-)(3), Z = 2, R(1) = 0.0425. The crystal structures of both Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-) salts are similar and reveal considerably weaker interactions between anion and cation than in previously known SbCl(4)(+) salts. Both cations are undistorted tetrahedra with bond lengths of 2.221(3) Å for SbCl(4)(+) and 2.385(2) Å for SbBr(4)(+). The Raman spectra are consistent with undistorted SbX(4)(+) tetrahedra and have been assigned under T(d)() point symmetry. Trends within groups 15 and 17 are noted among the general valence force constants of the PI(4)(+), AsF(4)(+), AsBr(4)(+), AsI(4)(+), SbCl(4)(+) and SbBr(4)(+) cations, which have been calculated for the first time, and the previously determined force constants for NF(4)(+), NCl(4)(+), PF(4)(+), PCl(4)(+), PBr(4)(+), and AsCl(4)(+), which have been recalculated for the P and As cations in the present study. The SbCl(4)(+) salt is stable in SO(2)ClF solution, whereas the SbBr(4)(+) salt decomposes slowly in SO(2)ClF at room temperature and rapidly in the presence of Br(-) ion and in CH(3)CN solution at low temperatures. The major products of the decompositions are SbBr(2)(+)Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-), as an adduct with CH(3)CN in CH(3)CN solvent, and Br(2).",

The Pt-N(1) distance (N(1) is the N donor of the hdta(4)(-) ligand) is 2.001(9) Å, only slightly shorter than typical Pt-N distances (2.04-2.09 Å) for sp(3) donors. The Pt-O distances to the coordinated glycinato donors in 1 are 2.012(7) and 2.000(8) Å, values very similar to those of trans-[Pt(gly)(2)] (gly = glycinate). The Pt-Cl distance of 2.310(3) Å is in the range of 2.27-2.32 Å observed for other Pt(II)-Cl(-) bonds.

The average nu(CO) frequencies for each tricarbonyl species reported are compared to those related dianions previously reported in order to gauge the pi-donor character of the different ligands. The (13)C NMR spectrum for each tricarbonyl derivative consists of a single sharp peak for the three inequivalent carbonyls as a result of a low-energy, fast intramolecular exchange process. Both inter- and intramolecular CO-exchange processes have been probed via variable temperature (13)C NMR. In the case of the 16-electron species the geometry of the metal dianion is that of a distorted trigonal bipyramid consisting of three carbonyl ligands and a five-membered chelate ring bound through the pi-donor atoms at an equatorial and an axial position, with the stronger pi-donor atom in the equatorial site. The equatorial site for the most effective pi-donor is preferred over the axial position because the unoccupied d(xy)() orbital lies in the equatorial plane, and may be stabilized via a pi-donor ligand in the equatorial position. The axial position exhibits a filled/filled repulsion as both orbitals available for pi-bonding are filled.",

The Pt(II)···Pt(II) separation in the neutral complex [{Pt(bzq)(μ-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-κN,S)}(2)] is 2.910 (2) Å, this being among the shortest observed in half-lantern divalent platinum complexes. Within the complex, the benzo[h]quinoline (bzq) groups lie in close proximity with most C···C distances being between 3.3 and 3.7 Å, which is indicative of significant π-π interactions. The reaction of 1 with halogens X(2) (X(2) = Cl(2), Br(2), or I(2)) proceeds with a two-electron oxidation to give the corresponding dihalodiplatinum(III) complexes [{Pt(bzq)(μ-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-κN,S)X}(2)] (X = Cl 2, Br 3, I 4).

The Pt-Pt distances (Pt-Pt = 2.6420(3) Å 2, 2.6435(4) Å 3, 2.6690(3) Å 4) are shorter than that in 1 because of the Pt-Pt bond formation. Time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies performed on 1 show a formal bond order of 0 between the metal atoms, with the 6p(z) contribution diminishing the antibonding character of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and being responsible for an attractive intermetallic interaction. A shortening of the Pt-Pt distance from 2.959 Å in the ground state S(0) to 2.760 Å in the optimized first excited state (T(1)) is consistent with an increase in the Pt-Pt bond order to 0.5. In agreement with TD-DFT calculations, the intense, structureless, red emission of 1 in the solid state and in solution can be mainly attributed to triplet metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer ((3)MMLCT) [dσ*(Pt-Pt) → π*(bzq)] excited states. The high quantum yields of this emission measured in toluene (44%) and solid state (62%) at room temperature indicate that 1 is a very efficient and stable (3)MMLCT emitter, even in solution. The high luminescence quantum yield of its red emission, added to its neutral character and the thermal stability of 1, make it a potential compound to be incorporated as phosphorescent dopant in multilayer organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs).",

The fitting of Mössbauer and magnetic data with the Ising-like model allowed us to determine the energy gap between the high-spin and low-spin states (Delta(eff) = 835 K) and to estimate the variation of the thermodynamic parameters upon spin transition.

Electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy data, particularly the nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI) parameters e(2)qQ and eta of the remote nitrogen (N1H), were analyzed and interpreted according to the model devised by Jiang et al.

The results are the following: (i) C2 substitution of the imidazole ring, next to the remote nitrogen (1, 2) decreases the asymmetry parameter eta to ca. 0.75 compared to 1.00 for Cu(HIm)(4)(ClO(4))(2); this effect of C2 substitution on the symmetry of the electric field gradient at N1H appears similar for both the electron-donating methylene substituents (1) and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group (2). (ii) The electron-donating or -withdrawing properties of the substituent are reflected by the variation of the e(2)qQ parameter, increasing from 1.43 to 1.75 MHz (1) or decreasing to 1.38 MHz (2), and by the nu(+) transition shifting toward higher frequencies from 1.49 to 1.65 MHz (1, 3, 4) or to lower frequencies to 1.29 MHz (2, 5). The use of the eta and nu(+) parameters to assign the Ndelta vs Nepsilon coordination of histidine to the metal and to detect modified histidine in copper-binding proteins is discussed.",

The mixed-valence states at various temperatures were also determined by (57)Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The Mössbauer spectrum of 1 showed a valence-detrapped state at room temperature. With decreasing temperature the spectrum was abruptly transformed into a valence-trapped state around 129 K, well corresponding to the heat-capacity anomaly due to the phase transition (T(trs) = 128.2 K) observed in the calorimetry. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination revealed that 1 has an equilateral structure at 296 and 135 K, and that the structure changes into an isosceles one at 100 K due to the electron trapping. The crystal system of 1 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 20.026(1) Å, c = 12.292(2) Å; at 135 K, a = 19.965(3) Å, c = 12.145(4) Å; and at 100 K, the crystal system changes into triclinic system, space group P&amp;onemacr;, with Z = 2 and a = 12.094(2) Å, b = 12.182(3) Å, c = 12.208(3) Å, alpha = 110.04(2) degrees, beta = 108.71(2) degrees, gamma = 109.59(2) degrees. The X-ray structure determination at 100 K suggests that the electronically trapped phase of 1 at low temperature is an antiferroelectrically ordered phase, because the distorted Fe(3)O molecules, which are expected to possess a nonzero electronic dipole moment, oriented alternatively in the opposite direction with respect to the center of symmetry. On the other hand, no heat-capacity anomaly was observed in 2 between 7 and 300 K, and X-ray structure determination indicated that 2 shows no structure change when the temperature is decreased from 296 K down to 102 K. The crystal system of 2 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 19.999(1) Å, c = 12.259(1) Å; at 102 K, a = 19.915(2) Å, c = 12.061(1) Å. Even at 102 K the CoFe(2)O complex still has a C(3) axis, and the three metal ion sites are crystallographically equivalent because of a static positional disorder of two Fe(III) ions and one Co(II) ion. The activation energy of intramolecular electron transfer of 1 in the high-temperature disordered phase was estimated to be 3.99 kJ mol(-)(1) from the temperature dependence of the Mössbauer spectra with the aid of the spectral simulation including the relaxation effect of intramolecular electron transfer.

An unusual feature of the structures is disorder in the C ring, consistent with a two-site occupancy in which the major conformation has the C46 methyl group in the usual position, \"upwardly\" axial, and the C47 methyl group equatorial, while in the minor conformation both are pseudoequatorial, above and below the corrin ring. (13)C NMR chemical shifts of C46, C47, C12, and C13 suggest that the C ring disorder may persist in solution as a ring flip. Since molecular dynamics simulations fail to reveal any population of the minor conformation, the effect is likely to be electronic rather than steric. The axial bond lengths in 10-Cl-MeCbl are very similar to those in MeCbl (d(Co)(-)(C) = 1.979(7) vs 1.99(2); to 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, d(Co)(-)(NB3) = 2.200(7) vs 2.19(2)), but the bonds to the four equatorial N donors, d(Co)(-)(N(eq)), are on average 0.05 Å shorter. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, d(Co)(-)(C) and d(Co)(-)(NB3) are longer (by 0.10(2) and 0.03(1) Å, respectively) than the bond lengths observed in CNCbl itself, while conversely, the C-N bond length is shorter by 0.06(2) Å, but there is little difference in d(Co)(-)(N(eq)). The Co-O bond length to coordinated water in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is very similar to that found in H(2)OCbl(+) itself, but the d(Co)(-)(NB3) bond is longer (1.967 vs1.925(2) Å), while the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) is very similar. The coordinated water molecule in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is hydrogen bonded to the c side chain carbonyl oxygen, as in H(2)OCbl(+). NMR observations indicate that the H bond between coordinated H(2)O and the c side chain amide persists in solution. The equilibrium constant, K(Co), for coordination of bzm to Co(III) is smaller in 10-Cl-MeCbl and 10-Cl-CNCbl than in their C10-unsubstituted analogs (181 vs 452; 4.57 x 10(3) vs 3.35 x 10(5)), but could not be determined for 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl because hydrolysis of the phosphodiester is competitive with the establishment of the base-off equilibrium. Substitution of H by Cl at C10 causes the bands in the electronic spectrum of 10-Cl-XCbl complexes to move to lower energy, which is consistent with an increase in electron density in the corrin pi-conjugated system. This increased electron density is not due to greater electron donation from the axial ligand as bonds between these and the metal are either longer (not shorter) or unchanged, and it most probably arises from pi-donation to the corrin by Cl at C10. As the donor power of X increases (H(2)O &lt; CN(-) &lt; Me), the corrin ring becomes more flexible to deformation, and the number of bond lengths and bond angles that are significantly different in XCbl and 10-Cl-XCbl increases; importantly, the C10-Cl bond length, d(C10)(-)(Cl), increases as well. Thus, despite the fact that chlorine is an inductively electron withdrawing substituent, its resonance electron donation is the more important effect on electron distribution in the corrin ring. Mulliken charges obtained from semiempirical RHF-SCF MO calculations using the ZINDO/1 model on XCbl and their 10-Cl analogs at the crystal structure geometry are shown to correlate reasonably well with (13)C NMR shifts and may be used to determine the pattern of electron distribution in these complexes. Substitution by Cl at C10 causes an increase in charge density at Co when X = H(2)O and CN(-), while the charge density on the four equatorial N donors remains virtually unchanged, but a decrease when X = Me, while the charge density on the equatorial N donors also decreases. In response, d(Co)(-)(NB3) increases in the first two complexes but the equatorial bond lengths remain virtually unchanged, while d(Co)(-)(NB3) remains unchanged and the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) decreases in 10-Cl-MeCbl. Furthermore, the partial charge on chlorine increases as the donor power of X increases. The small decrease in the pK(a) of coordinated H(2)O in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) compared to H(2)OCbl(+) itself (7.65 vs 8.09) is due to a decreased charge density on oxygen in 10-Cl-OHCbl compared to OHCbl. The picture that emerges, therefore, is of competitive electron donation by X and Cl toward the corrin system. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, the decrease in the C&amp;tbd1;N bond length as Co-C increases compared to CNCbl suggests that dpi-ppi bonding between cobalt and cyanide is important. (13)C and (15)N NMR observations on 10-Cl-(13)C(15)NCbl are consistent with these effects.",

The two nitrosyl units are equivalent with an average Fe-N-O angle of 167.4 +/- 0.8 degrees.

These data are comparable to those for other {FeNO}(7) systems. An S = (3)/(2) spin state was assigned from magnetic susceptibility studies to the two individual {FeNO} centers, each of which has a nitrosyl ligand antiferromagnetically coupled to iron. A least-squares fit of the chi vs temperature plots to a theoretical model yielded an exchange coupling constant J of -23 cm(-)(1), where H = -2JS(1).S(2), indicating that the two S = (3)/(2) centers are antiferromagnetically coupled to one another. An extended Hückel calculation on a model complex, [Fe(2)(NO)(2)(NH(3))(6)(O(2)CH)(OH)](2+), revealed that the magnitudes of Fe-N-O angles are dictated by pi-bonding interactions between the Fe d(xz)() and NO pi orbitals.",

For polymorph A, variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as Mössbauer spectroscopy have revealed the occurrence of a rather gradual HS if LS transition without hysteresis, centered at about 176 K. The same methods have shown that polymorph B is paramagnetic over the temperature range 4.5-295 K, whereas polymorph C exhibits a very abrupt S = 2 if S = 0 transition with a hysteresis.

The main differences between the structures of the three polymorphs are found in their crystal packing. The stabilization of the high-spin ground state of polymorph B is tentatively explained by the presence of two centers of steric strain in the crystal lattice resulting in the elongation of the Fe-N(aromatic) distance. The observed hysteresis in polymorph C seems to be due to the existence of an array of intermolecular contacts in the crystal lattice making the spin transition more cooperative than in polymorph A.",

We have discovered that 4-fold addition of EtOH to [Pt(N&amp;tbd1;CEt)(4)](2+) proceeds smoothly under basic conditions to yield stable, colorless [Pt(NH=C(OEt)Et)(4)](2+)(CF(3)SO(3)(-))(2) (1), which is the firsthomoleptic imino ether complex reported for any metal ion. The monodentate imino ether ligands are all equivalent in solution, according to (1)H NMR, and prove to have the E isomeric form with cis NH/COEt groups. The IR-active C-N stretching vibration moves from 2330 cm(-1) in the nitrile complex to 1633 cm(-1) in 1, and nu(NH) emerges at 3250 cm(-1). The (195)Pt NMR shift for 1 is found to be -2450 ppm, lying between that for [Pt(NCEt)(4)](2+) at -2409 ppm and that for [Pt(NH(3))(4)](2+) at -2580 ppm (all relative to [PtCl(6)](2-)). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction establishes that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c, with a = 9.026(2) Å, b = 14.838 (1) Å, c = 13.946 (1) Å, beta = 106.328(2) degrees, and Z = 2. The metal ion lies at a center of inversion and displays almost ideal square-planar PtN(4) coordination with mean Pt-N distances of 2.016(4) and N-Pt-N angles of 90 +/- 0.6 degrees. Within the two crystallographically independent NH=C(OEt)Et ligands, the mean N=C distance is 1.283 Å and there is structural evidence of partial pi-delocalization of O lone pairs into the NCO moiety. Nonetheless, according to both structural and (195)Pt NMR data, the imino ether ligand behaves as innocent Nsigma donor toward Pt(2+), with a trans influence similar to that of Cl(-). Due to their extended, asymmetric planar nature, such E-NH=C(OR')R ligands have exceptional steric requirements which control the coordination geometry and prevent unhindered rotation. These requirements are dominated by alkyl tail-to-tail (R/R) clashes that can be accommodated only by systematic twisting of the ligands about their respective Pt-N bonds. The present study reveals that 1 has the Pt(HHTT) C(2)(h)() conformation, where H (head up) and T (tail up) represent mutual NH-up and NH-down orientations of the imino ether ligands, with trans-ligand pairs cooperatively rotated by about 20 degrees with respect to the PtN(4) plane. The alternative Pt(HTHT) conformer of 1, with counterrotated trans ligands, is predicted to exist independently, possibly in the chiral D(2) form, in contrast to unfavored Pt(HHHH).",

Which of these mechanisms dominates the ET reaction is determined by the arrangement and electronic properties of the redox centers. For thermal ET, it is shown that single-step tunneling is overcome by hopping when the energy gap E between D and X is smaller than the crossover barrier E(C), E(C) = (ΔG/2) + (3/4)k(B)TβR(DA), where ΔG is the driving force, β the decay parameter, and R(DA) the donor-acceptor distance. In proteins at T = 300 K, hopping will dominate when E &lt; E(C) = (ΔG/2) + (R(DA)/50) (E and ΔG are in eV, R(DA) in Å); single-step tunneling will be operative when E &gt; E(C). Thus, one can explore the ET mechanism using three quantities E, ΔG, and R(DA). When ΔG = 0 and E = 0.5 eV (the difference in redox potentials of D and X is 0.5 V), two-step hopping D → X → A will be favored at R(DA) &gt;25 Å. In protein ET chains, the distance between redox cofactors is often smaller than 20 Å, but the gap E between the cofactors and surrounding amino acid residues is larger than 0.5 eV. Therefore, ET in the systems should occur by single-step tunneling D → A. In the activationless regime (ΔG ≈ -λ, λ is the reorganization energy) often observed for photoinduced ET, the crossing point energy is determined by E(C) = (2λkTβR(DA))(1/2) - λ. The suggested expressions for the threshold barrier may be useful to predict the ET mechanism in natural and artificial redox systems.",

Subsequent removal of the free catechol was achieved by the addition of NaOMe. The complexes were shown by X-ray crystallography to exhibit coordinatively unsaturated M degrees centers. These metal dianions which have formally 16e(-) configurations are stabilized by pi-donation from the oxygen atoms of the catecholate ligand. This is evident from the short M-O bond distances, e.g., for M = W, 2.059(6) Å vs 2.151(4) Å for a single bond. The structures of these five-coordinate dianions can be loosely defined as trigonal bipyramidal with the more electron-rich oxygen donor of the catecholate (ortho to the electron-releasing tert-butyl substituent) occupying an equatorial site as indicated by a shorter M-O bond length. The tungsten derivative was shown to reversibly react with CO or phosphines to afford the 18e(-), saturated complexes. Although the molybdenum tricarbonyl derivative reacts with CO to partially provide the tetracarbonyl complex, the analogous process involving chromium did not occur. That is, the formation of an O--&gt;M pi bond vs an additional M-CO bond is favored for M = chromium.

The samples with x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2 exhibit an infinite-layer crystal structure where all of the apical O atoms have been selectively removed upon reduction. A selected sample (x = 0.2) has been studied by neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Both techniques indicate that Fe and Mn adopt a divalent oxidation state, although Fe(2+) ions are under tensile stress whereas Mn(2+) ions undergo compressive stress in the structure. The unit-cell parameters progressively evolve from a = 3.9932(4) Å and c = 3.4790(4) Å for x = 0 to a = 4.00861(15) Å and c = 3.46769(16) Å for x = 0.2; the cell volume presents an expansion across the series from V = 55.47(1) to 55.722(4) Å(3) for x = 0 and 0.2, respectively, because of the larger effective ionic radius of Mn(2+) versus Fe(2+) in four-fold coordination. Attempts to prepare Mn-rich compositions beyond x = 0.2 were unsuccessful. For SrFe(0.8)Mn(0.2)O(2), the magnetic properties indicate a strong magnetic coupling between Fe(2+) and Mn(2+) magnetic moments, with an antiferromagnetic temperature T(N) above room temperature, between 453 and 523 K, according to temperature-dependent NPD data. The NPD data include Bragg reflections of magnetic origin, accounted for with a propagation vector k = ((1)/(2), (1)/(2), (1)/(2)). A G-type antiferromagnetic structure was modeled with magnetic moments at the Fe/Mn position. The refined ordered magnetic moment at this position is 1.71(3) μ(B)/f.u. at 295 K.

Several attempts to prepare oxo, amido-bridged dimers were unsuccessful, but the nearlinear [Cr(tmpa)(N(CN)(2))](2)O(ClO(4))(2).3H(2)O complex was isolated from the reaction of dicyanamide ion with [Cr(tmpa)(OH)](2)(4+). In contrast to the behavior of analogous diiron(III) complexes, antiferromagnetic coupling constants of [Cr(2)(tmpa)(2)(&amp;mgr;-O)(X)](n)()(+) dinuclear species are highly responsive to the X group. Considering the complexes with X = CO(3)(2)(-), PhPO(4)(2)(-), HS(-), SO(4)(2)(-), and RCO(2)(-) (10 R substituents), we find a reasonably linear, empirical relationship between J and oxo bridge basicity, as measured by pK(a) (Cr(OH)Cr) values in aqueous solution. While there is no theoretical basis for such a correlation between solid-state and solution-phase properties, this relationship demonstrates that CrOCr pi-bonding contributes significantly to antiferromagnetic exchange. Thus, J tends to become less negative with increasing &amp;mgr;-O(2)(-) basicity, showing that greater availability of a bridging oxo group lone pair toward the proton, with decreasing CrOCr pi-interaction, reduces the singlet-triplet gap.",

Within each cavity, the [4,4'-H(2)bpy](2+) cation forms twin three-center hydrogen bonds with two pairs of ClO(4)(-) anions.

The emissions were observed from a fast flow system in which tellurium vapor in argon carrier gas was passed through a microwave discharge and mixed with lithium vapor in an observation tube. Two systems of blue-degraded bands were measured at high spectral resolution in the ranges 8000-9000 and 5700-6700 cm(-1) and vibrational and rotational analyses were performed. In order to aid in the analysis of the experimental data, a series of relativistic configuration interaction calculations has been carried out to obtain potential curves for the low-lying states of TeLi and the isovalent TeH and also electric dipole transition moments connecting them. As in the TeH system, the ground state of TeLi is found to be X(2)Pi(i), but with a remarkably smaller spin-orbit splitting. The TeLi calculations indicate a strongly bound A(2)Sigma(+) state, while in TeH the analogous state is computed to lie significantly higher at approximately 32 000 cm(-1), and it is strongly predissociated. Based on the theoretical analysis, the observed TeLi band systems are assigned to the transitions A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(1)(2)Pi(3/2)(X(1)3/2) and A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(2)(2)Pi(1/2)(X(2)1/2).

X-ray analysis of 1-3 revealed trigonal bipyramidal geometries and provided evidence for the first series of complexes in the absence of ring strain in which the least electronegative group, ethyl or phenyl, is located in an axial position, in violation of the electronegativity rule. Thus, the two oxygen-containing ring systems occupied two different sets of positions in the trigonal bipyramid (TBP) with the eight-membered rings at diequatorial sites.

The complexes have low-energy absorption bands that exhibit mild solvatochromism (lambda(max) = 444 nm (epsilon, 2310 M(-)(1) cm(-)(1)) in CH(2)Cl(2) and 406 nm (epsilon, 3170 M(-)(1) cm(-)(1)) in DMSO) and are tentatively assigned to a charge-transfer-to-diimine transition. This transition occurs at higher energy than the analogous charge-transfer transition in related Pt(II) complexes (e.g., Pt(dbbpy)(tdt), lambda(max) = 563 nm (epsilon, 7200 M(-)(1) cm(-)(1)). Whereas neither Au(III) complex is emissive, their respective dichloride precursors, [Au(dbbpy)Cl(2)]PF(6) and Au(eta(2)-C,N-ppy)Cl(2), luminesce in low-temperature glass matrixes from an excited state that is tentatively assigned as intraligand pi-pi. The neutral complex, Au(eta(2)-C,N-ppy)(tdt), is more easily oxidized (E(ox) = 0.925 V vs 1.589 V (vs NHE)) and less easily reduced (E(red) = -1.339 V vs -0.255 V (vs NHE)) than the cationic complex, [Au(dbbpy)(tdt)]PF(6). Both dithiolate complexes exhibit approximately square planar coordination.

The structures contain ribbons of the antiferrodistortive sheets which are six copper atoms wide. The central four Cu(II) ions have the usual elongated octahedral coordination, while on each edge are CuX(4)(2)(-) ions which have a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Long Cu.X interactions (4.000 and 4.124 Å for the Cl and Br salts, respectively) between these terminating anions link the ribbons together into sheets. The organic cations provide overall stability to the lattice and link adjacent sheets together, forcing the existence of short two-halide X.X contacts between sheets (average Cl.Cl = 4.629 Å, Br.Br = 4.425 Å). While the changes in the semicoordinate Cu.X distances upon replacement of Cl by Br mirror the change in ionic radius, the X.X distances actually decrease when the larger bromide ion is introduced. This is because these distances are largely dictated by the size of the organic cation. The magnetic data for both salts show the presence of predominant ferromagnetic interactions at high temperature. The Cl salt orders antiferromagnetically at T(c) = 5.7 K, and the susceptibility data can be fit to a S = (1)/(2) Heisenberg model for antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic layers with a mean in-plane exchange constant of J/k = 8.13 K and an interlayer exchange constant of J'/k = 1.22 K. The corresponding values for the Br salt are T(c) = 18.9 K, J/k = 21.3 K, and J'/k = 5.87 K The increase in magnitude of the exchange constants and ordering temperature of the Br salt relative to the Cl salt is consistent with the increase in ionic radius of Br(-) relative to Cl(-).",

In addition, the rate constant for the decarbonylation of 2 was determined to be 7.60 x 10(-)(3) s(-)(1) at 36.0 degrees C, a value which is somewhat faster than anticipated on the basis of analogous data for a large variety of W(CO)(5)O(2)CR(-) derivatives. This is attributed to a diminution of the electron-withdrawing ability of the OH substituent in O(2)COH as a result of hydrogen bonding to solvent. Nevertheless, it is clear that the rate of decarboxylation of the anion from complex 2 is faster than the rate of CO dissociation. Concomitantly, carboxylation of complex 1 is faster than CO dissociation, since the W(CO)(5)OH(-) is inert toward (13)CO exchange on the time scale of carboxylation at -70.2 degrees C.",

Both Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-) salts have been characterized in the solid state by low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Owing to the weakly coordinating nature of the Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-) anion, both salts are readily soluble in SO(2)ClF and have been characterized in solution by (121)Sb, (123)Sb, and (19)F NMR spectroscopy. The tetrahedral environments around the Sb atoms of the cations result in low electric field gradients at the quadrupolar (121)Sb and (123)Sb nuclei and correspondingly long relaxation times, allowing the first solution NMR characterization of a tetrahalocation of the heavy pnicogens.

The crystal structures of both Sb(OTeF(5))(6)(-) salts are similar and reveal considerably weaker interactions between anion and cation than in previously known SbCl(4)(+) salts. Both cations are undistorted tetrahedra with bond lengths of 2.221(3) Å for SbCl(4)(+) and 2.385(2) Å for SbBr(4)(+). The Raman spectra are consistent with undistorted SbX(4)(+) tetrahedra and have been assigned under T(d)() point symmetry.

Within the set N(n-C(n)()H(2)(n)()(+1))(4)Fe(II)Fe(III)(C(2)O(4))(3) (n = 3-5), T(c) increases with interlayer separation and the low-temperature magnetization changes from positive (n = 3) to negative (n = 4, 5). In the M = Mn(II) compounds, the in-plane cell parameter a(0) is approximately 0.03 Å greater than in the corresponding M = Fe(II) ones while the interlayer separation (c(0)/6) is on average 0.08 Å smaller. All members of the M(II) = Mn series have magnetic susceptibilities showing broad maxima at 55 K characteristic of two-dimensional antiferromagnetism, but the magnetization of several of the salts increases sharply below 27 K due to the onset of spin canting, the magnitude of which varies significantly with A.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.

When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

These highly precise measurements cover the transitions from J = 2 &lt;-- 1 to J = 6 &lt;-- 5 with frequencies ranging from 220 to 661 GHz. For each of the five observed rotational transitions, the narrow linewidths of the saturation dips (about 20 kHz) permitted the resolution of the hyperfine splitting for the first time. This splitting is caused by the (13)C-nuclear spin-rotation interaction yielding a value for the nuclear spin-rotation coupling constant of C(I)((13)C(16)O). If combined with the beam measurements (C(I)((13)C(16)O) = 32.63(10) kHz), a slight J-dependence of the spin-rotation coupling constant can be determined (C(J) = 30 +/- 13 Hz).

This work is the first pure rotational study of this molecule. The radical was created by the reaction of Cl(2) with cobalt vapor. Rotational transitions arising from the Omega=4, 3, and 2 spin-orbit components of Co(35)Cl have been measured, all of which exhibit hyperfine splittings due to the (59)Co nucleus (I=7/2). Transitions arising from the Co(37)Cl species were also recorded, as well as those originating in the v=1, 2, 3, and 4 vibrational states of both isotopomers. The spin-orbit pattern exhibited by the molecule is unusual, with the Omega=3 component significantly shifted relative to the other spin components. In addition, the regular octet hyperfine splittings become distorted above a certain J value for the Omega=3 transitions only. These effects suggest that the molecule is highly perturbed in its ground state, most likely a result of second-order spin-orbit mixing with a nearby isoconfigurational (1)Phi(3) state. The complete data set for Co(35)Cl and Co(37)Cl were fit successfully with a case (a) Hamiltonian but required a large negative spin-spin constant of lambda=-7196 GHz and higher order centrifugal distortion corrections to the rotational, spin-orbit, spin-spin, and hyperfine terms. The value of the spin-spin constant suggests that the Omega=3 component is shifted to higher energy and lies near the Omega=2 sublevel. The hyperfine parameters are consistent with a delta(3)pi(3) electron configuration and indicate that CoCl is more covalent than CoF.",

Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy was used to study the J\" = 0 transition frequencies in the ground and several vibrationally excited states. The vibrational excitation of the newly studied isotopologues extend to between υ = 9 and 29 for (28)Si(17)O and (30)Si(16)O, respectively. Data were extended for some previously investigated species up to υ = 51 for the main isotopologue. The high spectral resolution allowed us to resolve the hyperfine structure in (28)Si(17)O caused by the nuclear electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of (17)O for the first time, and to resolve the much smaller nuclear spin-rotation splitting for isotopic species containing (29)Si. These data were combined with previous rotational and rovibrational (infrared) data to determine an improved set of spectroscopic parameters of SiO in one global fit which takes the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation into account. Highly accurate rotational transition frequencies for this important astronomical molecule can now be predicted well into the terahertz region with this parameter set.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009±0.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01± 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

R-branch (J + 1 &lt;-- J) transitions for J = 0, 1 and Q-branch rotational transitions for the v5 = 1 vibrational state have been measured by waveguide Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy in the range 8-26.5 GHz.

In particular, (kl = +1, A+) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -2, A-), (kl = +4, A+) &lt;--&gt; (kl = +1, A-), (kl = +2) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -1), (kl = +3) &lt;--&gt; (kl = 0), (kl = +2) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -3), and (kl = +3) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -3). The various aspects of the regional resonances are discussed in detail.

The data for the v5 = 1 vibrational state have been fitted successfully using two models up to seventh order with delta k = +/-3 interaction parameters constrained (dt constrained to zero, and epsilon to zero or to the ground-state value). On the other hand, reductions with the (delta k = +/-1, deltal = -/+2) interaction parameter q12 fixed to zero failed to reproduce the experimental data since the parameters defining the reduction transformation do not arise in the correct order of magnitude. The ground-state data have been analyzed including parameters up to fourth order constraining either parameters of the delta k = +/-3 interactions to zero (reduction A), or of the delta k = +/-6 interactions to zero (reduction B).

This work presents the parameterization of compounds belonging to these two classes in the Cornell et al. force field through ab initio and semiempirical methods. The new parameters were used in the conformational analysis for TIBO R82913, TIBO R79882, and nevirapine. Various conformational search protocols were tested and the pseudosystematic method SUMM led to the best results. A better understanding of the distribution of conformers was obtained through clustering techniques in the data reduction stages. It was possible to reproduce various experimental data such as the crystallographic structures of the isolated or reverse transcriptase-complexed (RT) molecules. The proton-proton coupling constants (\\documentclass{article}\\pagestyle{empty}\\begin{document}$\\,J^{3}_{\\mathrm{HH}}$\\end{document}) obtained for TIBO through NMR were also reproduced.

With infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, the weak, torsional overtone (v(6) = 2 &lt;-- 0) has been studied leading to the measurement of 382 frequencies between 405 and 440 cm(-1) at a resolution of 0.005 cm(-1). Torsional splittings on the order of 0.03 cm(-1) were observed. With mm-wave methods, a total of 669 rotational transitions between 50 and 360 GHz have been measured at Doppler-limited resolution in the four lowest torsional states v(6) = 0, 1, 2, 3. The experimental uncertainty attained for an isolated line was better than 10 kHz below 150 GHz, and somewhat larger at higher frequencies. For v(6) = 3, torsional splittings as large as 8.7 MHz were observed. The global data set consisted of the current frequency determinations and the 443 measurements with molecular beam, microwave, and mm-wave methods analyzed by I. Ozier, J. Schroderus, S.-X. Wang, G. A. McRae, M. C. L. Gerry, B. Vogelsanger, and A. Bauder [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 190, 324-340 (1998)]. The observation of mm-wave R-branch transitions for v(6) = 1 led to a change in the J-assignment of the forbidden (Deltak = +/-3) transitions reported earlier for this torsional state. A good fit was obtained by varying 24 parameters in a Hamiltonian that represented both the torsional effects and the sextic splittings. In the earlier work, the large reduced barrier height led to high correlations among several of the torsional distortion constants. With the current measurements, many of these correlations are substantially reduced. Improved effective values were determined for the height V(3) of the hindering barrier and the first-order correction V(6) in the Fourier expansion of the potential function. The dipole function which characterizes the transition moment of the torsional overtone (v(6) = 2 &lt;-- 0) can be written as the product of a single effective dipole constant µ(T)(0,eff) and the appropriate off-diagonal matrix element of (1 - cos 3alpha)/2, where alpha is the torsional angle. From an intensity analysis of the infrared spectrum, it has been determined that |µ(T)(0,eff)| = 85.3(62) mD. A novel approach based on a simple regrouping of angular momentum operators is introduced for decoupling the torsional and rotational degrees of freedom. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.",

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz. On the basis of present calculations of fine and hyperfine splittings and QED terms, we find r(p) = 0.84184(67) fm, which differs by 5.0 standard deviations from the CODATA value of 0.8768(69) fm. Our result implies that either the Rydberg constant has to be shifted by -110 kHz/c (4.9 standard deviations), or the calculations of the QED effects in atomic hydrogen or muonic hydrogen atoms are insufficient.",

(ii) Intensities decrease sharply at all energies near the time of closest approach, the decreases being most extended in time at the highest energies, reminiscent of a spacecraft's traversal of Earth's polar regions at low altitudes; simultaneously, several spikes of spectrally soft electrons and protons were seen (power input approximately 5 x 10(-4) ergs cm(-2) s(-1)) suggestive of auroral processes at Neptune. (iii) Composition measurements revealed the presence of H, H(2), and He(4), with relative abundances of 1300:1:0.1, suggesting a Neptunian ionospheric source for the trapped particle population. (iv) Plasma pressures at E &gt;/= 28 keV are maximum at the magnetic equator with beta approximately 0.2, suggestive of a relatively empty magnetosphere, similar to that of Uranus. (v) A potential signature of satellite 1989N1 was seen, both inbound and outbound; other possible signatures of the moons and rings are evident in the data but cannot be positively identified in the absence of an accurate magnetic-field model close to the planet. Other results indude the absence of upstream ion increases or energetic neutrals [particle intensity (j) &lt; 2.8 x 10(-3) cm(-2) s(-1) keV(-1) near 35 keV, at approximately 40 R(N)] implying an upper limit to the volume-averaged atomic H density at R &lt;/= 6 R(N) of &lt;/= 20 cm(-3); and an estimate of the rate of darkening of methane ice at the location of 1989N1 ranging from approximately 10(5) years (1-micrometer depth) to approximately 2 x 10(6) years (10-micrometers depth). Finally, the electron fluxes at the orbit of Triton represent a power input of approximately 10(9) W into its atmosphere, apparently accounting for the observed ultraviolet auroral emission; by contrast, the precipitating electron (&gt;22 keV) input on Neptune is approximately 3 x 10(7) W, surprisingly small when compared to energy input into the atmosphere of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.",

Although such models have to be derived from variational principles, up to now existing models have not been fully variational. In this paper a fully variational theory respecting virial theorem is proposed-all variables are variational except the parameters defining the equilibrium, i.e., the temperature T, the ion density ni and the atomic number Z. The theory is applied to the quasiclassical Thomas-Fermi (TF) atom, the quantum average atom (QAA), and the superconfigurations (SC) in plasmas. Both the self-consistent-field (SCF) equations for the electronic structure and the condition for the mean ionization Z* are found from minimization of a thermodynamic potential. This potential is constructed using the cluster expansion of the plasma free energy from which the zero and the first-order terms are retained. In the zero order the free energy per ion is that of the quantum homogeneous plasma of an unknown free-electron density n0 = Z* ni occupying the volume 1/ni. In the first order, ions submerged in this plasma are considered and local neutrality is assumed. These ions are considered in the infinite space without imposing the neutrality of the Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell. As in the Inferno model, a central cavity of a radius R is introduced, however, the value of R is unknown a priori. The charge density due to noncentral ions is zero inside the cavity and equals en0 outside. The first-order contribution to free energy per ion is the difference between the free energy of the system \"central ion+infinite plasma\" and the free energy of the system \"infinite plasma.\" An important part of the approach is an \"ionization model\" (IM), which is a relation between the mean ionization charge Z* and the first-order structure variables. Both the IM and the local neutrality are respected in the minimization procedure. The correct IM in the TF case is found to be Z-Z*= integral d3 r[n(r)-n0], where n(r) is the first-order electron density. It is shown that in the QAA case the same IM has to be used and that other IMs lead to unphysical solutions. With this IM R becomes in both cases (TF and QAA) equal to the WS radius and the variational calculation leads to SCF equations in an infinite plasma while n0 (or equivalently Z*) is to be found from the condition integral d3r theta(r-R)Vel(r)=0, where theta denotes Heaviside function and Vel(r) is the SCF electrostatic potential. In the SC case results are similar except that averages over all superconfigurations appear. In the TF case the condition for n0 gives the neutrality of the WS sphere and one gets the classical TF ion-in-cell average atom. The situation is different in the QAA and in the SC cases in which the cavity is not neutral and the SCF potential Vel(r) is not zero outside the cavity. Due to the fully variational character of our approach the expression for the thermodynamic pressure in all cases does not require any numerical differentiation and is consistent with the virial theorem.",

The key electronic effects such as topological distribution of the charge density involved in the reaction are presented and discussed. The results are obtained at B3LYP/6-31G(**) level theory. Attention is focused on topological parameters such as electron density, its Laplacian, kinetic energy density, potential energy density, and electronic energy density at the bond critical points (BCP) in all bonds involved in the interaction zone, in the reactants, pi-complex, transition state, and alkoxy product. In addition, the topological atomic properties are determined on the selected atoms in the course of the reaction (average electron population, N(Omega), atomic net charge, q(Omega), atomic energy, E(Omega), atomic volume, v(Omega), and first moment of the atomic charge distribution, M(Omega)) and their changes are analyzed exhaustively. The topological study clearly shows that the ethene interaction with the acid site of the zeolite cluster, T5-OH, in the ethene adsorbed, is dominated by a strong O-H...pi interaction with some degree of covalence. AIM analysis based on DFT calculation for the transition state (TS) shows that the hydrogen atom from the acid site in the zeolitic fragment is connected to the carbon atom by a covalent bond with some contribution of electrostatic interaction and to the oxygen atom by closed shell interaction with some contribution of covalent character. The C-O bond formed in the alkoxy product can be defined as a weaker shared interaction.

This is especially the case for energies representing electron transitions between two separated regions of space or between orbitals of different spatial extents. It will be shown that these limitations can be attributed to the electronic ground state Hessian G(GGA). Specifically, we shall demonstrate that the Hessian G(GGA) can be used to describe changes in energy due to small perturbations of the electron density (Deltarho), but it should not be applied to one-electron excitations involving the density rearrangement (Deltarho) of a full electron charge. This is in contrast to Hartree-Fock theory where G(HF) has a trust region that is accurate for both small perturbations and one-electron excitations. The large trust radius of G(HF) can be traced back to the complete cancellation of Coulomb and exchange terms in Hartree-Fock (HF) theory representing self-interaction (complete self-interaction cancellation, CSIC). On the other hand, it is shown that the small trust radius for G(GGA) can be attributed to the fact that CSIC is assumed for GGA in the derivation of G(GGA) although GGA (and many other approximate DFT schemes) exhibits incomplete self-interaction cancellation (ISIC). It is further shown that one can derive a new matrix G(R-DFT) with the same trust region as G(HF) by taking terms due to ISIC properly into account. Further, with TD-DFT based on G(R-DFT), energies for state-to-state transitions represented by a one-electron excitation (psi(i)--&gt;psi(a)) are approximately calculated as DeltaE(ai). Here DeltaE(ai) is the energy difference between the ground state Kohn-Sham Slater determinant and the energy of a Kohn-Sham Slater determinant where psi(i) has been replaced by psi(a). We make use of the new Hessian in two numerical applications involving charge-transfer excitations. It is concluded that higher than second order response theory (involving ISIC terms) must be used in approximate TD-DFT, in order to describe charge-transfer excitations.",

Coulomb explosion of molecular heteroclusters.\nIn this paper we present a theoretical and computational study of the temporal dynamics and energetics of Coulomb explosion of (CD4)(n) and (CH4)(n) (n=55-4213) molecular heteroclusters in ultraintense (I=10(16)-10(19) W cm(-2)) laser fields, addressing the manifestation of electron dynamics, together with nuclear energetic and kinematic effects on the heterocluster Coulomb instability. The manifestations of the coupling between electron and nuclear dynamics were explored by molecular dynamics simulations for these heteroclusters coupled to Gaussian laser fields (pulse width tau=25 fs), elucidating outer ionization dynamics, nanoplasma screening effects (being significant for I&lt; or =10(17) W cm(-2)), and the attainment of cluster vertical ionization (CVI) (at I=10(17) W cm(-2) for cluster radius R(0)&lt; or =31 A). Nuclear kinematic effects on heterocluster Coulomb explosion are governed by the kinematic parameter eta=q(C)m(A)/q(A)m(C) for (CA(4))(n) clusters (A=H,D), where q(j) and m(j) (j=A,C) are the ionic charges and masses. Nonuniform heterocluster Coulomb explosion (eta &gt;1) manifests an overrun effect of the light ions relative to the heavy ions, exhibiting the expansion of two spatially separated subclusters, with the light ions forming the outer subcluster at the outer edge of the spatial distribution. Important features of the energetics of heterocluster Coulomb explosion originate from energetic triggering effects of the driving of the light ions by the heavy ions (C(4+) for I=10(17)-10(18) W cm(-2) and C(6+) for I=10(19) W cm(-2)), as well as for kinematic effects. Based on the CVI assumption, scaling laws for the cluster size (radius R(0)) dependence of the energetics of uniform Coulomb explosion of heteroclusters (eta=1) were derived, with the size dependence of the average (E(j,av)) and maximal (E(j,M)) ion energies being E(j,av)=aR(0) (2) and E(j,M)=(5a/3)R(0) (2), as well as for the ion energy distributions P(E(j)) proportional to E(j) (1/2); E(j)&lt; or =E(j,M). These results for uniform Coulomb explosion serve as benchmark reference data for the assessment of the effects of nonuniform explosion, where the CVI scaling law for the energetics still holds, with deviations of the a coefficient, which increase with increasing eta. Kinematic effects (for eta&gt;1) result in an isotope effect, predicting the enhancement (by 9%-11%) of E(H,av) for Coulomb explosion of (C(4+)H(4) (+))(eta) (eta=3) relative to E(D,av) for Coulomb explosion of (C(4+)D(4) (+))(eta) (eta=1.5), with the isotope effect being determined by the ratio of the kinematic parameters for the pair of Coulomb exploding clusters. Kinematic effects for nonuniform explosion also result in a narrow isotope dependent energy distribution (of width DeltaE) of the light ions (with DeltaE/E(H,av) approximately 0.3 and DeltaE/E(D,av) approximately 0.4), with the distribution peaking at the high energy edge, in marked contrast with the uniform explosion case. Features of laser-heterocluster interactions were inferred from the analyses of the intensity dependent boundary radii (R(0))(I) and the corresponding average D+ ion energies (E(D,av))(I), which provide a measure for optimization of the cluster size at intensity I for the neutron yield from dd nuclear fusion driven by Coulomb explosion (NFDCE) of these heteroclusters. We infer on the advantage of deuterium containing heteronuclear clusters, e.g., (CD4)(n) in comparison to homonuclear clusters, e.g., (D2)(n/2), for dd NFDCE, where the highly charged heavy ions (e.g., C4+ or C6+) serve as energetic and kinematic triggers driving the D+ ions to a high (10-200 keV) energy domain.",

The sum of point charges (-1) simulates the incident electron. The sphere radius is determined by a critical distance (Rc eM) between the incoming electron (e-) and the target, at which the potential energy of the e(-)-M+q system is equal to that of the electron-captured molecule M+q(-1) in a symmetry-allowed electronic state with the same structure as M(+q). During the hopping procedure, the excess energies of electron association reaction are dispersed in the kinetic energies of M+q(-1) atoms to conserve total energy. The kinetic energies are adjusted by linearly adding atomic momenta in the direction of driving forces induced by the scattering electron. The nuclear dynamics of the resultant M+q(-1) molecule are studied by using a direct ab initio dynamics method on the adiabatic potential energy surface of M+q(-1), or together with extra adiabatic surface(s) of M+q(-1). For the latter case, the \"fewest switches\" surface hopping algorithm of Tully was adapted to deal with the nonadiabaticity in trajectory propagations.

The effect of a hydrogen bond between the alpha-hydroxy and carbonyl C(4)-O(4) groups was determined in perezone derivatives by substituting electron-donor and electron-acceptor groups such as -OMe, -Me, -Br, and -CN and comparing the -OH (APZs) and -OMe (APZms) derivatives. Reduction potentials of these compounds were measured using cyclic voltammetry in anhydrous acetonitrile. The typical behavior of quinones, with or without alpha-phenolic protons, in an aprotic medium was not observed for APZs due to the presence of coupled, self-protonation reactions. The self-protonation process gives rise to an initial wave, corresponding to the irreversible reduction reaction of quinone (HQ) to hydroquinone (HQH(2)), and to a second electron transfer, attributed to the reversible reduction of perezonate (Q(-)) formed during the self-protonation process. This reaction is favored by the acidity of the alpha-OH located at the quinone ring. To control the coupled chemical reaction, we considered both methylation of the -OH group (APZms) and addition of a strong base, tetramethylammonium phenolate (Me(4)N(+)C(6)H(5)O(-)), to completely deprotonate the APZs. Methylation led to recovery of reversible, bi-electronic behavior (Q/Q(*)(-) and Q(*)(-)/Q(2)(-)), indicating the nonacidic properties of the NH group. The addition of a strong base resulted in reduction of perezonate (Q(-)) obtained from the acid-base reaction of APZs with Me(4)N(+)C(6)H(5)O(-) to produce the dianion radical (Q(*)(2)(-)). Although the nitrogen atom interferes with direct conjugation between both rings by binding the quinone with the para-substituted ring, the UV-vis spectra of these compounds showed the existence of intramolecular electronic transfer from the respective aniline to the quinone moiety. (13)C NMR chemical shifts of the quinone atoms provided additional evidence for this electron transfer. These findings were also supported by linear variation in cathodic peak potentials (E(pc)) vs Hammett sigma(p) constants associated with the different electrochemical transformations: Q/Q(*)(-), Q(*)(-)/Q(2)(-) for APZms or HQ/HQH(2) and Q(-)/Q(*)(2)(-) for APZs. The electronic properties of model anilinebenzoquinones were determined at a B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory within the framework of the density functional theory. Our theoretical calculations predicted that all the compounds are floppy molecules with a low rotational C-N barrier, in which the degree of conjugation of the lone nitrogen pair with the quinone system depends on the magnitude of the electronic effect of the substituents of the aniline ring. Natural charges show that C(1) is more positive than C(4) although the LUMO orbital is located at C(4). Hence, if the natural charge distribution in the molecule controls the first electron addition, this should occur at carbon atom C(1). If the process is controlled by the LUMO orbitals, however, electron addition would first occur at C(4). For the APZms series susceptibility of the first reduction wave to the substitution effect (rho(pi) = 147 mV) is lower than that of the second reduction wave (rho(pi) = 156 mV). Thus, the first, one-electron transfer in the quinone system is controlled by the natural charge distribution of the molecule and therefore takes place at C(1).",

Results of all levels of calculations predicted two equivalent minimum energy structures of planar geometry and C(s) symmetry along the A\" surface of the complex, whereas the A' surface is repulsive.

Mulliken atomic charges showed that 65% of the negative charge is localized on the hydrogen bonded end of the superoxide radical and the HF unit becomes considerably polarized in the complex. These results suggest that the hydrogen bond is an incipient ionic bond.

The procedure for the iron substitution, which follows the work of Debus et al. [Debus, R. J., Feher, G., and Okamura, M. Y. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 2276-2287], is described. In Rps. viridisan exchange rate of the iron of approximately 50% +/- 10% is achieved. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy shows that the ZnRCs are fully competent in charge separation and that the charge recombination times are similar to those of native RCs. The g tensor of Q(A)(-)(*) in the ZnRCs is determined by a simulation of the EPR at 34 GHz yielding g(x) = 2.00597 (5), g(y) = 2.00492 (5), and g(z) = 2.00216 (5). Comparison with a menaquinone anion radical (MQ(4)(-)(*)) dissolved in 2-propanol identifies Q(A)(-)(*) as a naphthoquinone and shows that only one tensor component (g(x)) is predominantly changed in the RC. This is attributed to interaction with the protein environment. Electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments at 9 GHz reveal a shift of the spin density distribution of Q(A)(-)(*) in the RC as compared with MQ(4)(-)(*) in alcoholic solution. This is ascribed to an asymmetry of the Q(A) binding site. Furthermore, a hyperfine coupling constant from an exchangeable proton is deduced and assigned to a proton in a hydrogen bond between the quinone oxygen and surrounding amino acid residues. By electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) techniques performed on Q(A)(-)(*) in the ZnRCs, two (14)N nuclear quadrupole tensors are determined that arise from the surrounding amino acids.

Inspection of the X-ray structure of Rps. viridis RCs shows that His(M217) and Ala(M258) are likely candidates for the respective amino acids.

To assess the relative stability of the racemate with respect to the pure enantiomer, the crystal lattice energies, as obtained through DFT fully periodic calculations, are also discussed and compared with the experimental sublimation enthalpies after correction for the proton-transfer energies. In-crystal group charges, evaluated with the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, are found to be transferable between the racemic and the pure enantiomer, at variance with group volumes. Similarly, molecular first and third moments are not strictly transferable and indicate that for the zwitterionic alanine molecule the molecular charge distribution in the DL-crystal is more polarized in the c direction by about 10%. By contrast, quantitative agreement is observed for second and fourth moments. Significant differences arise from (1) the crystal packing of the dipole vectors, which are aligned in an antiparallel fashion in the L-crystal, to be compared with a parallel alignment in the racemate, due the polar space group Pna21 of the latter, (2) the strongly attractive electrostatic energy of a homochiral pair in the L-crystal, which is opposed to the corresponding heterochiral pair in the DL-crystal form. The difference between these Ees values amounts to 135-150 kJ mol(-1). Despite this, the two crystal forms are predicted as equally thermodynamically favored by the theoretical P-B3LYP estimates of the crystal lattice energies.

We used a new code, CELLDOSE, to assess electron dose for isolated spheres with radii varying from 2,500 mum down to 0.05 mum, in which (131)I is homogeneously distributed. All electron emissions of (131)I were considered, including the whole beta(- 131)I spectrum, 108 internal conversion electrons, and 21 Auger electrons. The Monte Carlo track-structure code used follows all electrons down to an energy threshold E(cutoff) = 7.4 eV. Calculated S values were in good agreement with published analytic methods, lying in between reported results for all experimental points. Our S values were also close to other published data using a Monte Carlo code. Contrary to the latter published results, our results show that dose distribution inside spheres is not homogeneous, with the dose at the outmost layer being approximately half that at the center. The fraction of electron energy retained within the spheres decreased with decreasing radius (r): 87.1% for r = 2,500 mum, 8.73% for r = 50 mum, and 1.18% for r = 5 mum. Thus, a radioiodine concentration that delivers a dose of 100 Gy to a micrometastasis of 2,500 mum radius would deliver 10 Gy in a cluster of 50 mum and only 1.4 Gy in an isolated cell. The specific contribution from Auger electrons varied from 0.25% for the largest sphere up to 76.8% for the smallest sphere. The dose to a tumor cell will depend on its position in a metastasis. For the treatment of very small metastases, (131)I may not be the isotope of choice. When trying to kill isolated cells or a small cluster of cells with (131)I, it is important to get the iodine as close as possible to the nucleus to get the enhancement factor from Auger electrons. The Monte Carlo code CELLDOSE can be used to assess the electron map deposit for any isotope.",

In this reaction, the electron is transferred to an outer-sphere oxidant, and the proton is transferred from the oxygen to nitrogen atom. In the present study, this reaction is studied computationally using a version of Hammes-Schiffer's multistate continuum theory where CPET is formulated as a transmission frequency between neutral and cation vibrational-electronic states. The neutral and cation proton vibrational wave functions are computed from one-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the transferring proton in a fixed heavy atom framework. The overlap integrals for these neutral/cation wave functions, considering several initial (i.e., neutral) and final (i.e., cation) vibrational states, are used to evaluate the relative rates of oxidation. The analysis is extended to heavy atom configurations with various proton donor-acceptor (i.e., O-N) distances to assess the importance of heavy atom \"gating\". Such changes in d(ON) dramatically affect the nature of the proton PESs and wave functions. Surprisingly, the most reactive configurations have similar donor-acceptor distances despite the large (~0.2 Å) differences in the optimized structures. These theoretical results qualitatively reproduce the experimental faster reactivity of the reaction of the pyridyl derivative 1 versus the CH(2)-pyridyl 2, but the computed factor of 5 is smaller than the experimental 10(2). The amine derivative is calculated to react similarly to 1, which does not agree with the experiments, likely due to some of the simplifying assumptions made in applying the theory.

The redox potential for Q(A) was calculated to be between -173 and -160 mV, which is close to the lowest measured values that are assumed to refer to nonequilibrated protonation patterns in the redox state Q(A)(-). The redox potential of quinone Q(B) is found to be about 160-220 mV larger for the light-exposed than for the dark-adapted structure. These values of the redox potentials are obtained if Asp-L213 is nearly protonated (probability 0.75-1.0) before and after electron transfer from Q(A) to Q(B), while Glu-L212 is partially protonated (probability 0.6) in the initial state Q(A)(-)Q(B)(0) and fully protonated in the final state Q(A)(0)Q(B)(-). Conversely, if the charge state of the quinones is varied from Q(A)(-)Q(B)(0) to Q(A)(0)Q(B)(-) corresponding to the electron transfer from Q(A) to Q(B), Asp-L213 remains protonated, while Glu-L212 changes its protonation state from 0.15 H(+) to fully protonated. In agreement with results from FTIR spectra, there is proton uptake at Glu-L212 going along with the electron transfer, whereas Asp-L213 does not change its protonation state. However, in our simulations Asp-L213 is considered to be protonated rather than ionized as deduced from FTIR spectra. The calculated redox potential of Q(A) shows little dependence on the charge state of Asp-L213, which is due to a strong coupling with the protonation state of Asp-M17 but increases by 50 mV if Glu-L212 changes from the ionized to the protonated charge state. Both are in agreement with fluorescence measurements observing the decay of SP(+)Q(A)(-) in a wide pH regime. The computed difference in redox potential of Q(B) in the light-exposed and dark-adapted structure was traced back to the hydrogen bond of Q(B) with His-L190 that is lost in the dark-adapted structure and the charge of the non-heme iron atom, which is closer to Q(B) in the light-exposed than in the dark-adapted structure.",

The driving force for electron transfer from the reductant to the NCs was varied systematically by the addition of acid, which lowers the energy of the NC orbitals. In the presence of excess reductant, the number of electrons per NC (⟨ne(-)⟩) reaches a maximum, beyond which the addition of more acid has no effect. This ⟨ne(-)⟩max varies with the NC radius with an r(3) dependence, so the density of electrons (⟨Ne(-)⟩max) is constant over a range of NC sizes. ⟨Ne(-)⟩max = 4.4(1.0) × 10(20) cm(-3) for CoCp*2 and 1.3(0.5) × 10(20) cm(-3) for the weaker reducing agent, CrCp*2. Up until the saturation point, the addition of electrons is linear with respect to protons added. This linearity contrasts with the typical description of hydrogen atom-like states (S, P, etc.) in the conduction band. The 1:1 relationship of ⟨ne(-)⟩ with protons per NC and the dramatic dependence of ⟨Ne(-)⟩max on the nature of the cation (H(+) vs MCp*2(+)) suggest that the protons intercalate into the NCs under these conditions. The differences between the reductants, the volume dependence, calculations of the Fermi level using the redox couple, and a proposed model encompassing these effects are presented.

Mulliken and his \"charge-transfer\" theory, H. Taube and his \"outer/inner-sphere\" mechanisms, R. A. Marcus and his \"two-state non-adiabatic\" theory, and N. S. Hush and his \"intervalence\" theory are each separately woven into the rich panoramic tapestry constituting chemical research into electron-transfer dynamics, and its mechanistic dominance for the past half century and more. In this Account, we illustrate how the simultaneous melding of all four key concepts allows sharp focus on the charge-transfer character of the critical encounter complex to evoke the latent facet of traditional electron-transfer mechanisms. To this end, we exploit the intervalence (electronic) transition that invariably accompanies the diffusive encounter of electron-rich organic donors (D) with electron-poor acceptors (A) as the experimental harbinger of the collision complex, which is then actually isolated and X-ray crystallographically established as loosely bound pi-stacked pairs of various aromatic and olefinic donor/acceptor dyads with uniform interplanar separations of r(DA) = 3.1 +/- 0.2 A. These X-ray structures, together with the spectral measurements of their intervalence transitions, lead to the pair of important electron-transfer parameters, H(DA) (electronic coupling element) versus lambdaT (reorganization energy), the ratio of which generally defines the odd-electron mobility within such an encounter complex in terms of the resonance stabilization of the donor/acceptor assembly [D, A] as opposed to the reorganization-energy penalty required for its interconversion to the electron-transfer state [D(+*), A(-*)]. We recognize the resonance-stabilization energy relative to the intrinsic activation barrier as the mechanistic binding factor, Q = 2H(DA)/lambdaT, to represent the quantitative measure of the highly variable continuum of inner-sphere/outer-sphere interactions that are possible within various types of precursor complexes. First, Q &lt;&lt; 1 identifies one extreme mechanism owing to slow electron-transfer rates that result from the dominance of the intrinsic activation barrier (lambdaT) between the encounter and successor complexes. At the other extreme of Q &gt; or = 1, the overwhelming dominance of the resonance stabilization (H(DA)) predicts the odd-electron mobility between the donor and acceptor to occur without an activation barrier such that bimolecular electron transfer is coincident with their diffusional encounter. In between lies a potentially infinite set of states, 0 &lt; Q &lt; 1 with opposing attractive and destabilizing forces that determine the location of the bound transition states along the reaction coordinate. Three prototypical potential-energy surfaces evolve as a result of progressively increasing the donor/acceptor bindings (H(DA)) extant in the precursor complex (at constant lambdaT). In these cases, the \"outer-sphere\" mechanism is limited by the weak donor/acceptor coupling that characterizes the now classical Marcus outer-sphere mechanism. Next, the \"inner-sphere\" mechanism derives from moderate (localized) donor/acceptor bindings and includes the mechanistic concept of the bridged-activated complex introduced by Taube for a wide variety of ligand-based redox dyads. Finally, the \"interior\" mechanism is also another subclass of the Taube (inner-sphere) classification, and it lies at the other extreme of very fast electron-transfer rate processes (heretofore unrecognized), arising from the spontaneous annihilation of the donor/acceptor dyad to the delocalized (electron-transfer) complex as it descends barrierlessly into the chemical \"black hole\" that is rate-limited solely by diffusion.",

Q(B) accepts electrons from the primary quinone, Q(A), in two sequential electron transfer reactions coupled to uptake of a proton from solution. It has been suggested that water molecules along the proton uptake pathway are protonated upon quinone reduction on the basis of FTIR difference spectra [Breton, J., and Nabedryk, E. (1998) Photosynth. Res. 55, 301-307]. We examined the possible involvement of water molecules in the photoreaction processes by studying (18)O water isotope effects on FTIR difference spectra resulting from formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-). Continuum bands in D(2)O due to Q(B)(-) formation in the 2300-1800 cm(-1) region did not show spectral shifts by (18)O water in the wild-type (WT) RC, suggesting that these bands do not originate from (protonated) water. In contrast, the Q(B)(-)/Q(B) spectrum of the EQ-L212 mutant RC showed a spectral shift of a band near 2100 cm(-1) due to (18)O water substitution, consistent with protonation of internal water. FTIR shifts due to (18)O water were also observed following formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-) in the spectral region of 3700-3500 cm(-1) characteristic of weakly hydrogen bonded water. The water responsible for the Q(B)(-) change was localized near Glu-L212 by spectral shifts in mutant RCs. The weakly hydrogen bonded water perturbed by quinone reduction may play a role in stabilizing the charge-separated state.",

Single atom or molecule multielectron ionization can be adequately described by the semiclassical barrier suppression ionization (BSI) mechanism. Extreme cluster multielectron ionization is distinct from that of a single atomic or molecular species in terms of the mechanisms, the ionization level and the time scales for electron dynamics and for nuclear motion. The novel compound mechanism of cluster multielectron ionization, which applies when the cluster size (radius R(0)) considerably exceeds the barrier distance for the BSI of a single constituent, involves a sequential-parallel, inner-outer ionization. The cluster inner ionization driven by the BSI for the constituents is induced by a composite field consisting of the laser field and inner fields. The energetics and dynamics of the system consisting of high energy (&lt; or =3 keV) electrons and of less, similar 100 keV ions in the laser field was treated by molecular dynamics simulations, which incorporate electron-electron, electron-ion, ion-ion, and charge-laser interactions. High-energy electron dynamics also incorporates relativistic effects and includes magnetic field effects. We treat inner ionization considering inner field ignition, screening and fluctuation contributions as well as small [(&lt; or =13%)] impact ionization contributions. Subsequent to inner ionization a charged nanoplasma is contained within the cluster, whose response to the composite (laser+inner) field results in outer ionization, which can be approximately described by an entire cluster barrier suppression ionization mechanism.",

The effect of air-drying that flattens a spherical nucleus with a radius of r to a discoid nucleus with an expanded radius of R and a thickness of T can be stated as follows: pi R2 = (4/3 pi r3)/T. Based on this formula, a graph was plotted to illustrate the effect of air-drying on the observed nuclear areas (ONA) of cells of various size. The ONA of ethanol-fixed Pap/H&amp;E-stained cells or cells in tissue sections is pi r2; the ONA of air-dried Diff-Quik-stained cells is pi R (2), i.e., (4/3 pi r3)/T. The former follows a first-order straight line, and the latter follows a second-order curve. As a consequence, the subtle \"nuclear size enlargement\" and \"broader nuclear size distribution\" of low-grade cancer cells, detectable only by statistical analysis of the data obtained by an image analyzer in ethanol-fixed cytopreparations or in formaldehyde-fixed tissue sections, become augmented to such a degree on the air-dried Diff-Quik-stained preparations that they are easily detected by direct microscopic observation.

In the solvent-permeable and ion-penetrable porous surface layer of the particle, idealized frictional segments with fixed charges are assumed to distribute at a constant density. The electrokinetic equations that govern the electric potential profile, ionic concentration distributions, and fluid flow field inside and outside the porous layer of the particle are linearized by assuming that the system is only slightly distorted from equilibrium. Using a regular perturbation method, these linearized equations are solved with the fixed charge densities on the rigid core surface and in the porous shell as the small perturbation parameters. An analytical expression for the diffusiophoretic mobility of the soft sphere in closed form is obtained from a balance between its electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces. This expression, which is correct to the second order of the fixed charge densities, is valid for arbitrary values of κa, λa, and r(0)/a, where κ is the reciprocal of the Debye screening length, λ is the reciprocal of the length characterizing the extent of flow penetration inside the porous layer, a is the radius of the soft sphere, and r(0) is the radius of the rigid core of the particle.

These results were analyzed in the framework of vibronic theory and compared to those obtained for the Zundel cation H(5)O(2) (+). All geometry optimizations carried out using wavefunction-based methods [Hartree-Fock, second and fourth order Moller-Plesset theory (MP2 and MP4), and quadratic configuration interaction with singles and doubles excitations (QCISD)] lead to an asymmetrical H(3)N-H(+)cdots, three dots, centeredNH(3) conformation (C(3v) symmetry) with a small energy barrier (1.26 kcalmol in MP4 and QCISD calculations) between both equivalent minima. The value of this barrier is underestimated in DFT calculations particularly at the local density approximation level where geometry optimization leads to a symmetric H(3)Ncdots, three dots, centeredH(+)cdots, three dots, centeredNH(3) structure (D(3d) point group). The instability of the symmetric D(3d) structure is shown to originate from the pseudo-Jahn-Teller mixing of the electronic (1)A(1g) ground state with five low lying excited states of A(2u) symmetry through the asymmetric alpha(2u) vibrational mode. A molecular orbital study of the pseudo-Jahn-Teller coupling has allowed us to discuss the origin of the proton displacement and the LBHB formation in terms of the polarization of the NH(3) molecules and the transfer of electronic charge between the proton and the NH(3) units (rebonding). The parallel study of the H(5)O(2) (+) cation, which presents a symmetric single-well structure, allows us to analyze why these similar molecules behave differently with respect to proton transfer. From the vibronic analysis, a unified view of the Rudle-Pimentel three-center four-electron and charge transfer models of LBHBs is given. Finally, the large difference in the N-N distance in the D(3d) and C(3v) configurations of N(2)H(7) (+) indicates a large anharmonic coupling between alpha(2u)-alpha(1g) modes along the proton-transfer dynamics.

The deuteration of N atoms not only caused a red-shift in the frequencies of the corresponding peaks below 1600 cm(-1), but also produced new vibrational modes of frequencies in the 2565-2595 cm(-1) range caused by the N-D bond stretching. Similarly, the deuteration of O atoms within the sulfonato groups (-SO3(-)) exhibited a new peak at around 2642 cm(-1) due to O-D bond stretching.

This model is based on the approximations that (a) the dominant excited states of a molecule form a band whose width is small compared to the average energy of excitation above the ground state and (b) biaxial orientational correlation between adjacent molecules can be neglected. Previous treatments of quantum chiral interactions have been based on a multipole expansion of the effective interaction energy within second-order perturbation theory. We consider a system consisting of elongated molecules and, although we invoke the expansion in terms of coordinates transverse to the long axis of constituent molecules, we treat the longitudinal coordinate exactly. Such an approximation is plausible for molecules in real liquid crystals. The macroscopic cholesteric wave vector Q (Q=2 pi/P, where P is the pitch) is obtained via Q=h/K(2), where K2 is the Frank elastic constant for twist and h is the torque field which we calculate from the effective chiral interaction kappa(IJ)a(I)xa(J) x R(IJ), where the unit vector a(I) specifies the orientation of molecule I and R(IJ) is the displacement of molecule I relative to molecule J. We identify two distinct physical limits depending on whether one or both of the interacting molecules are excited in the virtual state. When both molecules are excited, we regain the R(-8)(IJ) dependence of kappa(IJ) on intermolecular separation found previously by Van der Meer et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 65, 3935 (1976)]. The two-molecule, unlike the one-molecule term, can be interpreted in terms of a superposition of pairwise interactions between individual atoms (or local chiral centers) on the two molecules. Contributions to kappa(IJ) when one molecule is excited in the virtual state are of order R(-7)(IJ) for helical molecules which are assumed not to have a global dipole moment, but whose atoms possess a dipole moment. It is shown that for a helical molecule Q can have either the same or the opposite sign as the chiral pitch of an individual molecule, depending on the details of the anisotropy of the atomic polarizability. The one-molecule mechanism can become important when the local atomic dipoles become sizable, although biaxial correlations (ignored here) should then be taken into account. Our results suggest how the architecture of molecular dipole moments might be adjusted to significantly influence the macroscopic pitch.",

Actually, the best estimate of fundamental constant values is given by a least-squares adjustment, carried out under the auspices of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) Task Group on Fundamental Constants. This adjustment provides a significant measure of the correctness and overall consistency of the basic theories and experimental methods of physics using the values of the constants obtained from widely differing experiments. The physical theories that underlie this adjustment are assumed to be valid, such as quantum electrodynamics (QED). Testing QED, one of the most precise theories is the aim of many accurate experiments. The calculations and the corresponding experiments can be carried out either on a boundless system, such as the electron magnetic moment anomaly, or on a bound system, such as atomic hydrogen. The value of fundamental constants can be deduced from the comparison of theory and experiment. For example, using QED calculations, the value of the fine structure constant given by the CODATA is mainly inferred from the measurement of the electron magnetic moment anomaly carried out by Gabrielse's group. (Hanneke et al. 2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 120801) The value of the Rydberg constant is known from two-photon spectroscopy of hydrogen combined with accurate theoretical quantities. The Rydberg constant, determined by the comparison of theory and experiment using atomic hydrogen, is known with a relative uncertainty of 6.6×10(-12). It is one of the most accurate fundamental constants to date. A careful analysis shows that knowledge of the electrical size of the proton is nowadays a limitation in this comparison. The aim of muonic hydrogen spectroscopy was to obtain an accurate value of the proton charge radius. However, the value deduced from this experiment contradicts other less accurate determinations. This problem is known as the proton radius puzzle. This new determination of the proton radius may affect the value of the Rydberg constant . This constant is related to many fundamental constants; in particular, links the two possible ways proposed for the redefinition of the kilogram, the Avogadro constant N(A) and the Planck constant h. However, the current relative uncertainty on the experimental determinations of N(A) or h is three orders of magnitude larger than the 'possible' shift of the Rydberg constant, which may be shown by the new value of the size of the proton radius determined from muonic hydrogen. The proton radius puzzle will not interfere in the redefinition of the kilogram. After a short introduction to the properties of the proton, we will describe the muonic hydrogen experiment. There is intense theoretical activity as a result of our observation. A brief summary of possible theoretical explanations at the date of writing of the paper will be given. The contribution of the proton radius puzzle to the redefinition of SI-based units will then be examined.",

The free energy of a pore of a given radius, R, and a given number of peptides, s, is expressed as a sum of the peptides' electrostatic charging energy (calculated using Poisson-Boltzmann theory), and the lipid-perturbation energy associated with the formation of a membrane rim (which we model as being semitoroidal) in the gap between neighboring peptides. A simple phenomenological model is used to calculate the membrane perturbation energy. The balance between the opposing forces (namely, the radial free energy derivatives) associated with the electrostatic free energy that favors large R, and the membrane perturbation term that favors small R, dictates the equilibrium properties of the pore. Systematic calculations are reported for circular pores composed of various numbers of peptides, carrying different amounts of charge (1-6 elementary, positive charges) and characterized by different polar angles. We find that the optimal R's, for all (except, possibly, very weakly) charged peptides conform to the \"toroidal\" pore model, whereby a membrane rim larger than approximately 1 nm intervenes between neighboring peptides. Only weakly charged peptides are likely to form \"barrel-stave\" pores where the peptides essentially touch one another.

We show that such radii, which we denote R(XHe), make good qualitative sense. We also compare our R(XHe) values to more traditional ionic radii from solid crystal X-ray measurements, as well as estimates of such radii from \"ionic\" gas-phase MF, MOM, MF(+), and MO molecules, where M is a metal atom. Such comparisons lead to interesting conclusions about bonding in ionic crystals and in simple gas-phase oxide and fluoride molecules. The definition is shown to be reasonable for -1, +1, and even for many of the larger +2 atomic ions. Another advantage of the R(XHe) definition is that it is also consistently valid for ground states and excited states of both neutral atoms and atomic ions, even for open-shell np and nd cases where the electron clouds of the ions are not spherically symmetric and R(XHe) thus depends on the \"approach\" direction of the He atom. Finally, we note that when there is a contribution from covalent bonding with the He atom, and/or in cases where the ion is small and has a very high charge, so that there is distortion even of the He 1s electrons, R(XHe) is not expected to be representative of the size of the ion. We then suggest that in these cases small, and sometimes unphysical, values of R(XHe) are diagnostic of the fact that simple \"physical\" interactions have been supplemented by a \"chemical\" component.",

We find that even when q = R(g)/R(s) ⪆ 10, then the use of a monopole expansion for the polymer end-point distribution about the spheres is sufficient. For even larger spheres q ≈ 1, accuracy is maintained by including a dipolar correction. The implications of these findings on generating a full many-body effective interaction for a collection of N spheres imbedded in the polymer solution are discussed.",

Within the radius of convergence, the zeroth order yields the energy expansion at all orders, restricting the textbook statement by Wigner that the p-th order wave function derivative is necessary to describe the (2p + 1)-th energy derivative. Without the need for derivatives of the electron density, this allows us to cover entire chemical neighborhoods from just one quantum calculation instead of single systems one by one. Numerical evidence presented indicates that predictive accuracy is achieved in the range of mHa for the harmonic oscillator or the Morse potential and in the range of machine accuracy for hydrogen-like atoms.

Amide hydrogen exchange kinetics have been used to probe the structure and dynamics of M13 coat protein which has been solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles. In a previous 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study [O'Neil, J. D. J., &amp; Sykes, B. D. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2753-2762], multiple exponential analysis of the unresolved amide proton envelope revealed the existence of two slow \"kinetic sets\" containing a total of about 30 protons. The slower set (15-20 amides) originates from the hydrophobic membrane-spanning region and exchanges at least 10(5)-fold slower than the unstructured, non-H-bonded model polypeptide poly(DL-alanine). Herein we use 15N NMR spectroscopy of biosynthetically labeled coat protein to follow individual, assigned, slowly exchanging amides in or near the hydrophobic segment. The INEPT (insensitive nucleus enhancement by polarization transfer) experiment [Morris, G. A., &amp; Freeman, R. (1979) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 101, 760-762] can be used to transfer magnetization to the 15N nucleus from a coupled proton; when 15N-labeled protonated protein is dissolved in 2H2O, the INEPT signal disappears with time as the amide protons are replaced by solvent deuterons. Amide hydrogen exchange is catalyzed by both H+ and OH- ions. Base catalysis is significantly more effective, resulting in a characteristic minimum rate in model peptides at pH approximately equal to 3. Rate versus pH profiles have been obtained by using the INEPT experiment for the amides of leucine-14, leucine-41, tyrosine-21, tyrosine-24, and valines-29, -30, -31, and -33 in M13 coat protein. The valine residues exchange most slowly and at very similar rates, showing an apparent 10(6)-fold retardation over poly(DL-alanine). A substantial basic shift in the pH of the minimum rate (up to 1.5 pH units) was also observed for some residues. Possible reasons for the shift include accumulation of catalytic H+ ions at the negatively charged micelle surface or destabilization of the negatively charged transition state of the base-catalyzed reaction by either charge or hydrophobic effects within the micelle. The time-dependent exchange-out experiment is suitable for slow exchange rates (kex), i.e., less than (1-2) x 10(-4) s-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Effect of charge on the bond properties of hydrogen fluoride.\nWithin the framework of the molecular orbital (MO) theory, the addition of one electron to the 4sigma antibonding orbital of the neutral (F...H) system or the removal of one electron from its pi nonbonding orbitals, leading to (F...H)- and to (F...H)+, has permitted the investigation of these charge perturbations on the bond properties of the hydrogen fluoride molecule by using the topological analysis of rho(r). For (F...H), (F...H)-, and (F...H)+, the topological and energetic properties calculated at the F...H bond critical point (BCP) have been related to the 3sigma bonding molecular orbital (BMO) distribution, as this orbital is the main contributor to rho(r) at the interatomic surface. The analysis has been carried out at several F...H internuclear distances, ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 A. As far as the BMO distribution results from its interaction with the average Coulomb and exchange potential generated by the charge filling the other MOs, and in particular by the pi and 4sigma electrons, the comparison between the BCP properties calculated for the charged systems and those corresponding to the neutral one permits the interpretation of the differences in terms of the charge perturbation on BMO. Along with the BCP properties of (F...H), (F...H)-, and (F...H)+, the interaction energy magnitudes of these systems have been also calculated within the same range of internuclear distances, indicating that the applied perturbations do not break the F-H bond but soften it, giving rise to the stable species (F-H)- and (F-H)+. Comparing the three systems at their equilibrium geometries, the most stable configuration, which corresponds to the unperturbed (F...H) system, shows the highest quantity and the most locally concentrated charge density distribution, along with the largest total electron energy density magnitude, at the interatomic surface as a consequence of the BMO contraction toward the fluorine nucleus in (F...H)+ and of the BMO expansion toward both nuclei in (F...H)-. On the other hand, if the comparison is carried out at the equilibrium distance of (F...H) (d(eq)0), this one exhibits both the smallest total energy density magnitude and the largest quantity of bonding charge at the interatomic surface. Hence, being the signature of the most stable configuration, the characteristic magnitudes of the neutral system rho(d(eq)0), inverted triangle2 rho(d(eq)0), and H(d(eq)0) appear as boundary conditions at the interatomic surface of its unperturbed and relaxed electron distribution.",

The distribution functions for the radius of gyration in all cases have been very precisely calculated, those for the perturbed end-to-end distance less precisely, and those for the unperturbed end-to-end distance least precisely. Empirical distribution functions of the form W(p) = ap-b exp(-cp-d) for the reduced end-to-end distance p = r/\"r-2\"-one-half and a similar form for the reduced radius of gyration could be least-squares fit to the Monte Carlo data. The expansion factors alpha-r and alpha-s were calculated vs. chain length and were used to test various versions of the two-parameter theory of the excluded volume effect. To be consistent with the chain-length dependence of alpha-r and alpha-s as determined by the Monte Carlo calculations, each of these theories required two different binary cluster integrals, a beta-r based on alpha-r and a beta-s based on alpha-s, both of which were strongly chain-length dependent. Both of these results suggest that the two-parameter theory is not applicable to the models used in this study. It was also found that, except for very short chain lengths, plots of ln alphs-r vs. ln n were linear, and thus that alpha-r could be estimated for long chain lengths. Comparison of these estimates with the experimental data on four polypeptide chains in one-earth solvents that the hard-sphere models used in this study yield expansion factors that do not seriously overestimate the magnitude of the excluded volume effect.",

The novel compounds exhibited π-π* absorption wavelengths deep within the visible region, earmarking them for possible use as chromophores in a variety of applications. In this computational study, we determine the factors that cause such low-energy transitions, and describe the electronic structure of these remarkable compounds. DFT calculations of conjugated thiophene-based oligomers with up to five monomer units reveal that the main absorption band of each protonated oligomer is strongly red-shifted compared to the unprotonated form. This effect is counterintuitive, since protonation is expected to diminish aromaticity, and thereby increase the HOMO-LUMO gap. We find that upon protonation the π-electrons remain delocalized over the entire π-conjugated molecule, but the positive charge is localized predominantly on the protonated side of the molecule. A possible explanation for this ground-state charge localization is the participation of the C-H bond in the π-system of the protonated ring, locally providing aromatic stabilization for the positive charge. The addition of the proton stabilizes all electronic orbitals, but due to the ground state π-electron distribution away from the added nucleus, the HOMO is stabilized less than the LUMO. The main absorption peak upon protonation corresponds to the charge transfer excitation involving the frontier orbitals, and the small band gap explains the observed red shift. Analogue calculations on thiophene within a ZSM-5 zeolite cluster model confirm the same trends upon protonation as observed in the non-interacting compounds. Understanding the electronic structure of these compounds is very relevant to correlate UV-Vis bands with acidic strength and possibly environment in zeolites and to improve their performance in catalytic and energy related applications.

The geometries of the dimer and two monomers are optimized in the singlet ground and lowest-energy triplet excited states (LLTS's) to interpret absorption and emission behaviors, respectively. The singlet excited states calculated using time-dependent DFT correlate well with the absorption spectra in the lowest-energy and other major electronic transitions.

The lowest-energy Franck-Condon triplet excited state of the dimer arising from electronic transitions localized on the acetate moiety is unstable. The next higher Franck-Condon triplet excited state arises from long-range charge transfer transition, and its energy is close to that of the nicotinate-containing monomer.

This four-wave mixing method allows to probe the rotation of non-polar gas-phase molecules with fs time resolution over times up to ∼5 ns. The ground state rotational constant of hexafluorobenzene is determined as B0 = 1029.740(28) MHz (2σ uncertainty) from RR-RCS transients measured in a pulsed seeded supersonic jet, where essentially only the v = 0 state is populated. Using this B0 value, RR-RCS measurements in a room temperature gas cell give the rotational constants Bv of the five lowest-lying thermally populated vibrationally excited states ν7/8, ν9, ν11/12, ν13, and ν14/15. Their Bv constants differ from B0 by between -1.02 MHz and +2.23 MHz. Combining the B0 with the results of all-electron coupled-cluster CCSD(T) calculations of Demaison et al. [Mol.

Equilibrium geometries and harmonic frequencies have been accurately calculated in all cases at the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b level of theory, including the effects of core-valence correlation for the former. Where experimental values are available for the equilibrium structures (ClNO2 and BrNO2), the present calculations are in excellent agreement; however, the X-O distances are slightly too long by about 0.01 Å due to missing multireference effects. Accurate predictions for the iodine species are made for the first time. The vertical electronic excitation spectra have been calculated using equation-of-motion coupled cluster methods for the low-lying singlet states and multireference configuration interaction for both singlet and triplet states. The latter also included the effects of spin-orbit coupling to provide oscillator strengths for the ground state singlet to excited triplet transitions. While for ClNO2 the transitions to excited singlet states all occur at wavelengths shorter than 310 nm, there is one longer wavelength singlet transition in BrNO2 and two in the case of INO2. The long wavelength tail in the XNO2 species is predicted to be dominated by transitions to triplet states. In addition to red-shifting from X = Cl to I, the triplet transitions also increase in oscillator strength, becoming comparable to many of the singlet transitions in the case of INO2. Hence in particular, the latter species should be very photolabile. Similar trends are observed and reported for the halogen nitrites, many of which for the first time. ",

In spite of multiple quasidegeneracies (particularly for the cases of Sc(2) and Mn(2)), the GVVPT2 PECs are smooth with no discontinuities.

Much of the vibrational structure in the excitation spectrum is Franck-Condon activity due to three in-plane vibrations that modulate the distance between the NH<sub2</sub and CO<sub2</subMe groups, ν<sub33</sub (421 cm<sup-1</sup), ν<sub34</sub (366 cm<sup-1</sup), and ν<sub36</sub (179 cm<sup-1</sup). Based on the close correspondence between experiment and theory at the TD-DFT B3LYP-D3BJ/def2TZVP level of theory, the major structural changes associated with electronic excitation are evaluated, leading to the conclusion that the major motion is a reorientation and constriction of the 6-membered H-bonded ring closed by the intramolecular NHO[double bond, length as m-dash]C H-bond. This leads to a shortening of the NHO[double bond, length as m-dash]C H-bond distance from 1.926 Å to 1.723 Å, equivalent to about a 25% reduction in the HO distance compared to full H-atom transfer. As a result, the excited state process near the S<sub1</sub origin is a hydrogen atom dislocation that is brought about primarily by heavy atom motion, since the shortened H-bond distance results from extensive heavy-atom motion, with only a 0.03 Å increase in the NH bond length relative to its ground state value.",

The extent of exciton delocalization in the two lowest (π,π(*)) states of the dimers is determined using the symmetrized one-electron transition density matrices between the ground and excited states, and the electronic coupling is calculated using the delocalization measure and the energy splitting between the states [see F. Plasser, A. J. A. Aquino, W. L. Hase, and H. Lischka, J. Phys. Chem. A 116, 11151-11160 (2012)]. The calculated couplings lie between 0.05 eV and 0.14 eV. In the B-DNA conformation, where the interchromophoric distance is 3.38 Å, our couplings deviate significantly from those calculated with the transition charges, showing the importance of orbital overlap components for the couplings in this conformation. The calculation of the couplings is based on a two-state model for exciton delocalization. However, in three stacks with a purine in the 5(') position and a pyrimidine in the 3(') one (AT, GC, and GT), there is an energetically favored charge transfer state that mixes with the two lowest excited states. In these dimers we have applied a three-state model that considers the two locally excited diabatic states and the charge transfer state. Using the delocalization and charge transfer descriptors, we obtain all couplings between these three states. Our results are important in the context of DNA photophysics, since the calculated couplings can be used to parametrize effective Hamiltonians to model extended DNA stacks. Our calculations also suggest that the 5(')-purine-pyrimidine-3(') sequence favors the formation of charge transfer excited states. ",

The molecule can adopt either a paddle wheel or a propeller conformation in solution, where the paddle wheel structure possesses a metal-metal bond of 4.4 Å and a dihedral angle between the quasi-C(4v) planes of 0° and the propeller structure has a metal-metal bond of 3.6 Å and a dihedral angle of 17° when crystallized. Each conformation has a distinct absorption in the visible attributed to a (1)(dσ(z)* → pσ(z)) excitation, with the long eclipsed structure absorbing at 475 nm and the short twisted structure absorbing at 585 nm. We independently pumped at each of these visible transitions to form vibrational wavepackets on the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces, which modulated the ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals, respectively. We found that the ground state wavepacket oscillates with a frequency of 48 cm(-1) when pumping the red peak and 11 cm(-1) when pumping the blue peak. We assign these frequencies to the Ir-Ir symmetric stretch, with the variation in frequency reflecting the variation in metal-metal bond strength in support of our assignment of the blue peak to the longer Ir-Ir bond length conformer and the red peak to the shorter Ir-Ir bond length conformer. When pumping the red peak, we found two modes with frequencies of 80 and 119 cm(-1) in the stimulated emission and only one mode at 75 cm(-1) when pumping the blue peak. We assign the 75-80 cm(-1) frequency to the Ir-Ir stretch and the 119 cm(-1) vibration to the dihedral angle twist in the excited state. The variation in the excited state dynamics does not result from the excitation of different electronic states, but rather from excitation to different Franck-Condon regions of the same electronic excited state potential energy surface. This occurs because of the large difference in ground state molecular structure. DFT calculations support the existence of a single electronic excited state being accessed from two distinct structural isomers with conformations similar to those observed with X-ray crystallography.",

Steady-state absorption and emission measurements were employed for both molecules while a picosecond fluorescence up-conversion technique was used to follow the dynamic behavior of the 2M5M system. The experimental methods were complemented by DFT and TD DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) calculations involving ground and excited-state optimization which in the case of the smaller 2M5M molecule were extended to the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method. The solvent effect is incorporated by applying the polarizable continuum (PCM) model. The data reveal that the 2B5M molecule crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c and its crystal lattice is composed of monomers with intramolecular N-H···O [2.572(3) Å] hydrogen bonds, connected into a polymer network by weak intermolecular C-H…O [3.2-3.4 Å]-type interactions.

The results of both picosecond fluorescence up-conversion experiments in different solvents and quantum-chemical calculations suggest that in nonpolar media the ESIPT process in 2M5M is favored, while in polar acetonitrile, the N* → PT* transition demands barrier-crossing and thus unfavorable thermodynamic conditions do not allow the ESIPT to occur. The signals of picosecond fluorescence up-conversion of 2M5M are solvent- and emission-wavelength dependent. The three time components found in a weakly polar isooctane-dioxane mixture have been attributed to solvation dynamics (∼500 fs), and to relaxation of N* and PT* forms while in acetonitrile, a very rapid fluorescence decay with a time constant (2.3-4.0 ps) indicative of the presence of the normal (N*) form was observed. Much shorter fluorescence lifetimes in alcohols (a few picoseconds) and in D(2)O (less than 200 fs) than in aprotic solvents suggest that in protic media, the solvent molecules participate in the ESIPT, bridging between the methylamine group and the N-oxide group of 2M5M.",

A shortening of the Pt-Pt distance from 2.959 Å in the ground state S(0) to 2.760 Å in the optimized first excited state (T(1)) is consistent with an increase in the Pt-Pt bond order to 0.5. In agreement with TD-DFT calculations, the intense, structureless, red emission of 1 in the solid state and in solution can be mainly attributed to triplet metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer ((3)MMLCT) [dσ*(Pt-Pt) → π*(bzq)] excited states. The high quantum yields of this emission measured in toluene (44%) and solid state (62%) at room temperature indicate that 1 is a very efficient and stable (3)MMLCT emitter, even in solution.

In particular, we have constructed the potential energy curves (PECs) with respect to the iron-oxygen distance when removing all water ligands at the same time from the cluster minima and established their correlation to the long-range dissociation channels. Due to the fact that both the second and third ionization potentials of iron are larger than the one for water, the ground-state products asymptotically correlate with dissociation channels that are repulsive in nature at large separations, as they contain at least one H2O(+) fragment and a singly positively charged metal center (Fe(+)).

The binding energy of the Rydberg electron in the monomer is calculated to be 2.79 eV and 2.27 eV in the 3s and 3p state, respectively, which compares well with measured values of 2.88 eV and 2.21 eV. Three different stable configurations of the dimer in the ground state were found using an energy functional that includes van der Waals interaction. The lowest ground state energy conformation has the two N-atoms widely separated, by 6.2 Å, while the Rydberg state energy is lowest for a configuration where the N-atoms of the two molecules come close together, separated by 3.7 Å. This conformational change is found to lower the Rydberg electron binding energy by 0.2 eV. The self-interaction corrected functional gives a highly localized hole on one of the two molecules, unlike results obtained using the PBE functional or the hybrid B3LYP functional which give a delocalized hole. For the trimer, the self-interaction corrected calculation gives a Rydberg electron binding energy lowered further by 0.13 eV as compared with the dimer. The calculated results compare well with trends observed in experimental measurements. The reduction of the Rydberg electron binding energy with cluster size can be ascribed to an effective delocalization of the positive charge of the hole by the induced and permanent dipole moments of the neighboring molecules. A further decrease observed to occur on a time scale of tens of ps can be ascribed to a structural rearrangement of the clusters in the Rydberg state where molecules rotate to orient their dipoles in response to the formation of the localized hole.

Treatment of (NEt(4))(2)[V(2)(edt)(4)] (1) in MeCN with equimolar (C(12)H(8)S(2))BF(4) (C(12)H(8)S(2)(+) = the thianthrenium radical cation) results in a one-electron oxidation and isolation of the V(III),V(IV) complex (NEt(4))[V(2)(edt)(4)] (2).

The reaction of 1 in MeCN with equimolar VCl(3)(THF)(3) and NEt(4)Cl gives (NEt(4))(3)[V(3)Cl(6)(edt)(3)] (5). A more convenient procedure to 5 is the reaction in MeCN of VCl(3)(THF)(3), Na(2)edt, and NEt(4)Cl in a 1:1:1 molar ratio.

The complex thus is S = (1)/(2) with no thermally accessible S = (3)/(2) state. The combined data on 1 and 2, together with the results of EHT calculations, show that 1 and 2 contain a V-V single bond tying up two of the d electrons and that the remaining two d electrons in 1 are antiferromagnetically coupled to give an S = 0 ground state and S = 1 excited state; for 2, the one remaining d electron gives an S = (1)/(2) state.

The complex [Cr(tren)(3,6-DTBSQ)](PF(6))(2), where tren is tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and 3,6-DTBSQ is 3,6-di-tert-butylorthosemiquinone, crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c with a = 11.9560(2) Å, b = 17.0715(4) Å, c = 17.1805(4) Å, beta = 90.167(1) degrees, V = 3506.6(1) Å(3), Z = 4, with R = 0.056 and R(w) = 0.070. Alternating C-C bond distances within the quinoidal ligand confirm its semiquinone character. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility data collected on solid samples of both [Cr(tren)(3,6-DTBSQ)](PF(6))(2) and [Cr(tren)(3,6-DTBCat)](PF(6)) in the range 5-350 K exhibit temperature-independent values of 2.85 +/- 0.1 &amp;mgr;(B) and 3.85 +/- 0.1 &amp;mgr;(B), respectively.

The absorption spectrum of the semiquinone complex exhibits a number of sharp, relatively intense transitions in fluid solution. Group theoretical arguments coupled with a qualitative ligand-field analysis including the effects of Heisenberg spin exchange suggest that several of the observed transitions are a consequence of exchange interactions in both the ground- and excited-state manifolds of the compound. The effect of electron exchange on excited-state dynamics has also been probed through static emission as well as time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopies. It is suggested that the introduction of exchange coupling and subsequent change in the molecule's electronic structure may contribute to an increase of nearly 4 orders of magnitude in the rate of radiative decay (k(r)), and a factor of ca. 10(7) in the rate of nonradiative decay (k(nr)).",

The X(1)Σ(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 Å), whereas the A(1)Π state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 Å). The X(1)Σ(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;μ&gt;(υ), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)Π.

The υ(\") = 7 and 8 X(1)Σ(+) vibrational levels are found to have the highest probability to be reached via emission from the lowest lying vibrational levels of A(1)Π.

In the case of excitation between 430 nm and 600 nm, it is found that the molecular ion accesses two dissociation channels with a measured 60:40 branching ratio that is nearly constant over this range of photon energies. The dominant product channel corresponds to Br(-) + CN, while the second channel correlates to spin-orbit excited Br(*) with CN(-). A larger wavelength dependence of the branching ratio is observed at shorter wavelengths, where the fraction of Br(-) based products ranges from 80% to 95% at 355 nm and 270 nm, respectively. These branching ratios are reproduced and the mechanisms are explored by quantum dynamics calculations based on ground and excited state potential energy surfaces for BrCN(-), evaluated at the SO-MRCISD level of theory. It is found that the electronic states that correlate to the two observed product channels are coupled through the spin-orbit terms in the electronic Hamiltonian. The strength of this coupling displays a strong dependence on the Br-CN angle. Specifically, after promotion to the excited state that is energetically accessible with 430-600 nm photons, it is found that when the wave packet accesses Br-CN separations of between 4 Å and 6 Å, predominantly the Br(-) + CN products are formed when the Br-CN angle is smaller than 120°. For larger values of the Br-CN angle, the Br(*) + CN(-) channel dominates. At the shorter wavelength excitation, the dynamics is complicated by a pair of states that correlate to electronically excited CN(*) + Br(-) products that borrow oscillator strength from the bright state, leading to an increase in the amount of Br(-) relative to CN(-). The implications of these findings are discussed and compared to the experimentally measured product branching ratios for the photodissociation of BrCN(-). ",

The presence of the potential barrier is clearly demonstrated by the level structure of YOD, where the Sigma+ vibronic component of the 010 vibrational level (linear molecule notation) lies 1.4 cm-1 below the 000 level. The upper Born-Oppenheimer component, which has A\" symmetry, is unaffected; its bending frequency is similar to that of the ground state. Perturbations occur in both the &amp;Btilde;1Pi and &amp;Ctilde;1Sigma+ states; some of these represent local interactions between the two of them, but others are caused by higher vibrational levels of lower-lying \"dark\" electronic states.

There is extensive vibronic structure in the spectrum due to a long progression in the Cr-N stretch and transitions to all six spin-orbit levels in the upper state. The spin-orbit splitting in the excited state is observed to be A<subso</sub' = 39 cm<sup-1</sup. For the lowest spin-orbit level, the Cr-N stretching frequency in the excited state is 343 cm<sup-1</sup, with an anharmonicity of 4.2 cm<sup-1</sup. The <sup6</supE (Π) origin is predicted to lie at T<sub0</sub = 14 697 cm<sup-1</sup. The first peak observed is due to v' = 1, so the observed photodissociation onset is thermodynamic rather than spectroscopic, giving D<sub0</sub(Cr<sup+</sup-NH<sub3</sub) = 14 830 ± 100 cm<sup-1</sup (177.4 ± 1.2 kJ/mol) and D<sub0</sub(Cr<sup+</sup-ND<sub3</sub) = 15 040 ± 30 cm<sup-1</sup (179.9 ± 0.4 kJ/mol). The <sup6</supE (Π) state of Cr<sup+</sup(NH<sub3</sub) is ∼2740 cm<sup-1</sup less strongly bound than the ground state, and the Cr-N bond length increases by 0.23 ± 0.03 Å upon electronic excitation. Calculations at the time-dependent density functional theory (M06) and equations of motion coupled cluster, with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) level fairly accurately predict the energy and vibrational frequency of the excited state. Multi-reference configuration interaction calculations show how the spin-orbit states of Cr<sup+</sup(NH<sub3</sub) evolve into those of Cr<sup+</sup + NH<sub3</sub.",

Accurate electronic structure calculations were performed using the coupled cluster method including single and double excitations with addition of the perturbative triples correction [CCSD(T)] with the Dunning's correlation consistent basis sets aug-cc-pVnZ, n = 2-5. Also, the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12a level of theory was employed with the AVnZ basis as well as the Peterson and co-workers VnZ-F12 basis sets with n = 2 and 3. Results of all levels of calculations predicted two equivalent minimum energy structures of planar geometry and C(s) symmetry along the A\" surface of the complex, whereas the A' surface is repulsive. Values of the geometrical parameters and the counterpoise corrected dissociation energies (Cp-D(e)) that were calculated using the CCSD(T)-F12a/VnZ-F12 level of theory are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z calculations. The minimum energy structure is characterized by a very short hydrogen bond of length of 1.328 Å, with elongation of the HF bond distance in the complex by 0.133 Å, and D(e) value of 32.313 Kcal/mol. Mulliken atomic charges showed that 65% of the negative charge is localized on the hydrogen bonded end of the superoxide radical and the HF unit becomes considerably polarized in the complex. These results suggest that the hydrogen bond is an incipient ionic bond. Exploration of the potential energy surface confirmed the identified minimum and provided support for vibrationally induced intramolecular proton transfer within the complex. The T-shaped geometry that possesses C(2v) symmetry presents a saddle point on the top of the barrier to the in-plane bending of the hydrogen above and below the axis that connects centers of masses of the monomers. The height of this barrier is 7.257 Kcal/mol, which is higher in energy than the hydrogen bending frequency by 909.2 cm(-1). The calculated harmonic oscillator vibrational frequencies showed that the H-F stretch vibrational transition in the complex is redshifted by 2564 cm(-1) and gained significant intensity (by at least a factor of 30) with respect to the transition in the HF monomer. These results make the O(2)(-)-HF complex an excellent prototype for infrared spectroscopic investigations on open-shell complexes with vibrationally induced proton transfer.",

If the heteroatoms are both heavy chalcogens (S, Se, or Te) or isoelectronic species, then the lowest excited triplet state usually has (π*, σ*) character. The triplet energies are fairly low (30-50 kcal mol(-1)). The (π*, σ*) triplet states are characterized by a significantly lengthened bond between the two heteroatoms. Thus, in 1,2-dithiolane (1b), the S-S bond length is calculated to be 2.088 Å in the singlet ground state and 2.568 Å in the first triplet excited state. The spin density is predicted to be localized almost exclusively on the sulfur atoms. Replacing one heavy chalcogen atom by an oxygen atom or an NR group results in a significant destabilization of the (π*, σ*) triplet excited state, which then no longer is lower in energy than an open-chain biradical. The size of the heterocyclic ring also contributes to the stability of the (π*, σ*) triplet state, with five-membered rings being more favorable than six-membered rings. Benzoannulation, finally, usually lowers the energy of the (π*, σ*) triplet excited states. If one of the heteroatoms is an oxygen or nitrogen atom, however, the corresponding lowest triplet states are better described as σ,π-biradicals.",

The results show that the algebraic diagrammatic construction method to second order (ADC(2)) provides excellent possibilities for reliable calculations of CT states. Significant improvements in the accuracy of the computed transition energies are obtained by using the scaled opposite-spin (SOS) variant of ADC(2). Solvent effects were examined on the basis of the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) which has been implemented recently in the ADC(2) method. The dielectric constant and the refractive index of dichloromethane have been chosen in the COSMO calculations to compare with experimental solvatochromic effects. The computation of optimized ground state geometries and enthalpies of formation has been performed at the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) level. By comparison with experimental data and with high-level coupled-cluster methods including explicitly correlated (F12) wave functions, the importance of the SOS approach is demonstrated for the ground state as well. In the benzene-TCNE complex, the two lowest electronic excitations are of CT character whereas in the naphthalene and anthracene TCNE complexes three low-lying CT states are observed. As expected, they are strongly stabilized by the solvent. Geometry optimization in the lowest excited state allowed the calculation of fluorescence transitions. Solvent effects lead to a zero gap between S1 and S0 for the anthracene-TCNE complex. Therefore, in the series of benzene-TCNE to anthracene a change from a radiative to a nonradiative decay mechanism to the ground state is to be expected. ",

The estimated Tl-cd distances between Tl(+) cations and the centroids (cd) of the trimetallic Pt3(μ2-L)3(L')3 {3 : 3 : 3} decks were found in the range 2.932-3.397 Å. The predicted bond dissociation energy, D0, of the (c-Pt3)···Tl(+) bonds was found to lie within the range -31.5 up to -77.5 kcal mol(-1) at the B3LYP/LANL2TZ(f)(Pt) ∪ 6-31G(d,p)(E) ∪ SRLC(Tl) level of theory. Most of the [(c-Pt3)Tl(c-Pt3)](+) inorganic metallocenes adopt a bend titanocene-like structure. The Localized Orbital Locator (LOL) contour maps along with the 3D contour plots of the Reduced Gradient Density (RDG) mirror the composite nature of the interaction of Tl(+) with the triangular Pt3 metallic ring cores consisting of electrostatic, covalent and dispersion interaction components. The Pt3···Tl(+)···Pt3 bonding mode was further validated by Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) calculations which demonstrated that the electrostatic and covalent components of the interaction contribute almost equally to the bonding interactions. Furthermore, Charge Decomposition Analysis (CDA) and Natural Bond Orbital Analysis (NBO) calculations indicated that charge transfer from the Tl(+) cation to the Pt3(0) {3 : 3 : 3} decks also occurs. The {[Pt3(μ2-L)3(L')3]2(μ6-Tl)}(+) sandwiches absorb in the UV-Vis region (300-500 nm) and emit in the visible-near IR region (600-1000 nm). The absorption bands are mainly of MLCT/MC character while phosphorescence is predicted to occur via the first triplet excited state, T1, since the spin density of this excited state could be described as a SOMO - 1/SOMO combination. Generally, no significant distortions occur upon excitation of these systems from their S0 ground state to the first triplet excited state, T1. The S0 → T1 transition causes only an elongation of the Tl-cd distances by up to 0.7 Å accompanied in a few cases by a change in the &lt;cd-Tl-cd bond angle as well.",

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between SAEM and FOCEi using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status. Under the fasted state, the first-order absorption into the central compartment was preceded by zero-order infusion into the depot compartment, whereas for the fed state, the absorption into the depot was instantaneous followed by first-order absorption from depot into the central compartment.

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10 keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000 nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions.

The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

Computational models are particularly well suited for these investigations. The electric field can be accurately described by mathematical formalisms, and the population-based neural responses to the electrical stimulation can be investigated at resolutions well beyond those achievable by current state-of-the-art biological techniques. In this study, we used a biophysically-and morphologically-detailed RGC model to explore the ability of high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) to preferentially activate ON and OFF RGC subtypes, the two major information pathways of the retina. The performance of a wide range of electrical stimulation amplitudes (0 - $100~\\mu \\mathbf {A}$) and frequencies (1 - 10 kHz) on functionally-distinct RGC responses were evaluated. We found that ON RGCs could be preferentially activated at relatively higher stimulation amplitudes $( &gt; 50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ and frequencies $( &gt;2$ kHz) while OFF RGCs were activated by lower stimulation amplitudes (10 to $50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ across all tested frequencies.

This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot).

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO).

We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected.

Regarding RMSD scoring, the OM2/MNDO method performed fairly well, too. Besides absorption spectra, lifetimes of the first two excited states were estimated based on a stochastic approach exploring a swarm of OM2/MNDO hopping dynamics using the Tully fewest switch algorithm for each molecule. The longest lifetime of the first excited state (S<sub1</sub ) was found for decapentaene (about 5 ps). Further elongation of the conjugated chain caused a mild decrease of this value to ca 1.5 ps for docosaundecaene.",

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039 kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57 $\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mol}/{\\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30 000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL.

The XDM model is parametrized for both the B86bPBE and PBE functionals using double-ζ- and triple-ζ-quality basis sets (DZP and TZP). The use of finite-support local orbitals is shown to have minimal impact on the computed dispersion coefficients for van der Waals molecular dimers and small molecular solids. However, the quality of the basis set affects the accuracy of calculated dimer binding energies and molecular-crystal lattice energies quite significantly; the size of the counterpoise correction indicates that this is caused by basis-set incompleteness error. In the case of the DZP basis set, its performance for weakly bound gas-phase dimers is similar to that of a double-ζ Gaussian basis set without diffuse functions. The new XDM implementation was tested on graphite and phosphorene exfoliation, and on the X23 benchmark set of molecular-crystal lattice energies. Our results indicate that lattice energies similar to plane-wave calculations can be obtained only if the counterpoise correction is applied. Alternatively, the calculated equilibrium geometries are reasonably close to the plane-wave equivalents, and composite approaches in which a single-point plane-wave calculation is used at the XDM/DZP equilibrium geometry yield good accuracy at a significantly lower computational cost.",

Three types of low-cost methods are considered: DFT with a small basis set of finite-support numerical orbitals (the SIESTA method), dispersion-corrected Gaussian small or minimal-basis-set Hartree-Fock and DFT with additional empirical corrections (HF-3c and PBEh-3c), and self-consistent-charge dispersion-corrected density-functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB3-D3). In addition, we study the performance of composite methods that comprise a geometry optimization using a low-cost approach followed by a single-point calculation using the accurate but comparatively expensive B86bPBE-XDM functional. All methods were tested for their abilities to produce absolute lattice energies, relative lattice energies, and crystal geometries. We show that assessing various methods by their ability to produce absolute lattice energies can be misleading and that relative lattice energies are a much better indicator of performance in CSP. The EE14 set of relative solubilities of homochiral and heterochiral chiral crystals is proposed for relative lattice-energy benchmarking. Our results show that PBE-D2 plus a DZP basis set of numerical orbitals coupled with a final B86bPBE-XDM single-point calculation gives excellent performance at a fraction of the cost of a full B86bPBE-XDM calculation, although the results are sensitive to the particular details of the computational protocol.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest. LSCI was used to measure the area of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miarea</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{area}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and the perfusion level of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and normal skin ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miN</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${N}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ). The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and pruritus were also used to assess each keloid.

We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p &lt; 0.001). The expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p &lt; 0.05).

The RPI had a higher correlation with the pain-VAS, pruritus-VAS, and the expression levels of internal cytokines in keloids than blood perfusion levels and the VSS. T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) was also used to verify the clinical discriminatory abilities of this RPI model. The proposed RPI based on LSCI showed the highest accuracy, unlike the VSS and assessment of perfusion, and can be utilized as a reliable, objective, quantitative, and noninvasive tool to evaluate the severity of keloids.",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean (±standard deviation) ages: 47.4 ± 9.5 years).

The frozen density ${\\rho _{\\rm{B}} (\\vec r)}$ is usually obtained from some lower-level quantum mechanical methods applied to the environment, but FDET is not limited to such choices for ${\\rho _{\\rm{B}} (\\vec r)}$. The present work concerns the application of FDET, in which ${\\rho _{\\rm{B}} (\\vec r)}$ is the statistically averaged electron density of the solvent ${\\left\\langle {\\rho _{\\rm{B}} (\\vec r)} \\right\\rangle }$. The specific solute-solvent interactions are represented in a statistical manner in ${\\left\\langle {\\rho _{\\rm{B}} (\\vec r)} \\right\\rangle }$.

We find that the more complicated dependence of DOP on strain, as derived by the analytic model, fits the data better than the previously assumed simple dependence. This finding thus corroborates the analytical model and should have an impact on understanding the strain-dependent operation of optoelectronic devices.",

It has been rarely noted that this divergence is apparent already in the very 1st mental toss. Analysis of several existing data sets reveals that about 80% of respondents start their sequence with Heads. We attributed this to the linguistic convention describing coin toss outcomes as \"Heads or Tails,\" not vice versa. However, our subsequent experiments found the \"first-toss\" bias reversible under minor changes in the experimental setup, such as mentioning Tails before Heads in the instructions. We offer a comprehensive account in terms of a novel response bias, which we call reachability. It is more general than the 1st-toss bias, and it reflects the relative ease of reaching 1 option compared to its alternative in any binary choice context. When faced with a choice between 2 options (e.g., Heads and Tails, when \"tossing\" mental coins), whichever of the 2 is presented first by the choice architecture (hence, is more reachable) will be favored. This bias has far-reaching implications extending well beyond the context of randomness cognition; in particular, to binary surveys (e.g., accept vs. reject) and tests (e.g., True-False). In binary choice, there is an advantage to what presents first.",

We investigated a magic effect consisting of a coin \"vanish\" (i.e., the perceptual disappearance of a coin after a simulated toss from hand to hand). Previous research has shown that magicians can use joint attention cues such as their own gaze direction to strengthen the observers' perception of magic. Here we presented naïve observers with videos including real and simulated coin tosses to determine if joint attention might enhance the illusory perception of simulated coin tosses. The observers' eye positions were measured, and their perceptual responses simultaneously recorded via button press. To control for the magician's use of joint attention cues, we occluded his head in half of the trials. We found that subjects did not direct their gaze at the magician's face at the time of the coin toss, whether the face was visible or occluded, and that the presence of the magician's face did not enhance the illusion. Thus, our results show that joint attention is not necessary for the perception of this effect. We conclude that social misdirection is redundant and possibly detracting to this very robust sleight-of-hand illusion. We further determined that subjects required multiple trials to effectively distinguish real from simulated tosses; thus the illusion was resilient to repeated viewing.",

Two probabilistic treatment planning methods are presented that use tumor probabilities to balance tumor control with organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The first method explores OAR dose reduction by systematically discarding <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics<mml:mrow<mml:mix</mml:mi <mml:mo%</mml:mo</mml:mrow <mml:annotation$x\\%$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math of CTD voxels with an unfavorable dose-to-probability ratio from the minimum dose coverage objective. The second method sequentially expands the target volume from the GTV edge, calculating the CTD coverage versus OAR sparing trade-off after dosing each expansion. Each planning method leads to estimated levels of tumor control under specific statistical models of tumor infiltration: an independent tumor islets model and contiguous circumferential tumor growth model. The methods are illustrated by creating proton therapy treatment plans for two glioblastoma patients with the clinical goal of sparing the hippocampus and brainstem. For probabilistic plan evaluation, the concept of a dose-expected-volume histogram is introduced, which plots the dose to the expected tumor volume <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics<mml:mrow<mml:mo⟨</mml:mo <mml:miv</mml:mi <mml:mo⟩</mml:mo</mml:mrow <mml:annotation$\\langle v \\rangle$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math considering tumor probabilities. Both probabilistic planning approaches generate a library of treatment plans to interactively navigate the planning trade-offs.

One such application, which we present in this article, monitors the attention passers-by pay to an outdoor advertisement. Our approach to the VFOA-W problem proposes a multi-person tracking solution based on a dynamic Bayesian network that simultaneously infers the (variable) number of people in a scene, their body locations, their head locations, and their head pose. For efficient inference in the resulting large variable-dimensional state-space we propose a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) sampling scheme, as well as a novel global observation model which determines the number of people in the scene and localizes them. We propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based VFOA-W model which use head pose and location information to determine people's focus state.

Orientational constraints restrict this rate to approximately 10(5)-10(6) M(-1) s(-1). Proteins with higher association rates generally have complementary electrostatic surfaces; proteins with lower association rates generally are slowed down by conformational changes upon complex formation. Previous studies (Zhou, Biophys J 1997;73:2441-2445) have shown that electrostatic enhancement of the diffusion-limited association rate can be accurately modeled by $k_{\\bf D}$ = $k_{D}0\\ {exp} ( - \\langle U_{el} \\rangle;{\\star}/k_{B} T),$ where k(D) and k(D0) are the rates in the presence and absence of electrostatic interactions, respectively, U(el) is the average electrostatic interaction energy in a \"transient-complex\" ensemble, and k(B)T is the thermal energy. The transient-complex ensemble separates the bound state from the unbound state. Predictions of the transient-complex theory on four protein complexes were found to agree well with the experiment when the electrostatic interaction energy was calculated with the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation (Alsallaq and Zhou, Structure 2007;15:215-224). Here we show that the agreement is further improved when the nonlinear PB equation is used. These predictions are obtained with the dielectric boundary defined as the protein van der Waals surface. When the dielectric boundary is instead specified as the molecular surface, electrostatic interactions in the transient complex become repulsive and are thus predicted to retard association. Together these results demonstrate that the transient-complex theory is predictive of electrostatic rate enhancement and can help parameterize PB calculations.",

These phenomena, and thus this information, are described by classical physics. All actually available information (in the mathematical sense of information theory) is classical: it is composed of units, such as bits, that are-or are contained in-entities described by classical physics. On the other hand, classical physics cannot predict this information when it is created, as manifested in measuring instruments, in quantum experiments, while quantum theory can. In this epistemological sense, this information is quantum. The article designates the discontinuity between quantum theory and the emergence of quantum phenomena the \"Heisenberg discontinuity\", because it was introduced by W. Heisenberg along with QM, and the discontinuity between QM or QFT and the classical physics of quantum phenomena, the \"Bohr discontinuity\", because it was introduced as part of Bohr's interpretation of quantum phenomena and QM, under the assumption of Heisenberg discontinuity. Combining both discontinuities precludes QM or QFT from being connected to either physical reality, that ultimately responsible for quantum phenomena or that of these phenomena themselves, other than by means of probabilistic predictions concerning the information, classical in character, contained in quantum phenomena. The nature of quantum information is, in this view, defined by this situation.

In this game, participants guess the outcomes of unseen coin tosses after a person in another room (dubbed 'the reporter') observes the coin toss outcomes and then sends reports (which may or may not be truthful) to participants about whether the coins landed on heads or tails. Participants knew that the reporter's interests were aligned with their own (common interests), opposed to their own (conflicting interests) or opposed to their own, but that the reporter was penalized every time he or she sent a false report about the coin toss outcome (penalty for lying). In the common interests and penalty for lying conditions, participants followed the reporter's reports over 90% of the time, in contrast to &lt;59% of the time in the conflicting interests condition. Reaction time results indicated that participants took similar amounts of time to respond in the common interests and penalty for lying conditions and that they were reliably faster than in the conflicting interests condition. Event-related potentials timelocked to the reporter's reports revealed a larger P2, P3 and late positive complex response in the common interests condition than in the other two, suggesting that participants' brains processed the reporter's reports differently in the common interests condition relative to the other two conditions.

However, it critically disregards an interesting third outcome: the possibility of the coin coming at rest on its edge. Provided this evident yet elusive possibility, previous works have already focused on capturing all three landing probabilities of thick coins, but have only succeeded computationally.

DTC algorithms can be used for monitoring systems using sensors to detect a significant global change. When designing an efficient DTC algorithm, the following goals should be considered; minimizing the whole number of exchanged messages used for counting triggers and even distribution of communication loads among nodes. In this paper, we present an efficient DTC algorithm, DDR-coin (Deterministic Detection of Randomly generated coins). The message complexity-the total number of exchanged messages-of DDR-coin is O(nlogn(w/n)) in average. MaxRcvLoad-the maximum number of received messages to detect <iw</i triggers in each node-is O(logn(w/n)) on average. DDR-coin is not an exact algorithm; even though <iw</i triggers are received by the <in</i nodes, it can fail to raise an alarm with a negligible probability. However, DDR-coin is more efficient than exact DTC algorithms on average and the gap between those is increased for larger <in</i. We implemented the prototype of the proposed scheme using NetLogo 6.1.1. We confirmed that experimental results are close to our mathematical analysis. Compared with the previous schemes-TreeFill, CoinRand, and RingRand- DDR-coin shows smaller message complexity and MaxRcvLoad.",

Forty bulls were divided into three groups: young (1.8-2 years), adult (3.5-7 years), and senile (8-14.3 years). The ejaculates were frozen according to standards established by the Artificial Insemination Center located in the Southeast of Brazil. Toluidine blue staining was used for simultaneous evaluation of the sperm chromatin and sperm head morphometry. Chromomycin A3 (CMA3) was applied to analyze sperm protamination and IVP for embryonic development. Spermatozoa of young bulls presented higher values for area (A, pixels), perimeter (P, pixels), and width (W, pixels) compared to adults and senile (young: A = 1848.5 ± 119.79, P = 10.23 ± 0.29, and W = 1.95 ± 0.1; adults: A = 1672.9 ± 104.46, P = 9.86 ± 0.33, and W = 1.81 ± 0.06; senile: A = 1723.1 ± 124.41, P = 9.97 ± 0.33, and W = 1.83 ± 0.09; P &lt; 0.0001) and showed higher protamination deficiency when analyzed by CMA3 (young: 1.57 ± 0.76; adults: 1.09 ± 0.63, and senile: 0.90 ± 0.59; P &lt; 0.05). Likewise, variables of sperm head size (A, P, and W) and protamination assessed by CMA3 showed negative correlation with age and positive correlation with ellipticity, evaluated by toluidine blue method (P &lt; 0.05). Sperm head area was larger in spermatozoa presenting chromatin instabilities than spermatozoa without chromatin alteration (P &lt; 0.0001). There was no difference in IVP when using semen with larger or smaller portions of spermatozoa with chromatin instabilities, indicating that the proportion of sperm with abnormal chromatin compaction (4%-16.15%) did not interfere with early embryonic development. From our results, it can be concluded that sperm of young Nelore bulls have larger heads compared to adults and senile due to reduced protamine content when evaluated by CMA3 and higher proportion of major sperm defects assessed by differential interference contrast microscopy.",

In this article we analyze the case of two coin tossing games. Game B is played with two biased coins and has state-dependent rules based on the player's current capital. Game B can exhibit detailed balance or even negative drift (i.e., loss), depending on the chosen parameters. Game A is played with a single biased coin that produces a loss or negative drift in capital. However, a winning expectation is achieved by randomly mixing A and B. One possible interpretation pictures game A as a source of \"noise\" that is rectified by game B to produce overall positive drift-as in a Brownian ratchet. Game B has a state-dependent rule that favors a losing coin, but when this state dependence is broken up by the noise introduced by game A, a winning coin is favored. In this article we find the parameter space in which the paradoxical effect occurs and carry out a winning rate analysis. The significance of Parrondo's games is that they are physically motivated and were originally derived by considering a Brownian ratchet-the combination of the games can be therefore considered as a discrete-time Brownian ratchet. We postulate the use of games of this type as a toy model for a number of physical and biological processes and raise a number of open questions for future research.

Neither drinking nor believing one had been drinking affected the decision to toss the coin when participants deliberated in isolation. In contrast, when the decision occurred in a group context, groups led to believe they were drinking alcohol (i.e., groups administered alcohol or placebo beverages) were significantly more likely than groups knowing they had consumed a nonalcoholic beverage (i.e., groups administered a no-alcohol control beverage) to choose the coin toss.

Existing unsupervised binning methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads do not perform well on (i) samples with low-abundance species or (ii) samples (even with high abundance) when there are many extremely low-abundance species. These two problems are common for real metagenomic datasets. Binning methods that can solve these problems are desirable. We proposed a two-round binning method (MetaCluster 5.0) that aims at identifying both low-abundance and high-abundance species in the presence of a large amount of noise due to many extremely low-abundance species. In summary, MetaCluster 5.0 uses a filtering strategy to remove noise from the extremely low-abundance species. It separate reads of high-abundance species from those of low-abundance species in two different rounds. To overcome the issue of low coverage for low-abundance species, multiple w values are used to group reads with overlapping w-mers, whereas reads from high-abundance species are grouped with high confidence based on a large w and then binning expands to low-abundance species using a relaxed (shorter) w. Compared to the recent tools, TOSS and MetaCluster 4.0, MetaCluster 5.0 can find more species (especially those with low abundance of say 6× to 10×) and can achieve better sensitivity and specificity using less memory and running time. http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/ chin@cs.hku.hk.",

However, comparative cost-effectiveness evidence is lacking, let alone incorporation of perspectives from uncompensated stakeholders. A Burkina Faso trial evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Corn Soy Blend Plus w/ oil (CSB+ w/oil, reference arm), Corn Soy Whey Blend w/oil (CSWB w/oil), Super Cereal Plus (SC+), and Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) in reducing stunting and wasting among children 6-23 months old. This paper presents cost-effectiveness findings from multiple stakeholders' perspectives, including caregivers and program volunteers. An activity-based costing with ingredients approach was used to summarize cost of the 18-month-long blanket supplementary feeding for each enrolled child (in 2018 USD). Time data were collected using self-reported and observational instruments. Cost-effectiveness relative to CSB+ w/oil assessed incremental cost per enrolled child against incremental outcomes: prevalence of stunting at 23 months of age and number of months of wasting. Two combined perspectives were compared: program (donor, implementer, and volunteer) versus program and caregiver (adding caregiver). A total of 6112 children were enrolled. While similar effectiveness was found in three arms (CSWB w/oil was less effective), costs differed. Product cost and caregiver time to prepare study foods were major drivers of cross-arm cost differences from the respective combined perspective. The two major drivers were used to construct uncertainty ranges of cost per enrolled child from program and caregiver perspective: $317 ($279- $355) in CSB+ w/oil, $350 ($327- $373) in CSWB w/oil, $387 ($371- $403) in RUSF, and $434 ($365- $503) in SC+. Cost from program and caregiver perspective was a substantial increase from program perspective. CSB+ w/oil was most cost-effective in reducing stunting and wasting, and this main finding was robust to changing perspectives and all corresponding sensitivity analyses when uncompensated time was valued at minimum wage ($0.36/h). The break-even point for uncompensated time valuation is &gt;$0.84/h, where RUSF became the most cost-effective from the program and caregiver perspective. Relative cost-effectiveness rankings among the other three arms depended on choice of perspectives, and were sensitive to values assigned to product cost, international freight cost, opportunity cost of time, and outcomes of a hypothetical control. Volunteer opportunity cost did not affect arm comparisons, but lack of compensation resulted in negative financial consequences for caregivers. Evaluating cost-effectiveness by incorporating uncompensated stakeholders provided crucial implementation insights around nutrition products and programming. Trial registration number: NCT02071563.

The present study tried to replicate the previous finding in the Japanese context (Experiment 1); additionally, we explored the influence of unfamiliar Japanese instruction words that captured participants' attention (Experiment 2). <bMethods:</b In two online experiments, participants were asked to make 10 coin-tosses and report the number of \"heads\" results, which would indicate the amount of money that they could earn. In Experiment 1, we analyzed the difference in the number of \"heads\" results as reported by 768 participants under three conditions with different instructions (\"Don't cheat\" vs. \"Don't be a cheater\" vs. baseline as a control). In Experiment 2, we conducted an extended experiment with an additional task in which more attention was directed toward the text. <bResults:</b In Experiment 1, we successfully replicated the results of the original experiment. The results of Experiment 2 showed no evidence that the results in Experiment 1 were influenced by attentional factors. <bConclusions:</b In conclusion, the results of the present study supported the hypothesis that self-identity-related words of moral reminder curb unethical behaviors more effectively.

Considering a datum v and a set of n units w(i) in a Euclidean space, let v(i) be a point of the segment [vw(i)] whose position depends on gamma a real number between 0 and 1, the gamma-observable neighbours (gamma-ON) of v are the units w(i) for which v(i) is in the Voronoï of w(i), i.e. w(i) is the closest unit to v(i). For gamma = 1, v(i) merges with w(i), all the units are gamma-ON of v, while for gamma = 0, v(i) merges with v, only the closest unit to v is its gamma-ON. The size of the neighbourhood decreases from n to 1 while gamma goes from 1 to 0. For gamma lower or equal to 0.5, the gamma-ON of v are also its natural neighbours, i.e. their Voronoï regions share a common boundary with that of v. We show that this neighbourhood used in Vector Quantization gives faster convergence in terms of number of epochs and similar distortion than the Neural-Gas on several benchmark databases, and we propose the fact that it does not have the dimension selection property could explain these results. We show it also presents a new self-organization property we call 'self-distribution'.",

For example, when tossing a coin, a sequence of eight heads in a row does not seem very random. Where do these intuitions about randomness come from? We argue that subjective randomness can be understood as the result of a statistical inference assessing the evidence that an event provides for having been produced by a random generating process. We show how this account provides a link to previous work relating randomness to algorithmic complexity, in which random events are those that cannot be described by short computer programs. Algorithmic complexity is both incomputable and too general to capture the regularities that people can recognize, but viewing randomness as statistical inference provides two paths to addressing these problems: considering regularities generated by simpler computing machines, and restricting the set of probability distributions that characterize regularity. Building on previous work exploring these different routes to a more restricted notion of randomness, we define strong quantitative models of human randomness judgments that apply not just to binary sequences - which have been the focus of much of the previous work on subjective randomness - but also to binary matrices and spatial clustering.",

The results of the numerical models are compared with the laboratory experimental results to study the accuracy of the model especially in heterogeneous porous media. From the study it is observed that the simulator using pressure and saturation of the wetting fluid (P(W), S(W) formulation) is the best among the models tested.

Mathematical (a priori) probability is calculated according to the following consideration: during accidental tossing of an intact coin the probability of head is 1/2. Statistical (a posteriori) probability is assessed experimentally. If randomization is not respected, the result is doubtful. We call it bias. Probabilities are multiplied (added) if one and (or) another phenomenon should occur. Phenomena which occur or do not occur are frequently governed by binomial division. According to the law of large numbers the a posteriori probability will become the closer to the a priori probability, the larger the number of experiments. Forecasts based on probability are made possible by interferential statistics. In this respect they differ from mere statistical description. Thus optimal decision is achieved under conditions of uncertainty, typical for medicine. This applies to diagnosis as well as treatment. In this way a cut-off value can be selected for a given diagnostic test to achieve an optimal combination of the resulting sensitivity and specificity and the probability of disease (health) in case of a positive (negative) finding can be expressed. The results of statistical testing (e. g. the effectiveness of treatment) is as a rule presented by means of the probability value p, as compared with error alpha which should be assessed in advance.

A covariotide model explains apparent phylogenetic structure of oxygenic photosynthetic lineages. Mol Biol Evol. 15:1183-1188) is a simple and easily calculated statistic intended to detect heterotachy by comparing amino acid substitution patterns between two monophyletic groups of protein sequences. It is defined as the difference between the fraction of varied sites in both groups and the fraction of varied sites in each group. The w test has been used to distinguish a covarion process from equal rates and rates variation across sites processes. Using simulation we show that the w test is effective for small data sets and for data sets that have low substitution rates in the groups but can have difficulties when these conditions are not met. Using site entropy as a measure of variability of a sequence site, we modify the w statistic to a w' statistic by assigning as varied in one group those sites that are actually varied in both groups but have a large entropy difference. We show that the w' test has more power to detect two kinds of heterotachy processes (covarion and bivariate rate shifts) in large and variable data. We also show that a test of Pearson's correlation of the site entropies between two monophyletic groups can be used to detect heterotachy and has more power than the w' test. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are settings where the correlation test as well as w and w' tests do not detect heterotachy signals in data simulated under a branch length mixture model. In such cases, it is sometimes possible to detect heterotachy through subselection of appropriate taxa. Finally, we discuss the abilities of the three statistical tests to detect a fourth mode of heterotachy: lineage-specific changes in proportion of variable sites.",

The identifications of preferred adsorption geometries, bond formation, and binding energies are helpful tools for understanding the properties of these particles. This study is focused on a 38-atom gold cluster passivated with 3-hydroxypropanthiolate linkers. Starting from the re-optimized global minimum structure of a bare 38-atom gold cluster (Doye and Wales 1998 New J.

Using this methodology, the space around the gold cluster (with the distance of the S of the thiolate from the gold cluster surface in the range 2.3-2.6 Å) was examined to identify the most favourable absorption site for the thiolate linker. As a result, a 3D map was created and low energy areas corresponding to the potentially most favourable site for one 3-hydroxypropanthiolate linker on the gold cluster localized. Structures representing these areas were further optimized and consequently analysed using Mulliken population analysis to compare charge distribution over the tested structures, Mayer bond order analysis, as well as electron localization function/indicator bond formation analysis.

Atomic force microscopy confirmed 1-2 Å thickness of goldene. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS), selective area electron diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the chemical identity of goldene. We discovered the phenomenon of electric field-induced self-assembly of goldene supracrystals with a herringbone structure and developed an electric field printing (e-print) technique for goldene arrays. Goldene showed a semiconductor response with a knee voltage of ∼3.2 V, and <iI</i/<iV</i spectroscopy revealed periodic room temperature Coulomb blockade oscillations. These observations are consistent with the theoretical calculations reported in the literature predicting enhanced Coulombic interactions between gold valence electrons and the nucleus in stable 2D gold.

The Kr-S distances are 3.438(3) Å and 3.488(6) Å in Kr-SO3 and Kr-SO3-CO, respectively, indicating that the addition of CO to Kr-SO3 increases the Kr-S distance by 0.050(9) Å. Measurements of the (83)Kr nuclear quadrupole coupling constants provide direct probes of the electric field gradient at the Kr nucleus, and a comparison between the two systems reflects the degree to which the CO influences the electronic structure of the krypton atom. Although the Kr and CO in the trimer are on opposite sides of the SO3 and thus are not in direct contact, the addition of CO to Kr-SO3 reduces the electric field gradient at the Kr nucleus by 18%. Calculations using the block localized wavefunction decomposition method are performed to understand the physical origins of this change. While the magnitudes of both the electric field and the electric field gradient at the Kr nucleus decrease upon addition of the CO to Kr-SO3, the changes are shown to arise from rather complex combinations of geometrical distortion, electrostatic, polarization, and electron transfer effects. For the electric field, the electrostatic term accounts for the largest portion of the reduction, while for the electric field gradient, polarization and structural change of the Kr-SO3 moiety make the primary contributions. Despite significant changes in the electronic environment at the Kr nucleus, calculated binding energies indicate that the interactions are largely additive, with the binding energy of the trimer very nearly equal to the sum of the Kr-SO3 and SO3-CO binding energies.

We describe three applications of the developed EC-SFA and discuss the wide-range of potential other applications. In particular, we describe measurements of (1) force-distance profiles between smooth and rough gold surfaces and apposing self-assembled monolayer-covered smooth mica surfaces; (2) the effective changing thickness of anodically growing oxide layers with Å-accuracy on rough and smooth surfaces; and (3) friction forces evolving at a metal-ceramic contact, all as a function of the applied electrochemical potential. Interaction forces between atomically smooth surfaces are well-described using DLVO theory and the Hogg-Healy-Fuerstenau approximation for electric double layer interactions between dissimilar surfaces, which unintuitively predicts the possibility of attractive double layer forces between dissimilar surfaces whose surface potentials have similar sign, and repulsive forces between surfaces whose surface potentials have opposite sign. Surface roughness of the gold electrodes leads to an additional exponentially repulsive force in the force-distance profiles that is qualitatively well described by an extended DLVO model that includes repulsive hydration and steric forces. Comparing the measured thickness of the anodic gold oxide layer and the charge consumed for generating this layer allowed the identification of its chemical structure as a hydrated Au(OH)(3) phase formed at the gold surface at high positive potentials. The EC-SFA allows, for the first time, one to look at complex long-term transient effects of dynamic processes (e.g., relaxation times), which are also reflected in friction forces while tuning electrochemical surface potentials.",

Our calculations show that the ligand density along a radius emanating from the core of an isolated AuNP has the same gross features for all values of the coverage; it oscillates around a constant value up to a distance along the chain corresponding to the position of the fourth pseudo-atom and then smoothly decays to zero, reflecting both the restricted conformations of the chain near the core surface and the larger numbers of conformations available further from the core. Interaction between two AuNPs generates changes in the ligand distributions of each. We examine the structure and general shape of the ligand envelope as a function of the coverage and demonstrate that the equilibrium structure of the envelope and the deformation of that envelope generated by interaction between the NPs are coverage-dependent so that the shape, depth, and position of the minimum of the potential of mean force display a systematic dependence on the ligand coverage. We propose an accurate analytical description of the calculated potential of mean force as a function of a set of parameters that scale linearly with the ligand coverage. Noting that the conformational freedom of the ligands implies that multiparticle induced deviations from additivity of the pair potential of mean force are likely important; we define and calculate a \"bond stretching\" effective pair potential of mean force for a square lattice of particles that contains, implicitly, both the three- and four-NP contributions. We find that the bond stretching effective pair potential of mean force in this cluster has a different minimum and a different well depth from the isolated pair potential of mean force. Previous work has found that the three-particle contribution to deviation from pair additivity is monotonically repulsive, whereas we find that the combined three- and four-particle contributions have an attractive well, implying that the three- and four-particle contributions are of comparable magnitude but opposite sign, thereby suggesting that even higher order correction terms likely play a significant role in the behavior of dense assemblies of many nanoparticles.",

The increasing distance to the cell nucleus will drastically decrease the probability of the emitted alpha particle to hit the nucleus.

Both approaches showed similar resolution curves and nominal resolution values for the 60S dataset, estimated at 2.9 Å. The amount of over-fitting present during frequency-limited refinement was quantitatively analyzed using the high-resolution phase-randomization test, and the results showed no apparent over-fitting.

This work focuses on the adhesive force between radioactive particles and metallic surfaces, which relates to the deposition and resuspension of particles on surrounding surfaces. Scanning surface potential microscopy was employed to measure the surface potential of radioactive gold foil. Atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the adhesive force for gold that acquired surface charge either by irradiation or by application of an equivalent electrical bias. Overall, the adhesive force increases with increasing surface potential or relative humidity. However, a behavior that does not follow the general trend was observed for the irradiated gold at a high decay rate. A comparison between experimental measurements and calculated values revealed that the surface potential promotes adhesion. The contribution of the electrostatic force at high levels of relative humidity was lower than the one found using theoretical calculations due to the effects caused by enhanced adsorption rate of water molecules under a high surface charge density. The results of this study can be used to provide a better understanding of the behavior of radioactive particles in atmospheric systems. ",

The decay scheme of alpha-emitting radionuclides typically includes a chain of unstable progeny. It is generally assumed that alpha-particle emission by the parent radionuclide will break the chemical bond with its carrier molecule and that the resulting daughter atom will no longer be associated with the carrier molecule. If the daughter is very short lived, it will not have enough time to be carried any significant distance from the site of parent decay and a cellular, absorbed dose estimate must consider the energy deposited by the daughter as well as the parent. Depending on the site of parent decay and the expected removal rate of daughter atoms from this site, the contribution of emissions from longer-lived daughters may also be warranted. In this study, dose conversion factors (DCFs) for cellular dimensions that incorporate the fate of daughter radionuclides were derived for (225)Ac, (213)Bi, (211)At, and (223)Ra, the alpha-particle--emitting radionuclides of interest in radionuclide therapy. The dose contribution of daughter radionuclides at the site of parent decay was made dependent on a cutoff time parameter, which was used to estimate the fraction of daughter decays expected at the site of parent decay. Previously tabulated S values (cell-surface to nucleus and cell-surface to cell) for each daughter in the decay scheme were scaled by this fraction and a sum over all daughters was performed to yield a cutoff time--dependent set of corresponding DCF values for each radionuclide. DCF values for the absorbed dose to the nuclear or cellular volume from cell-surface decays are presented as a function of the cutoff time for 4 different cellular and nuclear dimensions. In contrast to the cellular S values that account only for parent decay, the DCF values provided in this study make it possible to easily include the contribution of daughter decays in cellular alpha-particle emitter dose calculations.",

From the resulting force curves we obtained contact angles and detachment forces of single particles. Contact angles of gold coated silica particles were adjusted between 20 degrees and 100 degrees by self-assembling monolayers from different mixtures of undecanethiols and omega-hydroxy undecanethiols from solution. In parallel, contact angles on flat gold surfaces prepared in the same way were determined by the sessile drop method. A systematic difference between contact angles measured with particles and on planar surfaces was observed. Results are discussed in terms of line tension of the three-phase contact line. In addition, detachment forces were measured. Detachment forces were slightly higher than predicted from flotation theory. This might be caused by a pinning of the three phase contact line.

However, difficulties in obtaining sufficient number of long-range distance restraints using dipolar coupling based spectra hamper the process of structure determination of proteins in solid-state NMR. In this study it is shown that high-resolution structure of proteins in solid phase can be determined without the use of traditional dipolar-dipolar coupling based distance restraints by combining the measurements of pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) with Rosetta calculations. The PCSs were generated by chelating exogenous paramagnetic metal ions to a tag 4-mercaptomethyl-dipicolinic acid, which is covalently attached to different residue sites in a 56-residue immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G (GB1). The long-range structural restraints with metal-nucleus distance of up to ∼20 Å are quantitatively extracted from experimentally observed PCSs, and these are in good agreement with the distances back-calculated using an X-ray structure model. Moreover, we demonstrate that using several paramagnetic ions with varied paramagnetic susceptibilities as well as the introduction of paramagnetic labels at different sites can dramatically increase the number of long-range restraints and cover different regions of the protein. The structure generated from solid-state NMR PCSs restraints combined with Rosetta calculations has 0.7 Å root-mean-square deviation relative to X-ray structure. ",

In particular, we study the HI between molecularly smooth hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers, and similarly modified gold-coated AFM tips (radii∼8-50 nm). We present quantitative and direct evidence that the hydrophobic force is both long-ranged and exponential down to distances of about 1-2 nm. Therefore, we introduce a self-consistent radius-normalization for atomic force microscopy data. This approach allows quantitative data fitting of AFM-based experimental data to the recently proposed Hydra-model. With a statistical significance of r(2)⩾0.96 our fitting and data directly reveal an exponential HI decay length of 7.2±1.2 Å that is independent of the salt concentration up to 750 mM. As such, electrostatic screening does not have a significant influence on the HI in electrolyte concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 750 mM. In 1 M solutions the observed instability during approach shifts to longer distances, indicating ion correlation/adsorption effects at high salt concentrations. With increasing temperature the magnitude of HI decreases monotonically, while the range increases slightly.

In the case of excitation between 430 nm and 600 nm, it is found that the molecular ion accesses two dissociation channels with a measured 60:40 branching ratio that is nearly constant over this range of photon energies. The dominant product channel corresponds to Br(-) + CN, while the second channel correlates to spin-orbit excited Br(*) with CN(-). A larger wavelength dependence of the branching ratio is observed at shorter wavelengths, where the fraction of Br(-) based products ranges from 80% to 95% at 355 nm and 270 nm, respectively. These branching ratios are reproduced and the mechanisms are explored by quantum dynamics calculations based on ground and excited state potential energy surfaces for BrCN(-), evaluated at the SO-MRCISD level of theory. It is found that the electronic states that correlate to the two observed product channels are coupled through the spin-orbit terms in the electronic Hamiltonian. The strength of this coupling displays a strong dependence on the Br-CN angle. Specifically, after promotion to the excited state that is energetically accessible with 430-600 nm photons, it is found that when the wave packet accesses Br-CN separations of between 4 Å and 6 Å, predominantly the Br(-) + CN products are formed when the Br-CN angle is smaller than 120°. For larger values of the Br-CN angle, the Br(*) + CN(-) channel dominates. At the shorter wavelength excitation, the dynamics is complicated by a pair of states that correlate to electronically excited CN(*) + Br(-) products that borrow oscillator strength from the bright state, leading to an increase in the amount of Br(-) relative to CN(-). The implications of these findings are discussed and compared to the experimentally measured product branching ratios for the photodissociation of BrCN(-). ",

The use of non-resonant single-photon ionization at 118.2 nm allows detection and velocity-map imaging of all fragments, regardless of their vibrotational or electronic state. The resulting photofragment kinetic energy and angular distributions and the quantum yields of ground-state and spin-orbit excited iodine fragments are in good agreement with previous studies employing state-selective detection via REMPI. The data are readily rationalised in terms of three competing dissociation mechanisms. The dominant excitation at all wavelengths studied is via a parallel transition to the (3)Q0 state, which either dissociates directly to give an alkyl radical partnered by spin-orbit excited iodine, or undergoes radiationless transfer to the (1)Q1 potential surface, where it dissociates to an alkyl radical partnered by iodine in its electronic ground state. Ground state iodine atoms can also be formed by direct dissociation from the (1)Q1 or (3)Q1 excited states following perpendicular excitation at the shorter and longer wavelength region, respectively, in the current range of interest. The extent of internal excitation of the alkyl fragment varies with dissociation mechanism, and is considerably higher for ethyl fragments from ethyl iodide photolysis than for methyl fragments from methyl iodide photolysis. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of single-photon vacuum-ultraviolet ionization relative to the more widely used REMPI detection schemes, and conclude, in agreement with others, that single-photon ionization is a viable detection method for photofragment imaging studies, particularly when studying large molecules possessing multiple fragmentation channels.

In case the initial excited-state population distribution reached after the laser excitation equals on average the thermal distribution, the fluorescence quantum yield becomes pressure independent. This initial distribution critically depends on the temperature-dependent ground-state population before excitation as well as the excitation wavelength. The ability to predict this behavior is a critical check for the validity of the existing photophysical models. The dependence of the effective fluorescence lifetime of anisole on the excitation wavelength (256-270 nm) was investigated at temperatures between 325 and 525 K for pressures between 1 and 4 bar. For each temperature, a unique excitation wavelength was found where the fluorescence lifetime is pressure-independent. The comparison of the experimental results with the predictions based on the established photophysical step-ladder models revealed a systematic underestimation of the required excitation photon energies for direct excitation into the thermalized level. An improved modeling approach based on quantum chemistry calculations for implementing simulated excitation spectra and state-dependent transition probabilities overcomes these limitations.

Depending on the laser wavelength, we find different dominant emission channels identified by the number of photons needed to emit electrons. Based on the band alignment between tungsten and nanodiamond, the relevant emission channels can be identified as specific transitions in diamond and its graphitic boundaries. It is the combination of the character of initial and final states (i.e., bulk or surface-near, direct or indirect excitation in the diamond band structure), the number of photons providing the excitation energy, and the peak intensity of the laser pulses that determines the dominant excitation channel for photoemission. A specific feature of the hydrogen-terminated nanodiamond coating is its negative electron affinity that significantly lowers the work function and enables efficient emission from the conduction band minimum into vacuum without an energy barrier.

Ground (X (2)B(1)) state parent ions were formed by multiphoton ionization of a jet cooled H(2)S(D(2)S) sample, resonance enhanced at the two photon energy by the v=0 level of the (1)A(2)(... 2b(1) (1)4pb(2)(1)) Rydberg state. This Rydberg excited state predissociates sufficiently slowly that the 2+1 resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectrum shows resolved rovibronic structure, thereby allowing full quantum state selectivity at this intermediate stage of the cation preparation process. Analysis of the S(+) ion images following one photon excitation of the resulting H(2)S(+)(D(2)S(+)) cations shows that these fragments are formed in their ground (4)S state, and that the H(2)(D(2)) cofragments are formed predominantly (if not exclusively) in rotational states with either odd or even J rotational quantum number--depending on the chosen REMPI preparation wavelength. This striking specificity for forming ortho- or para-H(2)(D(2)) products can be traced back to the state selectivity introduced in the REMPI preparation step. In the case of H(2)S, therefore, the nuclear spin symmetry of the two equivalent H nuclei in ortho-H(2)S (and H(2)S(+)) carries through into ortho-H(2) products, and para-H(2)S molecules map into para-H(2) fragments, surviving photoionization of the Rydberg state, photolysis of the resulting parent cation, and two subsequent radiationless transitions during the evolution from the photoexcited (A(2)A(1) state) cation through to S((4)S)+H(2) products. We identify two distinct fragmentation pathways. One, which we term route I, involves nonadiabatic (Renner-Teller) coupling to the X state at near linear configurations and subsequent (spin-orbit induced) coupling to the repulsive (4)A(2) potential energy surface (PES) at smaller bond angles. This process operates throughout the photolysis wavelength range investigated and yields rotationally \"cool\" and vibrationally \"cold\" H(2) products. The second (route II) shows a long wavelength threshold lambda approximately 335 nm, and gradually becomes dominant as the photolysis wavelength is reduced. Route II dissociation involves vibronically facilitated nonadiabatic transfer from the A to the B(2)B(2) state, followed by spin-orbit induced transfer to the (4)A(2) PES; the route II fragmentation dynamics results in H(2) products carrying higher levels of rotational and vibrational excitation.",

In this work, we experimentally investigate the photoluminescence (PL) properties of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) samples under near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible excitations (270∼440 nm). Based on the dependence of the PL peak wavelength (λ_{em}) upon the excitation wavelength (λ_{ex}), the PL behaviors of ssDNA can be approximately classified into two categories.

Moreover, the transition channels in different excitation wavelength regimes and the effects of strand length and base type can be analyzed on the basis of these results.

The shape of the rotational distributions is semi-quantitatively explained by a two-dimensional version of the reflection principle. The calculated rotational distribution for excitation with λ = 204 nm and the translational energy distribution for 193 nm agree well with experimental results, except for the tails of the experimental distributions corresponding to excitation of the highest rotational states. Inclusion of nonadiabatic transitions from the excited to the ground electronic state at relatively large N(2)-O separations, studied by trajectory surface hopping, improves the agreement at high j.",

The molecule can adopt either a paddle wheel or a propeller conformation in solution, where the paddle wheel structure possesses a metal-metal bond of 4.4 Å and a dihedral angle between the quasi-C(4v) planes of 0° and the propeller structure has a metal-metal bond of 3.6 Å and a dihedral angle of 17° when crystallized. Each conformation has a distinct absorption in the visible attributed to a (1)(dσ(z)* → pσ(z)) excitation, with the long eclipsed structure absorbing at 475 nm and the short twisted structure absorbing at 585 nm. We independently pumped at each of these visible transitions to form vibrational wavepackets on the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces, which modulated the ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals, respectively. We found that the ground state wavepacket oscillates with a frequency of 48 cm(-1) when pumping the red peak and 11 cm(-1) when pumping the blue peak. We assign these frequencies to the Ir-Ir symmetric stretch, with the variation in frequency reflecting the variation in metal-metal bond strength in support of our assignment of the blue peak to the longer Ir-Ir bond length conformer and the red peak to the shorter Ir-Ir bond length conformer. When pumping the red peak, we found two modes with frequencies of 80 and 119 cm(-1) in the stimulated emission and only one mode at 75 cm(-1) when pumping the blue peak. We assign the 75-80 cm(-1) frequency to the Ir-Ir stretch and the 119 cm(-1) vibration to the dihedral angle twist in the excited state. The variation in the excited state dynamics does not result from the excitation of different electronic states, but rather from excitation to different Franck-Condon regions of the same electronic excited state potential energy surface. This occurs because of the large difference in ground state molecular structure. DFT calculations support the existence of a single electronic excited state being accessed from two distinct structural isomers with conformations similar to those observed with X-ray crystallography.",

The effects of the protein environment on the primary photoexcitation process of retinal were studied by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the algebraic diagrammatic construction through second order (ADC(2)) combined with our recently introduced reduction of virtual space (RVS) approximation method. The calculations were performed on large full quantum chemical cluster models of the bluecone (BC) and rhodopsin (Rh) pigments with 165-171 atoms. Absorption wavelengths of 441 and 491 nm were obtained at the B3LYP level of theory for the respective models, which agree well with the experimental values of 414 and 498 nm. Electrostatic rather than structural strain effects were shown to dominate the spectral tuning properties of the surrounding protein. The Schiff base retinal and a neighboring Glu-113 residue were found to have comparable proton affinities in the ground state of the BC model, whereas in the excited state, the proton affinity of the Schiff base is 5.9 kcal/mol (0.26 eV) higher. For the ground and excited states of the Rh model, the proton affinity of the Schiff base is 3.2 kcal/mol (0.14 eV) and 7.9 kcal/mol (0.34 eV) higher than for Glu-113, respectively. The protein environment was found to enhance the bond length alternation (BLA) of the retinyl chain and blueshift the first absorption maxima of the protonated Schiff base in the BC and Rh models relative to the chromophore in the gas phase. The protein environment was also found to decrease the intensity of the second excited state, thus improving the quantum yield of the photoexcitation process. Relaxation of the BC model on the excited state potential energy surface led to a vanishing BLA around the isomerization center of the conjugated retinyl chain, rendering the retinal accessible for cis-trans isomerization. The energy of the relaxed excited state was found to be 30 kcal/mol (1.3 eV) above the minimum ground state energy, and might be related to the transition state of the thermal activation process.",

The computations were performed using our newly developed methodology, which incorporates the coupled five-dimensional translation-rotation (T-R) eigenstates of the guest molecule as the initial and final states of the INS transitions, and yields highly detailed spectra. Depending on the incident neutron wavelength, the number of computed INS transitions varies from almost 500 to over 2000. The low-temperature INS spectra display the fingerprints of the coupling between the translational and rotational motions of the entrapped HD molecule, which is responsible for the characteristic splitting patterns of the T-R energy levels. INS transitions from the ground T-R state of HD to certain sublevels of excited T-R multiplets have zero intensity and are absent from the spectra. This surprising finding is explained by the new INS selection rule introduced here. The calculated spectra exhibit strong temperature dependence. As the temperature increases, numerous new peaks appear, arising from the transitions originating in excited T-R states which become populated. Our calculations show that the higher temperature features typically comprise two or more transitions close in energy and with similar intensities, interspersed with numerous other transitions whose intensities are negligible. This implies that accurately calculated energies and intensities of INS transitions which our methodology provides will be indispensable for reliable interpretation and assignment of the experimental spectra of HD@C₆₀ and related systems at higher temperatures.",

This allows for accurate modeling of the experimentally observed wavelength dependence of the circular polarization in fluorescence, which directly probes the non-adiabatic nature of the electron-vibration (EV) coupling in this system. The fluorescence photon is emitted from a nuclear geometry in which one MOPV and its two nearest neighbors have a nuclear equilibrium that differs appreciably from the ground state due to the presence of the excited state. The absorption and emission band shape and the circular dichroism are consistent with a coherence range of the emitting excitation of approximately two neighboring molecules. Random fluctuations in the zero-order excited-state energy of the MOPVs (disorder) limit the exciton delocalization and can be described by a Gaussian distribution of energies with a width sigma=0.12 eV and a spatial correlation length l0 approximately 5 molecules.

To appreciate the deep connection between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics we need only recall that in 1901 Planck introduced the quantum of action to calculate the entropy of thermal light, and in 1905 Einstein's studies of the entropy of thermal light led him to introduce the photon. Then in 1917, he discovered stimulated emission by using detailed balance arguments. Half a century later, Scovil and Schulz-DuBois applied detailed balance ideas to show that maser photons were produced with Carnot quantum efficiency (see Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Shockley and Quiesser invoked detailed balance to obtain the efficiency of a photocell illuminated by \"hot\" thermal light (see Fig. 2A). To understand this detailed balance limit, we note that in the QHE, the incident light excites electrons, which can then deliver useful work to a load. However, the efficiency is limited by radiative recombination in which the excited electrons are returned to the ground state. But it has been proven that radiatively induced quantum coherence can break detailed balance and yield lasing without inversion. Here we show that noise-induced coherence enables us to break detailed balance and get more power out of a laser or photocell QHE. Surprisingly, this coherence can be induced by the same noisy (thermal) emission and absorption processes that drive the QHE (see Fig. 3A). Furthermore, this noise-induced coherence can be robust against environmental decoherence.Fig. 1.(A) Schematic of a laser pumped by hot photons at temperature T(h) (energy source, blue) and by cold photons at temperature T(c) (entropy sink, red).

Applying a target model that incorporates photoselection theory, estimates for the cross-sections for stimulated emission and absorption of the first excited state, the amount of ultrafast internal conversion and the underlying species associated dynamics have been determined. The final quantum yields for photoisomerisation were found to be 0.06, 0.14-0.19 and 0.02 for excitation wavelengths 400, 450 and 490 nm and found to increase with increasing pulse durations. Transient absorption measurements and Z-scan measurements at 450 nm, coinciding with the maximum wavelength of the ground state absorption, indicate that the photochemical quantum yield is intrinsically limited by an ultrafast internal conversion reaction as well as by stimulated emission cross-section. With excitation at 400 nm photoisomerisation quantum yield is further significantly limited by competing multi-photon excitation into excited state absorption at 385 nm previously proposed to result in photoionisation. With excitation at 490 nm the photoisomerisation quantum yield is predominantly limited further by the significantly higher stimulated emission cross-section compared to ground state cross-section as well as multi-photon processes. In addition to photoionisation, a second product of multi-photon excitation is identified and characterised by an induced absorption at 500 nm and a time constant of 2 ps for relaxation. With power densities up to 138 GW cm(-2) the measurements have not provided indication for coherent multi-photon absorption of PYP.

The geometries of the dimer and two monomers are optimized in the singlet ground and lowest-energy triplet excited states (LLTS's) to interpret absorption and emission behaviors, respectively.

However, the most omnipresent Bose gas, blackbody radiation (radiation in thermal equilibrium with the cavity walls) does not show this phase transition. In such systems photons have a vanishing chemical potential, meaning that their number is not conserved when the temperature of the photon gas is varied; at low temperatures, photons disappear in the cavity walls instead of occupying the cavity ground state. Theoretical works have considered thermalization processes that conserve photon number (a prerequisite for BEC), involving Compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons or photon-photon scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration. Number-conserving thermalization was experimentally observed for a two-dimensional photon gas in a dye-filled optical microcavity, which acts as a 'white-wall' box. Here we report the observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons in this system. The cavity mirrors provide both a confining potential and a non-vanishing effective photon mass, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped, massive bosons. The photons thermalize to the temperature of the dye solution (room temperature) by multiple scattering with the dye molecules. Upon increasing the photon density, we observe the following BEC signatures: the photon energies have a Bose-Einstein distribution with a massively populated ground-state mode on top of a broad thermal wing; the phase transition occurs at the expected photon density and exhibits the predicted dependence on cavity geometry; and the ground-state mode emerges even for a spatially displaced pump spot.

For geometry optimizations on the ground- and excited-state Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces (PESs), we employ density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations. Harmonic normal-mode analyses are carried out for the electronic ground state at Franck-Condon geometries. A diabatic Hamiltonian, comprising four low-lying singlet excited electronic states and 26 vibrational degrees of freedom of CPP, is constructed within the linear vibronic coupling (VC) model to elucidate the absorption spectral features in the range of 300-500 nm. Quantum nuclear dynamics is simulated within the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree approach to calculate the vibronic structure of the excited electronic states. The symmetry-forbidden S0 → S1 transition appears in the longer wavelength region of the spectrum with weak intensity due to VC. It is found that the Jahn-Teller and pseudo-Jahn-Teller effects in the doubly degenerate S2 and S3 electronic states are essential in the quantitative interpretation of the experimental observation of a broad absorption peak around 340 nm. The vibronic mixing of the S1 state with higher electronic states is responsible for the efficient photoluminescence from the S1 state. The fluorescence properties are characterized on the basis of the stationary points of the excited-state PESs. The findings reveal that vibronic effects become important in determining the photophysical properties of CPPs with increased ring size. ",

This phenomenon is utilized in optical highlighters, such as photoactivatable GFP (PA-GFP). Using state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations, we investigate the feasibility of the mechanism proposed in the experimental studies [van Thor et al. Nature Struct. Biol.2002, 9, 37-41; Bell et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc.2003, 125, 37-41]. It was hypothesized that a primary event of this photoconversion involves population of a charge-transfer (CT) state via either the first excited state S1 when using longer wavelength (404 and 476 nm) or a higher excited state when using higher energy radiation (254 and 280 nm). Based on the results of electronic structure calculations, we identify these critical CT states (produced by electron transfer from Glu to electronically excited Chro) and show that they are accessible via different routes, i.e., either directly, by one-photon absorption, or through a two-step excitation via S1. The calculations are performed for model systems representing the chromophore and the key nearby residues using two complementary approaches: (i) the multiconfigurational quasidegenerate perturbation theory of second order with the occupation restricted multiple active space scheme for configuration selection in the multiconfigurational self-consistent field reference; and (ii) the single-reference configuration interaction singles method with perturbative doubles that does not involve active space selection. We examined electronic transitions with nonzero oscillator strengths in the UV and visible range between the electronic states involving the Chro and Glu residues. Both methods predict the existence of CT states with nonzero oscillator strength in the UV range and a local excited state of the chromophore accessible via S1 that may lead to the target CT state. The results suggest several possible scenarios for the primary photoconversion event. We also demonstrate that the point mutation Thr203His exploited in PA-GFP results in shifting the light wavelength to access the CT up to 20 nm, which suggests a possibility of a rational design of photoactivatable proteins in silico.

Combining it with single-quantum two-dimensional (1Q2D) electronic spectroscopy enables one to determine the strength of the excited state absorption transition and the relative detuning of electronic states, as well as the dynamics of the single-quantum coherence. To investigate the correlation of spectral fluctuations in different electronically excited states, we have carried out experiments on a solvated dye (Rhodamine 6G) with 23 fs pulses centered at the maximum of the linear absorption spectrum. The 2Q2D spectrum reveals three peaks of alternating signs with the major negative peak located at higher frequencies along the emission axis compared to the single positive peak. The 1Q2D spectrum, on the other hand, shows a negative peak stemming from excited state absorption at lower frequencies along the emission axis. Analysis of the signal in the homogeneous limit fails to account for this observation as well as the number of peaks in the 2Q2D spectrum. Employing a three-level model in which all time correlations of the third-order response function are accounted for via second-order cumulant expansion gives good agreement with both the 1Q2D and 2Q2D data. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the fluctuations of the probed electronic states are highly correlated, reflecting the modulation by a common nuclear bath and similarities in the nature of the electronic transitions.",

Peak 2PA cross sections of neutral and ED-substituted Pt complexes occur at S<sub0</sub → S<subn</sub transitions to higher energy states, above the lowest-energy S<sub0</sub → S<sub1</sub transition, and the corresponding values increase systematically with increasing ED strength, reaching maximum value, σ<sub2</sub ∼ 300 GM (1 GM = 10<sup-50</sup cm<sup4</sup s), for R = NPh<sub2</sub.

We explained this effect by breaking of inversion symmetry due to conformational distortions associated with low energy barrier for ground-state rotation of the ligands. Our findings are corroborated by theoretical calculations that show large increase of the permanent electric dipole moment change in the S<sub0</sub → S<sub1</sub transition when ligands with strong EW substituents are twisted by 90° relative to the planar chromophore. Our NLT results in the S<sub0</sub → S<sub1</sub transition region are quantitatively similar to those obtained from the 2PEF measurement. However, at higher transition energy corresponding to S<sub0</sub → S<subn</sub transition region, the NLT method yields effective multiphoton absorption stronger than the 2PEF measurement in the same systems. Such enhancement is observed in all Pt complexes as well as in all ligand chromophores studied, and we tentatively attribute this effect to nearly saturated excited-state absorption (ESA), which may occur if 2PA from the ground state is immediately followed by strongly allowed 1PA to higher excited states.",

When introduced into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), its base-pairing and base-stacking properties are similar to those of adenine. Of particular interest, the fluorescence quantum yield of 8VA is sensitive to base stacking, making it a very useful real-time probe of DNA structure. The fundamental photophysics underlying this fluorescence quenching by base stacking is not well understood, and thus exploring the excited state electronic structure of the analog is warranted. In this study, we report on changes in the electronic structure of 8VA upon optical excitation. Stark spectroscopy was performed on 8VA monomer in frozen ethanol glass at 77 K to obtain the direction and degree of charge redistribution in the form of the difference dipole moment, Deltamu(01) = 4.7 +/- 0.3 D, and difference static polarizability, tr(Delta(alpha)01) = 21 +/- 11 A(3), for the S(0)--&gt;S(1) transition. In addition, solvatochromism experiments were performed on 8VA in various solvents and analyzed using Bakhshiev's model. High level ab initio methods were employed to calculate transition energies, oscillator strengths, and dipole moments of the ground and excited states of 8VA. The direction of Deltamu(01) was assigned in the molecular frame for the lowest optically accessible state. Our study shows that the angle between ground and excited state dipole moment plays a critical role in understanding the change in electronic structure upon optical excitation. Compared to 2AP, 8VA has a larger difference dipole moment which, with twice the extinction coefficient, suggests that 8VA is superior as a two-photon probe for microscopy studies. To this end, we have measured the ratio of the two-photon fluorescence yields of the two analogs by excitation at the respective monomer absorption maxima. We show that 8VA is indeed a significantly brighter two-photon fluorophore, based on our experimental and computational results.",

The infrared (975-nm) pulse with a duration of 4 ns pumps the ground state to the 4f excited state with the transition of (2)F(5/2) ← (2)F(7/2), and the second photon (355-nm) generates the charge transfer (CT) state of Cl 3p to Yb 4f; the reduction then occurs. Laser energy and excitation wavelength dependencies well-explain the above mechanism. The product Yb(2+) was detected by its absorption spectrum peak at 367 nm. The absorption spectrum of the intermediate in the two-photon chemistry was measured from the 4f excited state ((2)F(5/2)) to the CT state by nanosecond laser photolysis. The intermediate spectrum appears in the wavelengths shorter than 400 nm with the molar extinction coefficient on the order of (10(2) M(-1) cm(-1)) at 340 nm and can be explained in terms of the CT absorption shifted by IR photon energy. A UV nanosecond laser pulse (266 nm from a YAG laser with a duration of 6 ns) can generate the reactive CT state by one-photon absorption and leads to Yb(2+) formation. The reaction yields for single-photon UV excitation and the second photon in the two-photon excitation are on the order of 0.1, suggesting that the reactive states are a common CT state.",

All these stable heterocyclic compounds are fully characterized, and exhibit intense single- and two-photon excited fluorescence (SPEF and TPEF) over a wide spectral range from blue to red, with the spectral peak position of the SPEF being basically the same as that of the TPEF. The well-conjugated pi-systems, observed from the crystal structure, indicate the charge transfer feature of the ground state. Meanwhile, the theoretical and experimental studies indicate that the charge transfer from donor to acceptor is greatly enhanced in the excited states and the different substituted donor groups on the pyrimidine have a large effect on the optical and electrochemical properties. Based on typical structure data and comprehensive spectral data, the following structure-property relationships can be determined: for such bent-shaped chromophores, the absorption and the fluorescence wavelength maximum of the SPEF and TPEF, and two-photon absorption cross sections show a similar trend with increasing electron-donating strength of the corresponding terminal group and the number of branches, while the average bond lengths of the pi-linkage and HOMO-LUMO energy levels show an inverse trend. Experimental data and theoretical calculation provide a coherent picture. With these findings, bent-shaped quadrupolar chromophores combining peak TPA cross sections (up to 2280 GM), broad TPA bands throughout the whole 700-900 nm range, and high fluorescence quantum yields could, thus, be obtained. Such compounds are of particular interest for TPEF microscopy, as well as optical data storage in the visible and NIR regions.

In a semiconductor quantum dot, radiative Auger is predicted for charged excitons<sup5</sup. Here we report the observation of radiative Auger on trions in single quantum dots. For a trion, a photon is created on electron-hole recombination, leaving behind a single electron. The radiative Auger process promotes this additional (Auger) electron to a higher shell of the quantum dot. We show that the radiative Auger effect is a powerful probe of this single electron: the energy separations between the resonance fluorescence and the radiative Auger emission directly measure the single-particle splittings of the electronic states in the quantum dot with high precision. In semiconductors, these single-particle splittings are otherwise hard to access by optical means as particles are excited typically in pairs, as excitons. After the radiative Auger emission, the Auger carrier relaxes back to the lowest shell. Going beyond the original theoretical proposals, we show how applying quantum optics techniques to the radiative Auger photons gives access to the single-electron dynamics, notably relaxation and tunnelling. This is also hard to access by optical means: even for quasi-resonant p-shell excitation, electron relaxation takes place in the presence of a hole, complicating the relaxation dynamics. The radiative Auger effect can be exploited in other semiconductor nanostructures and quantum emitters in the solid state to determine the energy levels and the dynamics of a single carrier.",

Complementary UV absorption and, at the longest excitation wavelengths, one photon resonant multiphoton ionisation spectra of 2,5-DMP are reported also; analysis of the latter highlights the role of methyl torsional motions in promoting the parent absorption. The deduced fragmentation dynamics show parallels with that reported recently (B. Cronin, M. G. D. Nix, R. H. Qadiri and M. N. R. Ashfold, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2004, 6, 5031) for the bare pyrrole molecule. Excitation at the longer wavelengths leads to (vibronically induced) population of the 1(1)A(2)(pisigma*) excited state of 2,5-DMP, but once lambda(phot) decreases to approximately 250 nm stronger, dipole allowed transitions start to become apparent in the parent absorption. All total kinetic energy release (TKER) spectra of the H + 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl (2,5-DMPyl) fragments measured at lambda(phot)&gt; or=244 nm show a structured fast component, many of which are dominated by a peak with TKER approximately 5100 cm(-1); analysis of this structure reveals lambda(phot) dependent population of selected vibrational levels of 2,5-DMPyl, and enables determination of the N-H bond strength in 2,5-DMP: D(0) = 30 530 +/- 100 cm(-1). Two classes of behaviour are proposed to account for details of the observed energy partitioning. Both assume that N-H bond fission involves passage over (or tunnelling through) a small exit channel barrier on the 1(1)A(2) potential energy surface, but differ according to the vibrational energy content of the photo-prepared molecules. Specific parent out-of-plane skeletal modes that promote the 1(1)A(2)-X(1)A(1) absorption appear to evolve adiabatically into the corresponding vibrations of the 2,5-DMPyl products. Methyl torsions can also promote the 1(1)A(2)&lt;-- X(1)A(1) absorption in 2,5-DMP, and provide a means of populating a much higher density of excited vibrational levels than in pyrrole. Such excited levels are deduced to dissociate by redistributing the minimum amount of internal energy necessary to overcome the exit channel barrier in the N-H dissociation coordinate. Coupling with the ground state surface via a conical intersection at extended N-H bond lengths is proposed as a further mechanism for modest translational --&gt; vibrational energy transfer within the separating products. The parent absorption cross-section increases considerably at wavelengths approximately 250 nm, and PTS spectra recorded at lambda(phot)&lt; or = 254 nm display a second, unstructured, peak at lower TKER. As in pyrrole, this slower component is attributed to H atoms from the unimolecular decay of highly vibrationally excited ground state molecules formed via radiationless decay from photo-excited states lying above the 1(1)A(2) state.",

Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art.

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors. To account for this, this work proposes a sensor interface with $\\mathrm {C}_{P}$ canceller. By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

Our approach consists in designing and combining a coherent set of visual, auditory and haptic cues to represent the avatar's cardiac and respiratory activity. These sensory cues are modulated depending on the avatar's simulated physical exertion. We notably introduce a novel haptic technique to represent respiratory activity using a compression belt simulating abdominal movements that occur during a breathing cycle. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the influence of our multi-sensory rendering techniques on various aspects of the VR user experience, including the sense of virtual embodiment and the sensation of effort during a walking simulation. A first study ($\\mathrm{N}=30$) that focused on displaying cardiac activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort. A second study ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) that focused on respiratory activity showed that combining sensory modalities significantly enhances the sensation of effort as well as two sub-components of the sense of embodiment. Interestingly, the user's actual breathing tended to synchronize with the simulated breathing, especially with the multi-sensory and haptic displays. A third study ($\\mathrm{N}=18$) that focused on the combination of cardiac and respiratory activity showed that combining both rendering techniques significantly enhances the sensation of effort. Taken together, our results promote the use of our novel breathing display technique and multi-sensory rendering of physiological parameters in VR applications where effort sensations are prominent, such as for rehabilitation, sport training, or exergames.",

The purpose of this paper is to experimentally optimize the energy thresholds and tube voltage for single-exposure DE x-ray angiography. We optimized single-exposure DE x-ray angiography using the iodine signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) per root patient air kerma (κ) as a figure of merit. We measured the iodine SDNR by imaging an iodine stepwedge immersed in a water tank with a depth of 30 cm in the direction of x-ray propagation. The stepwedge was imaged using tube voltages ranging from 90 to 150 kV and a cadmium telluride (CdTe) x-ray detector with two energy bins and analog charge summing for charge sharing suppression. The energy threshold that separates the two energy bins was varied from approximately 35 keV to approximately 75% of the maximum energy of the x-ray beam.

The optimal energy thresholds increased monotonically from ∼50 to ∼85 keV over the range of tube voltages considered.

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the \"portullugo\" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (~ 2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with ~ 50% matrix completeness across data sets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support: Anacampserotaceae $+$ Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees. Our results add to the growing number of examples illustrating the complexity of phylogenetic signals in genomic-scale data.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P &lt; 10-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P = 0.003) but was unaffected by CO (P = 0.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure.

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation. Stimulus-induced cortical hyperactivity persisted up to 1.5 h and decayed to baseline after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ indicated by c-Fos expression. The synaptic proteins VGLUT1 and PSD-95, in contrast, were upregulated at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and downregulated at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$, respectively. Spine density and spine head volume were also increased at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and decreased at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$. This specific sequence of events reflects a continuous joint evolution of activity and connectivity that is characteristic of the model of homeostatic structural plasticity. Our computer simulations thus corroborate the observed empirical evidence from our animal experiments.",

The estimated 3D field maps generated with a 0.6 mm isotropic spatial resolution provide overall similar off-resonance corrections compared to reference corrections based on an external <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"<mml:semantics<mml:mrow<mml:miΔ</mml:mi<mml:msub<mml:miB</mml:mi<mml:mn0</mml:mn</mml:msub</mml:mrow<mml:annotation$$ \\Delta {\\mathrm{B}}_0 $$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics</mml:math acquisitions, and even improved for 2 of 4 individuals.

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors. To account for this, this work proposes a sensor interface with $\\mathrm {C}_{P}$ canceller. By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments.

The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL.

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity.

However, classical methods that use least-squares (LS) or maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are unsatisfactory at higher noise levels because the underlying inverse problem is ill-posed. This article provides a pipeline to enhance the synthesis of such images in three-dimensional (3D) using a deep learning (DL) neural network architecture for spatial regularization in a personalized setting where having more than a few training images is impractical. Our DL enhancements employ a Deep Image Prior (DIP) with a U-net type denoising architecture that includes situations with minimal training data, such as personalized syn-MRI. We provide a general workflow for syn-MRI from three or more training images. Our workflow, called DIPsyn-MRI, uses DIP to enhance training images, then obtains parametric images using LS or MLE before synthesizing images at desired design parameter settings. DIPsyn-MRI is implemented in our publicly available Python package DeepSynMRI available at: https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI. We demonstrate feasibility and improved performance of DIPsyn-MRI on 3D datasets acquired using the Brainweb interface for spin-echo and FLASH imaging sequences, at different noise levels. Our DL enhancements improve syn-MRI in the presence of different intensity nonuniformity levels of the magnetic field, for all but very low noise levels. This article provides recipes and software to realistically facilitate DL-enhanced personalized syn-MRI.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art.

This model suffers two deficiencies: (a) it does not account for experimental entropy differences of +/-2% among elemental liquids and (b) it implies a value of zero for the transit contribution to internal energy. The purpose of this paper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for entropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of +/-0.1% to the available experimental high-temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two nuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution S_{vib}(T/theta_{0}) , where T is temperature and theta_{0} is the vibrational characteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution S_{tr}(T/theta_{tr}) , where theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each liquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the liquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the V-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to internal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived in a single formula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike. An ab initio calculation of theta_{0} , based on density-functional theory, is reported for liquid Na and Cu. Comparison of these calculations with the above analysis of experimental entropy data provides verification of V-T theory. In view of the present results, techniques currently being applied in ab initio simulations of liquid properties can be employed to advantage in the further testing and development of V-T theory.",

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician. In a cohort of 28 subjects with a history of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, we compared the PeriVib performance with two established threshold sensing systems: (1) a Biothesiometer device and (2) a tuning fork.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60±30% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30°30% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4±17% of the early group and 13±24% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009±0.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01± 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO).

We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315 $\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50 $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

The obtained value at the transition temperature for the Mn(iii) complex is DeltaS(vib)(44 K) = 6.3 J K(-1) mol(-1), which is comparable with the proposed Jahn-Teller contribution of R ln3 = 9.1 J K(-1) mol(-1) and which is approximately half of the experimentally determined 13.8 J K(-1) mol(-1). The corresponding value for the Cr(ii) complex is DeltaS(vib)(171.45 K) = 46.5 J K(-1) mol(-1), as compared to the experimental value of 39.45 J K(-1) mol(-1). The analysis of the vibrational normal modes reveals that for the d(4) systems under study, contrary to Fe(ii) d(6) systems, not all metal-ligand stretching vibrations make a contribution. For the Mn(iii) complex, the only vibration that contributes to DeltaS(vib) involve the nitrogens occupying the Jahn-Teller axis, while in the case of Cr(ii) the contributing vibrations involve the Cr-I bonds. Low-frequency modes due to ring vibrations, metal-ligand bending and movement of the molecule as a whole also contribute to the vibrational entropy associated with the spin transition.",

Theoretical frequencies of vibrations perpendicular to the C(3) axis (E type) are in good agreement with experimental values, while the axial vibrations (MX and M...N stretchings) demonstrate a significant discrepancy with experimental spectra recorded for the crystalline state. This discrepancy stems from the well-known difference in the MX and M...N bond lengths in gas and solid state. The force constant scaling procedure was used to compensate for this difference. As a result a set of scaling factors was refined for 1-Cl-germatrane (the unique atrane for which the distinction between A and E modes was experimentally established). This set was transferred to the theoretical force fields of other atranes, which provided a fair reproduction of their experimental frequencies. The analysis of the normal modes allowed us to assign the ν M...N mode to bands in the 180-270 cm(-1) frequency range, although large contributions of these coordinates are in two other modes in the 450-500 cm(-1) and 600-800 cm(-1) frequency ranges.

Furthermore, we expect that plastic surgeons can use models in clinical work to enhance communication efficiency between doctors and patients.

The preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion can be predicted on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations including electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, most chemists and physicists are unaware of how the observed and/or calculated spin orientations are related to the local electronic structures of the magnetic ions. This is true even for most crystallographers who determine the directions and magnitudes of spin moments because, for them, they are merely the parameters needed for the diffraction refinements. The objective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework of thinking about and predicting the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion by examining the relationship between the spin orientation and the local electronic structure of the ion. In general, a magnetic ion M (i.e., an ion possessing unpaired spins) in a solid or a molecule is surrounded with main-group ligand atoms L to form an MLn polyhedron, where n is typically 4-6, and the d states of MLn are split because the antibonding interactions of the metal d orbitals with the p orbitals of the surrounding ligands L depend on the symmetries of the orbitals involved.1 The magnetic ion M of MLn has a certain preferred spin direction because its split d states interact among themselves under SOC.2,3 The preferred spin direction can be readily predicted on the basis of perturbation theory in which the SOC is taken as perturbation and the split d states as unperturbed states by inspecting the magnetic quantum numbers of its d orbitals present in the HOMO and LUMO of the MLn polyhedron. This is quite analogous to how chemists predict whether a chemical reaction is symmetry-allowed or symmetry-forbidden in terms of the HOMO-LUMO interactions by simply inspecting the symmetries of the frontier orbitals.4,5 Experimentally, the determination of the preferred spin orientations of magnetic ions requires a sophisticated level of experiments, for example, neutron diffraction measurements for magnetic solids with an ordered spin state at a very low temperature. Theoretically, it requires an elaborate level of electronic structure calculations, namely, DFT calculations including electron correlation and SOC. We show that the outcomes of such intricate experimental measurements and theoretical calculations can be predicted by a simple perturbation theory analysis. ",

While for the V-based compounds the values of the MAE are only of the order of 0.05-0.5 meV per metal atom, increasing the spin-orbit strength by substituting V with heavier Nb and Ta allows one to achieve an increase in anisotropy values by one to two orders of magnitude.

We therefore turn the investigation around and use constrained spin calculations, fixing the global magnetic moment. This approach provides direct insight into local and global energy minima (reflecting metastable and stable spin phases) as well as the curvature of the energy surface, which correlates with the magnetic entropy and thus the magnetic configuration space accessible at finite temperatures.

The magnetic systems of Co<sub3</subW clean surface, Co|Co<sub3</subW bilayer and superlattice can present large MAEs, and their easy-axes of magnetization are perpendicular to the (001) surface. Our calculated MAEs are of the same order of magnitude as that of the experimental measurements, and the electronic origin is revealed through the second-order perturbation method.",

Cu-NP showed a marked near-IR maximum absorption compared to Cu-P and, accordingly, a smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gap, calculated via the electrochemical results and simulations in the gas phase, as well as for Cu-NP from its crystallographic data. An electron-spin resonance (ESR) technique is used to extract the g values from the powder spectra that are taken at room temperature. The g values were determined to be g<sub∥</sub = 2.160 and g<sub⊥</sub = 2.045 for Cu-P and g<sub∥</sub = 2.150 and g<sub⊥</sub = 2.050 for Cu-NP. These values indicate that the paramagnetic copper center in both phthalocyanines has axial symmetry with a planar anisotropy ( g<sub∥</sub &gt; g<sub⊥</sub). The ESR spectra in solution could be obtained only for Cu-P. Curie law is used to fit the experimental data of the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature graphs, and the Curie constant ( C) and diamagnetic/temperature-independent paramagnetic (α) contributions are deduced as 0.37598 (0.39576) cm<sup3</sup·K/mol and -23 × 10<sup-5</sup (25 × 10<sup-5</sup) cm<sup3</sup/mol respectively for Cu-P and Cu-NP.

Cu-NP's room temperature magnetic moment value is larger than the value for Cu-P, demonstrating that the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment depends upon the substituent position. The magnitudes of the effective magnetic moment values also support that both Cu-P and Cu-NP complexes have square-planar coordination. This result is consistent with the determined g values. The spin densities were determined experimentally, and the results suggest that the positions of the substituents affect these values (0.469 for Cu-P and 0.490 for Cu-NP).",

The influence of the strong magnetic moments of the 3d atoms on the spin and orbital moments of the 5d atoms, and the influence of the strong spin-orbit coupling contributed by the 5d atom on the orbital moments of the 3d atoms have been studied in detail. The magnetic anisotropy energy is found to depend very sensitively on the nature of the eigenstates in the vicinity of the Fermi level, as determined by band filling, exchange splitting and spin-orbit coupling. The large magnetic anisotropy energy of free PtCo and IrCo dimers relative to the easy direction parallel to the dimer axis is coupled to a strong anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moments of the Co atom for both dimers, and also on the Ir atom in IrCo. In contrast the PtFe dimer shows a weak perpendicular anisotropy and only small spin and orbital anisotropies of opposite sign on the two atoms. For dimers supported on graphene, the strong binding within the dimer and the stronger interaction of the 3d atom with the substrate stabilizes an upright geometry. Spin and orbital moments on the 3d atom are strongly quenched, but due to the weaker binding within the dimer the properties of the 5d atom are more free-atom-like with increased spin and orbital moments. The changes in the magnetic moment are reflected in the structure of the electronic eigenstates near the Fermi level, for all three dimers the easy magnetic direction is now parallel to the dimer axis and perpendicular to the graphene layer. The already very large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of IrCo is further enhanced by the interaction with the support, the MAE of PtFe changes sign, and that of the PtCo dimer is reduced. These changes are discussed in relation to the relativistic electronic structure of free and supported dimers and it is demonstrated that the existence of a partially occupied quasi-degenerate state at the Fermi level favors the formation of a large magnetic anisotropy.

This work reports on the paramagnetic state of the [2Fe-2S](+) cluster in PuxB, both alone and in the PuR-PuxB complex. Aided by the X-ray crystal structure of PuxB, the protons nearest to the reduced [2Fe-2S](+) cluster were used as magnetic probes to quantify the g-matrix orientation and anisotropic magnetic moment of the paramagnetic centre. (1)H hyperfine couplings were measured with W-band Davies ENDOR and X-band HYSCORE spectroscopy and fitted to a model in which (1)H dipolar couplings were calculated assuming point magnetic moments located at the Fe ions, and bridging and coordinating cysteine sulfur atoms. The absolute sign of a (1)H hyperfine coupling was measured using a variable mixing time ENDOR experiment to confirm the assignment of the Fe(3+) and Fe(2+) ions. For the anti-ferromagnetically coupled cluster the magnetic moment is described in terms of spin projection factors, and our analysis yields values of K(exp)(A) = +2.33 to +1.85 (ferric site), and K(exp)(B) = -1.33 to -0.85 (ferrous site).

However, nonvolatile control on the valley and spin degrees of freedom of two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials by multiferroic materials has been rarely reported. Here, the electronic structure of monolayer 2H-VSe2/BiFeO3(111) triferroic heterostructures has been investigated by first-principles calculations. It is found that the V magnetic moment, spin and valley splitting of monolayer VSe2 can be affected by the BiFeO3(111) substrate with ferroelectric polarization and G-type antiferromagnetic order. Particularly, the reversed orientation of ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order of the BiFeO3(111) substrate can modulate the magnitude of spin and valley splitting, and change the spin splitting direction and the spin-dependent valley state in the valence band of monolayer VSe2. The coupling among ferroelectrics, magnetism and ferrovalley is realized in 2H-VSe2/BiFeO3(111) triferroic heterostructures. These results provide a new platform for multiferroic regulation in spintronics and valleytronics, which can enrich the diversity for high-performance devices based on two dimensional multiferroic heterostructures.",

The strength and relative importance of these spin phenomena are determined by the magnitude and sign of the exchange interaction between the localized magnetic moments and also by the mean distance between them. Detailed studies of such systems require the ability to tune the mean distance between the localized magnetic moments, which is equivalent to being able to control the concentration of magnetic impurities in the host material. Here, we present a method for doping a gold film with localized magnetic moments that involves depositing a monolayer of a metal terpyridine complex onto the film. The metal ions in the complexes can be cobalt or zinc, and the concentration of magnetic impurities in the gold film can be controlled by varying the relative amounts of cobalt complexes (which carry a spin) and zinc complexes (which have zero spin).

The electron spin-nuclear spin interaction term, Tab(SaΔIb + SbΔIa) mixes ortho (I = 1) and para (I = 0) levels to cause the \"forbidden\" ortho to para |ΔI| = 1 transition. The mixing term with Tab = 72.0 MHz is 4 orders of magnitude higher for H2O(+) than for its neutral counterpart H2O where the magnetic field interacting with proton spins is by molecular rotation rather than the free electron. The resultant 10(8) increase of ortho to para conversion rate possibly makes the effect of conversion in H2O(+) measurable in laboratories and possibly explains the anomalous ortho to para ratio recently reported by Herschel heterodyne instrument for the far-infrared (HIFI) observation. Results of our calculations show that the ortho ↔ para mixings involving near-degenerate ortho and para levels are high (∼10(-3)), but they tend to occur at high energy levels, ∼300 K. Because of the rapid spontaneous emission, such high levels are not populated in diffuse clouds unless the radiative temperature of the environment is very high. The low-lying 101 (para) and 111 (ortho) levels of H2O(+) are mixed by ∼10(-4) making the spontaneous emission lifetime for the para 101 → ortho 000 transition 520 years and 5200 years depending on the F value of the hyperfine structure. Thus the ortho ↔ para conversion due to the unpaired electron is not likely to seriously affect thermalization of interstellar H2O(+) unless either the radiative temperature is very high or number density of the cloud is very low.

The moment further increases when Mn-Ga antisite defect [1] is included in the calculation. A reasonable estimate of TC for Mn(2)NiGa is obtained from the exchange parameters for the disordered structure. Disorder influences the electronic structure of Mn(2)NiGa through overall broadening of the density of states and a decrease in the exchange splitting. Inclusion of antisite defects marginally broaden the minority spin partial DOS (PDOS), while the majority spin PDOS is hardly affected.

Our calculation result indicates that the five elements of V-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, and Cu-doped monolayer MoS2 at low impurity concentration all give rise to the good diluted magnetic semiconductors.

In contrast, Co and Cu doping both give the higher total magnetic moment. Especially, Cu doping induces strong ferromagnetism relative to the local spins. However, the atomic structures of Co- and Cu-doped MoS2 deviate from the original prismatic configuration, and the magnetic moments of the doped systems decrease at 12 % impurity concentration although both elements give higher magnetic moments at 8 % impurity concentration.

Here, in order to induce the spin polarization of monolayer SnO by magnetic proximity effects, the spin-dependent electronic structure of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) SnO/CrN heterostructures is calculated using first-principles calculations by considering different strains and interlayer distances. When the interlayer distance of the heterostructure increases, the Sn magnetic moment decreases, but the Cr magnetic moment increases. As the interlayer distance decreases, the band gap of SnO decreases in the spin-down channel because of the enhancements in orbital overlap and hybridization.

With an increase in tensile strain, the Fermi level of monolayer SnO moves down and p-type doping appears.

We will review its physical origin and present some recent calculations on naturally magnetic layered materials, so-called helical spin density waves.

In this paper, we report on the vibrational spectrum of the CoO(4) molecule in its ground and first low-lying excited states. Isotopic substitutions using (16)O(2) and (18)O(2) precursors, as well as (16)O(2) + (18)O(2) and (16)O(2) +( 16)O(18)O + (18)O(2) mixtures in either excess argon or neon, enable demonstration of C(2)(v)() and C(s)() structures for the respective states. CoO(4) is formed following molecular diffusion by complexation of ground-state CoO(2) by an O(2) molecule. The molecule is first formed in the excited state and then spontaneously relaxes to the ground state after remaining in the dark. The kinetics of relaxation can be fitted to a first-order exponential decay with an excited-state lifetime estimated around 23 +/- 2 min in argon and 15 +/- 2 min in neon, indicative of a slow, spin-forbidden process. Population of the excited state is induced by photons around 4250 +/- 250 cm(-1). Experimental results are compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the BPW91/6-311G(3df) level. Electronic and geometrical optimizations were carried out starting from the ground-state precursors (i.e., (3)Sigma(g)(-) for O(2) and (2)Sigma(g)(+) for CoO(2)). Calculations predict a (2)A(2) (C(2)(v)()) ground state and a (4)A' (C(s)()) first excited state 0.37 eV above, close to the 4250 +/- 250 cm(-1) experimental excitation energy. The transition pathway is found to involve two supplementary states with crossed potential energy surfaces (PESs): a (2)B(1) excited state, 0.48 eV above the ground state, reached first through an adiabatic transition with a photon around 4800 cm(-1), and a (4)B(1) transition state into which the system relaxes before finally attaining the (4)A' (C(s)()) excited state.

They were then used in an empirical rule of plot linking force constants and internuclear distances in order to obtain an estimate of the Co-O bond lengths for each state and are compared to the DFT predictions.",

Irradiation with light in the blue spectral range leads to the population of SI, while SII can be obtained by transferring SI into SII with irradiation of light in the near infrared spectral range.

The observations are compared with the ground state potential surface calculated by density functional theory, where the metastable states correspond to a side-on bonded (SII) and isonitrosyl (SI) configuration of the NO ligand. The calculations provide the energetic minima of the ground state and the metastable states SI and SII as well as the saddle points along the reaction coordinate Q, which corresponds roughly to a rotation of the NO ligand by about 90 degrees (SII) and 180 degrees (SI), and therefore allows for the comparison between observed and calculated activation energies.",

Two visible excitation bands for neutral TiC are observed at 16,446 and 16,930 cm(-1). Based on rotational analyses, these bands are assigned as the respective TiC((3)Π1) ← TiC(X(3)Σ(+)) and TiC((3)Σ(+)) ← TiC(X(3)Σ(+)) transition bands.

The rotational constant and the corresponding bond distance of TiC(X(3)Σ(+); v″ = 0) are determined to be B0″ = 0.6112(10) cm(-1) and r0″ = 1.695(2) Å, respectively.

The cleanly rotationally resolved VIS-UV-PFI-PE spectra have also provided a highly precise value of 53 200.2(8) cm(-1) [6.5960(1) eV] for the adiabatic ionization energy (IE) of TiC. This IE(TiC) value along with the known IE(Ti) has made possible the determination of the difference between the 0 K bond dissociation energy (D0) of TiC(+)(X(2)Σ(+)) and that of TiC(X(3)Σ(+)) to be D0(Ti(+)-C) - D0(Ti-C) = 0.2322(2) eV.

In order to find out the ground state geometries, a large number of initial cluster structures for each n has been searched via total energy calculations. Generally, the ground state structures for the case of n = 1-9 clusters have at least one monovalent O atom, which only binds to a single Ti atom. However, the most stable structure of the n = 10 cluster does not have any monovalent O atom. On the other hand, Ti atoms are at least fourfold coordinated for the ground state structures for n ≥ 4 clusters. Our calculations have revealed that clusters prefer to form three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, all these stoichiometric clusters have nonmagnetic ground state. The formation energy and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap for the most stable structure of (TiO(2))(n) clusters for each n have also been calculated. The formation energy and hence the stability increases as the cluster size grows. In addition, the interactions between the ground state structure of the (TiO(2))(n) cluster and a single water molecule have been studied. The binding energy (E(b)) of the H(2)O molecule exhibits an oscillatory behavior with the size of the clusters. A single water molecule preferably binds to the cluster Ti atom through its oxygen atom, resulting an average binding energy of 1.1 eV. We have also reported the interaction of the selected clusters (n = 3, 4, 10) with multiple water molecules.

All these elements interact strongly with this cluster, and a permanent magnetic moment is induced upon adsorption of Co and V atoms.

In contrast, the other two states, i.e. the 2(2)A' and 1(4)A' states, are energetically not favourable to the reaction as the first state has a potential barrier of 0.2 eV in the entrance channel and the former one presents long range potential wells and repulsive wall for carbon approaches near OH. The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one. Nevertheless, a decreasing behaviour with the temperature remains between 10 and 500 K if we consider the total rate constant of C((3)P) + OH(X(2)Pi), sum of the three reactive states rate constants.",

The X 1Sigmag + -B 3Pi0+u transition in Br2 is excited at 527 nm corresponding predominantly to excitation of the v' = 28 vibrational level in the B 3Pi0+u state. Tunable VUV undulator radiation in the energy range of 8.40-10.15 eV is subsequently used to ionize the excited molecules to the X 2Pi32,12 state of the ion, and the ionic ground state is probed by photoelectron imaging. Similar experiments are performed using single-photon synchrotron ionization in the photon energy range of 10.75-12.50 eV without any laser excitation. Photoelectron kinetic energy distributions are extracted from the photoelectron images. In the case of two-color photoionization using resonant excitation of the intermediate B 3Pi0+u state, a broad distribution of photoelectron kinetic energies is observed, and in some cases even a bimodal distribution, which depends on the VUV photon energy. In contrast, for single-photon ionization, a single nearly Gaussian-shaped distribution is observed, which shifts to higher energy with photon energy. Simulated spectra based on Franck-Condon factors for the transitions Br2(X 1Sigmag+, v\" = 0)-Br2 +(X 2Pi12,32, v+) and Br2(B 3Pi0+u, v' = 28)-Br2 +(X 2Pi12,32, v+) are generated. Comparison of these calculated spectra with the measured images suggests that the differences in the kinetic energy distributions for the two ionization processes reflect the different extensions of the vibrational wave functions in the v\" = 0 electronic ground state (X 1Sigmag+) versus the electronically and vibrationally excited state (B 3Pi0+u, v' = 28).",

The involved free-energy differences (DeltaG) and redox potentials are of prime interest. Oxygen-evolving PSII membrane particles of spinach were studied at 5 degrees C. By analyzing the delayed and prompt Chl fluorescence, we determined the equilibrium constant and thus free-energy difference between Chl200* and the [Z+,QA-] radical pair to be -0.43+/-0.025 eV, at 10 mus after the photon absorption event for PSII in its S(3)-state. On basis of this value and previously published results, the free-energy difference between P680* and [P680+,QA-] is calculated to be -0.50+/-0.04 eV; the free-energy loss associated with electron transfer from Phe to QA is found to be 0.34+/-0.04 eV.

Indeed, these data show clearly that the cluster molecules stay intact in solution. Ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that the cluster compounds exhibit magnetic susceptibility relaxation phenomena at low temperatures since, with nonzero dc fields, chi\"(M) has a nonzero value that is frequency dependent. However, there appears no out-of-phase (chi\"(M)) signal in zero dc field down to 1.8 K, which excludes the expected signature for a single molecule magnet. This finding is confirmed with the small uniaxial magnetic anisotropy value for D of 0.015 cm(-1), deduced from the high-field, high-frequency EPR measurement, which distinctly reveals a positive sign in D. Obviously, the overall magnetic anisotropy of the compounds is too low, and this may be a consequence of a small single ion magnetic anisotropy combined with the highly symmetric arrangement of the metal ions in the cluster molecule.",

Thus, (CS)4 is predicted to have a different ground state than its lighter congener, (CO)4, which has a triplet ground state, (3)B1u, in which these two MOs are each singly occupied. Here, we report the results of a negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) study of the radical anion (CS)4(•-), designed to test the prediction that (CS)4 has a singlet ground state. The NIPE spectrum reveals that (CS)4 does, indeed, have a singlet ground state with electron affinity (EA) = 3.75 eV. The lowest triplet state is found to lie 0.31 eV higher in energy than the ground state, and the open-shell singlet is 0.14 eV higher in energy than the triplet state. Calculations at the (U)CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//(U)B3LYP/6-311+G(2df) level support the spectral assignments, giving EA = 3.71 eV and ΔEST = 0.44 eV. These calculated values are, respectively, 0.04 eV (0.9 kcal/mol) smaller and 0.13 eV (3.0 kcal/mol) larger than the corresponding experimental values. In addition, RASPT2 calculations with various active spaces and basis sets converge on a (1)B1u-(3)B1u energy gap of 0.137 eV, in excellent agreement with the 0.14 eV energy difference obtained from the NIPE spectrum. Finally, calculations of the Franck-Condon factors for transitions from the ground state of (CS)4(•-) to the ground ((1)A1g) and two excited states ((3)B1u, (1)B1u) of (CS)4 account for all of the major spectral peaks and nicely reproduce the vibrational structure observed in each electronic transition. The close correspondence between the calculated and the observed features in the NIPE spectrum of (CS)4(•-) provides unequivocal proof that (CS)4, unlike (CO)4, has a singlet ground state. ",

The ground states NaM(4) (-) of aromatic anions are found to be symmetric C(4nu) ((1)A(1)) electronic states with ideal square pyramid geometries.

The structural properties, relative energies of different structural isomers, and the calculated first vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of different structural isomers for cluster anions FeVS1-3- and FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 3, 4; m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) are investigated at a BPW91/TZVP theory level. The experimental first VDEs for these Fe-V sulfur clusters are reported. The most probable ground state structures and spin multiplicities for these clusters are tentatively assigned by comparing their theoretical and experiment first VDE values. For FeVS1-3- clusters, their first VDEs are generally observed to increase with the number of sulfur atoms from 1.45 eV to 2.86 eV. The NBO/HOMOs of the ground state of FeVS1-3- clusters are localized in a p orbital on a S atom; the partial charge distribution on the NBO/HOMO localized site of each cluster anion is responsible for the trend of their first VDEs. A less negative localized charge distribution is correlated with a higher first VDE. Structure and steric effect differences for FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 3, m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) clusters are suggested to be responsible for their different first VDEs and properties. Two types of structural isomers are identified for FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 4, m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) clusters: a tower structure isomer and a cubic structure isomer. The first VDEs for tower like isomers are generally higher than those for cubic like isomers of FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 4, m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) clusters. Their first VDEs are can be understood through: (1) NBO/HOMO distributions, (2) structures (steric effects), and (3) partial charge numbers on the NBO/HOMO's localized sites. EBEs for excited state transitions for all Fe-V sulfur clusters are calculated employing OVGF and TDDFT approaches at the TZVP level. The OVGF approach for these Fe/V/S cluster anions is better for the higher transition energies than the TDDTF approach. The experimental and theoretical results for these Fe/V/S cluster anions are compared with their related pure iron sulfur cluster anions.

The former two states are of mostly pure Rydberg character and exhibit a resolved K structure, whereas the 3(1)A1(3p(x) &lt;-- pi) state is mixed with the valence 2(1)A1(pi* &lt;-- pi) state, which is unbound and is strongly predissociative. Analyses of photoelectron kinetic energy distributions indicate that the ground vibrational level of the 2(1)B1(3p(z)) state is mixed with the 2(1)A2(3p(y)) nu(9) level, which is of B1 vibronic symmetry.

This study supports that the ground state electronic configuration for VCH(+) is …7σ(2)8σ(2)3π(4)9σ(1) (X(2)Σ(+)), and is different from that of …7σ(2)8σ(2)3π(4)1δ(1) (X(2)Δ) for the isoelectronic TiO(+) and VN(+) ions.

The formation of VCH(+)(X(2)Σ(+)) from VCH(X(3)Δ1) by photoionization is shown to strengthen the VC-H bond by 0.3559 eV, while the strength of the V-CH bond remains nearly unchanged.

The observation of Franck-Condon-forbidden transitions to vibrational levels of the X(+) state of the cation with v(+) ≥ 25 is rationalized by a mechanism involving vertical excitation of predissociative Rydberg states of mixed singlet-triplet character with an A(+) ion core which are coupled to Rydberg states converging to high-v(+) levels of the X(+) state.

The (4)Σu (-) state is split into two spin-orbit components with Ω = 1∕2 and Ω = 3∕2, separated by 37.5 cm(-1). The vibrational energy level structure of both components is regular, which indicates that the splitting results from the interaction with one or more distant ungerade Ω = 1∕2 or Ω = 3∕2 electronic states.",

On the basis of theoretical results we find many interesting features of silylation process and we can conclude that silylation will result in better long-term photo and thermodynamic stability compared to its unsilylated counterpart due to increase in the values of thermodynamic parameters like SCF total energy, G(0) and H(0), etc. Therefore, silylated molecules may become good candidates for solid state dye lasers and dye sensitized solar cells.

Photoelectron spectra are obtained at 193 and 157 nm photon energies, revealing very different electronic structures for the Cr versus W oxide clusters.

A comprehensive search is performed to determine the ground-state structures for M(4)O(10) and M(4)O(10)(-), in terms of geometry and electronic states by carefully examining the calculated relative energies at the DFT, CCSD(T), and CASSCF levels. The ground states of Cr(4)O(10) and Cr(4)O(10)(-) have tetrahedral structures similar to that of P(4)O(10) with the anion having a lower symmetry due to a Jahn-Teller distortion. The ground states of W(4)O(10) and W(4)O(10)(-) have butterfly shape structures, featuring two fused five-member rings with a metal-metal multiple bond between the central metal atoms. The much stronger WW bonding than the CrCr bonding is found to be the primary cause for the different ground state structures of the reduced Cr(4)O(10)(0/-) versus W(4)O(10)(0/-) oxide clusters. The photoelectron spectra are assigned by comparing the experimental and theoretical adiabatic and vertical electron detachment energies, further confirming the determination of the ground electronic states of M(4)O(10) and M(4)O(10)(-). The time-dependent DFT method is used to calculate the excitation energies of M(4)O(10).

This function poorly reproduces the rotational constants of the lowest and most important puckering states. The microwave spectrum has been reinvestigated and largely extended to include more than 4600 transitions of the ground state and six excited states of the ring-puckering vibration allowing accurate centrifugal distortion constants to be obtained for the first time. A new potential function V(z) = 38.8(z(4) - 0.65z(2)) cm(-1) has been determined. This function yields much better agreement between calculated and observed rotational constants, especially for the lowest puckering states, than the previous function and predicts a nonplanar ring equilibrium conformation. The barrier to ring planarity is determined to be 49(8) J/mol. The ground-state energy level is 35 cm(-1) above the barrier maximum. Theory predicts that three of the five Watson centrifugal distortion constants, ΔJK, ΔK, and δK, should vary with the puckering state, whereas ΔJ and δJ should be unaffected.

Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128]. Theory agrees with experiment within 4.5 cm(-1) on average for the four vibrational level spacings that are so far known empirically. In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)Σ(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)Σ(u)(-) state. The ground state dissociation energy D(0) is predicted to be 23164 cm(-1).",

Irradiation with 100 eV electrons results in electron-stimulated dissociation and electron-stimulated desorption (ESD) of adsorbed water molecules. The molecular water ESD yield increases linearly with water coverage theta for 0&lt; or =theta&lt; or =1 ML and 1&lt;theta&lt; or =2 ML. However, for theta&gt;1 ML, the water ESD yield per additional water molecule adsorbed (i.e., the slope of the ESD yield versus coverage) is 3.5 times larger than for theta&lt;1 ML. In contrast, the number of water molecules dissociated per incident electron increases linearly for theta&lt; or =2 ML without changing slope at theta=1 ML. The total electron-stimulated sputtering rate, as measured by postirradiation temperature programmed desorption of the remaining water, is larger for theta&gt;1 ML due to the increased water ESD for those coverages. The water ESD yields versus electron energy (for 5-50 eV) are qualitatively similar for 1, 2, and 40 ML water films. In each case, the observed ESD threshold is at approximately 10 eV and the yield increases monotonically with increasing electron energy. The results indicate that excitations in the adsorbed water layer are primarily responsible for the ESD in thin water films on TiO(2)(110). Experiments on \"isotopically layered\" films with D(2)O adsorbed on the Ti(4+) sites (D(2)O(Ti)) and H(2)O adsorbed on the bridging oxygen atoms (H(2)O(BBO)) demonstrate that increasing the water coverage above 1 ML rapidly suppresses the electron-stimulated desorption of D(2)O(Ti) and D atoms, despite the fact that the total water ESD and atomic hydrogen ESD yields increase with increasing coverage. The coverage dependence of the electron-stimulated reactions is probably related to the different bonding geometries for H(2)O(Ti) and H(2)O(BBO) and its influence on the desorption probability of the reaction products.",

The ion temperatures and resulting energy distributions are crucial for understanding how well a TELS pulse can simulate an extreme event in a larger, magnetic confinement device. A retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) has been constructed for use with such a transient plasma due to its inexpensive and robust nature. The innovation surrounding the use of a control analyzer in conjunction with an actively sampling analyzer is presented and the conditions of RFEA operation are discussed, with results presented demonstrating successful performance under extreme conditions. Such extreme conditions are defined by heat fluxes on the order of 0.8 GW m<sup-2</sup and on time scales of nearly 200 μs. Measurements from the RFEA indicate two primary features for a typical TELS discharge, following closely with the pre-ionizing coaxial gun discharge characteristics. For the case using the pre-ionization pulse (PiP) and the theta pinch, the measured ion signal showed an ion temperature of 23.3 ± 6.6 eV for the first peak and 17.6 ± 1.9 eV for the second peak. For the case using only the PiP, the measured signal showed an ion temperature of 7.9 ± 1.1 eV for the first peak and 6.6 ± 0.8 eV for the second peak.

In a series of extensive experimental attempts, a high-order data set of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) could be collected to a resolution of sin theta/lambda = 1.00 A(-1) at 25 K. This modification contains only minor disorder at the solvent bulk. For methylcobalamin (MeCbl), only a severely disordered modification was found (sin theta/lambda = 1.00 A(-1), 100 K, measured with synchrotron radiation). The already published data set of cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) (sin theta/lambda = 1.25 A(-1), 100 K) was reintegrated to guarantee similar treatment of the three compounds and cut to sin theta/lambda = 1.11 A(-1) to obtain a higher degree of completeness and redundancy. On the basis of these accurate experimental geometries of AdoCbl, MeCbl, and CNCbl, state-of-the-art density functional calculations, single-point calculations, and geometry optimizations were performed on model compounds at the BP86/TZVP level of theory to evaluate the electronic differences of the three compounds. AdoCbl and MeCbl are known to undergo different reaction paths in the body. Thus, the focus was directed toward the characterization of the dative Co-C(ax) and Co-N(ax) bonds, which were quantifed by topological parameters, including energy densities; the source function including local source; and the electron localizability indicator (ELI-D), respectively. The source function reveals the existence of delocalized interactions between the corrin macrocycle and the axial ligands. The ELI-D indicates unsaturated Co-C(ax) bonding basins for the two biochemically active cofactors, but not for CNCbl, where a population of 2.2e is found. This may be related to significant pi-backbonding, which is supported by the delocalization index, delta, of 0.15 between the Co atom and the N atom of the cyano ligand. Considering all results, the inherent electronic differences between AdoCbl and MeCbl are found to be small thus, supporting earlier findings that the interaction with the protein site mainly controls the type of Co-C(ax) bond cleavage.",

The resulting rise in azimuthal anchoring energy subsequently drives the LC to adopt a finite pretilt. The values of the W's deduced from the model reveal that the polar anchoring energy is about approximately 1/10 of the typical values, with the sin(4) theta term dominating the sin(2) theta term.

The emphasis here is on how the reaction probability varies with incident kinetic energy (E(i)=0.4-2.07 eV) and angle of incidence (theta(i)=0 degrees -60 degrees ). The most reactive surface is the substrate underlying the SAMs-SiO(2) with a high density of -OH(a) (&gt;5 x 10(14) cm(-2)), \"chemical oxide.\" On chemical oxide, the dynamics of adsorption are well described by trapping, precursor-mediated adsorption, and the initial probability of adsorption depends only weakly on E(i) and theta(i). The dependence of the reaction probability on substrate temperature is well described by a model involving an intrinsic precursor state, where the barrier for dissociation is approximately 0.2-0.5 eV below the vacuum level. Reaction with the SAMs is more complicated. On the SAM with the unreactive, -CH(3), termination, reactivity decreases continuously with increasing E(i) while increasing with increasing theta(i). The data are best interpreted by a model where the Ti[N(CH(3))(2)](4) must first be trapped on the surface, followed by diffusion through the SAM and reaction at the SAMSiO(2) interface with residual -OH(a). This process is not activated by E(i) and most likely occurs in defective areas of the SAM. On the SAMs with reactive end groups, the situation is quite different. On both the-OH and -NH(2) SAMs, the reaction with the Ti[N(CH(3))(2)](4) as a function of E(i) passes through a minimum near E(i) approximately 1.0 eV. Two explanations for this intriguing finding are made-one involves the participation of a direct dissociation channel at sufficiently high E(i). A second explanation involves a new mechanism for trapping, which could be termed penetration facilitated trapping, where the Ti[N(CH(3))(2)](4) penetrates the near surface layers, a process that is activated as the molecules in the SAM must be displaced from their equilibrium positions.",

Using the free energy, we found that the elastic anomalies expected through the electrostrictive couplings between the order parameter and the elastic strains are strongly suppressed by the intrinsic electrical nature of the ferroelectric polymer. For both LA phonons, the temperature development of the phonon frequency and width can be reasonably reproduced by the Cole-Davidson relaxation model for the velocity dispersion with an exponent of betaCD=0.4. The relaxation time was found to obey the Arrhenius law tau=tau(0) exp(DeltaE/k(B)T) with DeltaE=0.55+/-0.01 eV and tau(0)=(4.0+/-0.6)x10(-18) s. At 24.0 degrees C in the ferroelectric phase, the in-plane phonon width anisotropy can be reasonably described by gammaB(straight theta)/2pi=0.18+0.72 sin4 straight theta for the LA phonon and gammaB(straight theta)/2pi=0.02+0.095 sin2 2straight theta for the transverse acoustic phonon, where the phonon propagation angle straight theta is measured from the perpendicular direction with respect to the polymer-chain axis. The straight theta dependence is strongly related to the one-dimensional freedom constrained in each copolymer chain.",

The elevation of the cemented casting, delta H, above the tooth preparation may also be obtained from this equation by substituting beta = 90 degrees, in which case Dm = delta H. The effect of the preparation of a chamfer margin or bevel on the marginal film thickness may be calculated from this equation. An additional analysis showed that the minimum marginal cement thickness, Dm = F, can be obtained for a shoulder preparation and X values of common metal-investment systems by applying a spacer of appropriate thickness on the entire occlusal and axial walls of the die. This renders the preparation of bevels superfluous. The thickness of the spacer should allow for the cement film thickness, roughness of the tooth and casting surfaces, dimensional inaccuracies of the die, and distortions of the wax pattern. If the spacer is thicker than required, a minimum value of Dm is still obtained for preparations without bevels. If the horizontal part of the die shoulder is covered as well with the spacer, a greater spacer thickness is required to obtain a minimum value of Dm than if the spacer extends to the end of the axial walls. In this case the spacer thickness should be greater on the occlusal die wall than on other regions of the die for values of X smaller than 1. The spacer should also be thicker in the occlusal region if restriction of the investment setting expansion by the wax pattern occurs mainly in this region.",

The semiempirical model AM1 was used for the gly(8)-H(+) intramolecular potential, so that its fragmentation could be studied.

VI.\nRaces of Rattus norvegicus labelled A and B give characteristic curves relating angle of orientation theta during geotropic progression to the inclination (alpha) of the surface. The orientation-angles for B are higher at every slope, and the threshold slope for orientation is lower in B. When these races are cross-bred, the F(1) progeny show a theta-alpha curve in general corresponding to that for the B parent, as regards both threshold slope and magnitudes of theta. Differences between the curve for F(1) and B have to do (1) with a slight but significant distortion of the curve, such that from alpha = 15 degrees to about (alpha = 35 degrees the mean curve is slightly above that for B, whereas above this slope of surface, theta is consistently below that for B, and (2) below alpha = 35 degrees the horizontal latitude of variation in the curve theta vs. log sin alpha is much greater than above alpha = 35 degrees . The first distortion is interpreted as due to the fact that, as a manifestation of heterosis, developmental processes which upon the one hand lead to growth in bulk in the posterior region of the body, and on the other which would lead to a proportionate development of tension receptors in the legs, fail to keep pace harmoniously. In ordinary development of individuals in a pure line, harmonious relationships between these two aspects of growth are maintained. The variation of response (theta) is not altered in F(1), if attention is paid to the total observed variation; but the unmodifiable or uncontrollable portion of the total variation of theta, not affected as a function of sin alpha, is increased. This fact is more pronounced in female offspring from the matings A male symbol x B female symbol. This effect in F(1) is interpreted as due to the introduction of modifying genetic influences, which affect variation of orientation. The percentage of modifiable variation is reduced from 74 per cent (mean) in B to about 59 per cent in F(1). These interpretations are checked by the behavior of offspring produced in the backcross F(1) x B. The disharmony of developmental processes thought to be signalized by the distortion of the form of the theta-alpha curve disappears completely in these backcross individuals. It can be computed that an equivalent distortion of the theta-alpha curve for B would be produced by the posterior attachment of a mass of about 0.5 gm., unaccompanied by its proportion of receptors in the legs; in backcrossing to the B line, this should be reduced in the average to about \"0.25 gm.,\" which is at about the threshold for any detectable effect of a mass added posteriorly. The variability of theta in (F(1) x B) is not different from that for B, or for F(1) (total variation); but, as must be expected if the unmodified variation has been increased in F(1) by the action of modifying genetic influences not directly connected with the genes determining the numbers of tension-receptors, we find that in (F(1) x B) the percentage of modifiable variation is returned half-way (65 per cent) toward that for the B line. The bearing of certain considerations derived from the treatment of this case is discussed with reference to the desirability that other phenomena of \"hybrid vigor\" and heterosis be similarly analyzed.",

Nonreproducibility of spectra at low theta values was concluded to be due to restricted motions of very long filaments confined in cages or zig-zag tubing formed by a major fraction of filaments, where the very long filaments were those at a distant tail of an exponential length distribution and the major fraction of filaments were those with lengths around Ln-2Ln, Ln being the number-average length. Spectral widths were compared with theoretical ones for rigid rods averaged over the length distribution with Ln = 900 nm, and were suggested to be largely contributed at high theta values from bending motions of filaments. (2) Acto-HMM solutions at 0.5 mg/ml F-actin and at weight ratios of HMM to F-actin of 0.5-2 gave spectra which, with respect to theta, behaved very similarly to those of F-actin alone. The spectral widths, however, drastically decreased with the weight ratio up to unity and stayed virtually constant above unity. In contrast to a previous study (F.D. Carlson and A.B. Fraser, J. Mol. Biol. 89 (1974) 273), beta values of acto-HMM were as large as those of F-actin alone. Acto-HMM was concluded to travel a distance far greater than 1/K with a mobility smaller than that of F-actin, where K = (4 pi/lambda) sin(theta/2), lambda being the wavelength of light in the medium. These results suggest that acto-HMM gels are very soft even though they did not pour from an inverted cell. Based on several intuitive models which give a mutual relationship between the beta value and modes of motion of scatterers, we discuss the restricted motions responsible for nonreproducibility of spectra at low angles and large beta values of acto-HMM gels at all theta values and weight ratios so far studied.",

Such polarons influence the performance of this important optical material decisively. Since coupling to the lattice strongly quenches the tunnelling of free small polarons in general, they are easily localized at one site even by weak irregularities of a crystal. The mechanism of their optical absorptions is thus shared with those of small polarons localized by binding to selected defects. It is shown that the optical properties of free electrons in LN as well as those bound to Nb(Li) antisite defects can be attributed consistently to small polarons. This is extended to electron pairs forming bipolarons bound to Nb(Li)-Nb(Nb) nearest neighbours in the LN ground state. On the basis of an elementary phenomenological approach, relying on familiar concepts of defect physics, the peak energies, lineshapes, widths of the related optical absorption bands as well as the defect binding energies induced by lattice distortion are analysed. A criterion universally identifying small polaron absorption bands in oxide materials is pointed out. For the bipolarons, the dissociation energy, 0.27 eV, derived from a corresponding study of the mass action behaviour, is shown to be consistent with the data on isolated polarons. Based on experience with simple O(-) hole small polaron systems, a mechanism is proposed which explains why the observed small polaron optical absorptions are higher above the peak energies of the bands than those predicted by the conventional theory. The parameters characterizing the optical absorptions are seen to be fully consistent with those determining the electrical conductivity, i.e. the bipolaron dissociation energy and the positions of the defect levels as well as the activation energy of mobility. A reinterpretation of previous thermopower data of reduced LN on the basis of the bipolaron model confirms that the mobility of the free polarons is activated by 0.27 eV. On the basis of the level scheme of the bipolarons as well as the bound and free polarons the temperature dependence of the electronic conductivity is explained. The polaron/bipolaron concept also allows us to account for the concentrations of the various polaron species under the combined influence of illumination and heating. The decay of free and bound polarons dissociated from bipolarons by intense short laser pulses of 532 nm light is put in the present context. A critical review of alternative models, being proposed to explain the mentioned absorption features, is given. These proposals include: single free polarons in the (diamagnetic) LN ground state, oxygen vacancies in their various conceivable charge states, quadpolarons, etc. It is shown why these models cannot explain the experimental findings consistently.",

Previous reports have shown that the nucleus contains diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), i.e., the enzymes that, by converting DAG into phosphatidic acid (PA), terminate DAG-dependent events. Here, we show, by immunofluorescence staining and confocal analysis, that DGK-theta localizes mainly to the nucleus of various cell lines, such as MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, PC12, and HeLa. Nuclear DGK-theta co-localizes with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) in domains that correspond to nuclear speckles, as revealed by the use of an antibody to the splicing factor SC-35, a well-established marker for these structures. The spatial distribution of nuclear DGK-theta was dynamic in that it was affected by inhibition of mRNA transcription with alpha-amanitin. Immuno-electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that DGK-theta, PIP(2), and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1) associated with electron-dense particles within the nucleus that correspond to interchromatin granule clusters. Cell fractionation experiments performed in MDA-MB-453, HeLa, and PC12 cells showed a preferential association of DGK-theta with the nucleus.

We have taken spatial learning as our starting point, computationally modeling the activity of place cells using methods derived from algebraic topology, especially persistent homology. We previously showed that ensembles of hundreds of place cells could accurately encode topological information about different environments (\"learn\" the space) within certain values of place cell firing rate, place field size, and cell population; we called this parameter space the learning region. Here we advance the model both technically and conceptually. To make the model more physiological, we explored the effects of theta precession on spatial learning in our virtual ensembles. Theta precession, which is believed to influence learning and memory, did in fact enhance learning in our model, increasing both speed and the size of the learning region. Interestingly, theta precession also increased the number of spurious loops during simplicial complex formation. We next explored how downstream readout neurons might define co-firing by grouping together cells within different windows of time and thereby capturing different degrees of temporal overlap between spike trains. Our model's optimum coactivity window correlates well with experimental data, ranging from ∼150-200 msec. We further studied the relationship between learning time, window width, and theta precession. Our results validate our topological model for spatial learning and open new avenues for connecting data at the level of individual neurons to behavioral outcomes at the neuronal ensemble level. Finally, we analyzed the dynamics of simplicial complex formation and loop transience to propose that the simplicial complex provides a useful working description of the spatial learning process. ",

Case 2 assumes that the cooling is caused by the imposed fixed temperature on both the vertical sidewall and the bottom boundary while the top boundary is adiabatic. The appropriate parameters to represent the long-term behavior of the fluid cooling in the container are the transient average fluid temperature T(a)(t) over the whole volume of the container per unit length (i.e., the transient area average fluid temperature, as used in the subsequent numerical simulations) at time t and the average Nusselt number on the cooling boundary. A scaling analysis has been carried out which shows that for both cases theta(a)(tau) scales as e(-C(ARa)(-1/4) tau), where theta(a)(tau) is the dimensionless form of T(a)(t), tau is the dimensionless time, A is the aspect ratio of the container, Ra is the Rayleigh number, and C is a proportionality constant.

A differential equation for the drop profile was derived by the variational minimization of the total potential energy by taking into account the structuring of the liquid near the fiber. This equation was solved by quadrature, and the existence conditions and the shape of the drop were examined as functions of the radius of the fiber, microscopic contact angle theta(0), which the actual drop profile makes with the fiber, and a certain parameter, a, which depends on the interaction potential parameters. Angle theta(0) is defined in the nanoscale range near the leading edge where the interactions between the liquid and solid are strong. It differs from the macroscopically measured wetting angle (theta(m)) that represents the extrapolation of the profile outside the range of liquid-solid interaction to the solid surface. Expressions for both theta(0) and theta(m) are established in the paper. For any given fiber radius, the range of drop existence involves two domains in the plane theta(0) - a, separated by a critical curve a = a(c)(theta(0)). In the first domain, below the curve a = a(c)(theta(0)), the drop always exists and can have any height, h(m). In the second domain, above the curve a = a(c)(theta(0)), there is an upper limit of h, h(m1), such that drops with h(m) &gt; h(m1) cannot exist. The shape of the drop depends on whether the point (theta(0), a) on the theta(0) - a plane is far from the critical curve or near to it. In the first case, the drop profile has generally a circular shape, with the center of the circle not located on the fiber axis, whereas in the second case the shape is \"quasi planar\", that is, most of the drop profile lies on a circle concentric with the fiber profile. Comparing the potential energies of a cylindrical drop on a fiber and a film of uniform thickness covering the fiber and having the same volume as the drop, the energetically preferred configuration was determined for various conditions. Considering the cylindrical drop as a limiting case of a clam-shell one, and the film as a limiting case of a barrel drop, the obtained analytical results could be employed to examine the barrel-drop-clam-shell-drop transformation (roll-up transition).",

The angle theta increases as the angle alpha of the inclination of the plane increases. The results of this experiment indicate that in principle the formulation of similar behavior in the cases of young rats and mice holds essentially for young guinea pigs, and further supports a general muscle tension theory of the limitation of geotropic orientation. The relation of theta to log sin alpha is sigmoid in character and cos theta is a nearly rectilinear function sin alpha. It is notable however that in this case the functions are in reality compound, being made up of two curves with a break occurring at a slope of alpha = 45 degrees . Observation of a blinded guinea pig in light upon an inclined plane reveals the fact that in the neighborhood of 45 degrees the mode of progression changes. Below this angle the animal walks with the feet on the two sides of the body moving forward alternately, while above alpha = 45 degrees the animal hops in such a way that both front feet and both hind feet move forward together. This change in the mode of progression clearly involves a change in the organization of muscular tensions, and in all probability accounts for the change in the relation of the values of theta to the magnitudes of the slope.

Although they are not perfect, simplified cylindrical cloaks have been shown to inherit many of the power-bending properties of the ideal cloak. However, energy is transmitted into simplified cloaks hidden regions. Here, we develop a constraint equation that can be used to determine how closely field behavior within the simplified cylindrical cloak matches that of the ideal cloak. The deviation from this controlling equation can be reduced by controlling the cloaks parameter value, microtheta. As the deviation from our constraint equation is decreased, the field transmitted into the cloaks hidden region is reduced, resulting in less energy impinging on the cloaked object. This results in a smaller scattered field due to the presence of the cloaked object. However, the resulting impedance mismatch at r = b results in a significant scattered field by the cloak itself. Thus, we have found when using cylindrical cloaks that satisfy the ideal values of epsilon (z)micro(theta)and epsilon(z)micro(r) for scattering width reduction, it is more important to have a matched impedance at r = b than to have a smaller field transmitted into the cloaks hidden region. However, such cloaks scattering widths can vary significantly as a function of the object in the hidden region.

The reaction mechanisms were revealed through ab initio molecular orbital theory. On the basis of the MP2(full)/6-31G(d) optimized geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies of various stationary points were calculated. The reaction paths were investigated and confirmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations. The results show that the thermal rearrangements of H3SiCH(OH)CH=CH2 happen in two ways. One is via the Brook rearrangement reactions (reaction A), and the silyl group migrates from carbon atom to oxygen atom passing through a double three-membered ring transition state, forming allyloxysilane CH2=CHCH2OSiH3. In the other, the reactant undergoes a dyotropic rearrangement; the hydroxyl group migrates from carbon atom to silicon atom coupled with a simultaneous migration of a hydrogen atom from silicon atom to carbon atom, forming allylsilanol CH2=CHCH2SiH2OH (reaction B). The barriers for reactions A and B were computed to be 343.5 and 203.7 kJ/mol, respectively, at the G3 level.

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

First, ab initio calculations are used to characterize the stationary points of the potential energy surface. Rotation around the C-C-O-H dihedral affords two conformers in 2-propanol, which gives rise to 13 hydrogen abstraction reaction pathways grouped into three channels, Cα, Cβ, and O, depending on the abstraction site. Reaction at Cα exhibits the lowest barrier and largest exothermicity, followed by reaction at Cβ, and at 2-propanol's oxygen atom. Additional ab initio calculations beyond the stationary points are employed to obtain a grid of energies with which a specific-reaction-parameters (SRP) PM6 semiemipirical Hamiltonian is derived for the title reaction. The SRP-PM6 model captures the energetics of the reaction with higher accuracy than some conventional first-principles methods but is efficient enough to allow for extensive reaction dynamics calculations. Quasiclassical trajectories are subsequently propagated with the SRP-PM6 Hamiltonian to obtain reaction dynamics properties that are compared to experiments. Product translational energy and angular distributions for reaction at Cα with the two conformers of 2-propanol are in good agreement with recent molecular-beam measurements, and they exhibit largely backward scattering with modest energy release to relative translation. Most of the energy is deposited into the organic product, substantiating a reaction mechanism dominated by rebound dynamics.",

Furthermore, enhancing our understanding of the barium puzzle in barium stars requires branching fraction data for proper modelling of nucleo-synthesis. Our measurements are the first to provide a direct test of quantum many-body calculations on the barium ion with a precision below one percent and more importantly with no known systematic uncertainties.

The protocol starts with the search and location of the conformers of the equilibrium structures using the TorsiFlex program. By a simple modification of the starting geometry of reactants, a Python script generates the input for the hydrogen abstraction transition states. Initially, the search of the stationary points (reactants and transition states) is carried out at a low-level employing firstly a preconditioned search and secondly a random search. The low-level conformers were reoptimized using a higher level electronic structure method. This information allows the evaluation of the multistructural harmonic-oscillator partition functions, which are corrected for zero-point energy anharmonicity by the hybrid degeneracy-corrected second-order vibrational perturbation theory and for torsional anharmonicity by the multistructural torsional method, as implemented in the MsTor program. The structural information of the stationary points is used by Pilgrim to evaluate the multipath canonical variational transition state theory thermal rate constants with multidimensional small-curvature corrections for tunneling. Therefore, the thermal rate constants include variational (recrossing) and tunneling effects in addition to the effect of multiple conformations on the thermal rate constants. These features grant the applicability of the method to a wide range of temperatures. The method was applied to each of the hydrogen abstraction sites of the four isomers of butanol. The methodology employed allowed us to calculate the thermal rate constants in the temperature range of 250-2500 K and to accurately fit them to analytical expressions. The variety of abstraction sites shows that the protocol is robust and that it can be employed to study hydrogen abstraction reactions in molecules containing carbon and oxygen as heavy atoms.",

The large entropy changes for these reactions, |TDeltaS degrees | = 9 kcal mol-1 at 298 K, are exceptions to the traditional assumption that DeltaS degrees approximately 0 for simple HAT reactions. Various studies indicate that hydrogen bonding, solvent effects, ion pairing, and iron spin equilibria do not make major contributions to the observed DeltaS degrees HAT. Instead, this effect arises primarily from changes in vibrational entropy upon oxidation of the iron center. Measurement of the electron-transfer half-reaction entropy, |DeltaS degrees Fe(H2bim)/ET| = 29 +/- 3 cal mol-1 K-1, is consistent with a vibrational origin.

Two laser beams are employed, the first to excite hydrogen atoms from the ground state to the second excited state via two-photon absorption and the second to strongly photoionize the excited atoms. The resulting fluorescence measurements are independent of quenching. A model is presented that assures the viability of PICLS as long as the photoionization rate is greater than or equal to the quenching rate.

The dissociation of the 1,1-dimethylhydrazine ion has been investigated using threshold photoelectron-photoion coincidence (TPEPICO) spectroscopy, in the photon energy range 8.25-31 eV, and tandem mass spectrometry.

Four different fluoroalkyl groups have been formed on the Pt(111) surface by dissociative adsorption of four fluoroalkyl iodides: RCH(2)CH(2)-I (R = CF(3), CF(3)CH(2), and CF(3)CF(2)) and (CF(3))(2)CHCH(2)-I. In the absence of preadsorbed hydrogen, fluoroalkyl groups on the Pt(111) surface dehydrogenate via beta-hydride elimination to form unsaturated fluorocarbons and deposit hydrogen atoms onto the surface. Those hydrogen atoms then hydrogenate the remaining fluoroalkyl groups to produce fluoroalkanes that desorb rapidly from the surface. The kinetics of hydrogenation and fluoroalkane desorption are rate limited by the beta-hydride elimination step and thus serve as measures of the kinetics of beta-hydride elimination. The field effects of the fluorinated substituents increase the barriers to beta-hydride elimination with a reaction constant of rho(F) = 19 +/- 2 kJ/mol. The interpretation of this effect is that the beta-carbon atom in the transition state is cationic, [RC(delta+...)H]++, with respect to the reactant. The field effect of the fluorinated substituent energetically destabilizes the electron deficient beta-carbon atom in the transition state. This is consistent with observations made on the Cu(111) surface; however, the substituent effect is significantly smaller on the Pt(111) surface.

The dynamic trajectory of monomeric extended [Met5]-enkephalin was analysed in terms of relative mobility between respective torsions of backbone chain. After 10 ps of the dynamics simulation, the conformational transition was converged into a stationary state among the beta-bend folded forms, where they are stabilized by several intramolecular hydrogen-bond formations. Similar conformational transition was also observed in the dynamics simulation of [D-Ala2,Met5]enkephalin, which is a more mu-receptor-specific peptide than [Met5]enkephalin. The geometrical correspondence between the monomeric enkephalin conformation in the stationary state and morphine molecule (a mu-specific rigid opiate) was surveyed by virtue of the triangular substructures generated by choosing three functional atoms in each molecule, and good resemblances were observed.

Two intermolecular hydrogen bonds at Tyr1 (NH3+)...Met5(CO2-) end residues were held throughout the 100 ps simulation, the dimeric structure being consequently kept. The conformational transition of the backbone chains from the antiparallel extended form to the twisted one took place via an intermediate state. Many conformations revealed during the dynamics simulation showed that the relative orientations of each two Tyr1, Gly3, Phe4 and Met5 residues in the dimer are nearly related by a pseudo-C2-symmetry respectively, and both halves of the dimer structure could be further fitted to the monomeric folded enkephalin conformation.

Comparison of experimental shifts with the results of chemical shift calculations on a variety of small molecules, including species containing very strong hydrogen bonds, has validated the overall approach and provided the means for calibrating and correcting the calculated values. Models of the active site of chymotrypsin in its resting state and tetrahedral intermediate state were derived from high-resolution X-ray structures. The distance between His(57) N(delta)(1) and Asp(102) O(delta)(1) in each model was varied between 2.77 A (weak hydrogen bond) and 2.50 A (extremely strong hydrogen bond), and the one-dimensional potential energy surface of the hydrogen-bonded proton (or deuteron/triton) was determined. The zero-point energy, probability distribution, and chemical shift were determined for each distance. Calculated values for NMR chemical shifts, NMR chemical shift differences between (1)H and (3)H, and (2)H/(1)H fractionation factors were compared with published experimental values.

All results were obtained within the 4-component polarization propagator formalism at different level of approach [random-phase approximation (RPA) and pure zeroth-order approximation (PZOA)], by using a local version of the DIRAC code. From the fact that calculations of diamagnetic contributions to sigma within RPA and PZOA approaches for HX(X=Br,I,At) and rare-gas atoms are quite close each to other and the finding that the diamagnetic part of the principal propagator at the PZOA level can be developed as a series [S(Delta)], it was found that there is a branch of negative-energy \"virtual\" excitations that contribute with more than 98% of the total diamagnetic value even for the heavier elements, namely, Xe, Rn, I, and At. It contains virtual negative-energy molecular-orbital states with energies between -2 mc2 and -4 mc2. This fact can explain the excellent performance of the linear response elimination of small component (LR-ESC) scheme for elements up to the fifth row in the Periodic Table. An analysis of the convergency of S(Delta) and its physical implications is given. It is also shown that the total contribution to relativistic effects of the innermost orbital (1s1/2) is by far the largest. For the paramagnetic contributions results at the RPA and PZOA approximations are similar only for rare-gas atoms. On the other hand, if the mass-correction contributions to sigma(p) are expressed in terms of atomic orbitals, a different pattern is found for 1s1/2 orbital contributions compared with all other s-type orbitals when the whole set of rare-gas atoms is considered.",

The stationary points on four different pathways leading to the product combinations HCF2+ + H+ + F and HCF2+ + HF+ have been calculated. All four pathways begin with the formation of a collision complex [H2-CF3]2+, followed by an internal hydrogen atom migration to give HC(FH)F2(2+). In two of the mechanisms, immediate charge separation of HC(FH)F2(2+) via loss of either HF+ or a proton, followed by loss of an F atom, yields the experimentally observed bond-forming product HCF2+. For the other two mechanisms, internal hydrogen rearrangement of HC(FH)F2(2+) to give C(FH)2F(2+), followed by charge separation, yields the product CF2H+. This product can then overcome a 2.04 eV barrier to rearrange to the HCF2+ isomer, which is 1.80 eV more stable. All four calculated mechanisms are in agreement with the isotope effects and collision energy dependencies of the product ion cross sections that have been previously observed experimentally following collisions between CF3(2+) and H2/D2. We find that in this open-shell system, CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) T1-diagnostic values of up to 0.04 are acceptable. A series of angularly resolved crossed-beam scattering experiments on collisions of CF3(2+) with D2 have also been performed. These experiments show two distinct channels leading to the formation of DCF2+. One channel appears to correspond to the pathway leading to the ground state 1DCF2+ + D+ + F product asymptote and the other to the 3DCF2+ + D+ + F product asymptote, which is 5.76 eV higher in energy. The experimental kinetic energy releases for these channels, 7.55 and 1.55 eV respectively, have been determined from the velocities of the DCF2+ product ion and are in agreement with the reaction mechanisms calculated quantum chemically. We suggest that both of these observed experimental channels are governed by the reaction mechanism we calculate in which charge separation occurs first by loss of a proton, without further hydrogen atom rearrangement, followed by loss of an F atom to give the final products 1DCF2+ + D+ + F or 3DCF2+ + D+ + F.",

This semiempirical surface is completely symmetric with respect to the permutation of the four methane hydrogen atoms and is calibrated with respect to the updated experimental and theoretical stationary point properties and experimental thermal rate constants. To take into account the two spin-orbit electronic states of the fluorine atom, two versions of the surface were constructed, the PES-SO and PES-NOSO surfaces, which differ in the choice of the zero reference level of the reactants. On both surfaces, the thermal rate constants were calculated using variational transition-state theory with semiclassical transmission coefficients over a wide temperature range, 180-500 K. While the PES-SO surface overestimates the experimental rate constants, the PES-NOSO surface shows a better agreement, reproducing the experimental variation with temperature. The influence of the tunneling factor is negligible, due to the flattening of the surface in the entrance valley, and we found a direct dependence on temperature, and therefore positive and small activation energies, in agreement with experiment. The kinetic isotope effects calculated showed good agreement with the sparse experimental data at 283 and 298 K.

At T&gt; or = 299 K, measured rate coefficients are pressure independent and a significant H/D kinetic isotope effect is observed, suggesting that hydrogen abstraction is the dominant reaction pathway. The following Arrhenius expression adequately describes all kinetic data at 299-435 K for C(5)H(5)N: k(1a) = (2.08 +/- 0.47) x 10(-11) exp[-(1410 +/- 80)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (uncertainties are 2sigma, precision only). At 216 K &lt; or =T&lt; or = 270 K, measured rate coefficients are pressure dependent and are much faster than computed from the above Arrhenius expression for the H-abstraction pathway, suggesting that the dominant reaction pathway at low temperature is formation of a stable adduct. Over the ranges of temperature, pressure, and pyridine concentration investigated, the adduct undergoes dissociation on the time scale of our experiments (10(-5)-10(-2) s) and establishes an equilibrium with Cl and pyridine. Equilibrium constants for adduct formation and dissociation are determined from the forward and reverse rate coefficients. Second- and third-law analyses of the equilibrium data lead to the following thermochemical parameters for the addition reaction: Delta(r)H = -47.2 +/- 2.8 kJ mol(-1), Delta(r)H = -46.7 +/- 3.2 kJ mol(-1), and Delta(r)S = -98.7 +/- 6.5 J mol(-1) K(-1). The enthalpy changes derived from our data are in good agreement with ab initio calculations reported in the literature (which suggest that the adduct structure is planar and involves formation of an N-Cl sigma-bond). In conjunction with the well-known heats of formation of atomic chlorine and pyridine, the above Delta(r)H values lead to the following heats of formation for C(5)H(5)N-Cl at 298 K and 0 K: Delta(f)H = 216.0 +/- 4.1 kJ mol(-1), Delta(f)H = 233.4 +/- 4.6 kJ mol(-1).

The data are compared with published (31)P-NMR data of enzymes closely related to TrxR. (13)C and (15)N-NMR chemical shifts of TrxR and the mutant proteins in the oxidized state provided information about the electronic structure of the protein-bound cofactor and its interactions with the apoproteins. Strong hydrogen bonds exist between protein-bound flavin and the apoproteins at C(2)O, C(4)O, N(1) and N(5). The N(10) atoms in the enzymes are slightly out of the molecular plane of the flavin. Of the ribityl carbon atoms C(10alpha,gamma,delta) are the most affected upon binding to the apoprotein and the large downfield shift of the C(10gamma) atom indicates strong hydrogen bonding with the apoprotein. The hydrogen bonding pattern observed is in excellent agreement with X-ray data, except for the N(1) and the N(3) atoms where a reversed situation was observed. Some chemical shifts observed in C138S deviate considerably from those of the other enzymes. From this it is concluded that C138S is in the FO conformation and the others are in the FR conformation, supporting published data. In the reduced state, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between C(2)O and C(4)O and the apoprotein. As revealed by the (15)N chemical shifts and the N(5)H coupling constant the N(5) and the N(10) atom are highly sp(3) hybridized.

In contrast, the N(1) is highly sp(2) hybridized and is protonated, i.e. in the neutral state. Upon reduction of the enzymes, the (13)C chemical shifts of some atoms of the ribityl side chain undergo considerable changes also indicating conformational rearrangements of the side-chain interactions with the apoproteins. The chemical shifts between native TrxR and C138S are now rather similar and differ from those of the two other mutant proteins. This strongly indicates that the former enzymes are in the FO conformation and the other two are in the FR conformation.

The activation energy for this somersault motion of the FeO-OH group is 20.3 kcal/mol for the P450 model porphyrin iron(III) hydroperoxide [Por(SH)Fe(III)-OOH(-)] to produce the isomeric ferryl oxygen hydrogen bonded to an *OH radical [Por(SH)Fe(III)-O....HO(-)].

The first step of the proposed mechanism for isobutane oxidation is abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond of isobutane by the hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl radical to produce a water molecule strongly hydrogen bonded to anionic Cpd II. The hydroxylation step involves a concerted but nonsynchronous transfer of a hydrogen atom from this newly formed, bound, water molecule to the ferryl oxygen with a concomitant rebound of the incipient *OH radical to the carbon radical of isobutane to produce the C-O bond of the final product, tert-butyl alcohol. The TS for the oxygen rebound step is 2 kcal/mol lower in energy than the hydrogen abstraction TS (DeltaE() = 19.5 kcal/mol).

The dependency of the CSA tensor parameters on the energy optimization of hydrogen atom positions and hydrogen bonding effects and the use of zwitterionic peptides in the calculations are examined. Our results indicate that the energy optimization of the hydrogen atom positions in crystal structures is necessary to obtain accurate CSA tensors. The inclusion of intermolecular effects such as hydrogen bonding in the calculations provided better agreement between the calculated and experimental values; however, the use of zwitterionic peptides in calculations, with or without the inclusion of hydrogen bonding, did not improve the results. In addition, our calculated values are in good agreement with tensor values obtained from solid-state NMR experiments on glycine-containing tripeptides. In the case of peptides containing an aromatic residue, calculations on an isolated peptide yielded more accurate isotropic shift values than the calculations on extended structures of the peptide. The calculations also suggested that the presence of an aromatic ring in the extended crystal peptide structure influences the magnitude of the delta(22) which the present level of ab initio calculations are unable to reproduce.",

A density functional theory study.\nThe effect of hydrogen bonding to the primary quinone (Q(A) and Q(*)(-)(A)) in bacterial reaction centers was studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The charge neutral state Q(A) was investigated by optimizing the hydrogen atom positions of model systems extracted from 15 different X-ray structures. From this analysis, mean values of the H-bond lengths and directions were derived. It was found that the N(delta)-H of His M219 forms a shorter H-bond to Q(A) than the N-H of Ala M260. The H-bond of His M219 is linear and more twisted out of the quinone plane. The radical anion Q(*)(-)(A) in the protein environment was investigated by using a mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach. Two geometry optimizations with a different number of flexible atoms were performed. H-bond lengths were obtained and spectroscopic parameters calculated, i.e. the hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole couplings of magnetic nuclei coupled to the radical. Good agreement was found with the results provided by EPR/ENDOR spectroscopy. This implies that the calculated lengths and directions of the H-bonds to Q(*)(-)(A) are reliable values. From a comparison of the neutral and reduced state of Q(A) it was concluded that the H-bond distances are shortened by approximately 0.17 Angstroms (His M219) and approximately 0.13 Angstroms (Ala M260) upon single reduction of the quinone. It is shown that the point-dipole approximation can not be used for an estimation of H-bond lengths from measured hyperfine couplings in a system with out-of-plane H-bonding. In contrast, the evaluation of the nuclear quadrupole couplings of (2)H nuclei substituted in the hydrogen bonds yields H-bond lengths close to the values that were deduced from DFT geometry optimizations. The significance of hydrogen bonding to the quinone cofactors in biological systems is discussed.",

Only one product channel is observed, corresponding to generation of hydrogen peroxide via transfer of two hydrogen atoms from protonated tyrosine. Despite being exoergic, the reaction is in competition with physical quenching of (1)O(2) and is very inefficient. At low E(col), the reaction may be mediated by intermediate complexes and shows strong inhibition by collision energy. At high E(col), the reaction efficiency drops to approximately 1% and starts to have contribution from a direct mechanism. Quasi-classical trajectory simulations were performed to probe the mechanism at high collision energies. Analysis of trajectories shows that, at E(col) of 3.0 eV, a small fraction of hydrogen peroxide (25%) is produced via a direct, concerted mechanism where two hydrogen atoms are transferred simultaneously, but most hydrogen peroxide (75%) is formed by dissociation of hydroperoxide intermediates. According to ab initio calculations and trajectory simulations, collisions also lead to formation of various endoperoxides, and dissociation of endoperoxides may play a role in physical quenching of (1)O(2).

Dimerization energies obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations on the hydrogen-bonded dimer of imidazole and planar formamide are used to represent the strength of this hydrogen bond in heme proteins. The effect of a change in iron oxidation state is modeled by varying the positive charge on imidazole. The effect of a change in hydrogen bond geometry is studied by employing x-ray coordinates for reduced and oxidized cytochrome c, deoxy- and metmyoglobin, and deoxy- and methemoglobin. Our conclusions are that the strength of this hydrogen bond in heme proteins is sensitive to both the oxidation state of the iron atom and to geometry changes on the order of those obtained from the x-ray coordinates. We speculate that the changes in oxidation state may be functionally coupled with changes in hydrogen bond geometry and that this hydrogen bond represents a feasible pathway to link protein conformation with redox potential or reactivity of the iron atom.",

The results show that the ground-state O(2)+HOC(O)H products can be produced by a direct hydrogen abstraction via a transition state with a small barrier (1.66 kcal/mol) on the lowest triplet surface. A similar hydrogen abstraction can occur on the singlet electronic surface, but it leads to the singlet O(2)(a(1)Delta) and HOC(O)H. On the singlet surface, a new stable intermediate, HOC(O)OOH, hydroperoxyformic acid, has been found. This intermediate is formed by the direct addition of the terminal oxygen atom in HO(2) onto the carbon atom in HOCO in a barrierless reaction. The HOC(O)OOH intermediate may dissociate into either the CO(2)+H(2)O(2) or CO(3)+H(2)O products through elimination reactions with four-center transition states, or into HOC(O)O+OH through an O-O bond cleavage. The heat of formation of HOC(O)OOH is predicted to be -118.9+/-1.0 kcal/mol. In addition, the dynamics of the HO(2)+HOCO reaction have been investigated using a scaling-all correlation couple cluster method with single and double excitation terms (CCSD) on the singlet potential energy surface. Reaction mechanisms have been studied in detail. It was found that the direct and addition reaction mechanisms coexist.

This is conjoined, with two boron atoms in common, to a second {SB(10)} subcluster of conventional nido eleven-vertex geometry. Protonation of 1 forms neutral [S(2)B(18)H(20)] 4. Subsequent deprotonation of 4 yields the fluxional [S(2)B(18)H(19)](-) anion 5, which is isomeric with 1. Neutral 4and anion 5 do not have the {B(7)} hexagonal pyramidal feature. Neutral 4 consists of conventional nido eleven-vertex {SB(10)} and arachno ten-vertex {SB(9)} subclusters conjoined with a single spiro boron atom in common. Anion 5 is closely related to 4, but with an additional inter-boron intercluster link. Anion 5 spontaneously reverts to anion 1 over a few hours at room temperature, remarkable in that the open {B(7)} hexagonal pyramid is regenerated.

Extension of this approach additionally defines transition states and intermediates for the fluxionality of 5, and also for the reassembly of the starting anion 1, together with its {B(7)} feature, from fluxional 5. The fluxionality of 5 involves the inter-subcluster transfer of a {BH} unit. The reassembly of 1 from 5 involves a DSD rearrangement and two successive hydrogen-atom hops.

The 55-atom quantum cluster is described at the density functional level while the remaining 1629 atoms of the surface cluster are described with atomistic potentials. Transition states are most easily calculated with our modified implementation of the climbing-image nudged elastic band method in ChemShell. With these computational techniques, we find that gas phase hydrogen atoms can chemisorb (-102 kJ mol(-1)) without an activation barrier on the forsterite (010) surface, concomitantly creating a surface electron at the adjacent magnesium atom site. Subsequently, an oxygen atom chemisorbs strongly to this surface electron site (-432 kJ mol(-1)). The rearrangement of the adjacently chemisorbed O and H to a chemisorbed OH-radical is endothermic by 4 kJ mol(-1) and activated by 27 kJ mol(-1). This chemisorbed OH can then react barrierlessly with a second hydrogen atom to yield adsorbed water (-511 kJ mol(-1)). Alternatively, if O and H do not recombine to form OH, but instead thermally equilibrate, a second hydrogen atom can react with the chemisorbed oxygen atom (-501 kJ mol(-1)) to yield dissociatively adsorbed water (OH(-) and H(+)), which then can rearrange to associatively adsorbed water (-5 kJ mol(-1), DeltaE(double dagger) = 18 kJ mol(-1)) or gas phase water (+91 kJ mol(-1)). The formation of water on a bare dust grain from hydrogen and oxygen atoms is thus catalysed by an olivine surface by stabilising the reaction intermediates and product.
