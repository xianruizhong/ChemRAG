From the early radiographic approaches using X-ray films as detectors, the portfolio of medical X-ray imaging devices developed into a large range of dedicated instrumentation for various applications. While X-ray imaging has come a long way, there are some physical properties of X-rays, which have not yet been fully exploited, and which may offer quite some room for further enhancements of current X-ray imaging equipment. Firstly, X-ray imaging today is mainly black and white, despite the fact that X-ray generators actually create a full spectrum of X-ray energies, and that the interactions of X-rays that occur within the human body are not the same for all energies and every material. Exploiting these spectral dependencies allows to not only obtain a black and white CT image, but also to obtain more molecularly specific information, which is relevant particularly in oncological precision radiology. The second aspect of X-rays, and so far in radiology mainly neglected and unused, is the physical fact that X-rays can also be interpreted in the wave picture, and not only as presently been done in the particle picture. If interpreted as waves, X-rays-just like visible light-experience a phase shift in matter, and this-if exploited correctly-can produce a new class of X-ray images, which then depict the wave interactions of X-rays with matter, rather than only the attenuating properties, as done until now.",

The capability of providing direct information on very small perturbations in atomic positions and thus on the minute changes in molecular geometry during (or as a consequence of) photoexcitation appears to be the most important asset of this emerging analytical technique. When combined with other physicochemical methods, X-ray photodiffraction can be a powerful tool for analysis of steady-state photoinduced structures as well as slow or very fast time-dependent phenomena. Despite being a very useful approach, however, due to a number of practical requirements that it places with regard to the system to be studied, at the present stage of developments the technique is not widely and indiscriminately applicable to any photoinduced process. In some particular chemical systems the inherent pitfalls could be practically overcome by practical or theoretical means. In this short chapter, the basic principles of X-ray photodiffraction are briefly summarized, and the prospects of its application to \"physical\" and \"chemical\" problems is illustrated with selected examples from recent literature.

It is claimed that in this way scattering from a powder, with randomly oriented crystals, gives rise to Bragg scattering even if the Bragg condition is never satisfied by an individual crystallite.

Whilst for a certain restricted set of shapes of crystals it is possible to obtain some diffraction close to (but not exactly at) the Bragg angle as the crystallite is oriented away from the Bragg condition, this is generally not the case.

The concept of angular resolution is introduced and applied to current x-ray source and detector configurations, testing their ability to record these features. It is difficult to record interference patterns arising from refractive phase shifts because their formation requires a mono-energetic beam. The refraction of x-rays across boundaries, as described by Snell's law, produces strong contrast enhancements when they are struck at close to the glancing incidence. Deflections are proportional to the change in electron density (at energies above the K-edge) and square root of the wavelength, so they can be observed with a poly-energetic beam. Diffraction can also be observed with white radiation, but produce fringes with far narrower separation under the same irradiation conditions.

This reactor is instrumented and controlled using virtual instrumentation. The power consumed by a constant-speed stirrer motor is measured as a function of time which, along with the temperature history, can be used to infer the state (monomer conversion xm and weight average molecular weight Mw) of the viscous reaction mass. This study highlights the importance of symmetry in the design of the reactor, proposes a novel reactor design, and discusses in detail the temperature control configuration that can help track any temperature history. Some preliminary results are reported for bulk polymerization of MMA and a correlation developed for the stirrer power, which can be used for soft sensing.",

When blood flows, membranes are bombarded with ions etc., whose entry creates an ATP demand proportional to flow rate. Also proportional to flow rate is ATP production from oxidation of substrates [S] from the same blood volume. 2. O2 is limiting and reaction velocity at rest (metabolic rate) is determined by flow rate, F, but not by [S]. 3. Since resting blood O2 A-V difference is about 5 vol%, 11 circulated produces about 0.25 kcal in mammals, birds or warm reptiles. 4. Where O2 is not limiting, as in most amino acid deaminations, V = K F[S] with K a constant unrelated to Km. 5. At equal blood vol/kg, solid geometry dictates that the average cross-sectional area of major vessels/kg will be an inverse function of body mass. The smaller the animal, the shorter the vessels, the \"thicker\" the vessels/kg body wt, and at any one blood pressure, the higher the flow/kg/hr. If a man's major vessels were equal in cross-section/kg to those of a shrew, it would take 224 l of blood to fill them. 6. Growth decreases flow/kg (and therefore metabolic rate), by decreasing vessel cross-section/kg without changing blood pressure or linear velocity of flow. 7. Surface area/g, body wt to some power, average vessel length/kg, circulation time and average major vessel cross-sectional area are all related mathematically.",

This is a fundamental question in physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering. This question hangs in the minds of many students, instructors, and researchers. The first instinct is to answer \"Yes, for water between 0 and 4 °C\" if one knows that water expands as temperature decreases in this temperature range. The same question is asked in several Physical Chemistry and Physics textbooks. Students are supposed to answer that water contracts when heated at below 4 °C in an isobaric process. Because work is done to the contracting water, less heat is required to increase the water temperature in an isobaric process than in an isochoric process. Therefore, <iC<subP</sub</i is less than <iC<subV</sub</i . However, this answer is fundamentally flawed because it assumes, implicitly and incorrectly, that the internal energy change of water depends solely on its temperature change. Neglecting the variation of the internal energy with volume (internal pressure) will invalidate the Clausius inequality and violate the second law of thermodynamics. Once the internal pressure is properly taken into account, it becomes clear that <iC<subP</sub</i cannot be less than <iC<subV</sub</i for any substance at any temperature regardless of the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient of the substance.",

This assertion is true, however, only for an isolated system. In a closed system, where energy exchange between the system and the environment occurs, input of energy in the form of an externally driven oscillation of a thermodynamic parameter (e.g. pressure or electric field strength), can maintain a chemical system in a stationary state away from equilibrium even if the ratio of the forward and backward rate constants for each elementary reaction equals the equilibrium constant at every instant.

On the other hand, an autocatalytic reaction front between a reactant and a product may propagate as a solitary wave, namely, at a constant velocity and with a stationary concentration profile, resulting from the balance between molecular diffusion and chemical reaction. In most systems, the fluid left behind the front has a different density leading to a lock-exchange configuration. We revisit, with a chemical reaction, the classical situation of lock-exchange.

At nondilute conditions, interactions among the components can give rise to coexisting phases, which can significantly alter the kinetics of chemical reactions. Here, we derive a theory for chemical reactions in coexisting phases at phase equilibrium. We show that phase equilibrium couples the rates of chemical reactions of components with their diffusive exchanges between the phases. Strikingly, the chemical relaxation kinetics can be represented as a flow along the phase equilibrium line in the phase diagram. A key finding of our theory is that differences in reaction rates between coexisting phases stem solely from phase-dependent reaction rate coefficients. Our theory is key to interpreting how concentration levels of reactive components in condensed phases control chemical reaction rates in synthetic and biological systems.",

By the mid-20th century, the theory of reaction rates had advanced and instruments had been developed in which the temperature of the sample could be increased at a constant rate. These nonisothermal methods are now widely used to determine the kinetic parameters of reactions because of their convenience. In this paper, the mathematical relationship between measurements at constant temperature (isothermal) and constant heating rate (nonisothermal) is developed and it is shown that there is a point in the temperature history of a single-step reaction at which the isothermal and nonisothermal reaction rates are equal. This equal (iso) kinetic point occurs at a temperature early in the heating history of nonisothermal analyses at which the reaction rate begins to accelerate. The isokinetic temperature is the basis for a new method of nonisothermal kinetic analysis that provides a direct measurement of the Arrhenius frequency factor A and activation energy E<suba</sub for the elementary step of a solid-state reaction without any assumptions about the relationship between these parameters (i.e., kinetic compensation) or the reaction mechanism.",

In the latter case, the pressure applied to the solutions is classified as hydrostatic pressure, which is a type of isotropic mechanical force. For instance, deep-sea organisms are exposed to hydrostatic pressure environments of up to 100 MPa, implying that hydrostatic pressurization plays a role in homeostatic functions at physiological levels. The pressure control of such complicated biological behavior can be addressed by thermodynamics or kinetics. In fact, the spontaneity (Δ<iG</i) of a reaction that is governed by weak interactions (approximately 10 kcal/mol), such as electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking, is determined by the exquisite balance of enthalpy (Δ<iH</i) and entropy changes (Δ<iS</i), in accordance with the fundamental thermodynamic equation Δ<iG</i = Δ<iH</i - <iT</iΔ<iS</i. The mutually correlated Δ<iH</i-Δ<iS</i relationship is known as the enthalpy-entropy compensation law, in which a more negative enthalpic change (more exothermic) causes further entropic loss based on a more negative entropy change. Namely, changing the temperature (<iT</i) as the state quantity, except for <iP</i, is highly likely to be equal to controlling the entropy term. The solution-state entropy term is relatively vague, mainly based on solvation, and thus unpredictable, even using high-cost quantum mechanical calculations because of the vast number of solvation molecules. Hence, such entropy control is not always feasible and must be demonstrated on a trial-and-error basis. Furthermore, the above-mentioned equation can be rearranged as Δ<iG</i = Δ<iF</i + <iP</iΔ<iV</i, enabling us to control solution-state reactions by simply changing <iP</i as hydrostatic pressure based on the volume change (Δ<iV</i). The volume term is strongly relevant to conformational changes, solvation changes, and molecular recognition upon complexation and thus is relatively predictable, that is, volumetrically compact or not, compared to the complicated entropy term. These extrathermodynamic and kinetic observations prompted us to use hydrostatic pressure as a controlling factor over a long period. Hydrostatic pressure chemistry in the solution phase has developed over the past six decades and then converged and passed the fields of mechanochemistry and mechanobiology, which are new but challenging and current hot topics in multidisciplinary science. In this Account, we fully summarize our achievements in solution-state hydrostatic pressure chemistry for smart/functional molecular, supramolecular, polymer, and biological systems. We hope that the phenomena, mechanistic outcomes, and methodologies that we introduced herein for hydrostatic-pressure-controlling dynamics can provide guidance for both theoretical and experimental chemists working in supramolecular and (bio)macromolecular chemistry, mechanoscience, materials science, and technology.",

Material transfer in these systems is determined by the flow rate and the concentration of material. While the most concentrated solutions offer the greatest potential in terms of material transfer, impedance typically increases with concentration, thus making them the most difficult to transport. We develop a general framework for describing systems for which impedance increases with concentration, and consider material flow in four different natural systems: blood flow in vertebrates, sugar transport in vascular plants and two modes of nectar drinking in birds and insects. The model provides a simple method for determining the optimum concentration copt in these systems. The model further suggests that the impedance at the optimum concentration μopt may be expressed in terms of the impedance of the pure (c = 0) carrier medium μ0 as μopt 2(α)μ0, where the power α is prescribed by the specific flow constraints, for example constant pressure for blood flow (α = 1) or constant work rate for certain nectar-drinking insects (α = 6). Comparing the model predictions with experimental data from more than 100 animal and plant species, we find that the simple model rationalizes the observed concentrations and impedances.

To evaluate the local state of micromixing, we used a system of parallel competing reactions involving the Dushman reaction between iodide and iodate, coupled with a neutralization. At first, we studied the effects of the acoustic frequency on micromixing (20-540-1000 kHz). It was found that micromixing through acoustic cavitation and acoustic streaming was more important at 20 kHz than at 540 kHz or 1 MHz. At high and low frequency, it was shown that the injection must be located near the ultrasonic emitter. The influence of the acoustic intensity proved to be predominant mostly for low intensities; for an acoustic intensity of 10 W cm(-2), a characteristic micromixing time of about 0.015 s has been obtained.

Induced polarization is incorporated into the potential function on the basis of the classical Drude oscillator model. Water-ethanol mixtures are simulated at 11 ethanol molar fractions, from 0.05 to 0.9.

Furthermore, the calculated dielectric constant for the various water-alcohol mixtures is in excellent agreement with experimental data.

This partial segregation is enhanced with decreasing temperature. The mole fraction of 0.27 also corresponds to the point of maximum excess entropy for ethanol-water mixtures.

Structural information is extracted for these solutions using neutron diffraction coupled with empirical potential structure refinement. We show that ethanol, like methanol, bi-percolates at this concentration and that, in a similar manner to methanol, alcohol segregation, as measured by the proximity of neighboring methyl sidechains, is increased upon cooling the solution. Water clustering is found to be significantly enhanced in both alcohol solutions compared to the water clustering that occurs for random, hard sphere-like, mixing with no hydrogen bonds between molecules. Alcohol clustering via the hydrophobic groups is, on the other hand, only slightly sensitive to the water hydrogen bond network.

The evaporation rates were examined by surface tension of the liquid mixture, but any definite relation between them was not found. Both the evaporation rate and the activation energy were found to be determined mainly by the mole fraction in the surface layer from which the evaporation takes place.

These results were based on simulations that used one water model for the solute-water interactions but two different water models for the water-water interactions. This is confirmed here by using two more water models for the water-water interactions. Furthermore, the previous work indicates that the initial decrease is caused by association of the hydration shells of the hydrocarbon tails, and the minimum occurs at the concentration where all of the hydration shells are touching each other. Thus, the characteristics of the hydration of the tail that cause the decrease and the features of the water models that reproduce this type of hydration are also examined here. The results show that a single-site multipole water model with a charge distribution that mimics the large quadrupole and the p-orbital type electron density out of the molecular plane has \"brittle\" hydration with hydrogen bonds that break as the tails touch, which reproduces the deep minimum. However, water models with more typical site representations with partial charges lead to flexible hydration that tends to stay intact, which produces a shallow minimum. Thus, brittle hydration may play an essential role in hydrophobic association in water. ",

Alcohol self-association is promoted in the presence of a small amount of water (ca. 10 approximately 20 wt%), in which the water-water hydrogen-bonding network is weak and does not contribute to alcohol self-association. We have demonstrated that alcohol self-association is also promoted by non-ideal mixing with other alcohols.

Eleven different mole fractions of TBA, covering extremely low TBA mole fractions to pure TBA, have been considered. An organic chromophore that undergoes a photoexcited intramolecular charge-transfer reaction is employed to reveal the signature of the solution heterogeneity. Upon increasing the solution temperature, the absorption spectrum of the dissolved chromophore exhibits a red shift at very low TBA concentrations but shifts toward higher energy (blue shift) at higher alcohol concentrations. This is a reflection of temperature-assisted aggregation of TBA molecules in very dilute aqueous solutions. The magnitude of the temperature-induced red shift is the largest at around 0.04 mol fraction of TBA, and a larger variation of the spectral line width across the temperature suggests enhanced solution heterogeneity. Reaction time constants measured at various mixture compositions are found to follow an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence. The average activation energy, when plotted as a function of mixture composition, steeply rises with TBA concentration in the limit of the very low TBA mole fraction and then suddenly levels off to a plateau upon further addition of TBA. The alcohol concentration-dependent activation energy abruptly changes its slope at a TBA mole fraction ∼0.1, at which a transition from the three-dimensional water-type network to the zigzag alcohol chain structure is known to occur. The plateau value of the activation energy is ∼6k(B)T and agrees well with the earlier estimate for the same chromophore from the pure solvent data at room temperature. The observed increase in the spectral red shift with temperature at low TBA mole fractions is in general agreement with the existing experimental results which support the view that temperature assists the aggregation of TBA molecules in dilute aqueous solutions of TBA. However, unlike in the small-angle neutron scattering study [ Bowron, D. T.; Finney, J. L. J. Phys. Chem.

Two Kamlet-Taft parameters, the polarizability π* and the hydrogen bond acceptor β coefficient were determined by spectroscopic measurements. In most cases, the solvent power (dipolarity/polarizability) of the ionic liquid is only slightly modified by the presence of the molecular component unless large quantities of this component are present. The viscosity and electrical conductivity of these mixtures were measured as a function of composition and the relationship between these two properties were studied through Walden plot curves. The viscosity of the ionic liquid dramatically decreases with the addition of the molecular component. This decrease is not directly related to the volumetric properties of each mixture or its interactions. The conductivity presents a maximum as a function of the composition and, except for the case of water, the conductivity maxima decrease for more viscous systems. The Walden plots indicate enhanced ionic association as the ionic liquid gets more diluted, a situation that is the inverse of that usually found for conventional electrolyte solutions.",

Miscibility and dielectric constant are fundamental properties that govern the applications of liquid mixtures. However, despite their importance, miscibility is usually predicted qualitatively based on the vaguely defined polarity of the liquids, and the dielectric constant of the mixture is modeled by introducing mixing rules. Here, we develop a first-principles theory for polar liquid mixtures using a statistical field approach, without resorting to mixing rules. With this theory, we obtain simple expressions for the mixture's dielectric constant and free energy of mixing. The dielectric constant predicted by this theory agrees well with measured data for simple binary mixtures. On the basis of the derived free energy of mixing, we can construct a miscibility map in the parameter space of the dielectric constant and molar volume for each liquid. The predicted miscibility shows remarkable agreement with known data, thus providing a quantitative basis for the empirical \"like-dissolves-like\" rule.",

The obtained results demonstrate that the addition of a small amount of water to tert-butyl alcohol (2-methyl-2-propanol, abbreviated as TBA) leads to minor changes in the structure of neat TBA and suggest that molecules of TBA in the mixture are in the same environment as those in pure TBA. The bands of water are red-shifted in the mixture relative to bulk water, implying that the molecules of water in TBA are involved in stronger hydrogen bonding. The present experimental data give no evidence for the existence of nonbonded water in the mixture. Even at a very low content of water, the main NIR bands of water (nu(2) + nu(3) and nu(1) + nu(3)) have two components showing markedly different behavior upon an increase in temperature. From the power spectra, it is seen that the extent of intensity changes due to the free OH groups of TBA is smaller in the mixture relative to pure TBA. All of these results support the model of chain-end bonding of water molecules to TBA associates. An increase in X(H2O) reduces the population of nonbonded OH groups of TBA, yet both processes do not appear at the same rate. The amount of bonded OH groups of water increases faster than that of the nonbonded ones. It seems that the water-water interaction becomes more important as X(H2O) increases. At high alcohol content, the position of the CH alkyl stretching bands is constant, evidencing a negligible role of the hydrophobic hydration in the mixture.",

An analogous state occurs in extremely low-temperature fluids, in which molecules flow without internal friction or resistance. Such a state, termed superfluidity, was predicted for helium-3 shortly after the Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of 1957 explained the superconductivity of metals. The search for helium-3 superfluidity commenced; it continued for about ten years without success, and was all but abandoned by the time Douglas D. Osheroff began his graduate studies at Cornell University. \"The general wisdom was that the superfluidity of helium-3 was a pipe dream of the theorists,\" says Osheroff. \"But in fact, it did occur.\" In 1972, Osheroff - together with David M. Lee and Robert C. Richardson - demonstrated the transition of helium-3 to a superfluid state at temperatures near absolute zero (-273 degrees C). Twenty-four years after their discovery, Osheroff and colleagues won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Osheroff's scientifically inquisitive nature developed long before his landmark discovery. \"A lot of people did crazy things when they were young\" says Osheroff, whose wild experimentation including building a 100,000-volt X-ray machine as a teenager. Now as a faculty member at Stanford University, Osheroff stresses the importance of mentoring undergraduates to get them excited about science, and to guide them on what to do next. As for graduate school, Osheroff says that \"it doesn't matter what is it that you study as a graduate student - the important thing is learning how to study.\"",

It is a prerequisite for life and as such a most important subject of current research in chemical physics and physical chemistry. In spite of its simplicity as a liquid, it has an enormously rich phase diagram where different types of ices, amorphous phases, and anomalies disclose a path that points to unique thermodynamics of its supercooled liquid state that still hides many unraveled secrets. In this review we describe the behavior of water in the regime from ambient conditions to the deeply supercooled region. The review describes simulations and experiments on this anomalous liquid. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomalous properties that become strongly enhanced in the supercooled region. Among those, the second critical-point scenario has been investigated extensively, and at present most experimental evidence point to this scenario. Starting from very low temperatures, a coexistence line between a high-density amorphous phase and a low-density amorphous phase would continue in a coexistence line between a high-density and a low-density liquid phase terminating in a liquid-liquid critical point, LLCP. On approaching this LLCP from the one-phase region, a crossover in thermodynamics and dynamics can be found. This is discussed based on a picture of a temperature-dependent balance between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid favored by, respectively, entropy and enthalpy, leading to a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of bulk water. Ice nucleation is also discussed, since this is what severely impedes experimental investigation of the vicinity of the proposed LLCP. Experimental investigation of stretched water, i.e., water at negative pressure, gives access to a different regime of the complex water diagram. Different ways to inhibit crystallization through confinement and aqueous solutions are discussed through results from experiments and simulations using the most sophisticated and advanced techniques. These findings represent tiles of a global picture that still needs to be completed. Some of the possible experimental lines of research that are essential to complete this picture are explored.",

The resistivity near melting exhibits a well documented sharp increase which allowed us to pinpoint the melting transition from ambient pressure to 64 GPa. Our data show that lithium melts clearly above 300 K in all pressure regions and its melting behavior adheres to the classical model.

Here we revisit our previous experiments by measuring melting points at five ethylene-glycol to sodium chloride ratios (R values; R=5, 10, 15, 30, and 45) and five levels of concentration for each ratio.

Due to the unique properties of matter at this scale, such devices offer great potential for creating novel materials and behaviors that can be leveraged to benefit mankind. This paper addresses a particular challenge involved in the design of nanostructures--their stochastic or apparently random response to external loading. This is because fundamentally the function that relates the energy of a nanostructure to the arrangement of its atoms is extremely nonconvex, with each minimum corresponding to a possible equilibrium state that may be visited as the system responds to loading. Traditional atomistic simulation techniques are not capable of systematically addressing this complexity. Instead, we construct an equilibrium map (EM) for the nanostructure, analogous to a phase diagram for bulk materials, which fully characterizes its response. Using the EM, definitive predictions can be made in limiting cases and the spectrum of responses at any desired loading rate can be obtained. The latter is important because standard atomistic methods are fundamentally limited, by computational feasibility, to simulations of loading rates that are many orders of magnitude faster than reality. In contrast, the EM-based approach makes possible the direct simulation of nanostructure experiments. We demonstrate the method's capabilities and its surprisingly complex results for the case of a nanoslab of nickel under compression.",

This NDR yields peculiar behavior that needs to be considered to design molecular and nanoelectronic devices. In addition, the commonly sharp contrast between transient and steady responses blurs at the nanoscale.

Additionally, the field is believed to have a large potential for technological applications, which has driven a high pace of experimental achievements in fabrication and characterization. From the side of theoretical modeling-so successful in solid state physics in general, since the emergence of density functional theory-we must acknowledge a weak connection to state of the art experimental achievements in the realm of nanostructures. The cause for this partial disconnect resides in the difficulty of the matter, nanostructures being small in size but large in the number of atoms constituting them, and the relevant observables being accessible only through proper treatment of excitations. The large number of atoms and the need for excited state properties makes this a challenging task for theory and modeling. In this contribution we will outline the framework, based on empirical pseudopotentials and configuration interaction, to obtain quantitative predictions of the excited state properties of semiconductor nanostructures using their experimental sizes, compositions and shapes. The methodology can be used to describe colloidal nanostructures of a few hundred atoms all the way to epitaxial structures requiring millions of atoms. The aim is to fill the gap existing between ab initio approaches and continuum descriptions. Based on the pseudopotential idea and the developments of empirical pseudopotentials for bulk materials in the early 1960s, the method has evolved into a powerful tool where the pseudopotential construction has lost some of its empirical character and is now based on modern density functional theory. We will present the construction of these potentials and the way the ensuing wavefunctions are used in a subsequent configuration interaction treatment of the excitation.

For example, the plasmon resonance shift upon shrinking the nanostructure size (red-shift for simple metals, blue-shift for <id</i-metals such as gold and silver) is universally accepted to originate from the quantum nature of the system.

To support our findings, we compare the ωFQFμ results for Ag and Au with literature time-dependent DFT simulations, showing the capability of fully classical physics to reproduce these TDDFT results.

Simulations are performed in a three-dimensional lattice of trap sites with energies distributed according to an exponential distribution and with a step-function distribution centered at the Fermi level. It is observed that once the stationary state is reached, the ensemble of particles follow Fermi-Dirac statistics with a well-defined Fermi level. In this stationary situation the diffusion coefficient obeys the theoretical predictions so that RWNS effectively reproduces the MT model. Mobilities can be also computed when an electrical bias is applied and they are observed to comply with the Einstein relation when compared with steady-state diffusion coefficients. The evolution of the system towards the stationary situation is also studied. When the diffusion coefficients are monitored along simulation time a transition from anomalous to trap-limited transport is observed. The nature of this transition is discussed in terms of the evolution of electron distribution and the Fermi level.

The ability to resolve structures using light microscopes is though limited to around 200 nm. Fluorescence-based super-resolution light microscopy techniques of several principles and methods have emerged in recent years and offer great potential to extend the capabilities of microscopy. This resolution improvement is especially promising for nanoscience where the imaging of nanoscale structures is inherently restricted by the resolution limit of standard forms of light microscopy. Resolution can be improved by several distinct approaches including structured illumination microscopy, stimulated emission depletion, and single-molecule positioning methods such as photoactivated localization microscopy and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy and several derivative variations of each of these. These methods involve substantial differences in the resolutions achievable in the different axes, speed of acquisition, compatibility with different labels, ease of use, hardware complexity, and compatibility with live biological samples. The field of super-resolution imaging and its application to nanotechnology is relatively new and still rapidly developing. An overview of how these methods may be used with nanomaterials is presented with some examples of pioneering uses of these approaches.",

The Fermi level displacement by potentiostatic control causes a broad change of physical properties such as the hopping conductivity, that can be investigated over a very large variation of electron density. In contrast to traditional electrochemistry, we emphasize that in nanostructured devices we must deal with systems that depart heavily from the ideal, Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, due to broad distributions of states (energy disorder) and interactions of charge carriers, therefore the electrochemical analysis must be aided by thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

In this work, we investigate bare and thiol-functionalized gold nanoparticles. For the latter, we employ a fast and low-cost fabrication technique which yields nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Using relatively long thiol-ended alkane chains for the functionalization modifies the electronic density of states of the nanoparticles. The study of decay dynamics of surface-plasmon-related hot electrons reveals the presence of electronic states at the interface which serve as a fast decay channel for electronic relaxation. By low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy we precisely investigate the energy scales and electronic interactions relevant for the tunnel charge transport through this system. We observe that the interaction between the functional ligand and the substrate on which the nanoparticles reside also influences the electronic transport.

Electrons in the conduction band roam throughout the metal core, and light can collectively excite these electrons to give rise to plasmonic responses. This plasmon resonance accounts for the beautiful ruby-red color of colloidal gold first observed by Faraday back in 1857.  On the other hand, when gold nanoparticles become extremely small (&lt;2 nm in diameter), significant quantization occurs to the conduction band. These quantum-sized nanoparticles constitute a new class of nanomaterial and have received much attention in recent years. To differentiate quantum-sized nanoparticles from conventional plasmonic gold nanoparticles, researchers often refer to the ultrasmall nanoparticles as nanoclusters.  In this Account, we chose several typical sizes of gold nanoclusters, including Au(25)(SR)(18), Au(38)(SR)(24), Au(102)(SR)(44), and Au(144)(SR)(60), to illustrate the novel properties of metal nanoclusters imparted by quantum size effects. In the nanocluster size regime, many of the physical and chemical properties of gold nanoparticles are fundamentally altered. Gold nanoclusters have discrete electronic energy levels as opposed to the continuous band in plasmonic nanoparticles. Quantum-sized nanoparticles also show multiple optical absorption peaks in the optical spectrum versus a single surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 520 nm for spherical gold nanocrystals. Although larger nanocrystals show an fcc structure, nanoclusters often have non-fcc atomic packing structures. Nanoclusters also have unique fluorescent, chiral, and magnetic properties.  Due to the strong quantum confinement effect, adding or removing one gold atom significantly changes the structure and the electronic and optical properties of the nanocluster. Therefore, precise atomic control of nanoclusters is critically important: the nanometer precision typical of conventional nanoparticles is not sufficient. Atomically precise nanoclusters are represented by molecular formulas (e.g. Au(n)(SR)(m) for thiolate-protected ones, where n and m denote the respective number of gold atoms and ligands).  Recently, major advances in the synthesis and structural characterization of molecular purity gold nanoclusters have made in-depth investigations of the size evolution of metal nanoclusters possible. Metal nanoclusters lie in the intermediate regime between localized atomic states and delocalized band structure in terms of electronic properties. We anticipate that future research on quantum-sized nanoclusters will stimulate broad scientific and technological interests in this special type of metal nanomaterial.",

At atmospheric pressure, this quantity increases for low alcohol mole fractions, reaches a maximum at intermediate concentrations, and then quickly falls. The new experimental results are basically in agreement with previous data in the literature by Wada and Umeda [G. Wada and S. Umeda, Bull. Chem. Soc.

Our exploration of the potential energy surface of (ethanol)<sub6</sub-water heteroheptamers, carried out at the B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p) level, shows these heteroclusters to exhibit a cyclic structure where the cooperativity effects between the OH···O HBs is a fundamental ingredient.

A comparison between (ethanol)<sub7</sub, (ethanol)<sub6</sub-water, (methanol)<sub7</sub, and (methanol)<sub6</sub-water shows the ethanol-containing systems to be significantly more stable than the methanol-containing analogues. This result is probably due to the fact that the OH···O HBs are weaker than those found between ethanol molecules. However, our atoms in molecule (AIM) and noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses unambiguously show that important contributors to the enhanced stability of the ethanol-containing clusters are the secondary van der Waals interactions between ethyl groups, which are not observed between methyl groups. Hence, while the formation of stable azeotropes is expected for the case of ethanol, for the methanol-containing analogues, the relative stability of the clusters is significantly smaller, and its formation is accompanied by an increase of the free energy.",

The more stable solvent complex formed via stronger hydrogen bonds can more effectively differentiate the anions through the anion-solvent complex interactions, resulting in a stronger amplification of Hofmeister effect. This study provides an alternative method to tune the relative strength of Hofmeister effect besides salt concentration. ",

The structural basis of the NMR pattern change was interpreted by a multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) analysis of the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra obtained for ethanol-water solutions. Results suggest that the NMR pattern change is due to the formation of ethanol-ethanol clusters. Below the critical concentration, no ethanol-ethanol clusters exist.

One claim is that the entirety of Δ<iE</i can be accounted for by the gauche effect. Against this, calculations using five different methods show that the maximum contribution of the gauche effect to Δ<iE</i is less than 1 kcal/mol. A second argument employs the quantum theory of atoms in molecules to contend that the absence of a bond critical point (BCP) between the OH and X groups in 2-X-ethanols denotes the lack of an IMHB. By looking at the 2-X-ethanols at fixed XCCO torsional angles ranging from 0° to 60°, it is shown that the BCP criterion is inconsistent with other properties such as energy, bond lengths, and stretching frequencies. These inconsistencies are removed when the theory of noncovalent interactions is used.

The non-polar dopants shift both the Debye and the primary structural relaxation time in the same direction, to shorter times for 3-methylpentane and to longer times for squalane, consistent with the relative glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the components. By contrast, polar dopants such as water or methanol modify the α-process towards slower dynamics and increased amplitude, while the Debye process is accelerated and with a decreased amplitude. This effect of adding water to alcohol is explained by water promoting more compact structures with reduced Kirkwood correlation factors.

A systematic study of the binary solutions of acetone with ethanol and butanol does not only reveal a universal behaviour at the molecular level when acetone is mixed with short-chain alcohols, it also shows that the phenomena at a length scale between the molecules and in the macroscopic solution need to be taken into account to understand the structure-property relationships. The size of self-associated molecule clusters seems to determine whether or not a system exhibits an azeotrope.

The activation enthalpy (ΔH(‡)), the activation entropy (ΔS(‡)), and the free energy barrier (ΔG(‡)) to evaporation have been determined by measuring the molar coefficient of evaporation, k(evap), at nine different temperatures (30-70 °C) and four gas flow rates (25-200 mL/min) using nitrogen and argon as carrier gases. At 70 °C in argon, the effect of the gas flow rate on k(evap) and ΔG(‡) is small. However, this is not true at temperatures as low as 30 °C, where the increase of the gas flow rate from 25 to 200 mL/min results in a nearly 6 times increase of k(evap) and decrease of ΔG(‡) by ~5 kJ/mol. Therefore, at 30 °C, the effect of the gas flow rate on the ethanol evaporation rate is attributed to interactions of ethanol with argon molecules. This is supported by simultaneous infrared spectroscopic analysis of the evolved vapors, which demonstrates the presence of different amounts of linear and cyclic hydrogen bonded ethanol aggregates. While the amount of these aggregates at 30 °C depends upon the gas flow rate, no such dependence was observed during evaporation at 70 °C. When the evaporation was carried out in nitrogen, ΔG(‡) was almost independent of the evaporation temperature (30-70 °C) and the gas flow rate (25-200 mL/min). Thus the evaporation of ethanol in a dynamic gas atmosphere at different temperatures may go via different mechanisms depending on the nature of the carrier gas.",

The taste of whisky is primarily associated with amphipathic molecules, such as guaiacol, but why and how dilution enhances the taste is not well understood. We carried out computer simulations of water-ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol, providing atomistic details on the structure of the liquid mixture. We found that guaiacol is preferentially associated with ethanol, and, therefore, primarily found at the liquid-air interface in mixtures that contain up to 45 vol-% of ethanol. At ethanol concentrations of 59 vol-% or higher, guaiacol is increasingly surrounded by ethanol molecules and is driven to the bulk. This indicates that the taste of guaiacol in the whisky would be enhanced upon dilution prior to bottling. Our findings may apply to other flavour-giving amphipathic molecules and could contribute to optimising the production of spirits for desired tastes. Furthermore, it sheds light on the molecular structure of water-alcohol mixtures that contain small solutes, and reveals that interactions with the water may be negligible already at 89 vol-% of ethanol.",

However, the precise properties of incoherent exciton populations in such systems are difficult to determine and are the subject of intense debate. We review recent contributions to this discussion, and argue that to obtain detailed information about exciton populations, conventional experimental techniques should be supplemented by direct quasi-particle spectroscopy using the relatively newly available terahertz light sources.

Typical molecular chromophores place only about 1% of their oscillator strength in the UV-vis window, so individual chromophores operate at about 1% of their theoretical limit. We explore the distribution of oscillator strength as a function of excitation energy to understand this circumstance. To this aim, we use familiar independent-electron model Hamiltonians as well as first-principles electronic structure methods. While model Hamiltonians capture the qualitative electronic spectra associated with π electron chromophores, these Hamiltonians mistakenly focus the oscillator strength in the fewest low-energy transitions. Advanced electronic structure methods, in contrast, spread the oscillator strength over a very wide excitation energy range, including transitions to Rydberg and continuum states, consistent with experiment.

In this perspective, we discuss electroabsorption spectroscopy (EAS), as the spectral bandshape of the electroabsorption (EA) signal directly depends on the strength of the charge carrier interactions. For instance, the electroabsorption response in molecular or confined excitonic systems can be modelled perturbatively yielding the Stark effect. In contrast, most solids exhibit weaker interactions, and a perturbative approach cannot be taken in general. For solids with negligible charge carrier interactions, one resorts to the Franz-Keldysh theory of a continuum in a field, that, in the low-field limit, simplifies to the low-field FKA effect. Alternatively, when the continuum approximation breaks down, the problem of a Wannier exciton in a field has to be solved, and numerical methods emerged as the best solution. We illustrate our discussion with two examples involving lead-halide perovskites, a new, high-stake solar cell material. In the first example, we discuss the lineshape of the electroabsorption response for thin-films of lead-iodide perovskite, that sustains the photogeneration of free carriers.

We investigate the relationship between the electronic band structures and exciton binding energies in semiconductors, employing first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory and the many-body perturbation theory using Green's functions. Our results clearly show that E(b) increases as the localization of valence electrons increases due to the reduced electronic screening.

For example, some applications are based on light scattering with twice the energy of the incoming photon for selected compounds, that is, the nonlinear optical effect related to the second-order susceptibility term from the electronic polarization expression. The microscopic interpretation of this phenomenon is called the first-order molecular hyperpolarizability or incoherent second harmonic generation of light. Understanding such phenomena as a function of the incoming wavelength is crucial to improving the optical response of future materials. Still, the experimental apparatus, hyper-Rayleigh scattering, apparently simple, is indeed a challenging task. Therefore, we proposed a proper alternative to obtain the dispersion of the first-order hyperpolarizability using the well-known one- and two-photon absorption techniques. By the spectral analysis of both the spectra, we gathered spectroscopic parameters and applied them for predicting the first-order hyperpolarizability dispersion. This prediction is based on an <in</i-level energy system, taking into account the position and magnitude of transition dipole moments and the difference between the permanent dipole moment of the <in</i-excited states.

Here we experimentally demonstrate that using semiconductor nanocrystals we can reduce this energy loss to a nearly absolute minimum allowed by energy conservation by producing multiple excitons per single photon. Specifically, we generate seven excitons from a photon with an energy of 7.8 energy gaps, which corresponds to only approximately 10% energy loss, while in the normal scenario (one photon produces one exciton) approximately 90% of the photon energy would be dissipated as heat.

Linear optical properties show that the phenylacetylene-based compounds exhibit strong molar absorptivity in the UV and high fluorescence quantum yield with lifetimes of approximately 2.0 ns, while the azoaromatic-compound has a strong absorption in the visible region with very low fluorescence quantum yield. The two-photon absorption was investigated employing nonlinear optical techniques and quantum chemical calculations based on the response functions formalism within the density functional theory framework. The experimental data revealed well-defined 2PA spectra with reasonable cross-section values in the visible and IR. Along the nonlinear spectra we observed two 2PA allowed bands, as well as the resonance enhancement effect due to the presence of one intermediate one-photon allowed state. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the 2PA allowed bands correspond to transitions to states that are also one-photon allowed, indicating the relaxation of the electric-dipole selection rules. Moreover, using the theoretical results, we were able to interpret the experimental trends of the 2PA spectra. Finally, using a few-energy-level diagram, within the sum-over-essential states approach, we observed strong qualitative and quantitative correlation between experimental and theoretical results.",

It is now shown that the ultrafast decay of hot electrons across Au nanoparticles can be significantly reduced by strong coupling with CdS quantum dots and by a Schottky junction with perovskite SrTiO3 nanoparticles.

In the early years of biochemistry, crystallization was a tool for the preparation of biological substances. Today, biocrystallogenesis aims to provide efficient methods for crystal fabrication and a means to optimize crystal quality for X-ray crystallography. The historical development of crystallization methods for structural biology occurred first in conjunction with that of biochemical and genetic methods for macromolecule production, then with the development of structure determination methodologies and, recently, with routine access to synchrotron X-ray sources. Previously, the identification of conditions that sustain crystal growth occurred mostly empirically but, in recent decades, this has moved progressively towards more rationality as a result of a deeper understanding of the physical chemistry of protein crystal growth and the use of idea-driven screening and high-throughput procedures. Protein and nucleic acid engineering procedures to facilitate crystallization, as well as crystallization methods in gelled-media or by counter-diffusion, represent recent important achievements, although the underlying concepts are old. The new nanotechnologies have brought a significant improvement in the practice of protein crystallization. Today, the increasing number of crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank could mean that crystallization is no longer a bottleneck. This is not the case, however, because structural biology projects always become more challenging and thereby require adapted methods to enable the growth of the appropriate crystals, notably macromolecular assemblages.

It is therefore generally necessary to improve upon these initial conditions in order to obtain better crystals of sufficient quality for X-ray data collection.

The quality of an X-ray structure determination is directly correlated with the size and the perfection of the crystalline samples; thus, refinement of conditions should always be a primary component of crystal growth.

This is particularly true for crystallization in solution, which is an essential part of processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and a major step in physiological and pathological phenomena. There have been significant recent advances in the understanding of the mechanism of nucleation of crystals in solution. The foremost of these are the two-step mechanism of nucleation and the notion of the solution-crystal spinodal. According to the two-step mechanism, the crystalline nucleus appears inside pre-existing metastable clusters of size several hundred nanometers, which consist of dense liquid and are suspended in the solution. While initially proposed for protein crystals, the applicability of this mechanism has been demonstrated for small molecule organic materials, colloids, polymers, and biominerals. This mechanism helps to explain several long-standing puzzles of crystal nucleation in solution: nucleation rates which are many orders of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions, the significance of the dense protein liquid, and others. At high supersaturations typical of most crystallizing systems, the generation of crystal embryos occurs in the spinodal regime, where the nucleation barrier is negligible. The solution-crystal spinodal helps to understand the role of heterogeneous substrates in nucleation and the selection of crystalline polymorphs. Importantly, these ideas provide powerful tools for control of the nucleation process by varying the solution thermodynamic parameters.",

The three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have not been crystallized previously. As a control system, we used E. coli polypeptide elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Apart from the different proteins used here, the methods we employed differed from previous studies in that (1) instead of making a series of measurements on individual samples at various concentrations, the protein solutions were titrated with the precipitants, and (2) the results of the light-scattering measurements were analysed by a new maximum entropy procedure that calculates a particle size distribution in a highly reproducible way. The particle size distributions of protein solutions titrated with precipitants showed two major peaks in most cases. For both peaks, relative areas and mean diffusion coefficients were determined. The diffusion constants were corrected for the viscosity of the solutions. From comparing the results on the proteins known to crystallize (EF-Tu) with the amorphously precipitating systems (LRSEC, NRSEC) we find two necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for the formation of crystals: the diffusion coefficient of the monomer peak stays constant until very close to the precipitation point; the percentage of large aggregates stays small (less than 10% of the scattered light intensity) during the titration. For VRSEC, both ammonium sulphate and sodium citrate showed a low percentage of large aggregates and a constant diffusion coefficient of the main (protein monomer) peak below the precipitation point. This indicates that both would be possible precipitants for the crystallization of this enzyme.

The availability of atomic resolution structures provides a deep and unique understanding of protein function, and helps to unravel the inner workings of the living cell. To date, 86% of the Protein Data Bank (rcsb-PDB) entries are macromolecular structures that were determined using X-ray crystallography. To obtain crystals suitable for crystallographic studies, the macromolecule (e.g. protein, nucleic acid, protein-protein complex or protein-nucleic acid complex) must be purified to homogeneity, or as close as possible to homogeneity. The homogeneity of the preparation is a key factor in obtaining crystals that diffract to high resolution (Bergfors, 1999; McPherson, 1999). Crystallization requires bringing the macromolecule to supersaturation. The sample should therefore be concentrated to the highest possible concentration without causing aggregation or precipitation of the macromolecule (usually 2-50 mg/mL). Introducing the sample to precipitating agent can promote the nucleation of protein crystals in the solution, which can result in large three-dimensional crystals growing from the solution. There are two main techniques to obtain crystals: vapor diffusion and batch crystallization. In vapor diffusion, a drop containing a mixture of precipitant and protein solutions is sealed in a chamber with pure precipitant. Water vapor then diffuses out of the drop until the osmolarity of the drop and the precipitant are equal (Figure 1A). The dehydration of the drop causes a slow concentration of both protein and precipitant until equilibrium is achieved, ideally in the crystal nucleation zone of the phase diagram. The batch method relies on bringing the protein directly into the nucleation zone by mixing protein with the appropriate amount of precipitant (Figure 1B). This method is usually performed under a paraffin/mineral oil mixture to prevent the diffusion of water out of the drop. Here we will demonstrate two kinds of experimental setup for vapor diffusion, hanging drop and sitting drop, in addition to batch crystallization under oil.",

Once a sequence has been designed, the RNA may be synthesized chemically by solid-state synthesis or it may be produced enzymatically using RNA polymerase and an appropriate DNA template. Purification of milligram quantities of RNA can be accomplished by HPLC or gel electrophoresis. As with proteins, crystallization of RNA is usually accomplished by vapor diffusion techniques.

We identify specific sequence features that correlate with crystallization propensity and that can be used to estimate the crystallization probability of a given construct.

At low supersaturation conditions, as described previously for small molecule crystallization, the metastable region was obtained. Under these conditions aggregation took place, but crystallization did not proceed and critical nuclei did not form over a long period of time. The critical solution supersaturation necessary to obtain crystals, sigma = ln(c/s) where c and s are concentration and solubility of protein, varied from approximately 0.1 for pumpkin seed globulin to approximately 0.9 for STMV. For higher supersaturation conditions when aggregation processes leading to formation of crystals are not established immediately but after a certain induction period, the supersaturation-dependent critical nuclear size, R(c), for different macromolecular systems was estimated from time-dependent size-distribution analyses to be in the range of approximately 10(3) for proteins such as pumpkin globulin to approximately 10 for virus particles. From the same data, the molar interfacial free energy was deduced to be 3.3-9.2 kJ mol(-1). These are believed to be among the first estimates for macromolecular crystals. Under conditions of moderate supersaturation where induction periods preceded the appearance of critical nuclei, the potential barriers for formation were estimated to be in the range 8.3-50 kJ mol(-1). Growth and dissolution kinetics for pumpkin seed globulin were investigated. These experiments allowed determination of protein solubility versus solution temperature, protein and precipitant concentrations. Aggregation patterns which lead to crystal formation are distinctly different to those which produce an amorphous precipitate. The results provide additional evidence that QELS can be used to find general criteria that allow one to discriminate between conditions for a given protein system leading to crystalline or amorphous states at early stages of the aggregation process.",

Although the idiosyncratic features of proteins have to be taken into account, the crystallization of proteins is governed by the same physics as the crystallization of inorganic materials. At present, a diversified panel of crystallization methods adapted to proteins has been validated, and although only a few methods are in current practice, the success rate of crystallization has increased constantly, leading to the determination of ∼10<sup5</sup X-ray structures. These structures reveal a huge repertoire of protein folds, but they only cover a restricted part of macromolecular diversity across the tree of life. In the future, crystals representative of missing structures or that will better document the structural dynamics and functional steps underlying biological processes need to be grown. For the pertinent choice of biologically relevant targets, computer-guided analysis of structural databases is needed. From another perspective, crystallization is a self-assembly process that can occur in the bulk of crowded fluids, with crystals being supramolecular assemblies. Life also uses self-assembly and supramolecular processes leading to transient, or less often stable, complexes. An integrated view of supramolecularity implies that proteins crystallizing either <iin vitro</i or <iin vivo</i or participating in cellular processes share common attributes, notably determinants and antideterminants that favour or disfavour their correct or incorrect associations. As a result, under <iin vivo</i conditions proteins show a balance between features that favour or disfavour association. If this balance is broken, disorders/diseases occur. Understanding crystallization under <iin vivo</i conditions is a challenge for the future. In this quest, the analysis of packing contacts and contacts within oligomers will be crucial in order to decipher the rules governing protein self-assembly and will guide the engineering of novel biomaterials. In a wider perspective, understanding such contacts will open the route towards supramolecular biology and generalized crystallogenesis.",

The most significant of these is the two-step mechanism of nucleation, according to which the crystalline nucleus appears inside pre-existing metastable clusters of size several hundred nanometers, which consist of dense liquid and are suspended in the solution. While initially proposed for protein crystals, the applicability of this mechanism has been demonstrated for small-molecule organic and inorganic materials, colloids, and biominerals. This mechanism helps to explain several long-standing puzzles of crystal nucleation in solution: nucleation rates which are many orders of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions, nucleation kinetic dependencies with steady or receding parts at increasing supersaturation, the role of heterogeneous substrates for polymorph selection, the significance of the dense protein liquid, and others. More importantly, this mechanism provides powerful tools for control of the nucleation process by varying the solution thermodynamic parameters so that the volume occupied by the dense liquid shrinks or expands.",

Electronic light microscopy: present capabilities and future prospects.\nElectronic light microscopy involves the combination of microscopic techniques with electronic imaging and digital image processing, resulting in dramatic improvements in image quality and ease of quantitative analysis. In this review, after a brief definition of digital images and a discussion of the sampling requirements for the accurate digital recording of optical images, I discuss the three most important imaging modalities in electronic light microscopy--video-enhanced contrast microscopy, digital fluorescence microscopy and confocal scanning microscopy--considering their capabilities, their applications, and recent developments that will increase their potential. Video-enhanced contrast microscopy permits the clear visualisation and real-time dynamic recording of minute objects such as microtubules, vesicles and colloidal gold particles, an order of magnitude smaller than the resolution limit of the light microscope. It has revolutionised the study of cellular motility, and permits the quantitative tracking of organelles and gold-labelled membrane bound proteins. In combination with the technique of optical trapping (optical tweezers), it permits exquisitely sensitive force and distance measurements to be made on motor proteins. Digital fluorescence microscopy enables low-light-level imaging of fluorescently labelled specimens. Recent progress has involved improvements in cameras, fluorescent probes and fluorescent filter sets, particularly multiple bandpass dichroic mirrors, and developments in multiparameter imaging, which is becoming particularly important for in situ hybridisation studies and automated image cytometry, fluorescence ratio imaging, and time-resolved fluorescence. As software improves and small computers become more powerful, computational techniques for out-of-focus blur deconvolution and image restoration are becoming increasingly important. Confocal microscopy permits convenient, high-resolution, non-invasive, blur-free optical sectioning and 3D image acquisition, but suffers from a number of limitations. I discuss advances in confocal techniques that address the problems of temporal resolution, spherical and chromatic aberration, wavelength flexibility and cross-talk between fluorescent channels, and describe new optics to enhance axial resolution and the use of two-photon excitation to reduce photobleaching. Finally, I consider the desirability of establishing a digital image database, the BioImage database, which would permit the archival storage of, and public Internet access to, multidimensional image data from all forms of biological microscopy. Submission of images to the BioImage database would be made in coordination with the scientific publication of research results based upon these data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

An introduction to the proceedings of the Second International Symposium and Workshop on Emission microscopy and Related Techniques.\nEmission microscopes and related instruments comprise a specialized class of electron microscopes that have in common an acceleration field in combination with the first stage of imaging (i.e., an immersion objective lens, also called a cathode lens or emission lens). These imaging techniques include photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM or PEM), electron emission induced by heat, ions, or neutral particles, mirror electron microscopy (MEM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM), among others. In these instruments the specimen is placed on a flat cathode or is the cathode itself. The low-energy electrons that are emitted, reflected, or backscattered from the specimen are first accelerated and then imaged by means of an electron lens system resembling that of a transmission electron microscope. The image is formed in a parallel mode in all of the above instruments, in contrast to the image in scanning electron microscopes, where the information is collected sequentially by scanning the specimen. A brief history and introduction to emission microscopy, MEM, and LEEM is presented as a background for the Proceedings of the Second International Symposium and Workshop on this subject, held in Seattle, Washington, August 16-17, 1990.

Techniques have been generally available since the 1980s which overcome this restriction for individual diffracted beams, by making a compromise between illuminated area and beam convergence. Here a simple technique is described which overcomes all of these problems using computer control, giving electron diffraction data over a large angular range for many diffracted beams from the volume given by a focused electron beam (typically a few nm or less).

The 2PT method determines the thermodynamic properties by applying the proper statistical mechanical partition function to the normal modes of a fluid. The vibrational density of state (DoS), obtained from the Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function, converges quickly, allowing the free energy, entropy, and other thermodynamic properties to be determined from short 20-ps MD trajectories. The anharmonic effects in the vibrations are accounted for by the broadening of the normal modes into bands from sampling the velocities over the trajectory. The low frequency diffusive modes, which lead to finite DoS at zero frequency, are accounted for by considering the DoS as a superposition of gas-phase and solid-phase components (two phases). The analytical decomposition of the DoS allows for an evaluation of properties contributed by different types of molecular motions. We show that this 2PT analysis leads to accurate predictions of entropy and energy of CO2 over a wide range of conditions (from the triple point to the critical point of both the vapor and the liquid phases along the saturation line). This allows the equation of state of CO2 to be determined, which is limited only by the accuracy of the force field. We also validated that the 2PT entropy agrees with that determined from thermodynamic integration, but 2PT requires only a fraction of the time. A complication for CO2 is that its equilibrium configuration is linear, which would have only two rotational modes, but during the dynamics it is never exactly linear, so that there is a third mode from rotational about the axis. In this work, we show how to treat such linear molecules in the 2PT framework. ",

The inverse of the entropy capacity relates the response of the system (change of temperature) to a stimulus (change of entropy) such as the fluid level responses to a change in amount of fluid contained in a vessel. Frequently, entropy capacity has been used implicitly, which is clarified in examples of the low-temperature analysis of phononic and electronic contributions to the thermal capacity of solids. Generally, entropy capacity is used in the estimation of the entropy of a solid. Implicitly, the thermoelectric figure of merit refers to entropy capacity. The advantage of the explicit use of entropy capacity comes with a descriptive fundamental understanding of the thermal behaviour of solids, which is made clear by the examples of the Debye model of phonons in solids, the latest thermochemical modelling of carbon allotropes (diamond and graphite) and not least caloric materials.

Hydrogen had been prepared earlier by Boyle but its properties had not been recognized; Cavendish described these in detail, including the density of the gas. Carbon dioxide had also previously been studied by Black, but Cavendish clarified its properties and measured its density. He was the first person to accurately analyze atmospheric air and reported an oxygen concentration very close to the currently accepted value. When he removed all the oxygen and nitrogen from an air sample, he found that there was a residual portion of about 0.8% that he could not characterize. Later this was shown to be argon. He produced large amounts of water by burning hydrogen in oxygen and recognized that these were its only constituents. Cavendish also worked on electricity and heat. However, his main contribution outside chemistry was an audacious experiment to measure the density of the earth, which he referred to as \"weighing the world.\" This involved determining the gravitational attraction between lead spheres in a specially constructed building. Although this was a simple experiment in principle, there were numerous complexities that he overcame with meticulous attention to experimental details. His result was very close to the modern accepted value. The Cavendish Experiment, as it is called, assures his place in the history of science. ",

Heat generation and absorption are universal features of microbial growth and product formation as well as of cell cultures from animals, plants and insects. The heat production rate reflects metabolic changes in real time and is measurable on-line. The detection limit of commercially available calorimetric instruments can be low enough to measure the heat of 100,000 aerobically growing bacteria or of 100 myocardial cells. Heat can be monitored in reaction vessels ranging from a few nanoliters up to many cubic meters. Most important the heat flux measurement does not interfere with the biological process under investigation. The practical advantages of calorimetry include the waiver of labeling and reactants. It is further possible to assemble the thermal transducer in a protected way that reduces aging and thereby signal drifts. Calorimetry works with optically opaque solutions. All of these advantages make calorimetry an interesting method for many applications in medicine, environmental sciences, ecology, biochemistry and biotechnology, just to mention a few. However, in many cases the heat signal is merely used to monitor biological processes but only rarely to quantitatively interpret the data. Therefore, a significant proportion of the information potential of calorimetry remains unutilized. To fill this information gap and to motivate the reader using the full information potential of calorimetry, various methods for quantitative data interpretations are presented, evaluated and compared with each other. Possible errors of interpretation and limitations of quantitative data analysis are also discussed. ",

His initial interest was in alkalis such as limewater that were thought to be useful in the treatment of renal stone. When he studied magnesium carbonate, he found that when this was heated or exposed to acid, a gas was evolved that he called \"fixed air\" because it had been combined with a solid material. He showed that the new gas extinguished a flame, that it could not support life, and that it was present in gas exhaled from the lung. Within a few years of his discovery, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen were also isolated. Thus arguably Black's work started the avalanche of research on the respiratory gases carried out by Priestley, Scheele, Lavoisier, and Cavendish. Black then turned his attention to heat and he was the first person to describe latent heat, that is the heat added or lost when a liquid changes its state, for example when water changes to ice or steam. Latent heat is a key concept in thermal physiology because of the heat lost when sweat evaporates. Black was a friend of the young James Watt (1736-1819) who was responsible for the development of early steam engines. Watt was puzzled why so much cooling was necessary to condense steam into water, and Black realized that the answer was the latent heat. The resulting improvements in steam engines ushered in the Industrial Revolution.",

Good agreement with indirect heat capacity estimations from the literature was obtained for the three liquids. Experimental results show large anomalies in water heat capacity.

For a reversible Carnot cycle operating between thermal reservoirs with Celsius temperatures <it</i and t + d t , heat <iQ</i from the hot reservoir, and net work <iW</i, Clapeyron derived W / Q = d t / C ( t ) , with C ( t ) material-independent.

As noted by Gibbs, in 1850, Clausius established the first modern form of thermodynamics, followed by Thomson's 1851 rephrasing of what he called the Second Law. In 1854, Clausius theoretically established for a simple Carnot cycle the condition Q 1 / T 1 + Q 2 / T 2 = 0 . He generalized it to ∑ i Q i / T g , i = 0 , and then ∮ d Q / T g = 0 .

We have termed these procedures \"volume-based thermodynamics\" (VBT). We here extend these studies to ambient isobaric heat capacities, C(p,m), of a wide range of materials. We show that heat capacity is strongly linearly correlated with formula volume for large sets of minerals, for ionic solids in general, and for ionic liquids and that the results demonstrate that the Neumann-Kopp rule (additivity of heat capacity contributions per atom) is widely valid for ionic materials, but the smaller heat capacity contribution per unit volume for ionic liquids is noted and discussed. Using these correlations, it is possible to predict values of ambient (298 K) heat capacities quite simply. We also show that the heat capacity contribution of water molecules of crystallization is remarkably constant, at 41.3 ± 4.7 J K(-1) (mol of water)(-1), so that the heat capacities of various hydrates may be reliably estimated from the values of their chemical formula neighbors.

We discuss how these activities will improve the link between thermodynamic temperature and the temperature as measured using the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) and report some preliminary results obtained by dielectric constant gas thermometry and acoustic gas thermometry. We also provide information on the status of other primary methods, such as Doppler broadening thermometry, Johnson noise thermometry and refractive index gas thermometry.

The reagent iodine monochloride oxidizes sulfur dioxide to sulfate, thereby reducing itself to iodine. Thus liberated iodine will also oxidize sulfur dioxide and reduce itself to iodide. The obtained iodide is expected to combine with iodine to form a brown-colored homoatomictriiodide anion (460 nm), which forms an ion-pair with the sulfonamide cation, providing exceptional color stability to the system under an acidic condition, and is quantitatively relatd to sulfur dioxide.

In the early part of the century, the British pneumatic chemists struggled to replace the traditional notion 'Air', understood as an inert chemical element, with the concept of 'air', regarded as the third state of matter, encompassing a wide variety of chemical species. These developments constituted a necessary condition for the Chemical Revolution, which occurred in the latter part of the century. In 'Observations', Priestley took pneumatic chemistry to a new level, with the discovery of eight simple inorganic gases. Motivated by his belief in a benevolent God and a pious utilitarianism, Priestly explored the role of the atmosphere in the balance of nature and the politics of the state, which he linked to the movement of Rational Dissent. He styled himself an 'aerial philosopher' to signal the interdisciplinary nature of his inquiries, which he regarded not as a branch of ordinary chemistry, but as a mode of thought that encompassed physics, chemistry and natural theology. Priestley saw it as a source of principles and secrets of nature more extensive than that of 'gravity itself'.

This is the simple molecular orbital model, which is often a good approximation for molecules. In infinite systems, this averaging treatment leads to delocalized electronic bands, an excellent description of bulk 3D sp(3) semiconductors. However, in reality electrons try to instantaneously avoid each other; their relative motion is correlated. Strong electron-electron repulsion and correlation create new collective states and cause new femtosecond kinetic processes. This is especially true in 1D and 2D systems. The quantum size effect, a single electron property, is widely known: the band gap increases with decreasing size. This Account focuses on the experimental consequences of strong correlation. We first describe π-π* excited states in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). To obtain the spectra of individual CNTs, we developed a white-light, right-angle resonant Rayleigh scattering method. Discrete exciton transitions dominate the optical absorption spectra of both semiconducting and metallic tubes. Excitons are bound neutral excited states in which the electron and hole tightly orbit each other due to their mutual Coulomb attraction. We then describe more generally the independent roles of size and dimensionality in nanoelectronic structure, using additional examples from graphene, trans-polyacetylene chains, transition metal dichalcogenides, organic/inorganic Pb iodide perovskites, quantum dots, and pentacene van der Waals crystals. In 1D and 2D chemical systems, the electronic band structure diagram can be a poor predictor of properties if explicit correlation is not considered. One- and two-dimensional systems show quantum confinement and especially strong correlation as compared with their 3D parent systems. The Coulomb interaction is enhanced because the electrons are on the surface. One- and two-dimensional systems can exhibit essentially molecular properties even though they are infinite in size. Zero-dimensional Qdots show quantum confinement and modest electron correlation. Correlation is weak in 3D bulk semiconductors. Strongly correlated electronic states can behave as if they have fractional charge and effectively separate the spin and charge of the electron. This is apparent in the \"soliton\" state of polyacetylene, the fractional charge quantum Hall state of graphene, and the Luttinger electrical conductivity of metallic CNTs.",

Moreover, one-third of these structures are metals and two-thirds are semiconductors, and they display optical resonances at many different frequencies. Systematic studies of many-body effects in nanotubes would therefore benefit from the availability of a technique for identifying the chiral index of a nanotube based on a measurement of its optical resonances, and vice versa. Here, we report the establishment of a structure-property 'atlas' for nanotube optical transitions based on simultaneous electron diffraction measurements of the chiral index and Rayleigh scattering measurements of the optical resonances of 206 different single-walled nanotube structures. The nanotubes, which were suspended across open slit structures on silicon substrates, had diameters in the range 1.3-4.7 nm. We also use this atlas as a starting point for a systematic study of many-body effects in the excited states of single-walled nanotubes. We find that electron-electron interactions shift the optical resonance energies by the same amount for both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, and that this shift (which corresponds to an effective Fermi velocity renormalization) increases monotonically with nanotube diameter.

Detailed spectroscopic measurements showed one-dimensional singularities in the SWNT density of states for both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes. The results obtained were compared to and agree well with theoretical predictions and tight-binding calculations. SWNTs were also shortened using the STM to explore the role of finite size, which might be exploited for device applications. Segments less than 10 nm exhibited discrete peaks in their tunneling spectra, which correspond to quantized energy levels, and whose spacing scales inversely with length. Finally, the interaction between magnetic impurities and electrons confined to one dimension was studied by spatially resolving the local electronic density of states of small cobalt clusters on metallic SWNTs. Spectroscopic measurements performed on and near these clusters exhibited a narrow peak near the Fermi level that has been identified as a Kondo resonance. In addition, spectroscopic studies of ultrasmall magnetic nanostructures, consisting of small cobalt clusters on short nanotube pieces, exhibited features characteristic of the bulk Kondo resonance, but also new features due to their finite size.",

States near the energy gap are predicted to have an orbital magnetic moment, mu(orb), that is much larger than the Bohr magneton (the magnetic moment of an electron due to its spin). This large moment is due to the motion of electrons around the circumference of the nanotube, and is thought to play a role in the magnetic susceptibility of CNTs and the magnetoresistance observed in large multiwalled CNTs. But the coupling between magnetic field and the electronic states of individual nanotubes remains to be quantified experimentally. Here we report electrical measurements of relatively small diameter (2-5 nm) individual CNTs in the presence of an axial magnetic field.

The suggested mechanism involves an oxidative alpha-dicarbonyl cleavage leading to an intermediary mixed acid anhydride that releases the acids, e.g., acetic and erythronic acid, from 1. Similarly, glyceric and lactic acids were formed from 1-deoxy-3,4-hexodiuloses, corroborated by complementary analytical techniques. This paper provides for the first time evidence for the direct formation of acids from C6-alpha-dicarbonyls by an oxidative mechanism and incorporation of a 17OH group into the carboxylic moiety. The experimental data obtained support the coexistence of at least two newly described reaction mechanisms leading to carboxylic acids, i.e., (i) a hydrolytic beta-dicarbonyl cleavage as a major pathway and (ii) an alternative minor pathway via oxidative alpha-dicarbonyl cleavage induced by oxidizing species.",

Experiments with various 13C-labeled glucose isotopomers in the presence of glycine revealed all six carbon atoms being incorporated into acetic acid: C-1/C-2 ( approximately 70%), C-3/C-4 ( approximately 10%), and C-5/C-6 (approximately 20%).

Using specifically (13)C-labeled sucrose at C-1 of the fructose moiety, HMF formation was studied at different temperatures. Under dry pyrolytic conditions and at temperatures above 250 degrees C, 90% of HMF originated from fructose moiety and only 10% originated from glucose.

Moreover, the relative efficiency of the known HMF precursor 3-deoxyglucosone to generate HMF was compared to that of glucose, fructose and sucrose. Glucose exhibited a much lower conversion rate than 3-deoxyglucosone, however, both fructose and sucrose showed much higher conversion rates than 3-deoxyglucosone thus precluding it as a major precursor of HMF in fructose and sucrose solutions.

The results eliminate possible mechanisms involving the obligatory loss of O-2 of D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate during its enzymatic oxidation and confirm the specificity of carbon--carbon bond cleavage in both the oxygenase and carboxylase reactions.",

Sterically unhindered primary amines were better catalysts than ammonia, secondary amines, and sterically hindered primary amines (i.e. alpha-aminoisobutyric acid). Reactions catalyzed by primary amines initially consumed formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde about 15-20 times faster than an uncatalyzed control reaction. The amine-catalyzed reactions yielded aldotriose (glyceraldehyde), ketotriose (dihydroxyacetone), aldotetroses (erythrose and threose), ketotetrose (erythrulose), pyruvaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, pyruvate, glyoxylate, and several unindentified carbonyl products. The concentrations of the carbonyl products, except pyruvate and ketotetrose, initially increased and then declined during the reaction, indicating their ultimate conversion to other products (like larger sugars or pyruvate). The uncatalyzed control reaction yielded no pyruvate or glyoxylate, and only trace amounts of pyruvaldehyde, acetaldehyde and glyoxal. In the presence of 15 mM catalytic primary amine, such as alanine, the rates of triose and pyruvaldehyde of synthesis were about 15-times and 1200-times faster, respectively, than the uncatalyzed reaction. Since previous studies established that alanine is synthesized from glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde via pyruvaldehyde as its direct precursor, the demonstration that the alanine catalyzes the conversion of glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde to pyruvaldehyde indicates that this synthetic pathway is capable of autocatalysis.

The presence of an intramolecular phosphate group, which catalyzes the early stages of the Maillard reaction, provides the opportunity for the R5P molecule to undergo novel reaction paths creating unique Maillard products. The initial set of reactions leading to an Amadori product (phosphorylated) and to an alpha-dicarbonyl phosphate compound follows a typical Maillard reaction sequence, but an observed phosphate hydrolysis accompanying the reaction adds to the complexity of the products formed. The reaction rate for the loss of R5P is partially dependent on the pK(a) of the amine but also is correlated to the protonation of an early intermediate of the reaction sequence. In the presence of oxygen, a carboxymethyl group conjugated to the amine is a major product of the reaction of R5P with N-acetyllysine while little of this product is generated in the absence of oxygen. Despite lacking a critical hydroxyl group necessary for the Maillard reaction, 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate (dR5P) still generates an Amadori-like product (with a carbonyl on the C-3 carbon) and undergoes phosphate cleavage. Two highly UV-absorbing products of dR5P were amine derivatives of 5-methylene-2-pyrrolone and 2-formylpyrrole.

While Vmax is pH independent, V/K decreases below the pK of 9.0 of the amino group. 6-Aminoglucose is a competitive inhibitor vs glucose with a Ki value increasing below the pK of 9 but leveling off at 33 mM below pH 7.16.

We also investigated the long term stability effects of temperature, pH, light, and oxygen (as air) on the NRH in aqueous solutions.

In the first scenario, we realize that the effect is totally different from what happens when the degeneracy of a single electron confined in a magnetic field is not taken into account. In particular, when the degeneracy of the system is negligible, the magnetocaloric effect cools the system, while in the other case, when the degeneracy is strong, the system heats up. For the second case, we study the competition between the characteristic frequency of the potential trap and the cyclotron frequency to find the optimal region that maximizes the ΔT of the magnetocaloric effect, and due to the strong degeneracy of this problem, the results are in coherence with those obtained for the Landau problem.

(2) The control of the Förster radius of the unbounded medium. (3) The impact of the local density of states.\nThe central motivation of this theoretical revisitation comes from the fact that some experimental works about Förster energy transfer report improvement of the Förster efficiency when the donor-acceptor molecular pair is in the vicinity of a metallic particle, while others found efficiency deterioration. In the presence of a nanoscale metallic sphere, we calculate contour plots of the Förster energy transfer rate KF and the Förster efficiency η as a function of the acceptor position rA for a fixed donor position. These contour plots clearly highlight the influence of the sphere on KF and η as the donor position, the orientations of donor and acceptor dipoles, and the particle size are varied; also the impact on KF(rA) and η due to the excitation of surface plasmons is easily noticeable from these contour plots. Moreover, we obtain the enhancement factor KF/KF0 (KF0 refers to the case without sphere) against the donor-surface separation for particular donor-acceptor spatial distributions, several particle sizes, and distinct molecular dipole orientations. Therefore, our calculations provide a systematic analysis of the Förster energy transfer in the presence of a metallic nanosphere. Based on these results, we formulate hypotheses for explaining the aforementioned contradictory experimental results about η. To complement our study, we examine the impact of the local density of states ρ on KF. KF is practically unperturbed by sphere when the intermolecular separation R is ≲ 3 nm, since the direct donor-acceptor electromagnetic interaction is dominant. On the contrary, when R ≳ 3 nm, the nanosphere perturbs KF and this perturbation is stronger if plasmonic resonances are excited. KF/KF0 can greatly be enhanced in certain regions, but these regions coincide with low-efficiency regions, compromising applications involving the Förster process. In the presence of the nanosphere, the high Förster efficiency region (η ≥ 0.5) has the same shape as that for the case without sphere, but its extension (Förster radius Ro) is reduced; this effect is a consequence of the large increase of the donor direct decay rate and Ro depends strongly on donor position. Consequently, the sphere controls Ro that is associated with the efficiency pattern that corresponds to the unbounded medium; this effect can be exploited in the measuring technique of nanoscale displacements of proteins that is based on the fluorescence resonant energy transfer. The functional form of KF(ρ) is determined by the intermolecular separation R, the spatial configuration and the dipole orientations of the molecular pair, and the donor proximity to the nanoparticle.",

In particular, we show that the particle-hole entropy, as a function of the confinement parameter, smoothly connects the two regimes. Moreover, it exhibits a maximum that could be interpreted as the transition point between the localized and delocalized regimes.",

This finding raises questions about the physical nature of such a collective resonance, a fundamental question in condensed matter and many-body physics, which the author addresses here by means of a plasmon-in-a-box model. A small number of carriers confined within a nanocrystal exhibit multiple transitions of individual carriers between quantized states. However, as carriers are progressively added, spectral lines associated with single-carrier excitations evolve into a band representing a collective resonance. This evolution is gradual, and it involves an intermediate regime where single-carrier excitations and few-carrier collective excitations coexist, until, at high carrier numbers, a purely classical collective resonance involving all carriers in the nanocrystal is sustained. The author finds that the emergence of the plasmon resonance is a density-driven transition; at high enough carrier densities, the Coulomb repulsion between carriers becomes strong enough to allow individual carriers to overcome their confinement to the nanocrystal lattice and to participate in a collective excitation within the mean Coulomb field of other carriers. The findings represent deeper insight into the physical picture of a plasmon resonance and serve as a potential design guide for nanoscale optoelectronic components and photocatalytic plasmonic clusters.

Modeling the excess electrons as interacting electrons confined to a sphere, we find that the excitation evolves from single-particle to plasmonic with increasing number of electrons at fixed density, and the threshold number of electrons to produce a plasmon increases with density due to quantum confinement and electron-hole attraction. In addition, the excitation passes through an intermediate regime where it is best characterized as an intraband exciton. We compare equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with those of more affordable single-excitation theories and identify the inclusion of electron-hole interactions as essential to describing the evolution of the excitation.

In the two-particle calculations, the importance of the correct treatment of the excitonic interaction is demonstrated in calculating the low-energy ELNES, for example at the Li-K edge. In addition, an unusually strong excitonic interactions in the O-K edge of perovskite oxides is identified. The multi-particle calculations are necessary to reproduce the multiplet structures appearing at the transition metal L2,3-edges and rare-earth M4,5-edges.

Although diamond is known to be the preferred allotrope of carbon at high pressure, the possibility of producing under pressure high-density polymorphs of diamond, including metallic forms, has been discussed. Structural changes have already been reported in diamond under non-hydrostatic pressures around 150 GPa and large deformation. However, measurements of the properties of diamond under hydrostatic pressure have been limited to below 40 GPa. Here, we report accurate measurements of the volume and of the optical phonon frequency of diamond under hydrostatic pressure up to 140 GPa. We show that diamond is more compressible than currently expected. By combining the volume and the frequency pressure shifts, we deduce that diamond remains very stable under pressure: it is a Gruneisen solid up to at least 140 GPa, and the covalent bond is even slightly strengthened under pressure. Finally, the optical phonon frequency versus pressure is calibrated here to be used as a pressure gauge for diamond anvil cell studies in the multi-megabar range.",

It is pre-eminent as a gemstone, an industrial tool and as a material for solid state research. Since natural diamonds grew deep below the Earth's surface before their ejection to mineable levels, they also contain valuable information for geologists. The key to many of diamond's properties is the rigidity of its structure which explains, for example, its exceptional hardness and its high thermal conductivity. Since 1953, it has been possible to grow synthetic diamond. Before then, it was effectively only possible to have natural diamond, with a small number of these found in the vicinity of meteorite impacts. Techniques are now available to grow gem quality synthetic diamonds greater than 1 carat (0.2 g) using high temperatures and pressures (HTHP) similar to those found in nature. However, the costs are high, and the largest commercially available industrial diamonds are about 0.01 carat in weight or about 1 mm in linear dimension. The bulk of synthetic diamonds used industrially are 600 µm or less. Over 75% of diamond used for industrial purposes today is synthetic material. In recent years, there have been two significant developments. The first is the production of composites based on diamond; these materials have a significantly greater toughness than diamond while still maintaining very high hardness and reasonable thermal conductivity. The second is the production at low pressures by metastable growth using chemical vapour deposition techniques. Deposition onto non-diamond substrates was first demonstrated by Spitsyn et al 1981 J. Cryst. Growth 52 219-26 and confirmed by Matsumoto et al 1982 Japan J. Appl. Phys. 21 L183-5. These developments have added further to the versatility of diamond.

Because diving physiology has also been extremely dependent on new technologies used in the development of diving recorders, a chronological approach fits well with advances in electronics and mechanical innovation. There are many species that dive underwater as part of their natural behavior, but it is mainly the marine mammals (seals, sea lions, and whales) that demonstrate both long duration and dives to great depth.

It may also be advantageous when seals are on land as UV is reflected by snow and ice but absorbed by fur, enhancing visual contrast. Here we show that the pelagic hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) has a highly UV permissive cornea and lens. Seals like other carnivores have a tapetum lucidum (TL) reflecting light back through the retina increasing sensitivity. The TL in this seal is unusual being white and covering almost the entire retina unlike that in other carnivores.

As physiological measurements of threshold sensitivity are much higher than those for psychophysical detection, these seals are likely to be more UV sensitive than our results imply.

They occupy depths from 200 to 1000 m at daytime and migrate to a varying degree into surface waters at nighttime.

However, it has been difficult to undertake the requisite controlled studies to determine the physiological limitations and trade-offs that marine mammals face while diving in the wild under varying environmental and nutritional conditions. For the past decade, Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) trained to swim and dive in the open ocean away from the physical confines of pools participated in studies that investigated the interactions between diving behaviour, energetic costs, physiological constraints, and prey availability. Many of these studies measured the cost of diving to understand how it varies with behaviour and environmental and physiological conditions. Collectively, these studies show that the type of diving (dive bouts or single dives), the level of underwater activity, the depth and duration of dives, and the nutritional status and physical condition of the animal affect the cost of diving and foraging. They show that dive depth, dive and surface duration, and the type of dive result in physiological adjustments (heart rate, gas exchange) that may be independent of energy expenditure. They also demonstrate that changes in prey abundance and nutritional status cause sea lions to alter the balance between time spent at the surface acquiring oxygen (and offloading CO<sub2</sub and other metabolic by-products) and time spent at depth acquiring prey.

The current study aimed to quantify total drag force as well as the specific contribution of wave drag during the underwater phase of the swimming start. Swimmers were towed at three different depths (surface, 0.5 m, 1.0 m) and four speeds (1.6, 1.9, 2.0, 2.5 m · s(-1)), totaling 12 conditions. Wave drag and total drag were measured for each trial. Mixed modeling and plots were then used to determine the relationships between each towing condition and the amount of drag acting on the swimmer. The results of this study show large decreases in total drag as depth increases, regardless of speed (-19.7% at 0.5 m and -23.8% at 1.0 m). This is largely due to the significant reduction in wave drag as the swimmers traveled at greater depth. It is recommended that swimmers travel at least 0.5 m below the surface to avoid excessive drag forces. Swimmers should also perform efficient breakouts when transitioning into free swimming to reduce the duration spent just below the surface where drag values are reported at their highest.",

In contrast, greater depths increase the prominence of point-source bioluminescent flashes. In bathypelagic depths (below 1000 m daylight no longer penetrates, and the visual scene consists exclusively of point-source bioluminescent flashes.

A sharp fovea is optimal for localizing point sources.

We investigated the location, timing and duration of extended surface times (ESTs) in 10 free-ranging loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and the possible relationship to water temperature and diving activity recorded via satellite relay data loggers for 101-450 days. For one turtle that dived only in offshore areas, ESTs contributed 12% of the time whereas for the other turtles ESTs contributed 0.4-1.8% of the time. ESTs lasted on average 90 min but were mostly infrequent and irregular, excluding the involvement of a fundamental regulatory function. However, 82% of the ESTs occurred during daylight, mostly around noon, suggesting a dependence on solar radiation. For three turtles, there was an appreciable (7 degrees C to 10.5 degrees C) temperature decrease with depth for dives during periods when ESTs occurred frequently, suggesting a re-warming function of EST to compensate for decreased body temperatures, possibly to enhance digestive efficiency. A positive correlation between body mass and EST duration supported this explanation. By contrast, night-active turtles that exceeded their calculated aerobic dive limits in 7.6-16% of the dives engaged in nocturnal ESTs, probably for lactate clearance. This is the first evidence that loggerhead turtles may refrain from diving for at least two reasons, either to absorb solar radiation or to recover from anaerobic activity.",

This study examines the drag, energetic cost and efficiency associated with this method of locomotion. Sea lions are highly streamlined, with a fineness ratio of 5.5 and maximum girth at 40% of body length. This profile leads to reduced drag and swimming power requirements. Films of gliding animals showed the drag coefficient (based on wetted surface area) to be 0.0042 at a Reynolds number of 2.0 X 10(6). This value is comparable to that found for other aquatic vertebrates and suggests that the sea lion's morphology helps to delay turbulent separation and maintain laminar flow over the forward portion of its body. Swimming metabolism was measured in a water flume at velocities up to 1.3 ms-1. Effective swimming speeds up to 2.7 ms-1 were attained by increasing each animal's drag. Oxygen consumption rose exponentially with velocity and for two animals was best described as VO2 = 6.27e0.48U, where VO2 is in mlO2 min-1 kg-1 and U is in ms-1. Minimum cost of transport for these animals was 0.12 ml O2 kg-1 m-1 at a relative speed of 1.4 body lengths s-1. This is 2.5 times that predicted for a fish of similar size. Swimming efficiencies were determined from these results using power output values calculated from the measured drag coefficient and standard hydrodynamic equations. At the highest velocity, aerobic efficiency reached a maximum of 15% while mechanical efficiency of the foreflippers was 80%. The results demonstrate that foreflipper propulsion is a highly efficient and comparatively inexpensive method of locomotion in aquatic mammals.",

A paradox exists when marine mammals are foraging underwater because activity should promote an elevation in heart rate (f(H)) to support increased metabolic demands. To assess the effect of the interaction between the diving response and underwater activity on f(H), we integrated interbeat f(H) with behavioral observations of adult bottlenose dolphins diving and swimming along the coast of the Bahamas. As expected for the dive response, f(H) while resting during submergence (40±6 beats min(-1)) was significantly lower than f(H) while resting at the water surface (105±8 beats min(-1)). The maximum recorded f(H) (f(H,max)) was 128±7 beats min(-1), and occurred during post-dive surface intervals. During submergence, the level of bradycardia was modified by activity. Behaviors such as simple head bobbing at depth increased f(H) by 40% from submerged resting levels. Higher heart rates were observed for horizontal swimming at depth. Indeed, the dolphins operated at 37-58% of their f(H,max) while active at depth and approached 57-79% of their f(H,max) during anticipatory tachycardia as the animals glided to the surface. f(H) was significantly correlated with stroke frequency (range=0-2.5 strokes s(-1), r=0.88, N=25 dives) and calculated swim speed (range=0-5.4 m s(-1), r=0.88, N=25 dives).

This strategy has several potential limitations, two of which are examined here. First, a predator with acute vision may be able to detect the individual photophores on the ventral surface. Second, a predator may be able to detect any mismatch between the spectrum of the bioluminescence and that of the background light. The first limitation was examined by modeling the perceived images of the counterillumination of the squid Abralia veranyi and the myctophid fish Ceratoscopelus maderensis as a function of the distance and visual acuity of the viewer. The second limitation was addressed by measuring downwelling irradiance under moonlight and starlight and then modeling underwater spectra. Four water types were examined: coastal water at a depth of 5 m and oceanic water at 5, 210, and 800 m. The appearance of the counterillumination was more affected by the visual acuity of the viewer than by the clarity of the water, even at relatively large distances. Species with high visual acuity (0.11 degrees resolution) were able to distinguish the individual photophores of some counterilluminating signals at distances of several meters, thus breaking the camouflage. Depth and the presence or absence of moonlight strongly affected the spectrum of the background light, particularly near the surface. The increased variability near the surface was partially offset by the higher contrast attenuation at shallow depths, which reduced the sighting distance of mismatches.

Recent evidence for a range of swimming vertebrates, however, has suggested that flapping paired appendages around a rigid body may be an extremely efficient means of aquatic locomotion.

We compiled data from 27 studies on 20 ectothermic vertebrate species to quantify the effect of temperature on dive durations. Using meta-analytic approaches, we show that, on average, dive durations decreased by 11% with every 1°C increase in water temperature. Larger increases in temperature (e.g. +3°C versus +8-9°C) exerted stronger effects on dive durations. Although species that respire bimodally are projected to be more resilient to the effects of temperature on dive durations than purely aerial breathers, we found no significant difference between these groups. Body mass had a weak impact on mean dive durations, with smaller divers being impacted by temperature more strongly. Few studies have examined thermal phenotypic plasticity (<iN</i=4) in diving ectotherms, and all report limited plasticity. Average water temperatures in marine and freshwater habitats are projected to increase between 1.5 and 4°C in the next century, and our data suggest that this magnitude of warming could translate to substantial decreases in dive durations, by approximately 16-44%.

Variations in swimming behaviour under differing foraging conditions.\nThe duration of breath-hold dives and the available time for foraging in submerged prey patches is ultimately constrained by oxygen balance. There is a close relationship between swim speed and oxygen utilisation, so it is likely that breath-holding divers optimise their speeds to and from the feeding patch to maximise time spent feeding at depth. Optimal foraging models suggest that transit swim speed should decrease to minimum cost of transport (MCT) speed in deeper and longer duration dives. Observations also suggest that descent and ascent swimming mode and speed may vary in response to changes in buoyancy. We measured the swimming behaviour during simulated foraging of seven captive female grey seals (two adults and five pups). Seals had to swim horizontally underwater from a breathing box to a submerged automatic feeder. The distance to the feeder and the rate of prey food delivery could be varied to simulate different feeding conditions. Diving durations and distances travelled in dives recorded during these experiments were similar to those recorded in the wild. Mean swim speed decreased significantly with increasing distance to the patch, indicating that seals adjusted their speed in response to travel distance, consistent with optimality model predictions. There was, however, no significant relationship between the transit swim speeds and prey density at the patch. Interestingly, all seals swam 10-20% faster on their way to the prey patch compared to the return to the breathing box, despite the fact that any effect of buoyancy on swimming speed should be the same in both directions. These results suggest that the swimming behaviour exhibited by foraging grey seals might be a combination of having to overcome the forces of buoyancy during vertical swimming and also of behavioural choices made by the seals.",

Efficient locomotion is particularly important for breath-holding divers because high levels of exercise may quickly deplete oxygen reserves, leading to the termination of a dive. We investigated the swimming behavior of eight adult Weddell seals, which are proficient divers, in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. A newly developed data logger was attached to free-ranging females at their own breeding sites to record swimming speed, depth, two-dimensional accelerations (stroke frequency and body angle) and temperature. All seals conducted multiple deep dives (the mean dive depth range for each animal was 223.3+/-66.5-297.9+/-164.7 m). Prolonged gliding while descending was observed with thinner females (N=5 seals). But the fatter females (N=3 seals) exhibited only swim-and-glide swimming, characterized by intermittent stroking and fluctuating swim speed, throughout their descent and ascent. The body angles of four of the seals were restricted to less than 30 degrees by the location of breathing holes in the ice and the slope of local bathymetric features. Of these four, the three fatter seals adopted the stroke-and-glide method while the other thinner seal descended with prolonged periods of gliding. Prolonged gliding seems to be a more efficient method for locomotion because the surface time between dives of gliding seals was significantly less than that of stroking animals, despite their same stroke frequencies.",

Attributes that serve them well for shorter dives are important also for long dives, such as: (a) a large total oxygen store relative to body size, and (b) parsimonious use of blood oxygen due to the lowered energy requirements of various organs. During long dives, some organs deplete their oxygen stores, become predominately dependent on anaerobic metabolism, and build up large quantities of lactate. The result is a degree of fatigue that leaves the animal incapable of further intense diving activities for some time. Consequently, long anaerobic dives are quite rare in nature.",

Snakes that are captured following prolonged periods without rainfall have lower body water content, lower body condition and increased tendencies to drink fresh water than do snakes that are captured following seasonal periods of high rainfall. These animals do not drink seawater and must rehydrate by drinking from a freshwater lens that forms on the ocean surface during heavy precipitation.

Data loggers were attached to the animals and measured swim speed, maximum depth of dive, dive duration, surface interval, descent and ascent rate, and descent and ascent angle along with sound pressure level (SPL). The ATOC sound source was at a depth of 939 m and transmitted at 195 dB re: 1 microPa at 1 m centered at 75 Hz with a 37.5-Hz bandwidth. Sound pressure levels (SPL) measured at the seal during transmissions averaged 128 dB and ranged from 118 to 137 dB re: 1 microPa for the 60-90 Hz band, in comparison to ambient levels of 87-107 dB within this band.

Using the goldring surgeonfish, <iCtenochaetus strigosus</i, a pectoral-fin (labriform) swimmer, we quantified the net cost of swimming (swimming metabolic rate minus standard metabolic rate) associated with station-holding under these various conditions. We determined that the swimming costs of station-holding in the bidirectional flow regime increased by 2-fold compared with costs based on swimming over the same range of speeds at steady velocities. Furthermore, as we found minimal differences in energetic costs associated with station-holding in the unidirectional, oscillating flow compared with that predicted from steady swimming costs, we conclude that the added acceleration costs are minimal, while the act of turning is an energetically expensive endeavor for this reef fish species.",

We study the underwater locomotor activity of a deep-diving species from the Cormorant family (Kerguelen shag) and report locomotor adjustments to the change of buoyancy with depth. Using accelerometers, we show that during both the descent and ascent phases of dives, shags modelled their acceleration and stroking activity on the natural variation of buoyancy with depth. For example, during the descent phase, birds increased swim speed with depth. But in parallel, and with a decay constant similar to the one in the equation explaining the decrease of buoyancy with depth, they decreased foot-stroke frequency exponentially, a behaviour that enables birds to reduce oxygen consumption. During ascent, birds also reduced locomotor cost by ascending passively. We considered the depth at which they started gliding as a proxy to their depth of neutral buoyancy. This depth increased with maximum dive depth. As an explanation for this, we propose that shags adjust their buoyancy to depth by varying the amount of respiratory air they dive with. Calculations based on known values of stored body oxygen volumes and on deep-diving metabolic rates in avian divers suggest that the variations of volume of respiratory oxygen associated with a respiration mediated buoyancy control only influence aerobic dive duration moderately. Therefore, we propose that an advantage in cormorants--as in other families of diving seabirds--of respiratory air volume adjustment upon diving could be related less to increasing time of submergence, through an increased volume of body oxygen stores, than to reducing the locomotor costs of buoyancy control.",

This was established experimentally in the mid-1980s by size-exclusion chromatography on carefully calibrated Sephadex® G-10 (which measures the effective volume and thus the water affinity of an ion) and by neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution (which measures the density and orientation of water molecules near the diffracting ion and thus its water affinity). These conclusions have been confirmed more recently by molecular dynamics simulations, which explicitly model each individual water molecule. This surprising change in force regime occurs because the oppositely charged ions in aqueous salt solutions exist functionally as ion pairs (separated by 0, 1 or 2 water molecules) as has now been shown by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy; this cancels out the strong long-range electrostatic forces and allows the weak, short-range water affinity effects to come to the fore. This microscopic structure of aqueous salt solutions is not captured by models utilizing a macroscopic dielectric constant. Additionally, the Law of Matching Water Affinity, first described in 1997 and 2004, establishes that contact ion pair formation is controlled by water affinity and is a major determinant of the solubility of charged species since only a net neutral species can change phases.",

The behavior of water entropy as a function of distance reveals significant (∼20%) contributions from the second solvation shell even for the low concentration considered here. While for the cations, contributions from both translational and rotational entropy loss are similar in different solvation shells, water around anions loses much more rotational entropy due to their ability to accept hydrogen bonds. Most importantly, while charge density of cations or anions correlates with the translational entropy loss, anions with similar charge density as that of cations has a much stronger and long-range effect on water.

Water has distinctive liquid and solid properties: It is highly cohesive. It has volumetric anomalies-water's solid (ice) floats on its liquid; pressure can melt the solid rather than freezing the liquid; heating can shrink the liquid. It has more solid phases than other materials. Its supercooled liquid has divergent thermodynamic response functions. Its glassy state is neither fragile nor strong. Its component ions-hydroxide and protons-diffuse much faster than other ions. Aqueous solvation of ions or oils entails large entropies and heat capacities. We review how these properties are encoded within water's molecular structure and energies, as understood from theories, simulations, and experiments.

These features give water remarkable physical properties, some of which are anomalous, such as its lower density in the solid phase compared with the liquid phase. Its ability to serve as both a hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor governs its role as a solvent, a role that is of central interest for biological chemists. In this Account, we focus on water's properties as a solvent. Water dissolves a vast range of solutes with solubilities that range over 10 orders of magnitude. Differences in solubility define the fundamental dichotomy between polar, or hydrophilic, solutes and apolar, or hydrophobic, solutes. This important distinction plays a large part in the structure, stability, and function of biological macromolecules. The strength of hydrogen bonding depends on the H-O...O H-bond angle, and the angular distribution is bimodal. Changes in the width and frequency of infrared spectral lines and in the heat capacity of the solution provide a measure of the changes in the strength and distribution of angles of the hydrogen bonds. Polar solutes and inorganic ions increase the population of bent hydrogen bonds at the expense of the more linear population, while apolar solutes or groups have the opposite effect. We examine how protein denaturants might alter the solvation behavior of water. Urea has very little effect on water's hydrogen bond network, while guanidinium ions promote more linear hydrogen bonds. These results point to fundamental differences in the protein denaturation mechanisms of these molecules. We also suggest a mechanism of action for antifreeze (or thermal hysteresis) proteins: ordering of water around the surface of these proteins prior to freezing appears to interfere with ice formation.",

While this problem has been studied in some detail through simulations in the past, it has not been very amenable for theoretical analysis owing to the complexities presented by the hydrogen (H) bond interactions in water. It is also difficult to perform experiments with water in externally imposed, high E-fields owing to dielectric breakdown problems; it is hence all the more important that theoretical progress in this area complements the progress achieved through simulations.

The approach explicitly accounts for volumetric properties of the solvent and solute (the equation of state, EoS) and casts the overall transfer process as a thermodynamic cycle with two stages: (1) isothermal solvent exchange from pure water to the cosolvent composition of interest at fixed mass density; (2) isothermal expansion or compression at the final solvent composition to recover the pressure of the initial state. Using molecular simulations with methane as the solute, the analysis is illustrated over a wide range of cosolvent concentrations for sorbitol-, ethanol-, and methanol-water binary mixtures. The EoS contribution semiquantitatively or quantitatively captures Deltamicrotr2, Deltastr2, and Deltahtr2 in almost all cases tested, highlighting the importance of considering the effects of changes in solvent density on the overall transfer process.

Here we turn our attention to slabs, cylinders, and droplets. In extended simulations with 1000 molecules, we find that hydroxide consistently prefers the surface, hydronium consistently avoids the surface, and the two together form an electrical double layer until neutralization occurs. The behavior of hydroxide can largely be accounted for by the observation that hydroxide moving to the surface loses fewer hydrogen bonds than are gained by the water molecule that it displaces from the surface. At the same time, since the orientation of the hydroxide increases the ratio of dangling hydrogens to dangling lone pairs, the proton activity of the exposed surface may be increased, rather than decreased. Hydroxide also moves more rapidly in the surface than in the bulk, likely because the proton donating propensity of neighboring water molecules is focused on the one hydrogen that is not dangling from the surface.

Such density behavior is, in turn, one of the manifestations of a nonstandard thermodynamic pattern contemplating a second, liquid-liquid critical point at conditions of temperature and pressure at which water exists as a deeply supercooled liquid. Recent experimental and computational work unambiguously points toward the existence of such a critical point, thereby providing concrete answers to the questions posed by the 1976 pioneering experiments by Speedy and Angell and the associated \"liquid-liquid transition hypothesis\" posited in 1992 by Stanley and co-workers.

Employing ultrafast IR spectroscopy, we use the orientational anisotropy decay of the bending vibrations of the hydrated proton complex to study the picosecond aqueous proton transfer kinetics as a function of temperature, concentration, and counterion. We find that the orientational anisotropy decay exhibits Arrhenius behavior, with an apparent activation energy of 2.4 kcal/mol in 1M and 2M HCl. Interestingly, acidic solutions at high concentration with longer proton transfer time scales display corresponding decreases in activation energy. We interpret this counterintuitive trend by considering the entropic and enthalpic contributions to the activation free energy for proton transfer. Halide counteranions at high concentrations impose entropic barriers to proton transfer in the form of constraints on the solution's collective H-bond fluctuations and obstruction of potential proton transfer pathways. The corresponding proton transfer barrier decreases due to weaker water-halide H-bonds in close proximity to the excess proton, but the entropic effects dominate and result in a net reduction in the proton transfer rate.

In particular, our attention is focused on reactive gas pressure devices with pressures between 1.2 and 600 MPa, multi-anvil apparatus at P &lt; 25 GPa and the diamond anvil cell, which allows work at pressures of 100 GPa and higher. For example, some of these techniques have been successfully upgraded to an industrial scale for the synthesis of diamond and cubic boron nitride.",

Second-generation HiPco apparatus can run continuously for 7-10 days at a time. In the HiPco process nanotubes grow in high-pressure, high-temperature flowing CO on catalytic clusters of iron. Catalyst is formed in situ by thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl, which is delivered intact within a cold CO flow and then rapidly mixed with hot CO in the reaction zone. Upon heating, the Fe(CO)5 decomposes into atoms that condense into larger clusters. SWNTs nucleate and grow on these particles in the gas phase via CO disproportionation: CO + CO --&gt; CO2 + C (SWNT), catalyzed by the Fe surface. The concentration of CO2 produced in this reaction is equal to that of carbon and can therefore serve as a useful real-time feedback parameter.

The in situ gas-cooled sampling probe mapped the chemistry inside the high-temperature reactor, while suppressing the thermal decomposition of the analytes. It thus allows a more accurate study of the mechanism of progressive thermocatalytic cracking of precursors compared to previously reported conventional residual gas analyses of the reactor exhaust gas and hence paves the way for the controlled production of novel nanomaterials with tailored properties. Our studies demonstrate that the composition of the precursors dynamically changes as they travel inside of the reactor, causing a nonuniform growth of nanomaterials. Moreover, mapping of the nanomaterials reactor using quantitative gas analysis revealed the actual contribution of thermocatalytic cracking and a quantification of individual precursor fragments. This information is particularly important for quality control of the produced nanomaterials and for the recycling of exhaust residues, ultimately leading toward a more cost-effective continuous production of nanomaterials in large quantities.

The spectrum was compared to literature data under vacuum conditions and with theoretical spectra of monomolecular and dimeric urea in the gas phase calculated with the density functional theory (DFT) method. Comparison of the spectra indicates that urea vapor is in the monomolecular form at atmospheric pressure. The measured vapor pressure of urea agrees with the thermodynamic data obtained under vacuum reported in the literature.

To understand and quantify the effects of the variation in the main parameters that influence the layer growth kinetics, the experimental programming method was used and mathematical models of interactions between influence and kinetics parameters were obtained for two metallic materials: Fe-ARMCO and 34CrAlMo5 nitralloy steel. It was concluded that the nitriding operating temperature and the degree of nitrogen dilution of the ammonia have statistically significant influences on the kinetics of the nitrided layer.

The analysis is based on in situ measurements of optical, thermo physical, and electromagnetic properties in gas mixtures with newly developed high pressure sensors. This article depicts the calculation of compositions from the measured properties, which is carried out iteratively by using highly accurate equations of state for gas mixtures. The validation of the method consisted of the generation and measurement of several mixtures, of which three are presented herein: a first mixture of 64.9 mol. % methane, 17.1 mol. % carbon dioxide, 9 mol. % helium, and 9 mol. % ethane at 323 K and 423 K in a pressure range from 2.5 MPa to 17 MPa; a second mixture of 93.0 mol. % methane, 4.0 mol. % propane, 2.0 mol. % carbon dioxide, and 1.0 mol. % nitrogen at 303 K, 313 K, and 323 K in a pressure range from 1.2 MPa to 3 MPa; and a third mixture of 64.9 mol. % methane, 30.1 mol. % carbon dioxide, and 5.0 mol. % nitrogen at 303 K, 313 K, and 323 K in a pressure range from 2.5 MPa to 4 MPa.

The change of activation energy with temperature was related to protective properties of the corresponding coating layer at particle surfaces. Two main coating layer growth processes were found in magnesium oxidation and nitridation using a modified Dreizin method which was also employed to determine activation energy for both magnesium oxidation and nitridation.

This nonclassical heating technique has slowly progressed from a laboratory curiosity to an established method commonly used both in academia and in industry. Because of its efficiency, microwave heating dramatically reduces reaction times (from days and hours to minutes and seconds) and improves product purities or material properties among other advantages. Since the early days of microwave chemistry, researchers have observed rate-accelerations and, in some cases, altered product distributions as compared with reactions carried out using classical oil-bath heating. As a result, researchers have speculated that so-called specific or nonthermal microwave effects could be responsible for these differences. Much of the debate has centered on the question of whether the electromagnetic field can exert a direct influence on a chemical transformation outside of the simple macroscopic change in bulk reaction temperature. In 2009, our group developed a relatively simple \"trick\" that allows us to rapidly evaluate whether an observed effect seen in a microwave-assisted reaction results from a purely thermal phenomenon, or involves specific or nonthermal microwave effects. We use a microwave reaction vessel made from silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic. Because of its high microwave absorptivity, the vessel shields its contents from the electromagnetic field. As a result, we can easily mimic a conventionally heated autoclave experiment inside a microwave reactor under carefully controlled reaction conditions. The switch from an almost microwave transparent glass (Pyrex) to a strongly microwave absorbing SiC reaction vial under otherwise identical reaction conditions (temperature profiles, pressure, stirring speed) then allows us to carefully evaluate the influence of the electromagnetic field on the particular chemical transformation. Over the past five years we have subjected a wide variety of chemical transformations, including organic reactions, preparations of inorganic nanoparticles, and the hydrolysis of proteins, to the \"SiC test.\" In nearly all of the studied examples, we obtained identical results from reactions carried out in Pyrex vials and those carried out in SiC vials. The data obtained from these investigations confirm that in the overwhelming majority of cases a bulk temperature phenomenon drives the enhancements in microwave chemistry and that the electromagnetic field has no direct influence on the reaction pathway.",

The development of in situ diagnostics for processes involving these compounds could be beneficial in, e.g., developing deposition recipes and validating equipment-scale simulations. This report describes the performance of the combination of two techniques for the simultaneous, rapid measurement of the three major gas phase species during hafnium oxide thermal ALD using TEMAH and water: TEMAH, water, and methylethyl amine (MEA), the only major reaction by-product. For measurement of TEMAH and MEA, direct absorption methods based on a broadband infrared source with different mid-IR bandpass filters and utilizing amplitude modulation and synchronous detection were developed. For the measurement of water, wavelength modulation spectroscopy utilizing a near-IR distributed feedback diode laser was used.

The degree of TEMAH entrainment was lower in 300 mL/min of helium compared to that in 1000 mL/min of nitrogen. The capability to obtain detailed time-dependent species concentrations during ALD could potentially allow for the selection of carrier gas composition and flow rates that would minimize parasitic wall reactions.

The OH proton shifts and hydrogen bond distances for methanol or ethanol complexed with pyridine depend very much on the functional employed and very little on the basis set, provided it is sufficiently large to give the correct quasi-linear hydrogen bond geometry. The CH proton shifts are insensitive to both the functional and the basis set. NMR shifts for all protons in several alcohol/pyridine complexes are calculated at the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof PBE0/cc-pVTZ//PBE0/6-311 + G(d,p) level in the gas phase. The results correlate with the shifts for the pyridine-complexed alcohols, determined by analysing data from the NMR titration of alcohols against pyridine. More pragmatically, computed shifts for a wider range of alcohols correlate with experimental shifts in neat pyridine. Shifts for alcohols in dimethylsulfoxide, based on the corresponding complexes in the gas phase, correlate well with the experimental values, but the overall root mean square difference is high (0.23 ppm), shifts for the OH, CHOH and other CH protons being systematically overestimated, by averages of 0.42, 0.21 and 0.06 ppm, respectively. If the computed shifts are corrected accordingly, a very good correlation is obtained with a gradient of 1.00 ± 0.01, an intercept of 0.00 ± 0.02 ppm and a root mean square difference of 0.09 ppm.

The rate-determining step is the deprotonation of the NH3 (+) group in MeCH(OH)-NH3 (+) to form 1-aminoethanol, which occurs with an activation energy barrier (ΔE (≠)) of 9.6 kcal/mol. The stereochemistry (R or S) of the aminonitrile product is determined at the NH3 addition step to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. While the addition of CN(-) to the carbon atom of the protonated imine 7 appears to scramble the stereochemistry, the water cluster above the imine plane reinforces the CN(-) to attack the imine group below the plane. The enforcement hinders the scrambling. In the second stage, the aminonitrile transforms to alanine, where an amide Me-CH(NH2)-C(=O)-NH2 is the key intermediate. The rate-determining step is the hydrolysis of the cyano group of N(amino)-protonated aminonitrile which occurs with an ΔE (≠) value of 34.7 kcal/mol.

This interaction is magnified by a factor of 4-9, bringing the binding energy up to as much as 20 kcal/mol, when a CH3(+) group is added to the proton donor. Complexes prefer trifurcated arrangements, wherein three separate methyl groups donate a proton to the O acceptor. Binding energies lessen when the systems are immersed in solvents of increasing polarity, but the ionic complexes retain their favored status even in water. The binding energy is reduced when the methyl groups are replaced by longer alkyl chains. The proton acceptor prefers to associate with those CH groups that are as close as possible to the S/N center of the formal positive charge. A single linear CH··O hydrogen bond (H-bond) is less favorable than is trifurcation with three separate methyl groups. A trifurcated arrangement with three H atoms of the same methyl group is even less favorable.

This is conventionally accounted for by shielding contributions arising from an aromatic-like ring current in cyclopropane, involving six electrons in the three C-C bonds, and deshielding coming from the σ antiaromatic CC framework of cyclobutane. The shielding pattern arising from the cyclopropane and cyclobutane CC framework response to a perpendicular magnetic field was visualized as two-dimensional grid distribution of NICS values. Further insight into the origin of chemical shift values was obtained by the NCS-NBO analysis of proton shielding tensor. In the case of cyclopropane, the CC framework shielding pattern implies the existence of both delocalized and localized currents that have a dominant shielding effect on protons. The magnitude of C-H bonds shielding effect is significant, too.

This allowed the determination of the substituent chemical shifts of the substituents in the three-membered rings and the long-range effect of these rings on the distant protons. The substituent chemical shifts of common substituents in the cyclopropane ring differ considerably from the same substituents in acyclic fragments and in cyclohexane and were modelled in terms of a three-bond (γ)-effect. For long-range protons (more than three bonds removed), the substituent effects of the cyclopropane ring were analysed in terms of the cyclopropane magnetic anisotropy and steric effect. The cyclopropane magnetic anisotropy (ring current) shift was modelled by (a) a single equivalent dipole perpendicular to and at the centre of the cyclopropane ring and (b) by three identical equivalent dipoles perpendicular to the ring placed at each carbon atom. Model (b) gave a more accurate description of the (1) H chemical shifts and was the selected model.

However, there are very few viable methods available to determine the energetic contribution of an individual hydrogen bond to binding and catalysis in biological systems. Therefore, the methods that use secondary deuterium isotope effects analyzed by NMR or equilibrium or kinetic isotope effect measurements are attractive ways to gain information on the H-bonding properties of an alcohol system, particularly in a biological environment. Here, we explore the anharmonic contribution to the C-H group when the O-H group of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP) forms an intermolecular H-bond with the amines by quantum mechanical calculations and by experimentally measuring the H/D effect by NMR. Within the framework of density functional theory, ab initio calculations were carried out for HFP in its two different conformational states and their H-bonded complexes with tertiary amines to determine the (13)C chemical shielding, change in their vibrational equilibrium distances, and the deuterium isotope effect on (13)C2 (secondary carbon) of HFP upon formation of complexes with tertiary amines. When C2-OH was involved in hydrogen bond formation (O-H as hydrogen donor), it weakened the geminal C2-H bond; it was reflected in the NMR chemical shift, coupling constant, and the equilibrium distances of the C-H bond. The first derivative of nuclear shielding at C2 in HFP was -48.94 and -50.73 ppm Å(-1) for anti and gauche conformations, respectively. In the complex, the values were -50.28 and -50.76 ppm Å(-1), respectively. The C-H stretching frequency was lower than the free monomer, indicating enhanced anharmonicity in the C-H bond in the complex form. In chloroform, HFP formed a complex with the amine; δC2 was 69.107 ppm for HFP-triethylamine and 68.766 ppm for HFP-d2-triethylamine and the difference in chemical shift, the ΔδC2 was 341 ppb. The enhanced anharmonicity in the hydrogen-bonded complex resulted in a larger vibrational equilibrium distance in C-H/D bonds. An analysis with the Morse potential function indicated that the enhanced anharmonicity encountered in the bond was the origin of a larger isotope effect and the equilibrium distances. Change in vibrational equilibrium distance and the deuterium isotope effect, as observed in the complex, could be used as parameters in monitoring the strength of the H-bond in small model systems with promising application in biomacromolecules.

Therefore, we conclude the model may not account for conjugation between the substituent and the pi-system of benzene.

Chemical shift is the most readily measured NMR parameter, and partial molecular alignment can reveal the anisotropic component of the chemical shift tensor, manifested as residual chemical shift anisotropy (RCSA). Hence, (13)C RCSAs provide information on the relative orientations of specific structural moieties including nonprotonated carbons and can be used for stereochemical assignment. Herein, we present two robust and sensitive methods to accurately measure and apply (13)C RCSAs for stereochemical assignment. The complementary techniques are demonstrated with five molecules representing differing structural classes.",

The rotational constant of CH(3)CHO was in reasonable agreement with experimental one due to the adequate treatment of the protonic quantum effect by the MC_MO method. The C-D bond distances were about 0.007 A shorter than the C-H distances because of the effect of anharmonicity of the potential. The Mulliken population for CD(3) in CD(3)CDO is larger than that for CH(3) in CH(3)CHO because the distribution of wavefunctions for the deuterons was more localized than that for the protons. The barrier height obtained by the MC_MO method for CH(3)CHO was estimated as 401.4 cm(-1), which was in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined barrier height. We predicted the barrier height of CD(3)CDO as 392.5 cm(-1). We suggest that the internal rotation of the CD(3) group was more facile than that of the CH(3) group because the C-D bond distance was observed to be shorter than the C-H distance. Additionally the localized electrons surrounding the CD(3) group in CD(3)CDO caused the extent of hyperconjugation between the CD(3) and CDO groups to be smaller than that in the case of CH(3)CHO, which may have also contributed to the observed differences in methyl internal rotation. The differences in bond distances and electronic populations induced by the H/D isotope effect were controlled by the difference in the distribution of wavefunctions between the protons and deuterons.",

Our calculations show that the low-bias junction conductance is determined by the electronic tunneling between the two Au-S donor-acceptor bonds formed at the molecule-electrode interfaces. For alkanes with 4, 6, and 8 carbon atoms in the chain, the Au-S bonds moderately couple with the σ-type frontier molecular orbitals of the alkane backbone and thus prefer to be coplanar with the alkane backbone in the junction. This results in an exponential decrease of the junction conductance as a function of the number of methylene groups. In contrast, the Au-S bonds couple strongly with the π-type orbitals of the 1,4'-bis(methylsulfide)benzene and 4,4'-bis(methylsulfide)biphenyl molecules and thus tend to be perpendicular to the neighboring benzene rings, leading to the rather large junction conductance.

Here we show that the access resistance through the organic semiconductor bulk can significantly influence the Schottky barrier evaluation and affect the charge-transport exploration. Indeed, access resistance plays a leading role in the contact resistance, whereas the Schottky barrier (expressed as the interface resistance) determines the charge injection at the metal/semiconductor interface. The Schottky barrier evaluation strongly depends on the access resistance and bias voltage. After eliminating the access resistance effect, the intrinsic Schottky barrier appears to be very coincident and weakly dependent on the work function of the contact metal.

The current-voltage characteristic of a Schottky-barrier FET has been studied as a function of physical parameters such as effective mass, graphene nanoribbon length, gate insulator thickness, and electrical parameters such as Schottky barrier height and applied bias voltage. In this paper, the scaling behaviors of a Schottky-barrier FET using trilayer graphene nanoribbon are studied and analytically modeled. A novel analytical method is also presented for describing a switch in a Schottky-contact double-gate trilayer graphene nanoribbon FET. In the proposed model, different stacking arrangements of trilayer graphene nanoribbon are assumed as metal and semiconductor contacts to form a Schottky transistor. Based on this assumption, an analytical model and numerical solution of the junction current-voltage are presented in which the applied bias voltage and channel length dependence characteristics are highlighted. The model is then compared with other types of transistors. The developed model can assist in comprehending experiments involving graphene nanoribbon Schottky-barrier FETs.

Electrical charge transport across the resulting interfaces was studied by current-voltage-temperature, internal photoemission, and capacitance-voltage measurements.

In this paper, we discuss a nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF)-based Hartree-Fock (HF) approach; the NEGF method can appropriately accommodate charge distributions in molecules connected to electrodes. In addition, we show that a NEGF-based density matrix can reduce to an ordinary HF density matrix for an isolated molecule if the molecule does not interact with electrodes. This feature of the NEGF-based density matrix also means that NEGF-based Mulliken charges can be reduced to ordinary Mulliken charges in those cases. Therefore, the NEGF-based HF approach can directly compare molecules that are connected to electrodes with isolated ones, and is useful in investigating complicated features of molecular conduction. We also calculated the transmission probability and conduction for benzenedithiol under finite electrode biases. The coupling between the electrodes and molecule causes electron transfer from the molecule to the electrodes, and the applied bias modifies this electron transfer.

The current-voltage characteristics are calculated for different values of Fermi energy in various basis sets such as 6-311++G(p,d) and cc-pVDZ and are compared with the experimental data. A good agreement is found in almost the entire voltage range. In addition, the results of our calculations indicate that the accuracy of ab initio electron propagator methods is in the range of 0.2-0.3 eV. Since the computational methods are truly ab initio, implying no adjustable parameters, functions, or functionals, the theoretical predictions can be improved only by changing the model of a transport device. The current-voltage characteristics predict peaks, i.e., negative differential resistances, for the various values of Fermi energy. As shown, the origin of the negative differential resistances is related to the voltage dependences of overlap integrals for the active terminal orbitals, expansion coefficients of partial atomic wavefunctions in Dyson orbitals, and the voltage dependences of Dyson poles (ionization potentials). We find that two peak behavior in the current-voltage characteristics can be explained by the anharmonicity of potential energy surfaces.

Since this question was first asked by Aviram and Ratner in the 1970s [Chem. Phys. Lett. 29, 277 (1974)], the field of molecular electronics has exploded with significant experimental advancements in the understanding of the charge transport properties of single molecule devices. Efforts to explain the results of these experiments and identify promising new candidate molecules for molecular devices have led to the development of numerous new theoretical methods including the current standard theoretical approach for studying single molecule charge transport, i.e., the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF). By pairing this formalism with density functional theory (DFT), a wide variety of transport problems in molecular junctions have been successfully treated. For some systems though, the conductance and current-voltage curves predicted by common DFT functionals can be several orders of magnitude above experimental results. In addition, since density functional theory relies on approximations to the exact exchange-correlation functional, the predicted transport properties can show significant variation depending on the functional chosen. As a first step to addressing this issue, the authors have replaced density functional theory in the NEGF formalism with a 2-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) method, creating a new approach known as the NEGF-RDM method. 2-RDM methods provide a more accurate description of electron correlation compared to density functional theory, and they have lower computational scaling compared to wavefunction based methods of similar accuracy. Additionally, 2-RDM methods are capable of capturing static electron correlation which is untreatable by existing NEGF-DFT methods. When studying dithiol alkane chains and dithiol benzene in model junctions, the authors found that the NEGF-RDM predicts conductances and currents that are 1-2 orders of magnitude below those of B3LYP and M06 DFT functionals. This suggests that the NEGF-RDM method could be a viable alternative to NEGF-DFT for molecular junction calculations.",

The field-effect transistor (FET), a semiconductor gated with at least three terminals, is pervasively exploited as the device geometry for these applications. For lack of effective and stable substitutional doping techniques, direct metal contact is often used in 2DSC FETs to inject carriers. A Schottky barrier (SB) generally exists in the metal-2DSC junction, which significantly affects and even dominates the performance of most 2DSC FETs. Therefore, low SB or Ohmic contact is highly preferred for approaching the intrinsic characteristics of the 2DSC channel. In this review, we systematically introduce the recent progress made in theoretical prediction of the SB height (SBH) in the 2DSC FETs and the efforts made both in theory and experiments to achieve low SB contacts. From the comparison between the theoretical and experimentally observed SBHs, the emerging first-principles quantum transport simulation turns out to be the most powerful theoretical tool to calculate the SBH of a 2DSC FET.

We show that such asymmetry can occur because of different energy dependences of the two contact self-energies. This may be attributed to differences in contact density of states (different contact material) or different energy dependence of the coupling (STM-like geometry or asymmetric positioning of molecular vibrational modes in the junction). The asymmetry scales with the difference between the energy dependence of these self-energies and disappears when this dependence is the same for the two contacts.

We present a thorough investigation of this viewpoint using the mathematical tools of quantum scattering, within the framework of Boltzmann transport theory. In particular, we ask: (a) How and when does a normal diffusive transport become anomalous? (b) What physical attribute of the system is conceptually useful to faithfully rationalize large variations in the coefficient of normal diffusion, observed particularly within the dynamical environment of biological cells? To characterize the diffusive transport, we introduce, analogous to continuous phase transitions, the curvature of the mean square displacement as an order parameter and use the notion of quantum scattering length, which measures the effective interactions between the diffusing molecules and the surrounding, to define a tuning variable, η. We show that the curvature signature conveniently differentiates the normal diffusion regime from the superdiffusion and subdiffusion regimes and the critical point, η = ηc, unambiguously determines the coefficient of normal diffusion. To solve the Boltzmann equation analytically, we use a quantum mechanical expression for the scattering amplitude in the Boltzmann collision term and obtain a general expression for the effective linear collision operator, useful for a variety of transport studies. We also demonstrate that the scattering length is a useful dynamical characteristic to rationalize experimental observations on diffusive transport in complex systems. We assess the numerical accuracy of the present work with representative experimental results on diffusion processes in biological systems.

The diversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We present such a model where there is diffusivity memory but no direction memory in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear MSD and a non-Gaussian G(x,t) at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is undergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression “diffusing diffusivity”. G(x,t) is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if the distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential remains a good fit for a variety of diffusivity distributions.

For this heterogeneous diffusion process (HDP) we analyse the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the tracer particles, the time averaged MSD, the spatial probability density function, and the first passage time dynamics from the cell boundary to the nucleus. Moreover we examine the non-ergodic properties of this process which are important for the correct physical interpretation of time averages of observables obtained from single particle tracking experiments. From extensive computer simulations of the 2D stochastic Langevin equation we present an in-depth study of this HDP. In particular, we find that the MSDs along the radial and azimuthal directions in a circular domain obey anomalous and Brownian scaling, respectively. We demonstrate that the time averaged MSD stays linear as a function of the lag time and the system thus reveals a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results will enable one to rationalise the diffusive motion of larger tracer particles such as viruses or submicron beads in biological cells. ",

An appreciable share of such reactions takes place in crowded environments of two-dimensional structures, such as plasma membrane or intracellular membranes, and is expected to be diffusion-controlled. In this work, starting from the microscopic bimolecular reaction rate constants and using estimates of the mean first-passage time for an enzyme-substrate encounter, we derive diffusion-dependent effective macroscopic reaction rate coefficients (EMRRC) for a generic reaction cycle. Each EMRRC was found to be half of the harmonic average of the microscopic rate constant (phosphorylation c or dephosphorylation d), and the effective (crowding-dependent) motility divided by a slowly decreasing logarithmic function of the sum of the enzyme concentrations. This implies that when c and d differ, the two EMRRCs scale differently with the motility, rendering the steady-state fraction of phosphorylated substrate molecules diffusion-dependent. Analytical predictions are verified using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on the two-dimensional triangular lattice at the single-molecule resolution. It is demonstrated that the proposed formulas estimate the steady-state concentrations and effective reaction rates for different sets of microscopic reaction rates and concentrations of reactants, including a non-trivial example where with increasing diffusivity the fraction of phosphorylated substrate molecules changes from 10% to 90%.

If even a single binding site is present, there is a very short, almost artifactual, period of anomalous subdiffusion, but a hierarchy of binding sites extends the anomalous regime considerably. As is well known, an essential requirement for anomalous subdiffusion due to binding is that the diffusing particle cannot be in thermal equilibrium with the binding sites; an equilibrated particle diffuses normally at all times. Anomalous subdiffusion due to barriers, however, still occurs at thermal equilibrium, and anomalous subdiffusion due to a combination of binding sites and barriers is reduced but not eliminated on equilibration.

Working forward, the observed distribution leads to transient anomalous subdiffusion, in which diffusion is anomalous at short times and normal at long times, here only mildly anomalous.

Both models treat molecules as points undergoing Brownian motion. The former represents chemical reactions between two reactants through the use of reactive boundary conditions, with two molecules reacting instantly upon reaching a fixed separation (called the reaction-radius). The Doi model uses reaction potentials, whereby two molecules react with a fixed probability per unit time, λ, when separated by less than the reaction radius.

Since the 1930s, master equations have served as a fundamental tool to understand the role of fluctuations in complex biological, chemical, and physical systems. Despite their simple appearance, analyses of master equations most often rely on low-noise approximations such as the Kramers-Moyal or the system size expansion, or require ad-hoc closure schemes for the derivation of low-order moment equations. We focus on numerical and analytical methods going beyond the low-noise limit and provide a unified framework for the study of master equations. After deriving the forward and backward master equations from the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, we show how the two master equations can be cast into either of four linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Three of these PDEs are discussed in detail. The first PDE governs the time evolution of a generalized probability generating function whose basis depends on the stochastic process under consideration. Spectral methods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for the analysis of the PDE. The second PDE is novel and is obeyed by a distribution that is marginalized over an initial state. It proves useful for the computation of mean extinction times. The third PDE describes the time evolution of a 'generating functional', which generalizes the so-called Poisson representation. Subsequently, the solutions of the PDEs are expressed in terms of two path integrals: a 'forward' and a 'backward' path integral. Combined with inverse transformations, one obtains two distinct path integral representations of the conditional probability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path integrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Moreover, we show how a well-known path integral representation of averaged observables can be recovered from them. Upon expanding the forward and the backward path integrals around stationary paths, we then discuss and extend a recent method for the computation of rare event probabilities. Besides, we also derive path integral representations for processes with continuous state spaces whose forward and backward master equations admit Kramers-Moyal expansions. A truncation of the backward expansion at the level of a diffusion approximation recovers a classic path integral representation of the (backward) Fokker-Planck equation. One can rewrite this path integral in terms of an Onsager-Machlup function and, for purely diffusive Brownian motion, it simplifies to the path integral of Wiener. To make this review accessible to a broad community, we have used the language of probability theory rather than quantum (field) theory and do not assume any knowledge of the latter.

Transcription factors, for example, search specific DNA sequences, signaling proteins aim at interacting with specific cofactors, and peripheral membrane proteins try to dock to membrane domains. Brownian motion, however, is affected by molecular crowding that induces anomalous diffusion (so-called subdiffusion) of proteins and larger structures, thereby compromising diffusive transport and the associated sampling processes. Contrary to the naive expectation that subdiffusion obstructs cellular processes, we show here by computer simulations that subdiffusion rather increases the probability of finding a nearby target. Consequently, important events like protein complex formation and signal propagation are enhanced as compared to normal diffusion. Hence, cells indeed benefit from their crowded internal state and the associated anomalous diffusion.",

We have expressed the state equation in terms of the atom work function from liquid into vacuum and performed calculations of the limiting line of stability composed of limiting points of the first type for argon.

The results deviate from classical nucleation theory (CNT) by two to seven orders of magnitude, which nevertheless is much smaller than the more than 20 orders of magnitude encountered in recent experiments in a similar temperature range. The extended modified liquid drop-dynamical nucleation theory (EMLD-DNT) shows excellent agreement with the simulation results with deviations of less than one order of magnitude over the entire studied temperature range. Both simulation and experiment confirm the same incorrect temperature trend of CNT, which seems to be corrected in the EMLD-DNT model. However, the predictions of CNT for the critical cluster sizes agree well with the results obtained from the simulations using the nucleation theorem, supporting the notion that CNT successfully estimates the location of the transition state but severely fails to predict its height.",

However, challenges remain in diamond anvil cell technology, including both the quality of various pressure transmitting media and the accuracy of secondary pressure scales at low temperature. We directly calibrate the ruby fluorescence R1 line shift with pressure at T=4.5 K using high-resolution x-ray powder diffraction measurements of the silver lattice constant and its known equation of state up to P=16 GPa. Our results reveal a ruby pressure scale at low temperatures that differs by 6% from the best available ruby scale at room T. We also use ruby fluorescence to characterize the pressure inhomogeneity and anisotropy in two representative and commonly used pressure media, helium and methanol:ethanol 4:1, under the same preparation conditions for pressures up to 20 GPa at T=5 K. Contrary to the accepted wisdom, both media show equal levels of pressure inhomogeneity measured over the same area, with a consistent DeltaP/P per unit area of +/-1.8 %/(10(4) microm(2)) from 0 to 20 GPa. The helium medium shows an essentially constant deviatoric stress of 0.021+/-0.011 GPa up to 16 GPa, while the methanol:ethanol mixture shows a similar level of anisotropy up to 10 GPa, above which the anisotropy increases. The quality of both pressure media is further examined under the more stringent requirements of single crystal x-ray diffraction at cryogenic temperature. For such experiments we conclude that the ratio of sample-to-pressure chamber volume is a critical parameter in maintaining sample quality at high pressure, and may affect the choice of pressure medium.",

In this paper we show that the marginal layer, though causing a substantial reduction in flow resistance and increasing discharge, does not reduce the rate of energy dissipation. This fact is not surprising if one considers the electric analog of the flow in a vessel: a resistance reduction increases both the current intensity (i.e., the discharge) and the energy dissipation.

In the temperature regime near or above the critical temperature, the density dependence of the shear viscosity can be accounted for by ab initio calculations with the self-diffusion coefficients provided by the modified free volume theory if the minimum (critical) free volume is set equal to the molecular volume and the volume overlap parameter (alpha) is taken about unity in the expression for the self-diffusion coefficient. In the subcritical temperature regime, if the density fluctuation range parameter is chosen appropriately at a temperature, then the resulting expression for the shear viscosity can well account for its density and temperature dependence over the ranges of density and temperature experimentally studied. In the sense that once the density fluctuation range is fixed at a temperature, the theory can account for the experimental data at other subcritical temperatures on the basis of the intermolecular force only; the theory is predictive even in the subcritical regime of temperature.

The first instinct is to answer \"Yes, for water between 0 and 4 °C\" if one knows that water expands as temperature decreases in this temperature range. The same question is asked in several Physical Chemistry and Physics textbooks. Students are supposed to answer that water contracts when heated at below 4 °C in an isobaric process. Because work is done to the contracting water, less heat is required to increase the water temperature in an isobaric process than in an isochoric process. Therefore, <iC<subP</sub</i is less than <iC<subV</sub</i . However, this answer is fundamentally flawed because it assumes, implicitly and incorrectly, that the internal energy change of water depends solely on its temperature change. Neglecting the variation of the internal energy with volume (internal pressure) will invalidate the Clausius inequality and violate the second law of thermodynamics. Once the internal pressure is properly taken into account, it becomes clear that <iC<subP</sub</i cannot be less than <iC<subV</sub</i for any substance at any temperature regardless of the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient of the substance.",

Our study revealed that the charge density of the clusters is a key factor determining the selectivity among various growth pathways. An optimal charge density appears to control the selection between neutral and charged species in cluster growth; partially positively charged clusters are thermodynamically preferred and can serve as seeds for further growth. They interact favorably with both the solvent, leading to their solubility, and the citrate. The solvent (water) plays an important role in cluster growth both on the energetics of reactions including highly charged clusters and on the geometry of the resulting silver structures by preventing the formation of asymmetric ones (a structure directing action). Contrary to the common belief we found, from an energetic viewpoint, that growth of small clusters is not blocked by the citrate. Citrate, by acting as a reducing agent, opens up new channels for cluster growth involving highly charged species. By regulating the cluster charge, cluster-cluster associations may be promoted by the citrate, providing a new mechanistic interpretation for the effect of citrate concentration on nanoparticle size substantially different from the classic nucleation theory. From the citrate-silver and water-silver cluster interactions, linear free energy relationships have been retrieved that provide insights into metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can create a circular process with the dissolution of ≡Ag3OH(0), exposure of new metallic sites at the underlying lattice, and subsequent oxidation to ≡Ag3OH(0).

The voltammograms showed the presence of reduction and oxidation peaks associated with the deposition and dissolution of silver from AgBF4 in both BMIMPF6 and BMIMBF(4), resembling the redox behavior of AgNO3 in KNO3 aqueous solution. A crossover loop was observed in all the cyclic voltammograms of these electrochemical systems, indicating a nucleation process. From the analysis of the experimental current transients, it was shown that the electrochemical deposition process of silver in these media was characteristic of 3D nucleation with diffusion-controlled hemispherical growth, and the silver nucleation closely followed the response predicted for progressive nucleation in BMIMPF6 and instantaneous nucleation in KNO3 aqueous solution, respectively. Compared with these two cases, the electrochemical deposition of silver in BMIMBF4 deviated from both the instantaneous and progressive nucleation models, which could be controlled by mixed kinetics and diffusion. On the basis of the experimental results, it was shown that parameters such as viscosity and water miscibility of RTILs would affect the electrodeposition behavior of silver. Atom force microscopy was employed to probe the surface morphology of the silver deposit, and it showed that the shining electrodeposit of silver was fairly dense and separate nanoclusters of &lt;100 nm were in evidence, corresponding to an island growth model. The strongly enhanced Raman scattering from the monolayer film of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid demonstrated that as-prepared silver nanoparticular film was surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active. The enhancement factor was calculated to be up to 9.0 x 10(5) and 1.0 x 10(6) for the silver film obtained in BMIMPF6 and BMIMBF4 RTILs, respectively.",

In this work, solid-state 27Al and 29Si MAS NMR and TGA were used to study silver reduction in silver-exchanged chabazite under various thermal conditions. The solid-state NMR results for both 27Al and 29Si show that there are no major changes in the chabazite during silver reduction in an argon stream; however a progressive structural change does take place in the hydrogen stream. The structural change likely involves breaking the silicon oxygen bond of the Si-O-AI fragment of chabazite, leading to the formation of extra-framework aluminum oxide. The TGA results at temperatures up to 600 degrees C indicate that silver reduction is less complete in an argon stream than in a hydrogen stream.

AgNPs initially react with H(2)O(2) to form Ag(+) and superoxide, with these products subsequently reacting to reform AgNPs (in-situ-formed AgNPs) via an electron charging-discharging mechanism. Our experimental results show that the AgNP reactivity toward H(2)O(2) varies significantly with pH, with the variation at high pH (&gt;10) due particularly to the differences in the reactivity of H(2)O(2) and its conjugate base HO(2)(-) with AgNPs whereas at lower pH (3-10) the pH dependence of H(2)O(2) decay is accounted for, at least in part, by the pH dependence of the rate of superoxide disproportionation.

We show in this paper that high pressure could also induce the superionic state in AgI even at ambient temperature. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we investigated Ag(+) ions diffusing in rock-salt structured AgI-III and KOH-type AgI-V under high pressures and directly observed the superionic state in AgI-V.

By analyzing the half infinite length Warburg diffusion process, two parameters α and β, which closely relate to the disordered state of Ag(+) ions, have been determined and it was suggested that Ag(+) ions in AgI-V become disordered. The ionic conductivity of AgI-V is three orders of magnitude higher than that of AgI-III, and has reached around 0.1 Ω(-1)cm(-1).

Partially (surface) oxidized silver nanoparticles have antibacterial activities, but zero-valent nanoparticles do not. The levels of chemisorbed Ag+ that form on the particle's surface, as revealed by changes in the surface plasmon resonance absorption during oxidation and reduction, correlate well with the observed antibacterial activities.

The antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles are related to their size, with the smaller particles having higher activities on the basis of equivalent silver mass content. The silver nanoparticles aggregate in media with a high electrolyte content, resulting in a loss of antibacterial activities. However, complexation with albumin can stabilize the silver nanoparticles against aggregation, leading to a retention of the antibacterial activities. Taken together, the results show that the antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles are dependent on chemisorbed Ag+, which is readily formed owing to extreme sensitivity to oxygen.

Different crystallographic phases, that is, metastable cubic, orthorhombic, monoclinic, and a mixture of cubic and orthorhombic AIS NCs, were studied. The band gap values estimated from the cyclic voltammetry measurements match well with the band gap values calculated from the diffuse reflectance spectra measurements.

Unlike gold, silver is notorious for its susceptibility to oxidation (tarnishing), which has limited the development of important silver-based nanomaterials. Despite two decades of synthetic efforts, silver nanoparticles that are inert or have long-term stability remain unrealized. Here we report a simple synthetic protocol for producing ultrastable silver nanoparticles, yielding a single-sized molecular product in very large quantities with quantitative yield and without the need for size sorting. The stability, purity and yield are substantially better than those for other metal nanoparticles, including gold, owing to an effective stabilization mechanism. The particular size and stoichiometry of the product were found to be insensitive to variations in synthesis parameters. The chemical stability and structural, electronic and optical properties can be understood using first-principles electronic structure theory based on an experimental single-crystal X-ray structure.

The total structure of a thiolate-protected silver nanocluster reported here uncovers the unique structure of the silver thiolate protecting layer, consisting of Ag2S5 capping structures.

The phase transition is irreversible and accompanied by extensive microstructural changes and grain growth. Detailed scanning and isothermal calorimetric analysis suggests that it is an autocatalytic transformation. Though the calorimetric data suggest an exothermic first-order phase transition with an onset at 155.6 °C (for a heating rate of 2 K min(-1)) and a latent heat of 312.9 J g(-1), the microstructure and the electrical resistance appear to change gradually from much lower temperatures.

A first-principles density functional theory calculation shows that the stacking fault energy of 4H-Ag increases monotonically with temperature.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the structural dynamic and energetic properties of AgTfO in both ILs. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed that the reduction of silver is a diffusion-controlled process. The morphology of the silver coatings obtained in [EMIM]TfO is independent of the applied current density, resulting in nodular electrodeposits grouped as crystalline clusters. However, the current density significantly influences the morphology of silver electrodeposits obtained in [HMIM(+)][HSO4(-)], thus evolving from dendrites at 15 mA cm(-2) to the coexistence of dendrites and columnar shapes at 30 mA cm(-2). These differences are probably due to the greater interaction of Ag(+) with [HSO4(-)] than with TfO(-), as indicated by the MD simulations. The morphology of Ag deposits is independent of the electrodeposition temperature for both ILs, but higher values of temperature promoted increased cluster sizes. Pure face-centred cubic polycrystalline Ag was deposited on the films with crystallite sizes on the nanometre scale.

Our semianalytical calculations based on a mean-spherical approximation correlate well with the experimental data on the concentration and temperature dependencies of the dielectric constant and the optical absorption spectrum. The properties are found to be mainly determined by the induced dipolar interactions between localized solvated electrons, which result in the two main effects: the dispersion attractions between the electrons and a sharp increase in the static dielectric constant of the solution. The first effect creates a classical phase separation for the light alkali metal solutes (Li, Na, K) below a critical temperature. The second effect leads to a dielectric instability, i.e., polarization catastrophe, which is the onset of metallization.

After 1960, pulse radiolysis of nearly any solvent produced solvated electrons, which became one of the most studied species in chemistry. In 1968, alkali metal solutions in amines and ethers were shown to contain alkali metal anions in addition to solvated electrons. The advent of crown ethers and cryptands as complexants for alkali cations greatly enhanced alkali metal solubilities. This permitted us to prepare a crystalline salt of Na(-) in 1974, followed by 30 other alkalides with Na(-), K(-), Rb(-) and Cs(-) anions. This firmly established the -1 oxidation state of alkali metals. The synthesis of alkalides led to the crystallization of electrides, with trapped electrons as the anions. Electrides have a variety of electronic and magnetic properties, depending on the geometries and connectivities of the trapping sites. In 2009, the final surprise was the experimental demonstration that alkali metals under high pressure lose their metallic character as the electrons are localized in voids between the alkali cations to become high-pressure electrides!

Alkali and alkaline earth atoms serve as electron donors in solvents that mediate outer-sphere electron transfer. We report herein ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of lithium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium in liquid ammonia at 250 K. By analyzing the electronic properties and the ionic and solvation structures and dynamics, we systematically characterize these metals as electron donors and ammonia molecules as electron acceptors. We show that the solvated metal strongly modifies the properties of its solvation shells and that the observed effect is metal-specific. Specifically, the radius and charge exhibit major impacts. The single solvated electron present in the alkali metal systems is distributed more uniformly among the solvent molecules of each metal's two solvation shells. In contrast, alkaline earth metals favor a less uniform distribution of the electron density. Alkali and alkaline earth atoms are coordinated by four and six NH3 molecules, respectively. The smaller atoms, Li and Mg, are stronger electron donors than Na and Ca. This result is surprising, as smaller atoms in a column of the periodic table have higher ionization potentials. However, it can be explained by stronger electron donor-acceptor interactions between the smaller atoms and the solvent molecules. The structure of the first solvation shell is sharpest for Mg, which has a large charge and a small radius. Solvation is weakest for Na, which has a small charge and a large radius. Weak solvation leads to rapid dynamics, as reflected in the diffusion coefficients of NH3 molecules of the first two solvation shells and the Na atom. The properties of the solvated electrons established in the present study are important for radiation chemistry, synthetic chemistry, condensed-matter charge transfer, and energy sources. ",

This value decreases to 0.0 for the saturated solution of 21 mol % metal, as all ammonia molecules have then become incorporated into the tetrahedral first solvation spheres of the lithium cations.

Experimentally determined NMR parameters have supported this interpretation, further indicating that whereas Na(-) is a genuine metal anion, the interaction of the alkali anion with the medium becomes progressively stronger for the larger metals. Herein, first-principles computations based upon density functional theory are carried out on various species which may be present in solutions composed of alkali metals and ethylenediamine. The energies of a number of hypothetical reactions computed with a continuum solvation model indicate that neither free metal anions, M(-), nor solvated electrons are the most stable species. Instead, [Li(en)(3)](2) and [M(en)(3)(δ+)·M(δ-)] (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) are predicted to have enhanced stability. The M(en)(3) complexes can be viewed as superalkalis or expanded alkalis, ones in which the valence electron density is pulled out to a greater extent than in the alkali metals alone. The computed optical absorption spectra and NMR parameters of the [Li(en)(3)](2) superalkali dimer and the [M(en)(3)(δ+)·M(δ-)] superalkali-alkali mixed dimers are in good agreement with the aforementioned experimental results, providing further evidence that these may be the dominant species in solution.

Pending decades of debate, it was established that nitrate is bidentate and coordinates in the inner sphere, and complexes have been observed with as many as four nitrates coordinated to a single lanthanide(III) center in nonaqueous solutions. We revisit the interactions between nitrate and europium(III) in methanol using optical spectroscopy, X-ray total scattering, and the current understanding of europium(III) photophysics.

IRPD spectra in the free-OH region (∼3600-3800 cm(-1)) for Cs(+), Rb(+), and K(+) with 18 and 20 water molecules indicates that water molecules with a free-OH stretch accept two hydrogen bonds and donate one hydrogen bond (acceptor-acceptor-donor water) to other water molecules.

Instead, only a redox-neutral dissociation of azide anions is seen under these conditions. However, clear evidence is found for the formation of the highly oxidized iron nitride product when the photolysis is carried out in liquid solution with UV light. Yet, the photooxidation must compete with photoreductive Fe-N bond cleavage leading to azide radicals and an iron(II) complex. Both, redox-neutral and photoreductive Fe-N bond breakage as well as photooxidative N-N bond breakage occur on a time scale well below a few hundred femtoseconds.

Yet, even in the low concentration regime the nature of the ammoniated electron is still controversial with cavity models supported by optical and density measurements whereas localized radical models have been invoked to explain magnetic measurements. Small clusters can shed light on these open questions, and in particular the Li-NH(3) tetramer represents the smallest cluster with a complete solvation shell for the Li(+) cation. In view of the controversies about the character of the excess electron, the first question investigated is whether different theoretical characterizations of the \"excess electron\" lead to different conclusions about it. Only small differences are found between orbital-based and spin density-based and between self-consistent-field and coupled-cluster-based methods. Natural orbitals from equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations are then used to analyze the excess electron's distribution of Li(NH(3))(4) with particular emphasis on the portion of the excess electron's density that is closely associated with the N atoms. Three different comparisons show that only about 6% of the excess electron's density are closely associated with the atoms, with about 1% being closely associated with any N atom, and that the electron is best characterized as a Rydberg-like electron of the whole cluster.

But, of course, experimental studies of metals, non-metals and, indeed, the electronic and thermodynamic transition between these canonical states of matter must always occur above T=0 K, and, in many important cases, for temperatures far above the absolute zero.

The IRMPD spectra contain many similarities that are most consistent with glutamine adopting nonzwitterionic forms in all ions, but differences in the spectra indicate that the specific nonzwitterionic forms adopted depend on metal-ion identity. For ions containing small alkali metals, the metal ion is solvated predominantly by the amino group, the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid group, and the carbonyl oxygen of the amide group. With increasing alkali-metal-ion size, additional structures are present in which the carboxylic acid group donates a hydrogen bond to the amino group and the metal ion is solvated only by the amide and carboxylic acid groups. The effects of alkylation of the amino and amide groups on the proton affinity of isolated glutamine and the relative zwitterion stability of sodiated glutamine were examined computationally. Methylation of the amino group increases the proton affinity of isolated glutamine and preferentially stabilizes the zwitterionic form of sodiated glutamine by roughly 20 kJ/mol. Ethylation and isopropylation of the amide group each increase the proton affinity of isolated glutamine by roughly 13 kJ/mol but preferentially stabilize the zwitterionic form of sodiated glutamine by less than 3 kJ/mol.

In order to address this problem, we need intense THz radiation able to drive the liquid into the nonlinear response regime. Firstly, in this study, we summarize the available brilliant THz sources and compare their emission properties. Secondly, we characterize the THz emission by Gallium Phosphide (GaP), 2-{3-(4-hydroxystyryl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-enylidene}malononitrile (OH1), and 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4'-N'-methyl-stilbazolium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (DSTMS) crystals pumped by an amplified near-infrared (NIR) laser with tunable wavelength.

We verify that low-loss electrons are the major contributors to EBSD patterns, but that there is still a diffraction contribution from electrons with only 80% of the incident beam energy. Additionally, the bands in filtered EBSD patterns have contrast that is more than twice the contrast of their unfiltered counterparts.

How does it differ from the scattering from long-range potential? With the development of new high-dynamic range pixel array detectors to measure the complete momentum distribution, these questions have immediate relevance for designing and understanding momentum-resolved imaging modes. We explore the asymptotic limits of long-range and short-range potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical model to explain the general and asymptotic limits for the probability distribution in both real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering potential much larger than the probe size cause the bright field (BF) disk to deflect uniformly, while features much smaller than the probe size, instead of a deflection, cause a redistribution of intensity within the BF disk. Because long-range and short-range features are encoded differently in the diffraction pattern, it is possible to separate their contributions in differential phase-contrast (DPC) or center-of-mass (CoM) imaging. The shape profiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging are dominated by the shape of the probe gradient and not the highly singular atomic potentials or their local fields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic number sensitivity, whose precise dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence angles, the contrast oscillates with increasing atomic number, similar to BF imaging. The range of collection angles impacts DPC and CoM imaging differently, with CoM being more sensitive to the upper cutoff limit, while DPC is more sensitive to the lower cutoff.",

Techniques have been generally available since the 1980s which overcome this restriction for individual diffracted beams, by making a compromise between illuminated area and beam convergence. Here a simple technique is described which overcomes all of these problems using computer control, giving electron diffraction data over a large angular range for many diffracted beams from the volume given by a focused electron beam (typically a few nm or less). The increase in the amount of information significantly improves the ease of interpretation and widens the applicability of the technique, particularly for thin materials or those with larger lattice parameters.",

Second, the new expression reveals a clear and straightforward relationship between the wave function and crystal potential.

The effective kinematical approximation\nWhile it is known that the kinematical approximation works poorly if at all for transmission electron diffraction, substantial success has been achieved over the last few years in applying it via direct methods to determine atomic structures. This raises an interesting quandary; is the established theory of electron diffraction wrong, or are the apparent successes mirages? The intention of this note is to look more deeply into this question and it is found that the correct answer is neither of the above. Beyond vanishingly thin samples when the kinematical approximation holds rigorously, the distribution of phases can remain effectively kinematical; the summation operator(0) distribution given by the sum of the phase of +g and -g reflections remains peaked, albeit not at zero phase, and has a relatively narrow distribution. This fact is shown via both exploiting prior works on including anomalous-scattering effects into direct methods, and numerical calculations. Provided that the summation operator(0) distribution remains narrow, direct methods and indeed structural refinements have some validity. Even larger unit-cell structures with close to statistically random atomic positions do not approach a kinematical limit but instead an effective statistical kinematical approximation. While there are similarities to what there is in conventional (kinematical) direct methods, there remain major differences; for instance, positivity is no longer a valid constraint and the scattering need not be dominated by heavy atoms.",

Here, using an energy filter with better than 10 eV resolution, we experimentally demonstrate the energy dependence of EBSD patterns from elements over a large atomic number range. We verify that low-loss electrons are the major contributors to EBSD patterns, but that there is still a diffraction contribution from electrons with only 80% of the incident beam energy. Additionally, the bands in filtered EBSD patterns have contrast that is more than twice the contrast of their unfiltered counterparts. The band contrast reaches a maximum for a cutoff energy in the filter of about 3% below the energy of the incident beam. Different mechanisms are used to explain the drop in contrast on each side of the maximum. With the cutoff set very close to the energy of the incident beam, the patterns become more blurred.

The meteoric rise in MAD applications resulted from the availability of new synchrotron beamlines, equipped with low bandpass optics, fast readout detectors, cryogenic cooling and user-friendly interfaces. The power of MAD phasing has been amplified by the availability of new computer programs for locating the positions of the anomalous scattering atoms and for calculating phases from the experimental data. Phasing by anomalous scattering techniques has been applied to structures as large as 640 kDa and 120 selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit.

How does it differ from the scattering from long-range potential? With the development of new high-dynamic range pixel array detectors to measure the complete momentum distribution, these questions have immediate relevance for designing and understanding momentum-resolved imaging modes. We explore the asymptotic limits of long-range and short-range potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical model to explain the general and asymptotic limits for the probability distribution in both real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering potential much larger than the probe size cause the bright field (BF) disk to deflect uniformly, while features much smaller than the probe size, instead of a deflection, cause a redistribution of intensity within the BF disk. Because long-range and short-range features are encoded differently in the diffraction pattern, it is possible to separate their contributions in differential phase-contrast (DPC) or center-of-mass (CoM) imaging. The shape profiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging are dominated by the shape of the probe gradient and not the highly singular atomic potentials or their local fields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic number sensitivity, whose precise dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence angles, the contrast oscillates with increasing atomic number, similar to BF imaging. The range of collection angles impacts DPC and CoM imaging differently, with CoM being more sensitive to the upper cutoff limit, while DPC is more sensitive to the lower cutoff.",

Techniques have been generally available since the 1980s which overcome this restriction for individual diffracted beams, by making a compromise between illuminated area and beam convergence. Here a simple technique is described which overcomes all of these problems using computer control, giving electron diffraction data over a large angular range for many diffracted beams from the volume given by a focused electron beam (typically a few nm or less).

Second, the new expression reveals a clear and straightforward relationship between the wave function and crystal potential. In the expression, the effect of dynamical diffraction on wave function can be simply attributed to two factors TP(D) = (sin(lambda pi zg2))/(4pi2g2) and TA(D) = [1 - cos(lambda pi zg2)]/4pi2g2.

The effective kinematical approximation\nWhile it is known that the kinematical approximation works poorly if at all for transmission electron diffraction, substantial success has been achieved over the last few years in applying it via direct methods to determine atomic structures. This raises an interesting quandary; is the established theory of electron diffraction wrong, or are the apparent successes mirages? The intention of this note is to look more deeply into this question and it is found that the correct answer is neither of the above. Beyond vanishingly thin samples when the kinematical approximation holds rigorously, the distribution of phases can remain effectively kinematical; the summation operator(0) distribution given by the sum of the phase of +g and -g reflections remains peaked, albeit not at zero phase, and has a relatively narrow distribution. This fact is shown via both exploiting prior works on including anomalous-scattering effects into direct methods, and numerical calculations. Provided that the summation operator(0) distribution remains narrow, direct methods and indeed structural refinements have some validity. Even larger unit-cell structures with close to statistically random atomic positions do not approach a kinematical limit but instead an effective statistical kinematical approximation. While there are similarities to what there is in conventional (kinematical) direct methods, there remain major differences; for instance, positivity is no longer a valid constraint and the scattering need not be dominated by heavy atoms.",

A critical evaluation of the work that has been done to gather such evidence, as well as of earlier work involving condensed-phase observations, suggests that NH(3) might well be best described as a powerful hydrogen-bond acceptor with little propensity to donate hydrogen bonds.",

From these complexes the following metal-containing dications have been generated: [Mg(NH3)n](2+), [Ca(NH3)n](2+), and [Sr(NH3)n](2+), and for n in the range 4-20, kinetic energy release measurements following the evaporation of a single molecule have been undertaken using a high resolution mass spectrometer. Using finite heat bath theory, these data have been transformed into binding energies for individual ammonia molecules attached to each of the three cluster systems. In the larger complexes (n &gt; 6) the results exhibit a consistent trend, whereby the experimental binding energy data for all three metal ions are very similar, suggesting that the magnitude of the charge rather than charge density influences the strength of the interaction. From a comparison with data recorded previously for (NH3)nH(+) it is found that the 2+ charge on a metal ion has an effect on the binding energy of molecules in complexes containing up to 20 solvent molecules. Although subject to comparatively large experimental errors, the results recorded for Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) when n ≤ 6 show evidence for the formation of an inner solvation shell containing up to 6 molecules. However, Mg(2+) exhibits relatively low binding energies when n = 5 and 6, which suggests that a second shell starts to form before there are 6 ammonia molecules bound to the metal ion. This conclusion is supported by DFT calculations and it is proposed that these complexes could take the form [Mg(NH3)4(NH3)](2+) when n = 5 and either [Mg(NH3)4(NH3)2](2+) or [Mg(NH3)5(NH3)](2+) when n = 6. In each case, additional molecules are hydrogen bonded to one or more molecules in the inner solvation shell. ",

Complexes have been generated using a combination of the pick-up technique and electron impact ionization, and individual ions were monitored for evidence of metastability in the form of Coulomb fission or charge separation: [M(XH)n](2+) → [M(+)X](XH)n-m + H2X(+)(XH)m-2. Values have been assigned to a quantity ns, which is identified as the minimum number of molecules required to suppress the above reaction. These values were found to range from 3 for Sr(2+) complexed with methanol to 19 for Sn(2+) complexed with ammonia. Comparisons are made with results published previously for the same metal dications complexed with water (Chen, X.; Stace, A. J. Chem. Commun.2012, 10292), and for the most part, it is found that ions solvated with either ammonia or methanol are less stable than their water counterparts. To account for differences in stability, several criteria have been examined, and of those, the most satisfactory correlation is between ns and M(2+)-XH bond strength; the stronger the bond, the larger ns has to be in order for a complex to be stable. However, for complexes where ns is large, such as those involving Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and especially Sn(2+) and Pb(2+), it is proposed that the geometry adopted by solvent molecules also has a significant influence on proton transfer. By comparing the ease with which proton transfer occurs for the three protic solvents, water, ammonia, and methanol, it is possible to comment on metal ion acidity in nonaqueous solutions, for which condensed phase data are nonexistent; the results suggest that most of the nine metals would be stronger Lewis acids in ammonia than in water.

Comparison of the experimental and calculated IR spectra, along with calculations of the energetics, indicates that this second product is the result of hydrogen bonding of a second NH3 molecule to the (CH3)3M:NH3 adduct and can be written as (CH3)3M:NH3...NH3.

DeltaG values at 298 K in the gas phase for eq 1 (DeltaG(DFT)) were calculated for 34 metal ions using density functional theory (DFT), with the expectation that these would correlate with the free energy of complex formation in aqueous solution (DeltaG(aq)). [M(H2O)6]n+(g) + NH(3)(g) = [M(H2O)5NH3]n+(g) + H2O(g) (eq 1). The DeltaG(aq) values include the effects of complex changes in solvation on complex formation, which are not included in eq 1. It was anticipated that such changes in solvation would be constant or vary systematically with changes in the log K(1) value for different metal ions; therefore, simple correlations between DeltaG(DFT) and DeltaG(aq) were sought. The bulk of the log K1(NH3) values used to calculate DeltaG(aq) were not experimental, but estimated previously (Hancock 1978, 1980) from a variety of empirical correlations. Separate linear correlations between DeltaG(DFT) and DeltaG(aq) for metal ions of different charges (M2+, M3+, and M4+) were found. In plots of DeltaG(DFT) versus DeltaG(aq), the slopes ranged from 2.201 for M2+ ions down to 1.076 for M4+ ions, with intercepts increasing from M2+ to M4+ ions. Two separate correlations occurred for the M3+ ions, which appeared to correspond to small metal ions with a coordination number (CN) of 6 and to large metal ions with a higher CN in the vicinity of 7-9. The good correlation coefficients (R) in the range of 0.97-0.99 for all these separate correlations suggest that the approach used here may be the basis for future predictions of aqueous phase chemistry that would otherwise be experimentally inaccessible. Thus, the log K1(NH3) value for the transuranic Lr3+, which has a half-life of 3.6 h in its most stable isotope, is predicted to be 1.46. These calculations should also lead to a greater insight into the factors governing complex formation in aqueous solution. All of the above DFT calculations involved corrections for scalar relativistic effects (RE). Au has been described (Koltsoyannis 1997) as a \"relativistic element\". The chief effect of RE for group 11 ions is to favor linear coordination geometry and greatly increase covalence in the M-L bond. The correlation for M+ ions (H+, Cu+, Ag+, Au+) involved the preferred linear coordination of the [M(H2O)2]+ complexes, so that the DFT calculations of DeltaG for the gas-phase reaction in eq 2 were carried out for M = H+, Cu+, Ag+, and Au+. [M(H2O)2]+(g) + NH3(g) = [M(H2O)NH3]+(g) + H2O(g) (eq 2). Additional DFT calculations for eq 2 were carried out omitting corrections for RE. These indicated, in the absence of RE, virtually no change in the log K1(NH3) value for H+, a small decrease for Cu+, and a larger decrease for Ag+. There would, however, be a very large decrease in the log K1(NH3) value for Au(I) from 9.8 (RE included) to 1.6 (RE omitted).

The excellent transferability of the model suggests that it can be used to investigate properties of fluid ammonia under conditions for which experiments are not easy to perform. For aqueous ammonia solutions, the model yields liquid structures and densities in good agreement with experimental data and allows the nonlinearity in the density-composition plot to be interpreted in terms of structural changes with composition. Finally, the model is used to investigate the solvation structure of ammonia in liquid water and of water in liquid ammonia and to calculate the solvation free energy of NH3 and H2O in aqueous ammonia as a function of solution composition and temperature.

One longstanding question about water's intermolecular interactions, and notably hydrogen bonding, is the extent and importance of charge transfer (CT) , which can have important implications for the development of reliable model potentials for water chemistry, among other applications. The weakly bound adducts, commonly regarded as pure van der Waals systems, formed by H(2)O, H(2)S, and NH(3) with noble gases or simple molecules such as H(2), provide an interesting case study for these interactions. Their binding energies are approximately 1 or 2 kJ/mol at most, and CT effects in these systems are thought to be negligible. Our laboratory has performed high-resolution molecular-beam scattering experiments that probe the (absolute scale) intermolecular potential of various types of these gas-phase binary complexes with extreme sensitivity. These experiments have yielded surprising and intriguing quantitative results. The key experimental measurable is the \"glory\" quantum interference shift that shows a systematic, anomalous energy stabilization for the water complexes and clearly points to a significant role for CT effects. To investigate these findings, we have performed very accurate theoretical calculations and devised a simple approach to study the electron displacement that accompanies gas-phase binary intermolecular interactions in extreme detail. These calculations are based on a partial progressive integration of the electron density changes. The results unambiguously show that water's intermolecular interactions are not typical van der Waals complexes. Instead, these interactions possess a definite, strongly stereospecific CT component, even when very weak, where a water molecule may act as electron donor or acceptor depending on its orientation. CT is mediated by an asymmetric role played by the two hydrogen atoms, which causes strong orientation effects. The careful comparison of these calculations with the experimental results shows that the stabilization energy associated to CT is approximately 2-3 eV per electron transferred and may make up for a large portion of the total interaction energy. A simple electron delocalization model helps to validate and explain these findings.",

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

Up to now all methods for computing the partition functions of these motions rely on the Pitzer approximation of more than 50 years ago, in which the large-amplitude motion is treated in complete independence of the other (vibrational) degrees of freedom. In this paper an extended hindered-rotor model (EHR) is developed in which the vibrational modes, treated harmonically, are correctly separated from the large-amplitude motion and in which relaxation effects (the changes in the kinetic-energy matrix and potential curvature) are taken into account as one moves along the large-amplitude path. The model also relies on a specific coordinate system in which the Coriolis terms vanish at all times in the Hamiltonian. In this way an increased level of consistency between the various internal modes is achieved, as compared with the more usual hindered-rotor (HR) description. The method is illustrated by calculating the entropies and heat capacities on 1,3-butadiene and 1-butene (with, respectively, one and two internal rotors) and the rate constant for the addition reaction of a vinyl radical to ethene. We also discuss various variants of the one-dimensional hindered-rotor scheme existing in the literature and its relation with the EHR model.

Here, we investigate an approach in which the purely electronic contribution is calculated at the coupled cluster singles and doubles level, while the zero-point vibrational correction is computed using the less demanding density functional theory (B3LYP functional). By comparing to experimental gas phase results for seven molecules and two wavelengths, we find that the mixed coupled cluster/B3LYP approach performs significantly better than pure B3LYP predictions.

Stopera and J. A. Morales, J. Chem. Phys. 152, 134112 (2020)], we reformulate an earlier rotational coherent state (CS) set to obtain a temporally stable (TS) CS set for symmetric rotors. Being TS, the new CSs remain within its own set during dynamics by evolving exclusively through their parameters. The TS CS set is now appropriate to reconstruct quantum rotational properties from classical-mechanics simulations of chemical reactions. Following literature precedents, we enforce temporal stability by incorporating action-angle-related phase factors into two parameters of the original CS set. Proofs and final expressions of the symmetric-rotor CS turn out more intricate than those of its spherical-rotor counterpart. We demonstrate and examine the key properties of the new CS set: continuity, resolution of unity, temporal stability, action identity, minimum uncertainty relationships, and quasi-classical behavior. Regarding the last property, we demonstrate that the body-fixed z-component of the CS angular momentum average evolves exactly as its classical counterpart, and that the x- and y-components display an astonishing analogy with their classical counterparts in terms of functional form, precession angular velocities, amplitudes, and phases. We elucidate some of these properties via computer simulations of a rotating benzene molecule represented with the CS set. We discuss the utilization of this CS set to reconstruct quantum rotational properties of symmetric-rotor molecules from classical-mechanics simulations. The new CS set is appropriate to establish quantum-classical connections for rotational properties in chemical dynamics, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, nuclear physics, and quantum computing.",

The first instinct is to answer \"Yes, for water between 0 and 4 °C\" if one knows that water expands as temperature decreases in this temperature range. The same question is asked in several Physical Chemistry and Physics textbooks. Students are supposed to answer that water contracts when heated at below 4 °C in an isobaric process. Because work is done to the contracting water, less heat is required to increase the water temperature in an isobaric process than in an isochoric process. Therefore, <iC<subP</sub</i is less than <iC<subV</sub</i . However, this answer is fundamentally flawed because it assumes, implicitly and incorrectly, that the internal energy change of water depends solely on its temperature change. Neglecting the variation of the internal energy with volume (internal pressure) will invalidate the Clausius inequality and violate the second law of thermodynamics. Once the internal pressure is properly taken into account, it becomes clear that <iC<subP</sub</i cannot be less than <iC<subV</sub</i for any substance at any temperature regardless of the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient of the substance.",

Thermodynamic constraints make chemiosmosis strictly necessary for carbon and energy metabolism in all free-living chemotrophs, and presumably the first free-living cells too. Proton gradients form naturally at alkaline hydrothermal vents and are viewed as central to the origin of life. Here we consider how the earliest cells might have harnessed a geochemically created proton-motive force and then learned to make their own, a transition that was necessary for their escape from the vents. Synthesis of ATP by chemiosmosis today involves generation of an ion gradient by means of vectorial electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor.

Examples of such states are many modern materials produced intentionally for technological applications. Furthermore, all living organisms fuelled directly by photosynthesis and those fuelled indirectly by living on high energy nutrition represent preserved non-equilibrium states. The formation of these states represents the local reversal of the arrow of time which only seemingly violates the second law. It has been known since the seminal work of Prigogine that the stabilisation of these states inevitably requires the dissipation of energy in the form of waste heat. It is this feature of waste heat dissipation following the input of energy that drives all processes occurring at a non-zero rate. Photosynthesis, replication of living organisms, self-assembly, crystal shape engineering and distillation have this principle in common with the well-known Carnot cycle in the heat engine. Drawing on this analogy, we subsume these essential and often sophisticated driven processes under the term machinery of life. ",

A brilliant sequence to this simple idea followed through Poynting, Arrhenius, Noyes and culminated with Hulett, who in 1901 formulated the \"solvent tension theory\" of osmosis, stating in essence that the thermal motion of the solute molecules by impact with the free solvent surface put the solvent under tension. This lowers the vapor pressure and thereby also its freezing point. Perrin, in famous experiments on Brownian motion, demonstrated solute-solvent independence within a solution and further support came through Herzfeld, Mysels and Duclaux. We measured negative pressures in salt-free sap of mangroves and other plants matching the osmotic pressure in the leaf cells. A series of measurements on magnetic and gravitational effects on osmotic pressure likewise bore out the tension theory.

Water has distinctive liquid and solid properties: It is highly cohesive. It has volumetric anomalies-water's solid (ice) floats on its liquid; pressure can melt the solid rather than freezing the liquid; heating can shrink the liquid. It has more solid phases than other materials. Its supercooled liquid has divergent thermodynamic response functions. Its glassy state is neither fragile nor strong. Its component ions-hydroxide and protons-diffuse much faster than other ions. Aqueous solvation of ions or oils entails large entropies and heat capacities. We review how these properties are encoded within water's molecular structure and energies, as understood from theories, simulations, and experiments.

We first collected and curated aqueous thermodynamic data, including reaction-equilibrium constants, enthalpies of reaction, Gibbs free energies of formation, enthalpies of formation, entropy changes of formation of compounds, and proton- and metal-ion-binding constants.

The model, which does not require steady state conditions, is based on a set of equations, each one describing the fates of a given carbon of a selected intermediate. These fates are expressed as ratios of integrated transfer of this carbon to corresponding carbons in subsequent metabolites. At each bifurcation, the sum of all proportions adds up to 1. Among several calculation routes to determine a proportion value, we chose the one that was based on the most reliable parameter determined experimentally. The data introduced in the model are the micrograms of atom of traced carbon measured on each carbon of a number of products (corrected for natural tracer abundance). These incorporations can be measured by 13C NMR, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, or 14C counting. Thanks to its flexibility, this model can be applied to data obtained with substrates other than glucose under many experimental conditions.",

The utilization of energy for maintenance could only explain a small portion of this discrepancy particularly when the growth rate was high. These ideas and thermodynamic arguments indicated that cells might have another avenue of energy utilization. This phenomenon has also been called 'uncoupling', 'spillage' and 'overflow metabolism', but 'energy spilling' is probably the most descriptive term. It appears that many bacteria spill energy, and the few that do not can be killed (large and often rapid decrease in viability), if the growth medium is nitrogen-limited and the energy source is in 'excess'. The lactic acid bacterium, Streptococcus bovis, is an ideal bacterium for the study of energy spilling. Because it only uses substrate level phosphorylation to generate ATP, ATP generation can be calculated with a high degree of certainty. It does not store glucose as glycogen, and its cell membrane can be easily accessed. Comparative analysis of heat production, membrane voltage, ATP production and Ohm's law indicated that the energy spilling reaction of S. bovis is mediated by a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane. Less is known about Escherichia coli, but in this bacterium energy spilling could be mediated by a futile cycle of potassium or ammonium ions. Energy spilling is not restricted to prokaryotes and appears to occur in yeasts and in higher organisms. In man, energy spilling may be related to cancer, ageing, ischemia and cardiac failure.",

This study provides new lines of evidence about the reaction through exploration of the reaction mechanism using the CCSD(T) method and solving the corresponding master equation by following two main approaches. According to the results, the rate coefficient of the reaction is significantly influenced by the tunneling and hindered rotation effects, in addition to the selected total angular momentum (<iJ</i). Furthermore, the total rate coefficient of the reaction increases dramatically (from 10<sup7</sup to 10<sup11</sup L mol<sup-1</sup s<sup-1</sup) with the rise of temperature from 100 to 4000 K, while the total rate coefficient is insensitive to pressure (0.1-10 atm). Despite some differences between the results of the two approaches, the rate coefficients of both methods are consistent with the previously reported rate coefficients. Also, in agreement with the previous studies, the major products are <sup2</supHOC + <sup2</supH and <sup2</supHCO + <sup2</supH. In general, the findings approve the occurrence of the title reaction and indicate that the mentioned conflict is due to the sensitivity of the reaction to the investigated temperature and <iJ</i level.

These structures hold the potential for use in future technologies ranging from drug development and antimicrobial agents, to armor and superconductors. Harold Kroto was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire in 1939 and grew up in Bolton. Educated at Bolton School, he entered Sheffield University in 1958 to study Chemistry. During his time there he played tennis for the university team, illustrated the university's magazine covers, and played folk music with other students. Enjoying his time at Sheffield very much, he chose to stay on and complete a Ph.D. in Chemistry under Richard Dixon. Following graduation in 1964, Kroto went on to post doc at the National Research Council (NRC) in Ottowa, Canada where microwave spectroscopy became his specialty. After two years of study at the NRC he spent a year at Bell Laboratories. He then accepted a position as a tutorial fellow at the University of Sussex, where he was soon offered a permanent position. There, he applied his expertise in microwave spectroscopy to the field of astronomy and spent several fruitful years detecting long carbon chains in the interstellar medium. Upon hearing of the work of Richard Smalley at Rice, who developed a laser that could vaporize graphite, Kroto thought they could use Smalley's instrument to see carbon chains similar to those they had observed in interstellar matter. He suggested his idea for an experiment to Bob Curl, also at Rice. In 1985 he traveled to Rice to perform the experiment (and also to visit a half-price bookstore he'd heard about in Houston). Although he felt certain that the apparatus would create the carbon chains, the experiment revealed a totally unexpected result: the spontaneous formation of spherical shapes, which they called Buckminster Fullerenes in honor of the architect who popularized the geodesic dome. Though he is pleased to have received the Nobel Prize, Kroto does not believe in prizes or competition as a motivator for scientific (or athletic) progress. Rather, he believes that the pursuit of science or athletics should be simply for the enjoyment or interest in the subject matter, and he prefers to investigate subjects that other people aren't working on. Kroto has mixed feelings about the effect the prize has had on his life. On the one hand, he would like to be able to spend more time pursuing graphic design, something he has always deeply enjoyed. On the other hand, he now enjoys a sense of responsibility for supporting the scientific community. As an atheist, Kroto feels that science is, in itself, atheistic. He doesn't accept anything without evidence. Kroto expresses concern about people holding positions of power who do not use evidence as a basis for decision-making. \"When they are prepared to accept one of 20-30 stories from thousands of years ago, I wonder what else they are prepared to accept when it comes to decisions which affect me?\" Kroto is particularly worried about the effect of policies that require the teaching of non-scientific ideas, to the detriment of evidence-based scientific education. He points to the forced teaching of creationism in public schools and the existence of a \"creation museum\" in the United States as sources of misinformation that have given rise to \"a whole generation of school children who've been abused.\"",

Rate constants are derived for the clustering of H(2)O to NO(+)(H(2)O)(1-3) and the reactions of NO(+)(H(2)O)(3,4) with H(2)O to form H(3)O(+)(H(2)O)(2,3), respectively.

While radiolysis kinetics have been studied extensively in the past, it is only in recent years that high-speed computing has allowed the rapid exploration of the solution over widely varying dose and compositional conditions. We explore the radiolytic production of H2O2 under various externally fixed conditions of molecular H2 and O2 that have been regarded as problematic in the literature-specifically, \"jumps\" in predicted concentrations, and inconsistencies between predictions and experiments have been reported for α radiolysis. We computationally map-out a critical concentration behavior for α radiolysis kinetics using a comprehensive set of reactions. We then show that all features of interest are accurately reproduced with 15 reactions. An analytical solution for steady-state concentrations of the 15 reactions reveals regions in [H2] and [O2] where the H2O2 concentration is not unique-both stable and unstable concentrations exist. The boundary of this region can be characterized analytically as a function of G-values and rate constants independent of dose rate. Physically, the boundary can be understood as separating a region where a steady-state H2O2 concentration exists from one where it does not exist without a direct decomposition reaction. We show that this behavior is consistent with reported α radiolysis data and that no such behavior should occur for γ radiolysis. We suggest experiments that could verify or discredit a critical concentration behavior for α radiolysis and could place more restrictive ranges on G-values from derived relationships between them.

This survey showed that hydrocarbons and organic substances containing a single oxygenated group were kinetically the most stable; whereas organic substances containing two oxygenated groups in which one group was an alpha- or beta-positioned carbonyl group were the most reactive. Compounds with an alpha- or beta-positioned carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) had rates of reaction that were up to 10(24)-times faster than rates of similar molecules lacking the carbonyl group. This survey of organic reactivity, together with estimates of the molecular containment properties of lipid vesicles and liquid spherules, indicates that an origins process in a small domain that used C,H,O-intermediates had to be catalytic and use the most reactive organic molecules to prevent escape of its reaction intermediates.",

A complete kinetic model based on the most relevant elementary steps can be established for any given point along an industrial reactor, and the kinetic results can be integrated over the catalyst bed to determine the industrial reactor yield. We find that, given the present uncertainties, the rate of ammonia production is well-determined directly from our atomic-scale calculations. Furthermore, our studies provide new insight into several related fields, for instance, gas-phase and electrochemical ammonia synthesis.

The one-electron proof then motivates an approximation to the QCM (exact under certain conditions) expanded on the wavefunctions of the KS equations.

This is problematic, especially in cases of dative bonding and for open-shell complexes involving cation radicals, for which one might expect significant CT. Here, we analyze CT interactions predicted by several popular energy decomposition analyses and ultimately recommend the definition afforded by constrained density functional theory (cDFT), as it is scarcely dependent on basis set and provides results that are in accord with chemical intuition in simple cases, and in quantitative agreement with experimental estimates of the CT energy, where available. For open-shell complexes, the cDFT approach affords CT energies that are in line with trends expected based on ionization potentials and electron affinities whereas some other definitions afford unreasonably large CT energies in large-gap systems, which are sometimes artificially offset by underestimation of van der Waals interactions by density functional theory. Our recommended energy decomposition analysis is a composite approach, in which cDFT is used to define the CT component of the interaction energy and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) defines the electrostatic, polarization, Pauli repulsion, and van der Waals contributions. SAPT/cDFT provides a stable and physically motivated energy decomposition that, when combined with a new implementation of open-shell SAPT, can be applied to supramolecular complexes involving molecules, ions, and/or radicals.

He directs some of these concerns back to Pauling's earlier text, The Nature of the Chemical Bond. Both Coulson and Pauling are aware that quantum theory's ability to approximate the energetic stability of chemical systems is of use to chemistry only if it can be correlated with the molecular structure that results from chemical bonding. While this may now be routinely expected, it was a struggle to see that this was the challenge chemistry posed to physics-and this achievement they both attribute to G.N. Lewis. Until the more mature forms of quantum mechanics arose in the 1920s, Lewis was skeptical that the dynamic models of the atom posed by Bohr could meet this challenge.

We also present a conceptual evaluation of charge models that aims to explain, at least partially, why GAPT and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) charges are strongly correlated with one another, even though they seem to be constructed under very different frameworks.

More specifically, Bohr's original method did not impose action quantization constraints but rather obtained these as predictions by simply matching photon and classical orbital frequencies. In other words, the hydrogen atom was treated entirely classically and orbital quantized emerged directly from the Planck-Einstein photon quantization condition, E = h nu. Here, we revisit this early history of quantum theory and demonstrate the application of Bohr's original strategy to the three quintessential quantum systems: an electron in a box, an electron in a ring, and a dipolar harmonic oscillator. The usual energy-level spectra, and optical selection rules, emerge by solving an algebraic (quadratic) equation, rather than a Bohr-Sommerfeld integral (or Schroedinger) equation. However, the new predictions include a frozen (zero-kinetic-energy) state which in some (but not all) cases lies below the usual zero-point energy.

This flux is identified with the bond valence, and Gauss' law with the valence-sum rule, providing a secure theoretical foundation for the bond-valence model. The localization of the Coulomb field provides an unambiguous definition of coordination number and our calculations show that, in addition to the expected primary coordination sphere, there are a number of weak bonds between cations and the anions in the second coordination sphere.

We apply it to selections from different classes of materials, including alkali metals, semiconductors, wide band gap insulators, transition metals, transition metal oxides, magnetic insulators, and rare earth compounds. Apart from some mild exceptions, the properties are very well described, particularly in weakly correlated cases. Self-consistency dramatically improves agreement with experiment, and is sometimes essential. Discrepancies with experiment are systematic, and can be explained in terms of approximations made.",

Intuition suggests that the HF kinetic energy should not exceed the exact kinetic energy; but no proof of this conjecture exists, despite a near century of development. Beginning from a generalized virial theorem derived from scaling considerations, we derive a general expression for the kinetic energy difference that applies to all systems. For any atom or ion, this trivially reduces to the well-known result that the total energy is the negative of the kinetic energy and, since correlation energies are never positive, proves the conjecture in this case. Similar considerations apply to molecules at their equilibrium bond lengths. We use highly precise calculations on Hooke's atom (two electrons in a parabolic well) to test the conjecture in a nontrivial case and to parameterize the difference between density functional and HF quantities, but find no violations of the conjecture.",

In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the electron pair). The octet rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i.e., plausible alternative Lewis structures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for example in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett's double quartet theory.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

As such, we focus herein on the main point of contention, the 4th bond of C2, and discuss the main views. We present new data and an overview of the nature of the 4th bond--its proposed antiferromagnetically coupled nature, its strength, and a derivation of its bond energy from experimentally based thermochemical data. We address the bond-order conundrum of C2 arising from generalized VB (GVB) calculations by comparing it to HC≡CH, and showing that the two molecules behave very similarly, and C2 is in no way an exception. We analyse the root cause of the deviation of C2 from the Badger Rule, and demonstrate that the reason for the smaller force constant (FC) of C2 relative to HC≡CH has nothing to do with the bond energies, or with the number of bonds in the two molecules. The FC is determined primarily by the bond length, which is set by the balance between the bond length preferences of the σ- versus π-bonds in the two molecules. This interplay in the case of C2 clearly shows the fingerprints of the 4th bond. Our discussion resolves the points of contention and shows that the arguments used to dismiss the quadruple bond nature of C2 are not well founded.",

It then focuses on selected capabilities that might not be present in the majority of electronic structure packages either among planewave codes or, in general, treatment of strongly correlated materials using DMFT; materials under finite electric fields; properties at nuclei (electric field gradient, Mössbauer shifts, and orbital magnetization); positron annihilation; Raman intensities and electro-optic effect; and DFPT calculations of response to strain perturbation (elastic constants and piezoelectricity), spatial dispersion (flexoelectricity), electronic mobility, temperature dependence of the gap, and spin-magnetic-field perturbation. The abinit DFPT implementation is very general, including systems with van der Waals interaction or with noncollinear magnetism. Community projects are also described: generation of pseudopotential and PAW datasets, high-throughput calculations (databases of phonon band structure, second-harmonic generation, and GW computations of bandgaps), and the library libpaw. abinit has strong links with many other software projects that are briefly mentioned.",

These interactions are described well at the level of quantum mechanics (QM) but not so well for the various models used in force field simulations of these systems. We propose and validate a new general methodology, denoted PQEq, to predict rapidly and dynamically the atomic charges and polarization underlying the electrostatic interactions. Here the polarization is described using an atomic sized Gaussian shaped electron density that can polarize away from the core in response to internal and external electric fields, while at the same time adjusting the charge on each core (described as a Gaussian function) so as to achieve a constant chemical potential across all atoms of the system. The parameters for PQEq are derived from experimental atomic properties of all elements up to Nobelium (atomic no. = 102). We validate PQEq by comparing to QM interaction energy as probe dipoles are brought along various directions up to 30 molecules containing H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Cl atoms. We find that PQEq predicts interaction energies in excellent agreement with QM, much better than other common charge models such as obtained from QM using Mulliken or ESP charges and those from standard force fields (OPLS and AMBER). Since PQEq increases the accuracy of electrostatic interactions and the response to external electric fields, we expect that PQEq will be useful for a large range of applications including ligand docking to proteins, catalytic reactions, electrocatalysis, ferroelectrics, and growth of ceramics and films, where it could be incorporated into standard force fields as OPLS, AMBER, CHARMM, Dreiding, ReaxFF, and UFF.",

The origin of this notion has been the identification of the Lagrange multiplier <iμ</i = ∂<iE</i/∂<iN</i in the Euler-Lagrange variational equation for the ground state density as the chemical potential of the electrons. We first discuss why the Lagrange multiplier in this case is an arbitrary constant and therefore cannot be a physical characteristic of an atom or molecule. The switching of the energy derivative (\"chemical potential\") from -<iI</i to -<iA</i when the electron number crosses the integer, called integer discontinuity or derivative discontinuity, is not physical but only occurs when the nonphysical noninteger electron systems and the corresponding energy and derivative ∂<iE</i/∂<iN</i are chosen in a specific discontinuous way. The question is discussed whether in fact the thermodynamical concept of a chemical potential can be defined for the electrons in such few-electron systems as atoms and molecules. The conclusion is that such systems lack important characteristics of thermodynamic systems and do not afford the definition of a chemical potential. They also cannot be considered as analogues of the open systems of thermodynamics that can exchange particles with an environment (a particle bath or other members of a Gibbsian ensemble).

The air flow and negative pressure of the system will depend on the particular design of each model. This experimental study analyzes the specifications and performance of the pleural drainage systems currently on the market. Thirteen models of pleural drainage systems connected to wall suction were examined. The models were classified into the following three groups: dry systems; wet systems; and single-chamber systems. We determined the ambient air flow and the negative pressure generated according to the suction level. The components of each model are also described. Under normal conditions, dry (except for the Sentinel Seal; Sherwood Medical; Tullamore, Ireland), wet, and single-chamber systems reach similar air flow rates (17 to 30, 24 to 27, and 22 to 28 L/min, respectively). With higher wall suction levels, wet systems increase the air flow (26 to 49 L/min) but the negative pressure becomes unstable because of the water loss phenomenon, dry systems increase the air flow (29 to 50 L/min) without modifying the regulator pressure, and single-chamber systems also raise the air flow (45 to 51 L/min) but increase the negative pressure. When there is an air leak, dry systems (except for the Sentinel Seal) lose less negative pressure than the other systems. The functioning of these systems can be optimized only by applying a suitable wall suction level adjusted to each case. Although the three types of systems are capable of evacuating adequate air flow rates, the negative pressure and the capacity to maintain it in the presence of an air leak are different in each system. Being fitted with valves and not water compartments makes the dry systems the safest and the ideal for use when the patient has to be moved.",

KEML studies were carried out in a large temperature range (398-567) K by using effusion orifices with 0.3, 1, and 3 mm diameters. The vapor pressures so measured revealed no kinetically hindered vaporization effects and provided second-law vaporization enthalpies at the mean experimental temperatures in close agreement with literature. By exploiting the large temperature range covered, the heat capacity change associated with vaporization was estimated, resulting in a value of -66.8 J K(-1) mol(-1), much lower than that predicted from calorimetric measurements on the liquid phase and theoretical calculations on the gas phase. The conversion of the high temperature vaporization enthalpy to 298 K was discussed and the value Δ(l)(g)H(m)(298 K) = (128.6 ± 1.3) kJ mol(-1) assessed on the basis of data from literature and present work.

Recent studies have pointed to a conceptual understanding of the pleural space that is different from the one advocated some 30 years ago in this journal. The fundamental concept is that pleural surface pressure, the result of the opposing recoils of the lung and chest wall, is the major determinant of the pressure in the pleural liquid. Pleural liquid is not in hydrostatic equilibrium because the vertical gradient in pleural liquid pressure, determined by the vertical gradient in pleural surface pressure, does not equal the hydrostatic gradient. As a result, a viscous flow of pleural liquid occurs in the pleural space. Ventilatory and cardiogenic motions serve to redistribute pleural liquid and minimize contact between the pleural surfaces. Pleural liquid is a microvascular filtrate from parietal pleural capillaries in the chest wall. Homeostasis in pleural liquid volume is achieved by an adjustment of the pleural liquid thickness to the filtration rate that is matched by an outflow via lymphatic stomata.",

A standard viscometer was used to measure the viscosities of water, blood, pseudocyst fluid, purulent material, and purulent material with admixed urokinase. For each fluid, Poiseuille's law was used to calculate the kinematic viscosity, from which theoretical drainage times through seven different sizes of catheters were calculated. These theoretical times were compared with the actual measured values to verify that flow was according to Poiseuille's law. The calculated kinematic viscosities (in 10(-6) stokes) were as follows: water, 0.695 +/- 0.006; pseudocyst fluid, 2.185 +/- 0.008; blood, 3.001 +/- 0.049; abscess fluid without urokinase, 5.729 +/- 0.064; and abscess fluid with urokinase, 4.416 +/- 0.070. The viscosity of abscess fluid decreased by 23% with the addition of urokinase. Drainage time was considerably shorter with larger catheters.

Treatment of the mesothelial cells with a TGF-beta dose ranging from 0.1 to 10 ng/ml for 96 hr induced distinct morphologic changes in the cells. Each cell increased in size as did the volume of the intercellular spaces. TGF-beta also significantly inhibited the growth of mesothelial cells at a concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 ng/ml. This growth inhibition was blocked completely by the addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody. Treatment of the mesothelial cells with 2.0 ng/ml TGF-beta significantly increased the permeability of a mesothelial cell monolayer as assessed by a FITC-albumin permeability assay. In our clinical analysis using 10 effusion samples obtained from patients with various types of carcinoma cells, considerable level of TGF-beta could be detected by ELISA, ranged from 0.90 to 8.75 ng/ml. Our data suggest that TGF-beta plays an important role in the formation of malignant effusions through structural and functional damage to the mesothelial cells.

A majority of the existing bubble-driven micropumps employs boiling despite the unfavorable scaling of energy consumption for miniaturization because the vapor bubbles can be easily removed by condensation. Other gas generation methods are rarely suitable for micropumping applications because it is difficult to remove the gas bubbles promptly from a pump loop. In order to eradicate this limitation, the rapid removal of insoluble gas bubbles without liquid leakage is achieved with hydrophobic nanopores, allowing the use of virtually any kind of bubbles. In this paper, electrolysis and gas injection are demonstrated as two distinctively different gas sources. The proposed mechanism is first proved by circulating water in a looped microchannel. Using H(2) and O(2) gas bubbles continuously generated by electrolysis, a prototype device with a looped channel shows a volumetric flow rate of 4.5-13.5 nL s(-1) with a direct current (DC) power input of 2-85 mW. A similar device with an open-ended microchannel gives a maximum flow rate of approximately 65 nL s(-1) and a maximum pressure head of approximately 195 Pa with 14 mW input. The electrolytic-bubble-driven micropump operates with a 10-100 times higher power efficiency than its thermal-bubble-driven counterparts and exhibits better controllability. The pumping mechanism is then implemented by injecting nitrogen gas bubbles to demonstrate the flexibility of bubble sources, which would allow one to choose them for specific needs (e.g., energy efficiency, thermal sensitivity, biocompatibility, and adjustable flow rate), making the proposed mechanism attractive for many applications including micro total analysis systems (microTAS) and micro fuel cells.",

A comparison with other cell types.\nThe osmolarity of bodily fluids is strictly controlled so that most cells do not experience changes in osmotic pressure under normal conditions, but osmotic changes can occur in pathological states such as ischemia, septic shock, and diabetic coma. The primary effect of a change in osmolarity is to acutely alter cell volume. If the osmolarity around a cell is decreased, the cell swells, and if increased, it shrinks. In order to tolerate changes in osmolarity, cells have evolved volume regulatory mechanisms activated by osmotic challenge to normalise cell volume and maintain normal function. In the heart, osmotic stress is encountered during a period of myocardial ischemia when metabolites such as lactate accumulate intracellularly and to a certain degree extracellularly, and cause cell swelling. This swelling may be exacerbated further on reperfusion when the hyperosmotic extracellular milieu is replaced by normosmotic blood. In this review, we describe the theory and mechanisms of volume regulation, and draw on findings in extracardiac tissues, such as kidney, whose responses to osmotic change are well characterised. We then describe cell volume regulation in the heart, with particular emphasis on the effect of myocardial ischemia. Finally, we describe the consequences of osmotic cell swelling for the cell and for the heart, and discuss the implications for antiarrhythmic drug efficacy. Using computer modelling, we have summated the changes induced by cell swelling, and predict that swelling will shorten the action potential.

At the venous ends, however, the position is reversed. The fluids are, therefore, reabsorbed. Inthis paper it is argued that this is not a true picture of what must really happen. For, having once become equal there is no reason why the pressures should ever cease to be so. Instead, fluids are absorbed at exactly that rate which just keeps pace with falling hydraulic pressure, as the blood proceeds along the capillary loop. Moreover, the forces are indeed shown to be equal at the extreme venous ends of the capillaries. It is further argued that, though this mechanism might operate anywhere in the horizontal position, it could not possibly work in the feet of a standing man. For here the hydraulic blood pressure everywhere greatly exceeds the osmotic pressure of plasma proteins. An addition to Starling's hypothesis is therefore suggested to adapt it to dependent tissues.

The convective interstitial fluid flow within and around chondrocytes is poorly understood. This theoretical study demonstrates that the incorporation of a semi-permeable membrane when modeling the chondrocyte leads to the following findings: under mechanical loading of an isolated chondrocyte the intracellular fluid pressure is on the order of tens of Pascals and the transmembrane fluid outflow, on the order of picometers per second, takes several days to subside; consequently, the chondrocyte behaves practically as an incompressible solid whenever the loading duration is on the order of minutes or hours. When embedded in its extracellular matrix (ECM), the chondrocyte response is substantially different. Mechanical loading of the tissue leads to a fluid pressure difference between intracellular and extracellular compartments on the order of tens of kilopascals and the transmembrane outflow, on the order of a nanometer per second, subsides in about 1 h. The volume of the chondrocyte decreases concomitantly with that of the ECM. The interstitial fluid flow in the extracellular matrix is directed around the cell, with peak values on the order of tens of nanometers per second. The viscous fluid shear stress acting on the cell surface is several orders of magnitude smaller than the solid matrix shear stresses resulting from the ECM deformation. These results provide new insight toward our understanding of water transport in chondrocytes.",

Diffusion is commonly considered the predominant mechanism for mass transport into a recirculating flow region. While this may be true for steady flows, one must also consider the possibility of convective fluid exchange when the outer (free stream) flow is transient. In the case of an open cavity, convective exchange occurs via the formation of lobes at the downstream attachment point of the separating streamline. Previous studies revealed the effect of forcing amplitude and frequency on material transport rates into a square cavity (Horner in J Fluid Mech 452:199-229, 2002). This paper summarizes the effect of cavity aspect ratio on exchange rates. The transport process is characterized using both computational fluid dynamics modeling and dye-advection experiments. Lagrangian analysis of the computed flow field reveals the existence of turnstile lobe transport for this class of flows. Experiments show that material exchange rates do not vary linearly as a function of the cavity aspect ratio (A = W/H). Rather, optima are predicted for A ≈ 2 and A ≈ 2.73, with a minimum occurring at A ≈ 2.5. The minimum occurs at the point where the cavity flow structure bifurcates from a single recirculating flow cell into two corner eddies. These results have significant implications for mass transport environments where the geometry of the flow domain evolves with time, such as coronary stents and growing aneurysms. Indeed, device designers may be able to take advantage of the turnstile-lobe transport mechanism to tailor deposition rates near newly implanted medical devices.",

Osmotic responses of V-79W Chinese hamster fibroblast cells were measured in hypertonic solutions at various temperatures and the membrane hydraulic conductivity was determined.

A theoretical model describing equilibrium between buoyancy, hydrostatic forces, and capillary forces is proposed. The capillary equilibrium model described depends on control of pleural fluid volume and protein content, powered by an active pleural pump. The interaction between buoyancy forces, hydrostatic pressure and capillary pressure was calculated, and values for pleural thickness and pressure were determined using values for surface tension, contact angle, pleural fluid and lung densities found in the literature. Modelling can explain the issue of the differing hydrostatic vertical pleural pressure gradient at the lobar margins for buoyancy forces between the pleural fluid and the lung floating in the pleural fluid according to Archimedes' hydrostatic paradox. The capillary equilibrium model satisfies all salient requirements for a pleural pressure model, with negative pressures maximal at the apex, equal and opposite forces in the lung and chest wall, and circulatory pump action. This model predicts that pleural effusions cannot occur in emphysema unless concomitant heart failure increases lung density. This model also explains how the non-confluence of the lung with the chest wall (e.g., lobar margins) makes the pleural pressure more negative, and why pleural pressures would be higher after an upper lobectomy compared to a lower lobectomy. Pathological changes in pleural fluid composition and lung density alter the equilibrium between capillarity and buoyancy hydrostatic pressure to promote pleural effusion formation.",

The high sensitivity of the apparatus combined with a suitable calibration procedure allows very accurate heat capacity measurements under pressure to be made.

At constant flow, the pressure gradient generated in the tumour by the infusion of fluid (Evans blue-albumin in saline) was measured as a function of the radial position with micropipettes connected to a servo-null system.

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

The Lorentz law is the universal expression of the force exerted by electromagnetic fields on a volume containing a distribution of electrical charges and currents. If electric and magnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are traditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and magnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current densities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current densities, respectively. In this way, Maxwell's macroscopic equations are reduced to his microscopic equations, and the Lorentz law is expected to provide a precise expression of the electromagnetic force density on material bodies at all points in space and time. This Letter presents incontrovertible theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity. We argue that the Lorentz law must be abandoned in favor of a more general expression of the electromagnetic force density, such as the one discovered by Einstein and Laub in 1908.

Actually, the best estimate of fundamental constant values is given by a least-squares adjustment, carried out under the auspices of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) Task Group on Fundamental Constants. This adjustment provides a significant measure of the correctness and overall consistency of the basic theories and experimental methods of physics using the values of the constants obtained from widely differing experiments. The physical theories that underlie this adjustment are assumed to be valid, such as quantum electrodynamics (QED). Testing QED, one of the most precise theories is the aim of many accurate experiments. The calculations and the corresponding experiments can be carried out either on a boundless system, such as the electron magnetic moment anomaly, or on a bound system, such as atomic hydrogen. The value of fundamental constants can be deduced from the comparison of theory and experiment. For example, using QED calculations, the value of the fine structure constant given by the CODATA is mainly inferred from the measurement of the electron magnetic moment anomaly carried out by Gabrielse's group. (Hanneke et al. 2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 120801) The value of the Rydberg constant is known from two-photon spectroscopy of hydrogen combined with accurate theoretical quantities. The Rydberg constant, determined by the comparison of theory and experiment using atomic hydrogen, is known with a relative uncertainty of 6.6×10(-12). It is one of the most accurate fundamental constants to date. A careful analysis shows that knowledge of the electrical size of the proton is nowadays a limitation in this comparison. The aim of muonic hydrogen spectroscopy was to obtain an accurate value of the proton charge radius. However, the value deduced from this experiment contradicts other less accurate determinations. This problem is known as the proton radius puzzle. This new determination of the proton radius may affect the value of the Rydberg constant . This constant is related to many fundamental constants; in particular, links the two possible ways proposed for the redefinition of the kilogram, the Avogadro constant N(A) and the Planck constant h. However, the current relative uncertainty on the experimental determinations of N(A) or h is three orders of magnitude larger than the 'possible' shift of the Rydberg constant, which may be shown by the new value of the size of the proton radius determined from muonic hydrogen. The proton radius puzzle will not interfere in the redefinition of the kilogram. After a short introduction to the properties of the proton, we will describe the muonic hydrogen experiment. There is intense theoretical activity as a result of our observation. A brief summary of possible theoretical explanations at the date of writing of the paper will be given. The contribution of the proton radius puzzle to the redefinition of SI-based units will then be examined.",

The reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear theory.",

We find two different regimes: one where the Mandelstam-Tamm limit constrains the evolution at all times, and a second where a crossover to the Margolus-Levitin limit occurs at longer times.

But despite its fundamental role, it is typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit definition. Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities by way of the Born rule. At present, the wavefunction is determined through tomographic methods, which estimate the wavefunction most consistent with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first measurement is performed in a gentle way through weak measurement, so as not to invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that the concept is universal, being applicable to other degrees of freedom of the photon, such as polarization or frequency, and to other quantum systems--for example, electron spins, SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) and trapped ions. Consequently, this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in terms of a specific set of experimental operations.

Analysis of these assumptions shows that they are not always justified.

Consequently, as it is, the kT problem may not be an argument against the existence of non thermal magnetobiological effects.

Let us note, however, that all the structures that have been discussed above are collinear structures: on the average (in time) all the atomic magnets pointing in one or the opposite direction are parallel to a single direction. However, the local molecular field method can also be extended to noncollinear structures such as that of helimagnetism, which Yoshimori and Villain discovered independently in an absolutely unexpected manner; one can thus interpret phenomena in a remarkably simple and concrete manner. Nevertheless, the method can hardly be recommended for more complex structures such as the umbrella structure, which requires the decomposition of the principal crystal lattice into a large number of sublattices. Indeed, under these conditions an atom belonging to a given sublattice has only a very small number of neighbors (one or two) in each of the other sublattices, and the molecular field method, which consists in replacing the instantaneous action of an atom by that of an average atom, will be more likely to yield a correct result, the larger the number of atoms to which it is applied. Its correctness probably also increases as the atomic spin becomes larger. Independently of this problem, the method applied to a large number of sublattices completely loses its chief advantage, simplicity. The method also involves more insidious traps. If a judicious choice of parameters is made, the method can lead one to calculate curves and thermal variations of the spontaneous magnetization or paramagnetic susceptibility that coincide remarkably well with the experimental results, for example, to within a few thousandths. Under these conditions, one could expect that the elementary interaction energies deduced from these parameters would correspond to the actual values with the same accuracy. This is not so; errors of 10 to 20 percent and even greater are frequently made in this manner. A certain amount of caution thus becomes imperative. On the other hand, recourse to the local molecular field seems indispensable since more rigorous methods lead to insurmountable complications. Consider for example that the rigorous solution is not yet known for the simplest case, that of a simple cubic lattice with identical atoms of spin 1/2, and interactions reduced to those present between nearest-neighbor atoms. How then should one treat the case of garnets with 160 atoms in the unit cell, spins up to 5/2, and at least six different coupling constants? One must therefore be lenient toward the imperfections of the molecular field methods, considering the simplicity with which the successes recalled in the first few lines of these conclusions were obtained.",

Thus, when an HMF is applied to a cell, the concentration-gradient magnetic forces act on paramagnetic or diamagnetic species and can either assist or oppose large particle movement through the cytoplasm. We demonstrate possibilities for changing the machinery in living cells with HMFs and predict two new mechanisms for modulating cellular functions with HMFs via (i) changes in the membrane potential and (ii) magnetically assisted intracellular diffusiophoresis of large proteins. By deriving a generalized form for the Nernst equation, we find that an HMF can change the membrane potential of the cell and thus have a significant impact on the properties and biological functionality of cells.

The users of NMR wanted higher magnetic fields, and the key issue for NMR manufacturers became how to increase the magnetic field strength. With a permanent magnet, the maximum magnetic field is 90 MHz (2.11 Tesla), and the limit with an electromagnet is 100 MHz (2.4 Tesla). This limitation was removed with the advent of superconducting magnets (SCM). Furthermore, in addition to the Continuous Wave method, which only allowed observation of 1H nuclei, Pulse Fourier Transform (FT) methods were developed, enabling observation and measurement of 13C and other nuclei. The development of SCM and FT was epoch-making for NMR, and the field has flourished since then. Of course, there has been technical innovation that could not be accomplished by the NMR manufacturers alone, such as the development of superconducting materials and winding techniques for SCM, and new algorithm development and the acceleration of computing speeds for FT.

TetraMag creates stable and homogeneous magnetic fields at the sample position with a resolution of 0.02 mT tunable between -570 mT and +570 mT. The field direction is continuously rotatable between 0° and 360° within the sample plane, while the field strength is maintained. A simplified mathematical description of TetraMag is developed leading to magnetic field calculations which are in good agreement with the experimental results. This versatile device avoids electrical energy dissipation, cooling mechanisms, and hysteresis effects known from classical electromagnets. It is ultrahigh vacuum compatible and it offers a completely free optical path over 180° for magneto-optical experiments. It is suitable for scattering experiments with synchrotron radiation and neutrons and may be employed in a large class of magnetization experiments.",

So, the next question was \"how and why?\" Further changes were seen using these and then other bacterial and eukaryotic cells in respiration, in ATP, in the protein replication chain, and so forth. Changes occurred even in cell extracts that lacked an intact plasma membrane. Nerve cells showed changes in leakage of neurotransmitters and in neurite outgrowth from excised ganglia.

Without the colloidal and Brownian forces being included, the velocity of small particles is found to be approximately equal to the inverse of the drag force correction function used in this study as the particle approaches the near-wall region. Colloidal force is added to the particle equation of motion as the particle moves a distance comparable to its size. It is found that the particle might become suspended above or deposited onto the wall, depending on the Hamaker constant, the surface potentials of the particle and wall, and the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). For strong EDL repulsive force and weaker van der Waals (VDW) attractive force, the particle will become suspended above the wall at a distance at which the particle velocity is zero. This location is referred to as the equilibrium distance. The equilibrium distance is found to increase with increased in EDL thickness when a repulsive force barrier appears in the colloidal force interaction. For the weak EDL repulsive force and strong VDW attractive force case, the particle can become deposited onto the wall without the Brownian motion effect.

It is shown that particle tracking and subsequent statistical analysis is essential to ascertain if small particles actually propel themselves, or if they are propelled by another process. Specifically we find that it is necessary to calculate the mean-squared displacement of particles at both short and long time intervals, to show that the direction of propulsion changes coincident with rotation of the particle by Brownian motion, as this allows nanopropulsion to be differentiated from Brownian motion, convection and sedimentation.

This leads to motion which appears very similar to nanopropulsion and cannot be differentiated using particle tracking and therefore find that carefully designed control experiments must be performed.

If electric and magnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are traditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and magnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current densities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current densities, respectively. In this way, Maxwell's macroscopic equations are reduced to his microscopic equations, and the Lorentz law is expected to provide a precise expression of the electromagnetic force density on material bodies at all points in space and time. This Letter presents incontrovertible theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity. We argue that the Lorentz law must be abandoned in favor of a more general expression of the electromagnetic force density, such as the one discovered by Einstein and Laub in 1908.

First, the individual particles making up a granular material are typically large so that thermal energy is irrelevant compared to gravitational energy. Consequently, concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics are often not applicable. Second, the interactions between particles are frictional and can be mobilized to different degrees depending on the preparation history, giving rise to memory effects, i.e., a static pile will remember how it was formed. Third, when particles collide they do so inelastically so that a \"gas\" of particles will slow down and come to rest in clumps.

However, its use has also resulted in some puzzling findings including an extremely negative surface tension between phase separated active particles. Here, we demonstrate that this contradiction stems from the fact that the swim pressure is not a true pressure. At a boundary or interface, the reduction in particle swimming generates a net active force density-an entirely self-generated body force. The pressure at the boundary, which was previously identified as the swim pressure, is in fact an elevated (relative to the bulk) value of the traditional particle pressure that is generated by this interfacial force density. Recognizing this unique mechanism for stress generation allows us to define a much more physically plausible surface tension. We clarify the utility of the swim pressure as an \"equivalent pressure\" (analogous to those defined from electrostatic and gravitational body forces) and the conditions in which this concept can be appropriately applied.",

Newton's strategy depends on distinguishing two quantities of matter, which I call 'active' and 'passive', by how they are measured. These measurement procedures frame conditions on the additivity of each quantity so measured. While Newton has direct evidence for the additivity of passive quantity of matter, he does not for that of the active quantity. Instead, he tries to infer the latter from the former via conceptual analyses of the third law of motion grounded largely on analogies to magnetic attractions.

Without the colloidal and Brownian forces being included, the velocity of small particles is found to be approximately equal to the inverse of the drag force correction function used in this study as the particle approaches the near-wall region. Colloidal force is added to the particle equation of motion as the particle moves a distance comparable to its size. It is found that the particle might become suspended above or deposited onto the wall, depending on the Hamaker constant, the surface potentials of the particle and wall, and the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). For strong EDL repulsive force and weaker van der Waals (VDW) attractive force, the particle will become suspended above the wall at a distance at which the particle velocity is zero. This location is referred to as the equilibrium distance. The equilibrium distance is found to increase with increased in EDL thickness when a repulsive force barrier appears in the colloidal force interaction. For the weak EDL repulsive force and strong VDW attractive force case, the particle can become deposited onto the wall without the Brownian motion effect.

Specifically we find that it is necessary to calculate the mean-squared displacement of particles at both short and long time intervals, to show that the direction of propulsion changes coincident with rotation of the particle by Brownian motion, as this allows nanopropulsion to be differentiated from Brownian motion, convection and sedimentation. We also find that bacteria can attach themselves to particles and cause them to be propelled. This leads to motion which appears very similar to nanopropulsion and cannot be differentiated using particle tracking and therefore find that carefully designed control experiments must be performed.

If electric and magnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are traditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and magnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current densities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current densities, respectively. In this way, Maxwell's macroscopic equations are reduced to his microscopic equations, and the Lorentz law is expected to provide a precise expression of the electromagnetic force density on material bodies at all points in space and time. This Letter presents incontrovertible theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity. We argue that the Lorentz law must be abandoned in favor of a more general expression of the electromagnetic force density, such as the one discovered by Einstein and Laub in 1908.

First, the individual particles making up a granular material are typically large so that thermal energy is irrelevant compared to gravitational energy. Consequently, concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics are often not applicable. Second, the interactions between particles are frictional and can be mobilized to different degrees depending on the preparation history, giving rise to memory effects, i.e., a static pile will remember how it was formed. Third, when particles collide they do so inelastically so that a \"gas\" of particles will slow down and come to rest in clumps.

A continuum description is possible when variations occur on scales larger than the run length of the active particles and gives a Boltzmann-like distribution from a balance of the swim force and the swim pressure. Active particles may also display 'action at a distance' and accumulate adjacent to (or be depleted from) a boundary without any external forces. In the momentum balance for the suspension - the mixture of active particles plus fluid - only external body forces appear. ",

However, its use has also resulted in some puzzling findings including an extremely negative surface tension between phase separated active particles. Here, we demonstrate that this contradiction stems from the fact that the swim pressure is not a true pressure. At a boundary or interface, the reduction in particle swimming generates a net active force density-an entirely self-generated body force. The pressure at the boundary, which was previously identified as the swim pressure, is in fact an elevated (relative to the bulk) value of the traditional particle pressure that is generated by this interfacial force density. Recognizing this unique mechanism for stress generation allows us to define a much more physically plausible surface tension. We clarify the utility of the swim pressure as an \"equivalent pressure\" (analogous to those defined from electrostatic and gravitational body forces) and the conditions in which this concept can be appropriately applied.",

These measurement procedures frame conditions on the additivity of each quantity so measured. While Newton has direct evidence for the additivity of passive quantity of matter, he does not for that of the active quantity.

IRAS has demonstrated the power of infrared astronomy from space. Already, from a brief look at a miniscule fraction of the data available, we have learned much about the solar system, about nearby stars, about the Galaxy as a whole and about distant extragalactic systems. Comets are much dustier than previously thought. Solid particles, presumably the remnants of the star-formation process, orbit around Vega and other stars and may provide the raw material for planetary systems. Emission from cool interstellar material has been traced throughout the Galaxy all the way to the galactic poles. Both the clumpiness and breadth of the distribution of this material were previously unsuspected. The far-infrared sky away from the galactic plane has been found to be dominated by spiral galaxies, some of which emit more than 50 percent and as much as 98 percent of their energy in the infrared-an exciting and surprising revelation.

The major new accomplishments are in the radio and x-ray bands, and in the associated study of cosmic ray electrons. Synchrotron radiation is known to be a mechanism for radio signals; discrete x-ray sources have been found; the intensity and the charge ratio of galactic electrons are under study. Experimental results at energies above the x-ray region are less firm. The sun surely emits gamma rays at energies of about 1 Mev during flare activity, and instruments in deep space have probably recorded the general galactic glow of similar photons. Upper limits for fluxes have been set at 100 Mev and beyond. To some extent the physical processes which give rise to the extraterrestrial radiation are familiar to workers in the terrestrial laboratory. Synchrotron radiation is an example; the bremsstrahlung of electrons, the production of neutral pions in p-p collisions, and the annihilation of electron and nucleon pairs are others. Some proposed mechanisms are, and perhaps always will be, purely speculative in the sense that they are not directly observable in the laboratory. The inverse Compton effect, possibly one of the sources of a metagalactic sky glow of hard photons, is in this class. There is little chance that spontaneous creation of matter, even if it occurs in nature, can be observed on a terrestrial scale. And the extreme physical conditions proposed for neutron stars are beyond our ability to reproduce. Only through interpretation of astronomical data can we test the validity of these ideas.

An analysis of the irradiance spectra, reaching the shallow ocean depths, revealed that the available radiation could have determined the bandwidth of the precursor to vision systems, including human vision. We used the radiative transfer model to test the existing hypotheses on human vision. We argue that, once on the surface, the human photopic (daytime) and scotopic (night-time) vision followed different evolutionary directions, maximum total energy, and optimum information, respectively. Our analysis also suggests that solar radiation reflected from the moon had little or no influence on the evolution of scotopic vision.

We have developed a method to quantitatively attribute the causes for such differences between sites by analysis of spectra. We conclude that these large differences are caused mainly by differences in total ozone, cloudiness, aerosol loading and Sun-Earth separation. The relative contribution of clouds varies from year to year and it is site dependent. Averaged over several years we find a strong latitudinal gradient of the cloud impact within Europe, with much less cloud attenuation in southern Europe. Due to the differences in total ozone and aerosol loading, the UV-B levels are generally lower in Europe compared to New Zealand. It is likely that inter-hemispheric differences will change in coming decades due to a combination of changes in ozone concentrations, air pollution and cloudiness as a result of climate change. However, since the future evolution of these major parameters is highly uncertain, the magnitude and even the sign of such changes are not known yet.",

The comparisons of the derived ATMOS solar transmittance spectrum with the two solar irradiance curves show that he curve derived by Wehrli contains many absorption features in the 2.0-2.5-µm region that are not of solar origin, whereas the curve obtained by Neckel and Labs is completely devoid of weak solar absorption features that should be there. An Earth atmospheric oxygen band at 1.268 µm and a water-vapor band near 0.94 µm are likely present in the curve obtained by Wehrli. It is shown that the solar irradiance measurement errors in some narrow spectral intervals can be as large as 20%.

Terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones of stars-where planetary surface conditions are compatible with the presence of liquid water-are of enormous interest because they might have global environments similar to Earth's and even harbour life. The light scattered by such a planet will vary in intensity and colour as the planet rotates; the resulting light curve will contain information about the planet's surface and atmospheric properties.

For extrasolar planets similar to Earth, we expect daily flux variations of up to hundreds of per cent, depending sensitively on ice and cloud cover as well as seasonal variations. This suggests that the meteorological variability, composition of the surface (for example, ocean versus land fraction) and rotation period of an Earth-like planet could be derived from photometric observations.

However, it is often difficult to obtain correct optical indices due to the inherent instrumental functions. This paper proposes a simple practical method for correction of KKT with two parameters, which include all the effects of the instrumental function. In order to obtain the parameters of the instrumental function, absorption ratios of charge transfer to solvent (CTTS) transitions of aqueous iodide ions observed at 195 nm and 230 nm were used as a standard. The absorption indices calculated from the ATR spectra with the parameters correspond reasonably well to those given by the transmittance spectra not only in the UV region but also in the far-ultraviolet (FUV, 120-200 nm) region. By applying the corrected KKT to the ATR-FUV spectra of aqueous potassium halide solutions in the range of 0-2 M, correct features of the absorption spectra of KCl and KBr, whose CTTS bands are thought to be observed in FUV region, were confirmed.

The biological effects of UV radiation vary enormously with wavelength and for this reason the UV spectrum is further subdivided into three regions: UVA, UVB, and UVC. Quantities of UV radiation are expressed using radiometric terminology. A particularly important term in clinical photobiology is the standard erythema dose (SED), which is a measure of the erythemal effectiveness of a UV exposure. UV radiation is produced either by heating a body to an incandescent temperature, as is the case with solar UV, or by passing an electric current through a gas, usually vaporized mercury. The latter process is the mechanism whereby UV radiation is produced artificially. Both the quality (spectrum) and quantity (intensity) of terrestrial UV radiation vary with factors including the elevation of the sun above the horizon and absorption and scattering by molecules in the atmosphere, notably ozone, and by clouds. For many experimental studies in photobiology it is simply not practicable to use natural sunlight and so artificial sources of UV radiation designed to simulate the UV component of sunlight are employed; these are based on either optically filtered xenon arc lamps or fluorescent lamps. The complete way to characterize an UV source is by spectroradiometry, although for most practical purposes a detector optically filtered to respond to a limited portion of the UV spectrum normally suffices.",

Using this laboratory source, calibrated optically thin vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectra have been obtained and synthetic spectral models developed for important molecular band systems of H(2) and N(2) and the n(1)P(0) Itydberg series of He. The model spectrum from H(2) represents an extension of the molecular branching ratio technique to include spectral line intensities from more than one electronic upper state. The accuracy of the model fit to the VUV spectra of H(2) and N(2) is sufficient to predict the relative spectral intensity of the electron impact source and to serve as a primary calibration standard for VUV instrumentation in the 80-230-nm wavelength range. The model is applicable to VUV instrumentation with full width at half-maximum &gt;/= 0.4 nm. The present accuracy is 10% in the far ultraviolet (120-230 nm), 10% in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) (90-120 nm), and 20% in the EUV (80-90 nm).

To obtain complete coverage of IR wavelengths relevant to the unidentified infrared bands (UIRs), UV laser-induced desorption was used to generate gas-phase highly excited PAHs. Lorentzian band shapes were convoluted with the monochromator-slit function in order to determine the widths of PAH emission bands under astrophysically relevant conditions.

These parameters are grouped according to the functional groups mostly involved in the vibration, and mean bandwidths are obtained. These bandwidths are larger than the widths of the corresponding UIR bands.

The data determine the relative partial cross-sections for the photoionization of ethyl radicals to form C2H5+, C2H4+, and C2H3+ at 12.1 and 13.8 eV. The data also determine the internal energy distribution of the ethyl radical prior to photoionization, so we can assess the internal energy dependence of the photoionization cross-sections. The results show that the C2H4++H and C2H3++H2 dissociative photoionization cross-sections strongly depend on the photoionization energy. Calibrating the ethyl radical partial photoionization cross-sections relative to the bandwidth-averaged photoionization cross-section of Cl atoms near 13.8 eV allows us to use these data in conjunction with literature estimates of the Cl atom photoionization cross-sections to put the present bandwidth-averaged cross-sections on an absolute scale. The resulting bandwidth-averaged cross-section for the photoionization of ethyl radicals to C2H5+ near 13.8 eV is 8+/-2 Mb. Comparison of our 12.1 eV data with high-resolution ethyl radical photoionization spectra allows us to roughly put the high-resolution spectrum on the same absolute scale. Thus, one obtains the photoionization cross-section of ethyl radicals to C2H5+ from threshold to 12.1 eV.

Following a short ( approximately 1 s) induction period, CO(2) laser irradiation produces an essentially blackbody internal energy distribution, whose 'temperature' varies inversely with laser intensity. The only currently available method for measuring such activation energies is blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD). Compared with BIRD, FRAGMENT: (a) eliminates the need to heat the surrounding ion trap and vacuum chamber to each of several temperatures (each requiring hours for temperature equilibration); (b) offers a three-fold wider range of effective blackbody temperature; and (c) extends the range of applications to include initially cold ions (e.g., gas-phase H/D exchange). Our FRAGMENT-determined activation energy for dissociation of protonated bradykinin, 1.2 +/- 0.1 eV, agrees within experimental error to the value, 1.3 +/- 0.1 eV, previously reported by Williams et al. from BIRD experiments.

Lavoisier never thanked him. After 9 years of generating and studying its chemistry, he couldn't understand whether it was a new element.

In 1783, on June 24th, Lavoisier was urged to try it, and, when water appeared, he realized that water was not an element but a compound of two gases, proving that oxygen was an element.

An overview of thermodynamic and mechanistic effects - On the \"hot spot theory\".\nAlthough most of researchers agree on the elementary reactions behind the sonolytic formation of molecular hydrogen (H<sub2</sub) from water, namely the radical attack of H<sub2</subO and H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub and the free radicals recombination, several recent papers ignore the intervention of the dissolved gas molecules in the kinetic pathways of free radicals, and hence may wrongly assess the effect of dissolved gases on the sonochemical production of hydrogen. One may fairly ask to which extent is it acceptable to ignore the role of the dissolved gas and its eventual decomposition inside the acoustic cavitation bubble? The present opinion paper discusses numerically the ways in which the nature of dissolved gas, i.e., N<sub2</sub, O<sub2</sub, Ar and air, may influence the kinetics of sonochemical hydrogen formation. The model evaluates the extent of direct physical effects, i.e., dynamics of bubble oscillation and collapse events if any, against indirect chemical effects, i.e., the chemical reactions of free radicals formation and consequently hydrogen emergence, it demonstrates the improvement in the sonochemical hydrogen production under argon and sheds light on several misinterpretations reported in earlier works, due to wrong assumptions mainly related to initial conditions. The paper also highlights the role of dissolved gases in the nature of created cavitation and hence the eventual bubble population phenomena that may prevent the achievement of the sonochemical activity. This is particularly demonstrated experimentally using a 20 kHz Sinaptec transducer and a Photron SA 5 high speed camera, in the case of CO<sub2</sub-saturated water where degassing bubbles are formed instead of transient cavitation.",

His initial interest was in alkalis such as limewater that were thought to be useful in the treatment of renal stone. When he studied magnesium carbonate, he found that when this was heated or exposed to acid, a gas was evolved that he called \"fixed air\" because it had been combined with a solid material. He showed that the new gas extinguished a flame, that it could not support life, and that it was present in gas exhaled from the lung. Within a few years of his discovery, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen were also isolated. Thus arguably Black's work started the avalanche of research on the respiratory gases carried out by Priestley, Scheele, Lavoisier, and Cavendish. Black then turned his attention to heat and he was the first person to describe latent heat, that is the heat added or lost when a liquid changes its state, for example when water changes to ice or steam. Latent heat is a key concept in thermal physiology because of the heat lost when sweat evaporates. Black was a friend of the young James Watt (1736-1819) who was responsible for the development of early steam engines. Watt was puzzled why so much cooling was necessary to condense steam into water, and Black realized that the answer was the latent heat.

As a result, [Formula: see text] was found to be approximately 0.7 μmol/min/m(2)BSA, which was compatible with the findings we obtained using H2-rich water.

Once in these ideal locations of the cell, previous studies have shown that hydrogen exerts antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties that are beneficial to the cell. Hydrogen is most commonly applied as a gas, water, saline, and can be applied in a variety of other mediums. There are also few side effects involving hydrogen, thus making hydrogen a perfect medical gas candidate for the convention of novel therapeutic strategies against cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, cancer, metabolic, and respiratory diseases and disorders. Although hydrogen appears to be faultless at times, there still are several deficiencies or snares that need to be investigated by future studies.

Although he was not a major figure in the history of respiratory physiology he made important discoveries concerning hydrogen, carbon dioxide, atmospheric air, and water. Hydrogen had been prepared earlier by Boyle but its properties had not been recognized; Cavendish described these in detail, including the density of the gas. Carbon dioxide had also previously been studied by Black, but Cavendish clarified its properties and measured its density. He was the first person to accurately analyze atmospheric air and reported an oxygen concentration very close to the currently accepted value. When he removed all the oxygen and nitrogen from an air sample, he found that there was a residual portion of about 0.8% that he could not characterize. Later this was shown to be argon. He produced large amounts of water by burning hydrogen in oxygen and recognized that these were its only constituents. Cavendish also worked on electricity and heat. However, his main contribution outside chemistry was an audacious experiment to measure the density of the earth, which he referred to as \"weighing the world.\" This involved determining the gravitational attraction between lead spheres in a specially constructed building. Although this was a simple experiment in principle, there were numerous complexities that he overcame with meticulous attention to experimental details. His result was very close to the modern accepted value. The Cavendish Experiment, as it is called, assures his place in the history of science. ",

H2 has a number of advantages exhibiting extensive effects: H2 rapidly diffuses into tissues and cells, and it is mild enough neither to disturb metabolic redox reactions nor to affect signaling reactive oxygen species; therefore, there should be no or little adverse effects of H2. There are several methods to ingest or consume H2; inhaling H2 gas, drinking H2-dissolved water (H2-water), injecting H2-dissolved saline (H2-saline), taking an H2 bath, or dropping H2-saline into the eyes. The numerous publications on its biological and medical benefits revealed that H2 reduces oxidative stress not only by direct reactions with strong oxidants, but also indirectly by regulating various gene expressions. Moreover, by regulating the gene expressions, H2 functions as an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic, and stimulates energy metabolism. In addition to growing evidence obtained by model animal experiments, extensive clinical examinations were performed or are under investigation. Since most drugs specifically act to their targets, H2 seems to differ from conventional pharmaceutical drugs. Owing to its great efficacy and lack of adverse effects, H2 has promising potential for clinical use against many diseases. ",

The first instinct is to answer \"Yes, for water between 0 and 4 °C\" if one knows that water expands as temperature decreases in this temperature range. The same question is asked in several Physical Chemistry and Physics textbooks. Students are supposed to answer that water contracts when heated at below 4 °C in an isobaric process. Because work is done to the contracting water, less heat is required to increase the water temperature in an isobaric process than in an isochoric process. Therefore, <iC<subP</sub</i is less than <iC<subV</sub</i . However, this answer is fundamentally flawed because it assumes, implicitly and incorrectly, that the internal energy change of water depends solely on its temperature change. Neglecting the variation of the internal energy with volume (internal pressure) will invalidate the Clausius inequality and violate the second law of thermodynamics. Once the internal pressure is properly taken into account, it becomes clear that <iC<subP</sub</i cannot be less than <iC<subV</sub</i for any substance at any temperature regardless of the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient of the substance.",

Clathrate hydrates have been extensively studied because they occur widely in nature, have important industrial applications, and provide insight into water-guest hydrophobic interactions. Until recently, the expectation-based on calculations-had been that all clathrate hydrates were dissociated into ice and gas by the application of pressures of 1 GPa or so. However, over the past five years, studies have shown that this view is incorrect. Instead, all the systems so far studied undergo structural rearrangement to other, new types of hydrate structure that remain stable to much higher pressures than had been thought possible.

Lavoisier proved that air contained a new element, oxygen, which combined with hydrogen to make water. He disproved the phlogiston theory but Priestley called it dephlogisticated air until his death 30 years later. Scandanavians learn that a Swedish apothecary Carl Wilhelm Scheele beat Priestley by 2 years but was deprived of credit because Lavoisier denied receiving a letter Scheele later claimed to have sent in September 1774 describing his 1772 discovery of \"fire air\". His claim was unconfirmed because Scheele first published his work in 1777. However, Scheele's missing letter was made public in 1992 in Paris, 218 years late, and now resides at the French Academie de Sciences. Lavoisier received it on Oct 15, 1774. His guilt was kept secret in the effects of Madame Lavoisier. He failed on several occasions to credit either Priestley or Scheele for contributing to the most important discovery in the history of science. Priestley was a teacher, political philosopher, essayist, Unitarian minister and pioneer in chemical and electrical science. He discovered 9 gases including nitrous oxide. He invented soda water, refrigeration, and gum erasers for which he coined the term \"rubber\". He discovered photosynthesis. He was humorless, argumentative, brilliant and passionate, called a \"furious free-thinker\". While his liberal colleagues Josiah Wedgwood, Erasmus Darwin, James Watts, and others of the Lunar Society were celebrating the 2nd anniversary of the French revolution, a Birmingham mob, supported by the royalists and the established church, destroyed Priestley's home, laboratory and church. Driven from England, he emigrated to Pennsylvania where he built a home and laboratory and collected a 1600 volume library, then among the largest in America. He is regarded as a founder of liberal Unitarian thinking. He was friend and correspondent of Thomas Jefferson. His philosophy and insight persuaded Jefferson to initiate what Americans call a liberal arts education. Scheele was later recognized as a brilliant and productive pioneer in chemistry although he died at age 44 of tasting his own arsenic compounds. In the new time-lapse play \"Oxygen\" set in Stockholm in both 18th and 21st centuries, in 1774, blame falls on Lavoisier's wife who hid Scheele's letter in hopes of giving her husband sole credit for discovering oxygen.

Few of us are aware that as human inhabitants of the earth, we have a unique privilege. This is that as air breathers, we and most other animals on Earth, are the only living creatures in the known universe that have unlimited supply of oxygen. This situation came about through one of the greatest miracles of nature, that is photosynthesis, the ability to release oxygen from water using the energy of sunlight. One consequence of this was that the first atmospheric oxygen came from the metabolism of microorganisms, the cyanobacteria, that used photosynthesis, but for which oxygen was an unwanted by-product. In fact, the oxygen had to be discarded for the organisms to thrive. When a major increase of oxygen concentration in the atmosphere occurred some 2 billion years ago, and the partial pressure of oxygen in the air rose to perhaps 200 mmHg, this Great Oxidation Event as it was called, was a death sentence for the large population of anaerobic animals for whom oxygen was toxic. Today much of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from photosynthesis in microorganisms, including the cyanobacteria, and the recently discovered Prochlorococcus, that discard this unwanted by-product. The result is that the PO2 in our atmosphere at sea level remains nearly constant at about 150 mm Hg, although the factors responsible for this are not understood.",

Surface tension gradients may also form due to temperature gradients generated by ohmic heating of the electrolyte. In both cases, the resulting shear stress imposes a convection in the electrolyte and the gas bubble (Marangoni effect). This phenomenon may influence the entire electrolytic gas evolution process, e.g., by an enhanced mass transfer.

This formalism permits the identification of the classical mechanical analog of the pure dephasing of a quantum mechanical degree of freedom, and suggests the construction of classical mechanical analogs of the double-sided Feynman diagrams of quantum mechanics, which are widely applied to nonlinear spectroscopy. Application of a rotating wave approximation permits the analytic extraction of signals obeying particular spatial phase matching conditions from a classical-mechanical response function. Calculations of the third-order response function for an anharmonic oscillator coupled to a harmonic solvent are compared to numerically correct classical mechanical results.",

A systematic analysis has been performed of the temperature and mole-fraction dependences of the VER rate constant, as well as the relative contributions of centrifugal and potential forces, and of different types of quantum effects.

Such calculations provide in addition accurate free energy gradient vectors and Hessian matrices and thus open the door for the characterization of stationary points in free energy landscapes and the study of chemical reaction mechanisms in large disordered systems. The vibrational spectrum of the water molecule in liquid water has been computed as a test case. It has been obtained using a weighted average of instantaneous signals assuming the instantaneous normal modes approach. Vibrational frequencies are also computed by diagonalizing the Hessian of the free energy surface. Comparison is made with experimental data and with calculations using the Fourier transform of the time autocorrelation function of the dipole moment.

Considering in particular the application to IR spectroscopy, we stress the strength and weakness of each approach for spectral features that evolve from \"simple\" to \"complex\". We use the 10-atom formic acid dimer as an ideal example of this evolution. The IR spectrum of this dimer and two isotopologs has been obtained computationally using our software, MULTIMODE, and approaches to obtain accurate, ab initio, full-dimensional potential energy and dipole moment surfaces, also developed by our group. The IR spectra obtained with the widely used \"ab initio molecular dynamics\" approach are also presented and assessed. The extension of quantum approaches to molecular clusters and even condensed phase applications, where molecular dynamics approaches are typically used, is discussed mainly in the context of the local monomer model.

In this approach, two different levels of theory were used, a high level one (DFT) for computing the harmonic spectrum and a lower fast one (Molecular Mechanic) for the anharmonic corrections. To validate our approach, we used B2PLYP/def2-TZVPP as the high-level method, and the MMFF94 method for the anharmonic corrections as the low-level method. The calculations were carried out on 28 molecules (containing from 2 to 47 atoms) covering a broad range of vibrational modes present in organic molecules. We find that this fast hybrid method reproduces the experimental frequencies with a very good accuracy for organic and bio-molecules. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is about 27 cm <sup-1</sup while the full B3LYP/SNSD simulation reproduces the experimental values with a RMSD of about 41 cm <sup-1</sup. Concerning the computational time, the hybrid B2PLYP//MMFF94 approach considerably outperforms the full B3LYP/SNSD: for the larger molecule of our set (a dipeptide containing 47 atoms), the anharmonic corrections are 2300 times faster using hybrid MMFF94 rather than full B3LYP, which represents an additional computation time to the harmonic calculation of merely 9 %, instead of 32100 % with the full B3LYP approach.

In a 2019 Chemical Reviews article, Puzzarini et al. note that a common workaround is to simply decouple these problematic modes from all other vibrations in the system during anharmonic frequency calculations. They also point out that this approximation can be \"ill-suited\", but do not quantify the errors introduced. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into how separating out or constraining torsion and inversion vibrations within potential energy surface (PES) expansions affects the accuracy of computed fundamental wavenumbers for the remaining vibrational modes, using a test set of 19 tetratomic molecules for which high quality analytic potential energy surfaces and fully-coupled anharmonic reference fundamental frequencies are available. We find that the most effective and efficient strategy is to remove the mode in question from the PES expansion entirely. This introduces errors of up to +10 cm-1 in stretching fundamentals that would otherwise couple to the dropped mode, and ±5 cm-1 in all other fundamentals. These errors are approximately commensurate with, but not necessarily additional to, errors due to the choice of electronic structure model used in constructing spectroscopically accurate PES.",

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties.

This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of (14)C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech. Among those programs, which will be discussed, were (14)C tracing of carbocation rearrangements and benzyne formation, electrical effects of substituents, Grignard reagents, synthesis of small-ring compounds, (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated ethylenes, assisting in development of (19)F, (13)C, and (15)N NMR for conformational analysis, other structural, kinetic, and tracer studies, as well as helping through textbooks to bring Huckel MO theory and the elements of NMR to familiarity for organic chemists.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

In this work, we show that the constants a and b in the van der Waals equation of state are linearly proportional to the polarizability volume of the molecules in a gas or liquid. Using this information, a new thermodynamic one-parameter equation of state is derived that contains experimentally measurable variables and physics constants only. This is the first equation of state apart from the Ideal Gas Law that contains experimentally measurable variables and physics constants only, and as such, it may be a very useful and practical equation for the description of dilute gases and liquids. The modified van der Waals equation of state describes pV as the sum of repulsive and attractive intermolecular interaction energies that are represented by an exponential repulsion function between the electron clouds of the molecules and a London dispersion component, respectively. The newly derived equation of state is tested against experimental data for several gas and liquid examples, and the agreement is satisfactory. The description of the equation of state as a one-parameter function also has implications on other thermodynamic functions, such as critical parameters, virial coefficients, and isothermal compressibilities. Using our modified van der Waals equation of state, we show that all of these properties are a function of the molecular polarizability volume.

It is the only physical theory of universal content, which I am convinced will never be overthrown, within the framework of applicability of its basic concepts. In this review, basic relationships between partial derivatives of internal energy, enthalpy, Helmholtz and Gibbs (free) energies are presented in a condensed and self-consistent \"Thermodynamic Wheel of Connections\" (TWC). As a support for experimentalists a complete set of first- and second-order partial derivatives of basic state functions (U, F, H, G) derived with respect to state variables (P, T, V, S) under isothermal, isobaric, isochoric and isentropic conditions are presented as a Table. The basic TWC-network remains unchanged when expanded by additional conjugative state parameter pairs, such as chemical potential - amount of substance and surface/interfacial tension - contact area. The extension enables characterization of first- and second-order phase transitions of bulk phases and interphases in terms of first-, second- and third-order partial derivatives of Gibbs energy as well as by first- and second-order partial derivatives of chemical potential and Derjaguin's disjoining pressure. Semi-three-dimensional interface (Guggenheim convention) state functions are derived by subtracting corresponding parameters from total state functions.

Mole fractions calculated by adhering to the law and recognizing effects of incomplete dissociation and amounts of water interacting strongly with solutes obey Raoult's law to high concentrations. Another belief is that, for a solution to be \"ideal\", there must be no volume or heat change on mixing the components. We demonstrate \"ideality\" despite volume changes and nonzero enthalpies of solution. Results with a variety of electrolytes correlate with residence times of waters near ions, viscosities, entropies of hydration, enthalpies of solution and dilution, ion ionization energies, Hofmeister series, and so forth. Older reports of \"negative hydration\", that had been considered unreliable, are now understood; the effect is due to formation of mobile, or \"fast\", water by strong hydrophobic associations.

We find that the absolute entropy and heat capacity of liquid water from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is underestimated, but falls within the range of the flexible empirical as well as the reactive force fields. The origin of the low absolute entropy of liquid water from AIMD simulations is due to an underestimation of the translational entropy by 20% and the rotational entropy by 40% compared to the TIP3P classical water model, consistent with previous studies that reports low diffusivity and increased ordering of liquid water from AIMD simulations. Classical MD simulations with rigid water models tend to be in better agreement with experiment (in particular TIP3P yielding the best agreement), although the TIP4P-ice water model, the only empirical force field that reproduces the experimental melting temperature, has the lowest entropy, perhaps expectedly. This reiterates the limitations of existing empirical water models in simultaneously capturing the thermodynamics of solid and liquid phases. We find that the quantum corrections to heat capacity of water can be as large as 60%. Although certain water models are computed to yield good absolute free energies of water compared to experiments, they are often due to the fortuitous enthalpy-entropy cancellation, but not necessarily due to the correct descriptions of enthalpy and entropy separately.",

While such variationally determined rotational constants do not correspond strictly to constants resulting from fits performed by spectroscopists, the expected good agreement is found for the A and B rotational constants for both isotopologues.

Furthermore, because of issues in their evaluation, they are also of considerable mathematical interest. The corresponding Madelung (electrostatic, coulomb) energy is the principal contributor to the lattice energies of ionic systems, and these energies largely influence many of their physical properties. The Madelung constants are here defined and their properties considered. A difficulty with their application is that they may be defined relative to various lattice distances, and with various conventions for inclusion of the charges, leading to possible confusion in their use. Instead, the unambiguous Madelung energy, E(M), is to be preferred in chemistry. An extensive list of Madelung energies is presented. From this data set, it is observed that there is a strong linear correlation between the lattice energies of ionic solids, U(POT), and their Madelung energies: U(POT)/kJ mol(-1) = 0.8519E(M) + 293.9. This correlation establishes that the lattice energy, U(POT), for ionic solids is about 15% smaller than the attractive Madelung energy, the difference arising from the repulsions unaccounted for by the solely coulombic Madelung energy calculation. Correlations of U(POT) against E(M) for alkali metal hydrides and transition metal compounds, each having considerable covalency, show much reduced Madelung contributions to the lattice energy. These correlations  permit ready estimation of lattice energies, and are the first to be based on actual data rather than a broad analysis.

GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community via a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ).

It makes consistent use of the concept of bond-separation reactions to supply high-level precomputed bond increments which correct for errors of lower-level models. The present work extends the approach to the calculation of standard heats of formation and validates it by comparison to experimental and benchmark level ab initio data reported in the literature. Standard heats of formation (298 K) have been compiled for a large sample of 173 neutral molecules containing hydrogen and first-row atoms (C, N, O, F), resorting to several previous compilations and to the original experimental literature. Statistical evaluation shows that the simplest implementation of the ATOMIC protocol (composite model C) achieves an accuracy comparable to the popular Gaussian-3 approach and that composite models A and B perform better. Chemical accuracy (1-2 kcal/mol) is normally achieved even for larger systems with about 10 non-hydrogen atoms and for systems with charge-separated valence structures, bearing testimony to the robustness of the bond-separation reaction model. Effects of conformational averaging have been examined in detail for the series of n-alkanes, and our most refined composite model A reproduces experimental heats of formation quantitatively, provided that conformational averaging is properly accounted for.

This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of (14)C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech. Among those programs, which will be discussed, were (14)C tracing of carbocation rearrangements and benzyne formation, electrical effects of substituents, Grignard reagents, synthesis of small-ring compounds, (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated ethylenes, assisting in development of (19)F, (13)C, and (15)N NMR for conformational analysis, other structural, kinetic, and tracer studies, as well as helping through textbooks to bring Huckel MO theory and the elements of NMR to familiarity for organic chemists.

We summarize evidence supporting the idea that a reaction should be viewed as going through a transition region rather than through a single point transition state. A similar conclusion has come out of transition state spectroscopy. We describe this region as a chemically-active, or electronically-intensive, stage of the reaction, while the ones that precede and follow it are structurally-intensive.

Slater.\nA reading of the book of Dirac's life entitled The Strangest Man is a most stirring experience, bringing one back to the beginnings of quantum mechanics where every attempt was made \"to establish a basis for theoretical quantum mechanics founded exclusively on relationships between quantities which are in principle observable.\" The prime movers in this quest were Heisenberg and Dirac. One of Dirac's most important contributions in the passage from classical to quantum mechanics, a passage that consumed much of his early efforts, was unfortunately published in an obscure Russian journal where it remained largely unread until it was found by Feynman while a graduate student at Princeton. The paper posed the question, \"what corresponds in the quantum theory to the Lagrangian method of classical mechanics?\", a method that, as Dirac pointed out, is clearly superior in the simplicity of its structure to that of the classical Hamiltonian approach. Dirac's partial answer to this question provided the key to solving the problem of introducing the action integral into quantum mechanics that occupied Feynman's mind, leading to his formulation of the path integral technique. His contribution was followed two years later by Schwinger's independently derived statement of the quantum action principle, each contribution providing a complete formulation of quantum mechanics stated in terms of single principle. The present paper points out that the successful introduction of the action principle into quantum mechanics made possible by Dirac, enables one to proceed still further by extending Schwinger's quantum action principle to an open system, to an atom in a molecule. Thus the quantum theory of an atom in a molecule has its roots in the question posed by Dirac in 1933. The paper proposes a return to a greater use of the theorems of quantum mechanics in interpretive chemistry from that begun by Slater in 1933, a staunch advocate of theory following in the footsteps of observation.",

It is concluded from these calculations that despite some multireference character, dynamic electron correlation plays a dominant role near the reaction barrier. Thus, the coupled-cluster method with higher excitations than singles and doubles gives a better description than the multireference configuration interaction method for the barrier height. The FPA and HEAT classical barrier heights, including the spin-orbit and other corrections, are 1.919 and 2.007 kcal/mol, respectively. The rate constants and H/D kinetic isotope effect for the title reaction are determined by semiclassical transition-state theory based on the anharmonic potential energy surface near the saddle point, and the agreement with experiment is excellent. The rate constants are also computed using a quasi-classical trajectory method on a global potential energy surface scaled to the FPA barrier height and a similar level of agreement with experimental data is obtained.

A new bimolecular pathway, possibly involving an 8-membered cyclic transition state, was proposed to account for reaction rates that increased disproportionately with substrate concentration under microwave heating conditions. We report a reanalysis of the kinetics and molecularity of the rearrangement of N,N-dimethyl O-(p-nitrophenyl)thiocarbamate 1a in N,N-dimethylacetamide solvent. Using HPLC, isotopic labeling ((2)H, (18)O, (34)S), and ESI-ICRMS methods, we show that there is no evidence for a bimolecular pathway en route to 2a, with near-perfect exponential decay in 1a at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 4.70 M. Instead, it is demonstrated that under the microwave heating conditions, a delayed negative feedback signal to the microwave power balancing loop results in oscillatory reaction overheating. Due to higher tan δ in the solute, the amplitude of this oscillation increases with the concentration of 1a, and this phenomenon best accounts for the kinetic behavior previously misinterpreted as being mixed first- and second-order in nature.",

Rate coefficients were calculated using four approaches: Smoluchowski (Stokes-Einstein) diffusion, a solution-phase incarnation of transition state theory based on quantum chemistry calculations, simple Marcus theory for electron-transfer reactions, and a variational TST approach for dissociative isomerization reactions that occur in the solvent cage. Available experimental data were used to test the accuracy of the computations. There were significant discrepancies between the computed and experimental values for some key parameters, indicating a need for improvements in computational methodology. Nonetheless, the 90-reaction mechanism showed the ability to reproduce many of the trends seen in experimental studies of this very complicated kinetic system.

Thus, it is well-known how the rate of ionization of R-X is affected by the stabilization of the carbocation R(+), the nature of the leaving group X(-), or the solvent ionizing power. On the other hand, when asked to estimate the half-life of the ionization of a certain substrate in a certain solvent, most chemists resign. This question, however, is crucial in daily laboratory practice. Can a certain substrate R-X be handled in alcoholic or aqueous solution without being solvolyzed? Can a biologically active tertiary amine or azole be released by ionization of a quaternary ammonium ion? In this Account, we describe a straightforward means of addressing such experimental concerns. A semiquantitative answer to these questions is given by the correlation equation log k(25 °C) = s(f)(N(f) + E(f)), in which carbocations R(+) are characterized by the electrofugality parameter E(f), and leaving groups X(-) in a certain solvent are characterized by the nucleofugality parameter N(f) and the nucleofuge-specific sensitivity parameter s(f). As s(f) is typically around 1 (0.8 &lt; s(f) &lt; 1.2), ionization half-lives of around 1 h at 25 °C can be expected when E(f) + N(f) = -4. This correlation equation is formally analogous to the linear free energy relationship that was used to derive the most comprehensive nucleophilicity and electrophilicity scales presently available (Mayr, H.; Bug, T.; Gotta, M. F.; Hering, N.; Irrgang, B.; Janker, B.; Kempf, B.; Loos, R.; Ofial, A. R.; Remennikov, G.; Schimmel, H. Reference Scales for the Characterization of Cationic Electrophiles and Neutral Nucleophiles. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9500-9512). By subjecting 628 solvolysis rate constants k(25 °C) for different benzhydryl derivatives (aryl(2)CH-X) to a least-squares minimization on the basis of the correlation equation, we obtained and tabulate here (i) the electrofugality parameters E(f) for 39 benzhydrylium ions and (ii) the nucleofuge-specific parameters N(f) and s(f) for 101 combinations of common leaving groups and solvents. We show that the E(f) parameters of the reference electrofuges can be used to determine N(f) and s(f) for almost any combination of leaving group and solvent. The nucleofuge-specific parameters of the reference systems can analogously be used to derive the electrofugalities E(f) of other types of carbocations. While it has long been recognized that good nucleophiles are not necessarily poor nucleofuges, it is now reported that there is also no general inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality. Although more electrophilic methyl- and methoxy-substituted benzhydrylium ions are generally weaker electrofuges, the inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality breaks down in the series of amino-substituted benzhydrylium ions. Because neither differential solvation of the carbocations nor steric effects are explicitly considered by this treatment, predictions for substrates not belonging to the benzhydrylium series are only reliable within a factor of 10. This is hardly acceptable to physical organic chemists, who are used to high precision within narrow groups of compounds. The synthetic chemist, however, who is seeking orientation in a reactivity range of 25 orders of magnitude, might appreciate the simplicity of this approach, which only requires considering the sum E(f) + N(f) or consulting our summary graphs.",

Miller and co-workers is used to compute rate constants for the isotopologues of the title reaction, with no empirical adjustments. The SCTST and relevant results from second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) are summarized. VPT2 is used at the CCSD(T) level of electronic structure theory to compute the anharmonicities of the fully coupled vibrational modes (including the reaction coordinate) of the transition structure. The anharmonicities are used in SCTST to compute the rate constants over the temperature range from 200 to 2500 K. The computed rate constants are compared to experimental data and theoretical calculations from the literature. The SCTST results for absolute rate constants and for both primary and secondary isotope effects are in excellent agreement with the experimental data for this reaction over the entire temperature range. The sensitivity of SCTST to various parameters is investigated by using a set of simplified models. The results show that multidimensional tunneling along the curved reaction path is important at low temperatures and the anharmonic coupling among the vibrational modes is important at high temperatures. The theoretical kinetics data are also presented as fitted empirical algebraic expressions.",

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

In a previous study on amines with radical cations that underwent rapid decarboxylation, we estimated E(ox) by correcting the E(p) from cyclic voltammetry with rate constants for decarboxylation obtained using laser flash photolysis. Here we use redox equilibration experiments to determine accurate relative oxidation potentials for the same amines.

The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Several of the key intermediates in the previously proposed \"azlactone\" mechanism have been experimentally detected and characterized. In particular, interception of the mixed anhydrides involved in the early and late stages of the mechanistic scheme, as well as of the cyclic acyl-oxazolone intermediate, supports the original pathway suggested by Dakin and West. All intermediates and transition structures involved in several competing mechanisms have been calculated. The theoretical calculations support the experimental results and corroborate the proposed \"azlactone\" mechanism. The pathway involving the cyclic oxazolone (\"azlactone\") intermediate represents an energy barrier more than 3 kcal mol(-1) lower than for the competing aldol-type mechanism, thus ruling out this alternative mechanism. The DFT calculations explain the observed ESI-MS data and assess those intermediates which the experiments cannot fully elucidate.",

The identification of benzo[cd]phenanthro[1,2,3-lm]perylene is based on the product's mass spectrum, HPLC elution time, and UV absorbance spectrum. The mass spectrum of the identified 1-methylnaphthalene pyrolysis product, called component I here, reveals a molecular weight of 426, corresponding to a C(34)H(18) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The extremely long HPLC elution time, 20-48min longer than those of the four other C(34)H(18) PAH components in this product mixture, indicates that component I has a planar structure with a high length-to-breadth ratio.

In general, techniques that require the fewest steps for sample preparation give the best results and instrumentation should be selected with this in mind. In recent times, the most successful determinations of benzene have used nonvisible spectrophotometry and gas chromatography. These techniques provide good sensitivity and require minimal sample preparation. Spectrophotometric methods are best used where there are few interfering compounds and therefore they are adequate for determinations of benzene in air, water, some industrial gases, and simple solvent mixtures. The development of Fourier transform interfacing has greatly improved the sensitivity of spectrophotometers and allows for improved accuracy using small samples. This has been especially realized in the direct analysis of gases by infrared spectrophotometry. The usefulness of gas chromatography lies in its ability to separate components in a mixture before analysis. For this reason, gas chromatography is the technique of choice for determining benzene in complex gaseous or liquid mixtures and biological systems. The development of microcircuitry has improved detector response as well as reduced the costs of most instruments. This, combined with the availability of prepacked columns, has made the gas chromatograph a standard instrument in even small laboratories.",

This unexpected observation was found by measuring the VOC partitioning between supercooled water and gas phase in the temperature range from -5 degrees C to -15 degrees C for benzene, toluene, ethlybenzene, m-, p-, o-xylenes (BTEX), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). Aqueous standard solutions were analyzed using a static headspace method in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Dimensionless Henry's law coefficients (K(AW)) were calculated from measurements of the concentration of the VOCs in the headspace above the standard solutions at temperatures between -25 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The results show that the well known temperature dependence of Henry's law coefficients at temperatures above 0 degrees C is inversed upon decreasing the temperature below 0 degrees C and formation of supercooled water while decreasing the temperature to -15 degrees C. Upon further decrease of the temperature to -25 degrees C freezing of the supercooled water occurs. K(AW) values increase from 0.092 (benzene), 0.099 (toluene), 0.098 (ethylbenzene), 0.117 (m/p-xylene), 0.076 (o-xylene), 0.012 (MTBE) and 0.014 (ETBE at 5 degrees C to 0.298 (benzene), 0.498 (toluene), 0.944 (ethylbenzene), 0.327 (m/p-xylene), 0.342 (o-xylene), 0.029 (MTBE) and 0.041 (ETBE) at -25 degrees C, respectively. Inversion of Henry coefficients upon cooling the aqueous solutions to temperatures below 0 degrees C is explained by the increasing formation of ice-like clusters in the water below 0 degrees C. The VOC are expelled from these clusters resulting in enhanced VOC concentrations in the gas phase upon supercooling. Formation of ice upon further cooling to -25 degrees C results in a further increase of the VOC concentrations in the gas phase above the ice. The findings have implications for the partitioning of VOC in clouds between the gas phase, supercooled water droplets, aerosol particles and ice.",

However, these are usually associated with a corresponding amount of effort and become less accurate as the vapor pressure decreases. For purposes of vapor pressure prediction, algorithms were developed that are usually based on quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). The quantum mechanical (QM) approach followed here applies an alternative, much less empirical strategy, where the change in Gibbs free energy for the transition from the condensed to the gas phase is obtained from conformer ensembles computed for each phase separately. The results of this automatic, so-called CRENSO workflow are compared with experimentally determined vapor pressures for a large set of environmentally relevant compounds. In addition, comparisons are made with the single structure-based COSMO-RS QM approach, linear-free-energy relationships (LFER) as well as results from the SPARC program.

All spectra are poor in vibronic structure and hardly affected in shape by the surroundings (vapor or solution). Moderate solvatochromic shifts of ∼ -0.2 eV are measured. For all isomers vertical transition energies, oscillator strengths, and excited state dipole moments were computed using the MS-CASPT2/CASSCF and CC2 methods. Based on these calculations the experimental transitions were assigned. The spectra of all isomers are characterized by weak (ε(max) ≈ 100 M(-1) cm(-1)) transitions around 350 nm (3.6 eV), arising from nπ* absorptions starting from the lone pairs of the nitro and aldehyde moieties. The next band of intermediate intensity peaking around 300 nm (4.2 eV, ε(max) ≈ 1000 M(-1) cm(-1)) is dominated by ππ* excitations within the arene function.

It was found that if benzene was used as a reference substance, the ratio of the solute rate to that of benzene (F) becomes insensitive to water mixing, whether the solute possessed high or low Henry's law constant. In the presence of surfactants, however, the F value changes sharply as the solute solubility decreases. For benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), the F values are essentially constant irrespective of the presence of other chemicals (including organic compounds, surfactants, and salinity) and of the variation in temperature. On the other hand, the volatilization rates are closely related to molecular weight (solubility) in the existence of mixing (surfactants). Three different approaches, i.e., mass-transport theory, modified Knudsen equation, and reaction rate concept, were used to evaluate the dependence of solute volatilization rates on solute properties.

Here, we demonstrate that the relationship between delta H(VAP)and PL is consistent with Trouton's rule and the ClausiusClapeyron equation under the assumption that delta H(VAP) is linearly dependent on temperature between 298 K and the boiling point temperature. Our interpretation based on Trouton's rule substantiates the empirical relationship between delta H(VAP) degree and P(L) degrees for non-hydrogen-bonding chemicals with subcooled liquid vapor pressures ranging over 15 orders of magnitude. We apply the relationship between delta H(VAP) degrees and P(L) degrees to evaluate data reported in literature reviews for several important classes of semivolatile environmental contaminants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorobenzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and -furans and illustrate the temperature dependence of results from a multimedia model presented as a partitioning map.

The thermodynamic quantities for sublimation suggest that molecular symmetry and torsional freedom are major factors affecting entropic differentiation in these molecules, and that cohesive forces are significantly influenced by molecular surface area. The global results obtained support the lack of significant conjugation between aromatic moieties in the α position of naphthalene but indicate the existence of significant electron delocalization when the aromatic groups are in the β position. Evidence for the existence of a quasi T-shaped intramolecular aromatic interaction between the two outer phenyl rings in 1,8-di([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)naphthalene was found, and the enthalpy of this interaction quantified on pure experimental grounds as -(11.9 ± 4.8) kJ·mol(-1), in excellent agreement with the literature CCSD(T) theoretical results for the benzene dimer.",

For over a half-century after, chemists struggled to reconcile proposed structures for benzene and other aromatic compounds with their resistance to chemical transformation and tendency to maintain the type during reaction. The combined structural and reactivity features of these compounds were eventually covered by the term 'aromaticity'. Kekulé, Bamberger and Thiele had each proposed a criterion for aromaticity; all were either empirically contradicted or incapable of evaluation. In the 1930s, two rival quantum mechanical methods succeeded in establishing a physical basis for aromaticity. Using valence bond theory, Pauling attributed benzene's stability to its being a resonance hybrid of several Lewis structures. Calculating resonance energies was challenging but manipulating Lewis structures was not; that procedure provided qualitative insights into aromatic structure and reactivity. Resonance theory appealed especially to organic chemists and eclipsed Hückel's contemporaneous molecular orbital approach, which remained relatively inaccessible. In the 1950s, however, simple rules derived from Hückel's mathematics, combined with proton NMR data, provided seemingly universal criteria for aromaticity. In the event, post-1950 discoveries of non-organic, three-dimensional compounds such as ferrocene and the fullerenes that exhibit aromatic properties led chemists to doubt the utility and universality of 'aromaticity' as a concept. A recent consensus maintains that aromaticity is a multi-variable phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a strict definition, a property it shares with other core chemical concepts such as 'acidity' and 'reactivity'.

Proton-transfer chemical ionization mass spectrometry was used to follow directly the temperature-dependent evaporation rates of aerosol samples collected on a cold plate that could be heated at a known rate. The vapor pressures of the deposited compounds were derived from observed evaporation rates through application of the Hertz-Knudsen equation. Temperature programmed desorption allowed for quantification of the enthalpy (DeltaHsub) and entropy (DeltaSsub) of sublimation of the diacids and is described. A strong odd-even dependence with respect to the total carbon number was observed in the derived diacid vapor pressures, consistent with previous measurements. However, the vapor pressures from this method were systematically lower than previous measurements. Though seen in the vapor pressure, no odd-even carbon chain length dependence was readily discernible in the measured values of DeltaHsub and DeltaSsub. Perhaps most importantly, these experimental results also suggest that residual solvent molecules (from the aerosol generation process) trapped in the diacid samples can have a considerable influence on the measured thermodynamic parameters and, if not properly accounted for, may give erroneous results.",

The solvation Gibbs energy change is determined by the balance between the work of cavity creation in the solvent, and the dispersive interactions of the inserted benzene molecule with the surrounding solvent molecules. The purely structural solvent reorganization upon solute insertion proves to be a compensating process. The analysis shows that the work of cavity creation is larger in water than in benzene, whereas the attractive energetic interactions are stronger in benzene than in water; this scenario is true at any temperature.

Second, the d-polarization sets are increased to 3d on the first-row atoms and to 4d on the second-row atoms, with reoptimization of the exponents for the latter. Third, the QCISD(T) method is replaced by the CCSD(T) method for the highest level of correlation treatment. Fourth, optimized geometries and zero-point energies are obtained with the B3LYP density functional. Fifth, two new higher level corrections are added to account for deficiencies in the energy calculations. The new method is assessed on the 454 experimental energies in the G305 test set [L. A. Curtiss, P. C. Redfern, and K. Raghavachari, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 124107 (2005)], and the average absolute deviation from experiment shows significant improvement from 1.13 kcal/mol (G3 theory) to 0.83 kcal/mol (G4 theory). The largest improvement is found for 79 nonhydrogen systems (2.10 kcal/mol for G3 versus 1.13 kcal/mol for G4). The contributions of the new features to this improvement are analyzed and the performance on different types of energies is discussed.",

The triatomic anions are assumed to maintain a collinear configuration throughout all calculations, so only the symmetric (nu(1)) and asymmetric (nu(3)) stretching modes are considered. The two-dimensional permanent dipole surfaces and potential energy surfaces are then constructed along bond coordinates, using high-level ab initio methods. Fundamental and combination bands are obtained from the vibrational eigenfunctions, resulting in anharmonic frequencies, which can be compared with the available theoretical and experimental data. The agreement is very good, especially for the pure symmetric modes, while the asymmetric ones show larger discrepancies, presumably due to the neglected coupling between stretching and bending modes. Strong inverse anharmonicity is found in the level spacing of the asymmetric modes, for both FHF(-) and OHF(-) anions. The calculated mixed modes (nnu(1)+mnu(3), n, m=0-3) also agree reasonably with the few available experimental data, supporting our model. Based on the vibrational eigenfunctions, isotope effects are also rationalized. Infrared absorption spectra are calculated from the dipole autocorrelation function for FHF(-) and FDF(-), and for OHF(-) and ODF(-). Peak locations and relative intensities are assigned in terms of the fundamental and mixed transitions.",

In these studies, it was demonstrated that by applying high-voltage nanosecond pulses to cells, plasma membrane and cell organelles are permeabilized. As suggested in a recent publication, the repetition rate and polarity of nanosecond high-voltage pulses could have an important effect on the electropermeabilization process, and consequently, on the observed phenomena. Therefore, we designed a new Blumlein configuration that enables a higher repetition rate of variable duration of either bipolar or unipolar high-voltage pulses. We achieved a maximal pulse repetition rate of 1.1 MHz. However, theoretically, this rate could be even higher. We labeled endocytotic vesicles with lucifer yellow and added propidium iodide to a cell suspension for testing the cell plasma membrane integrity, so we were able to observe the permeabilization of endocytotic vesicles and the cell plasma membrane at the same time. The new design of pulse generator was built, verified, and also tested in experiments. The resulting flexibility and variability allow further in vitro experiments to determine the importance of the pulse repetition rate and pulse polarity on membrane permeabilization -- both of the cell plasma membrane as well as of cell organelle membranes.",

This paper describes a method to generate nanosecond multiphasic pulses for biomedical use, and specifically demonstrates its ability to cancel or enhance cell swelling and blebbing. The generator consists of a series of the fundamental module, which includes a capacitor and a MOSFET switch. A positive or a negative phase pulse module can be produced based on how the switch is connected. Stacking the modules in series can increase the voltage up to 5 kV. Multiple stacks in parallel can create multiphase outputs. As each stack is independently controlled and charged, multiphasic pulses can be created to produce flexible and versatile pulse waveforms. The circuit topology can be used for high-frequency uniphasic or biphasic nanosecond burst pulse production, creating numerous opportunities for the generator in electroporation applications, tissue ablation, wound healing, and nonthermal plasma generation.",

To alleviate this difficulty, we have studied meteorite samples with the ultrasensitive magnetic field modulated microwave spectroscopy (MFMMS) technique [J. G. Ramírez, A. C. Basaran, J. de la Venta, J. Pereiro, I. K. Schuller, <iRep. Prog. Phys.</i 77, 093902 (2014)].

MFMMS measurements detected superconducting transitions in samples from each, above 5 K. By subdividing and remeasuring individual samples, grains containing the largest superconducting fraction were isolated. The superconducting grains were then characterized with a series of complementary techniques, including vibrating-sample magnetometry (VSM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and numerical methods. These measurements and analysis identified the likely phases as alloys of lead, indium, and tin.",

The next heavy element targeted for chemical characterization is element 112; its closed-shell electronic structure with a filled outer s orbital suggests that it may be particularly susceptible to strong deviations from the chemical property trends expected within group 12.

By directly comparing the adsorption characteristics of (283)112 to that of mercury and the noble gas radon, we find that element 112 is very volatile and, unlike radon, reveals a metallic interaction with the gold surface.

The search for helium-3 superfluidity commenced; it continued for about ten years without success, and was all but abandoned by the time Douglas D.

Lee and Robert C. Richardson - demonstrated the transition of helium-3 to a superfluid state at temperatures near absolute zero (-273 degrees C). Twenty-four years after their discovery, Osheroff and colleagues won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

The laser-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) is currently the only technique capable of routinely accessing the Earth's lower-mantle geotherm for experiments on non-metallic samples, but large temperature uncertainties and poor temperature stability limit the accuracy of measured data and prohibits analyses requiring long acquisition times. We have developed a novel internal resistive heating (IRH) technique for the DAC and demonstrate stable heating of non-metallic samples up to 3000 K and 64 GPa, as confirmed by in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction and simultaneous spectroradiometric temperature measurement. The temperature generated in our IRH-DAC can be precisely controlled and is extremely stable, with less than 20 K variation over several hours without any user intervention, resulting in temperature uncertainties an order of magnitude smaller than those in typical laser-heating experiments. Our IRH-DAC design, with its simple geometry, provides a new and highly accessible tool for investigating materials at extreme conditions. It is well suited for the rapid collection of high-resolution P-V-T data, precise demarcation of phase boundaries, and experiments requiring long acquisition times at high temperature. Our IRH technique is ideally placed to exploit the move toward coherent nano-focused x-ray beams at next-generation synchrotron sources.",

II, p. 23; Poliakoff M. &amp; Tang S. 2015 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 373: , 20140211). Here, we review major, pre-quantum-mechanical innovations (Goldhammer DA. 1913 Dispersion und Absorption des Lichtes; Herzfeld KF. 1927 Phys. Rev. 29: , 701-705) that allow an understanding of the metallic or non-metallic status of the chemical elements under both ambient and extreme conditions. A special emphasis will be placed on recent experimental advances that investigate how the electronic properties of chemical elements vary with temperature and density, and how this invariably relates to a changing status of the chemical elements. Thus, the prototypical non-metals, hydrogen and helium, becomes metallic at high densities; and the acknowledged metals, mercury, rubidium and caesium, transform into their non-metallic forms at low elemental densities. This reflects the fundamental fact that, at temperatures above the absolute zero of temperature, there is therefore no clear dividing line between metals and non-metals. Our conventional demarcation of chemical elements as metals or non-metals within the periodic table is of course governed by our experience of the nature of the elements under ambient conditions. Examination of these other situations helps us to examine the exact divisions of the chemical elements into metals and non-metals (Mendeleeff D. 1905 The principles of chemistry, vol. II, p. 23). ",

Several sources have been proposed for the prebiotic organic molecules: terrestrial primitive atmosphere (methane or carbon dioxide), deep-sea hydrothermal systems, and extraterrestrial meteoritic and cometary dust grains. The study of carbonaceous chondrites, which contain up to 5% by weight of organic matter, has allowed close examination of the delivery of extraterrestrial organic material. Eight proteinaceous amino acids have been identified in the Murchison meteorite among more than 70 amino acids. Engel reported that L-alanine was surprisingly more abundant than D-alanine in the Murchison meteorite. Cronin also found excesses of L-enantiomers for nonprotein amino acids. A large collection of micrometeorites has been recently extracted from Antarctic old blue ice. In the 50- to 100-micron size range, carbonaceous micrometeorites represent 80% of the samples and contain 2% of carbon, on average. They might have brought more carbon than that involved in the present surficial biomass. The early histories of Mars and Earth clearly show similarities. Liquid water was once stable on the surface of Mars, attesting the presence of an atmosphere capable of deccelerating C-rich micrometeorites. Therefore, primitive life may have developed on Mars as well and fossilized microorganisms may still be present in the near subsurface. The Viking missions to Mars in 1976 did not find evidence of either contemporary or past life, but the mass spectrometer on the lander aeroshell determined the atmospheric composition, which has allowed a family of meteorites to be identified as Martian. Although these samples are essentially volcanic in origin, it has been recognized that some of them contain carbonate inclusions and even veins that have a carbon isotopic composition indicative of an origin from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide. The oxygen isotopic composition of these carbonate deposits allows calculation of the temperature regime existing during formation from a fluid that dissolved the carbon dioxide. As the composition of the fluid is unknown, only a temperature range can be estimated, but this falls between 0 degree and 90 degrees C, which would seem entirely appropriate for life processes. It was such carbonate veins that were found to host putative microfossils. Irrespective of the existence of features that could be considered to be fossils, carbonate-rich portions of Martian meteorites tend to have material, at more than 1000 ppm, that combusts at a low temperature; i.e., it is an organic form of carbon. Unfortunately, this organic matter does not have a diagnostic isotopic signature so it cannot be unambiguously said to be indigenous to the samples. However, many circumstantial arguments can be made to the effect that it is cogenetic with the carbonate and hence Martian. If it could be proved that the organic matter was preterrestrial, then the isotopic fractionation between it and the carbon is in the right sense for a biological origin.",

The consistent force field 91 is extended for accurate simulation of mica and related minerals. We investigate mica sheets with 12 octadecyltrimethylammonium (C(18)) ions or 12 dioctadecyldimethylammonium (2C(18)) ions, respectively, as single and layered structures at different temperatures with periodicity in the xy plane by NVT dynamics. The alkylammonium ions reside preferably above the cavities in the mica surface with an aluminum-rich boundary. The nitrogen atoms are 380-390 pm away from the superficial silicon-aluminum plane. With increasing temperature, rearrangements of C(18) ions on the mica surface are found, while 2C(18) ions remain tethered due to geometric restraints. We present basal-plane spacings in the duplicate structures, tilt angles of the alkyl chains, and gauche-trans ratios to analyze the chain conformation. Agreement with experimental data, where available, is quantitative. In C(18)-mica with less than 100% alkali-ion exchange, the disordered C(18) rods in the island structures [Hayes, W. A.; Schwartz, D. K. Langmuir 1998, 14, 5913-5917] break at 40 degrees C. At 60 degrees C, the headgroups of the C(18) alkyl chains rearrange on the mica surface, and the broken chain backbones assume a coillike structure. The C(18)-mica obtained on fast cooling of this phase is metastable due to slow reverse rearrangements of the headgroups. In 2C(18)-mica with 70-80% ion exchange, the alkali ions are interspersed between the alkyl chains, corresponding to a single phase on the surface. The observed phase transition at approximately 53 degrees C involves an increase of chain disorder (partial melting) of the 2C(18) ions without significant rearrangements on the mica surface. We propose a geometric parameter lambda for the saturation of the surface with alkyl chains, which determines the preferred self-assembly pattern, that is, islands, intermediate, or continuous. lambda allows the calculation of tilt angles in continuous layers on mica or other surfaces.

The self-diffusivity follows an Arrhenius behavior over the entire investigated temperature range, with an activation energy of 41.8 ± 1.4 meV. The standard deviation is in the order of 5%, significantly more precise than previously reported measurements in the literature. Similar to alkali metal melts, the self-diffusion coefficient close to the melting point can be predicted with an effective atom radius of 1.37 Å. This shows a dominant contribution from the repulsive part of the interatomic potential to the mass transport. We observed deviations from the Stokes/Sutherland-Einstein relation and indications of an increasing collective nature of the dynamics with decreasing temperature. Thus, a transport mechanism of uncorrelated binary collisions cannot fully describe the temperature dependence of the self-diffusion.",

The hard sphere model for the gas-like component is shown to give systematically high entropies for liquid metals as a direct result of the unphysical Lorentzian high-frequency tail. Using a memory function framework we derive a generally applicable velocity autocorrelation and frequency spectrum for the diffusive component which recovers the low-frequency (long-time) behavior of the hard sphere model while providing for realistic short-time coherence and high-frequency tails to the spectrum. This approach provides a significant increase in the accuracy of the calculated entropies for liquid metals and is compared to ambient pressure data for liquid sodium, aluminum, gallium, tin, and iron. The use of this method for the determination of melt boundaries is demonstrated with a calculation of the high-pressure bcc melt boundary for sodium. With the significantly improved accuracy available with the memory function treatment for softer interatomic potentials, the 2PT model for entropy calculations should find broader application in high energy density science, warm dense matter, planetary science, geophysics, and material science.

We find that in contrast to F(-) and Cl(-) those for O(2-) and S(2-) are unrealistically high due to the instability of the corresponding restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) solutions. Yet, already a relatively weak HO confining potential stabilizes their RHF solutions and eliminates any possible broken-symmetry solutions. The coupled-cluster theory with single, double and noniterative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) then yields considerably reduced polarizabilities for O(2-) and S(2-) relative to their unconfined values. We showed that polarizabilities of O(2-) and S(2-) are more sensitive to the strength of a confinement potential than are those for F(-) and Cl(-). This enables us to relate the confining parameter ω with the known experimental polarizabilities for selected crystals (our \"training set\") and to find a specific confining parameter ω for which the CCSD(T) polarizability equals the experimental in-crystal polarizability of an anion in the training set. The latter may then be used as an alternative approach for determining the in-crystal polarizabilities of anions by exploiting the fact that the characteristic ω values depend linearly on the ionic radius of a cation participating in specific crystals containing these anions. Using this method we then calculate the isotropic dipole polarizabilities for F(-), Cl(-), O(2-), and S(2-) embedded in the LiF, LiCl, NaF, NaCl, KF, KCl, ZnO, ZnS, MgO, MgS, CaO, CaS, SrO, SrS, BaO, BaS, and other crystals containing halogen, oxygen, or sulphur anions.

Thus, the prototypical non-metals, hydrogen and helium, becomes metallic at high densities; and the acknowledged metals, mercury, rubidium and caesium, transform into their non-metallic forms at low elemental densities. This reflects the fundamental fact that, at temperatures above the absolute zero of temperature, there is therefore no clear dividing line between metals and non-metals. Our conventional demarcation of chemical elements as metals or non-metals within the periodic table is of course governed by our experience of the nature of the elements under ambient conditions.

We rigorously assess the B3LYP functional for solids through calculations of lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and thermochemical properties (atomization energies and reaction energies). The theoretical lattice constants overestimate the experimental ones by approximately 1%, and hence behave similarly to the PBE gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional. B3LYP atomization energies of solids are drastically worse than those of nonempirical hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functionals (HF/DFT) such as PBE0 and HSE03. These large errors can be traced back to the lack of a proper description of \"free-electron-like\" systems with a significant itinerant character (metals and small gap semiconductors).

The MOPAC2016 software package has long been at the forefront of semiempirical quantum chemical methods (SEQMs) for small molecules, proteins, and solids and until this release has included only NDDO-type SEQMs. The new code enables the calculation of excited states using the INDO/S Hamiltonian combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach using single excitations (CIS), single and double excitations (CISD), or multiple reference determinants (MRCI) where reference determinants are generated using a complete active space (CAS) approach. The capacity to perform excited-state calculations beyond the CIS level makes INDO/CI one of the few low-cost computational methods capable of accurately modeling states with substantial double-excitation character. Solvent corrections to the ground-state and excited-state energies can be computed using the COSMO implicit solvent model, incorporating state-specific corrections to the excited states based on the solvent refractive index. This code produces physically reasonable electronic structures, absorption spectra, and solvatochromic shifts at low computational costs for systems up to hundreds of atoms, and for both organic molecules and metal clusters.",

[J. Chem. Phys. 131, 054106 (2009)] to compute the ground state of correlated many-electron systems, an extension to the computation of excited states (exFCIQMC) is presented. The Hilbert space is divided into a large part consisting of pure Slater determinants and a much smaller orthogonal part (the size of which is controlled by a cut-off threshold), from which the lowest eigenstates can be removed efficiently. In this way, the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is restricted to the orthogonal complement of the lower excited states and projects out the next highest excited state. Starting from the ground state, higher excited states can be found one after the other. The Schrödinger equation in imaginary time is solved by the same population dynamics as in the ground state algorithm with modified probabilities and matrix elements, for which working formulae are provided. As a proof of principle, the method is applied to lithium hydride in the 3-21G basis set and to the helium dimer in the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. It is shown to give the correct electronic structure for all bond lengths. Much more testing will be required before the applicability of this method to electron correlation problems of interesting size can be assessed. ",

Previous simulation results point to the existence of such a maximum. However, simulations were performed at constant temperature with the aid of a thermostat that dissipates the heat released at the ice-water interface unrealistically fast. Here, we perform simulations of ice growth without any thermostat. Large systems are required to perform these simulations at constant overall thermodynamic conditions (pressure and temperature). We obtain the same growth rate as in previous thermostatted simulations. This implies that the dynamics of ice growth is not affected by heat dissipation. Our results strongly support the experiments predicting the existence of a maximum in the ice growth rate.

We present a thermodynamic theory for homogeneous ice nucleation, which expresses the nucleation rate coefficient as a function of water activity and pressure.

The deviations of approximative formulations of the driving force and the surface tension from the exact reference properties are quantified, showing that the proposed simplifications are applicable for low to moderate undercooling and pressure differences to the respective equilibrium state of water. The TEOS-10-based predictions of the ice crystallization rate revealed pressure-induced deceleration of ice nucleation with an increasing pressure, and acceleration of ice nucleation by pressure decrease. This result is in, at least, qualitative agreement with laboratory experiments and computer simulations. Both the temperature and pressure dependencies of the ice-water surface tension were found to be in line with the le Chatelier-Braun principle, in that the surface tension decreases upon increasing degree of metastability of water (by decreasing temperature and pressure), which favors nucleation to move the system back to a stable state. The reason for this behavior is discussed. Finally, the Kauzmann temperature of the ice-water system was found to amount T K = 116 K , which is far below the temperature of homogeneous freezing. The Kauzmann pressure was found to amount to p K = - 212 MPa , suggesting favor of homogeneous freezing on exerting a negative pressure on the liquid. In terms of thermodynamic properties entering the theory, the reason for the negative Kauzmann pressure is the higher mass density of water in comparison to ice at the melting point.",

It is a prerequisite for life and as such a most important subject of current research in chemical physics and physical chemistry. In spite of its simplicity as a liquid, it has an enormously rich phase diagram where different types of ices, amorphous phases, and anomalies disclose a path that points to unique thermodynamics of its supercooled liquid state that still hides many unraveled secrets. In this review we describe the behavior of water in the regime from ambient conditions to the deeply supercooled region. The review describes simulations and experiments on this anomalous liquid. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomalous properties that become strongly enhanced in the supercooled region. Among those, the second critical-point scenario has been investigated extensively, and at present most experimental evidence point to this scenario. Starting from very low temperatures, a coexistence line between a high-density amorphous phase and a low-density amorphous phase would continue in a coexistence line between a high-density and a low-density liquid phase terminating in a liquid-liquid critical point, LLCP. On approaching this LLCP from the one-phase region, a crossover in thermodynamics and dynamics can be found. This is discussed based on a picture of a temperature-dependent balance between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid favored by, respectively, entropy and enthalpy, leading to a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of bulk water. Ice nucleation is also discussed, since this is what severely impedes experimental investigation of the vicinity of the proposed LLCP. Experimental investigation of stretched water, i.e., water at negative pressure, gives access to a different regime of the complex water diagram. Different ways to inhibit crystallization through confinement and aqueous solutions are discussed through results from experiments and simulations using the most sophisticated and advanced techniques. These findings represent tiles of a global picture that still needs to be completed. Some of the possible experimental lines of research that are essential to complete this picture are explored.",

Here, we report that high-density amorphous ice at ambient pressure shows a distinct calorimetric glass transitions at 116 K and present evidence that this second glass transition involves liquid-like translational mobility of water molecules. This \"double Tg scenario\" is related to the coexistence of two liquid phases. The calorimetric signature of the second glass transition is much less feeble, with a heat capacity increase at Tg,2 about five times as large as at Tg,1. By using broadband-dielectric spectroscopy we resolve loss peaks yielding relaxation times near 100 s at 126 K for low-density amorphous ice and at 110 K for high-density amorphous ice as signatures of these two distinct glass transitions. Temperature-dependent dielectric data and heating-rate-dependent calorimetric data allow us to construct the relaxation map for the two distinct phases of water and to extract fragility indices m = 14 for the low-density and m = 20-25 for the high-density liquid.

Then, certain percentages of H-bonds were broken, and the obtained structures were examined.

Parameterizations of the freezing temperatures in terms of the water activity of the solution have been successfully established, but the fundamental origin of the thermodynamic control of the non-equilibrium crystallization of ice has remained elusive. Here we use large-scale molecular simulations to elucidate the relationship between the structure, thermodynamics, and ice crystallization temperatures for solutions of mW water and a strongly hydrophilic solute that mimics LiCI ions.

This temperature is in the middle of water's \"no-man's land,\" where rapid ice crystallization prevents the elucidation of the structure of liquid water and its transformation into ice with state of the art experimental methods. We find that critical ice nuclei (that contain less than ten water molecules) form in a time scale shorter than the time required for the relaxation of the liquid, suggesting that supercooled liquid water cannot be properly equilibrated in this region. We distinguish three stages in the crystallization of water at 180 K: concurrent nucleation and growth of ice, followed by consolidation that decreases the number density of ice nuclei, and finally, slow growth of the crystallites without change in their number density. The kinetics of the transformation along the three stages is well described by a single compacted exponential Avrami equation with n approximately 1.7. This work confirms the coexistence of ice and liquid after water is crystallized in \"no-man's land\": the formation of ice plateaus when there is still 15%-20% of liquid water in the systems, thinly dispersed between ice I crystals with linear dimensions ranging from 3 to 10 nm.

When the derivative is expressed in terms of the three-state ensemble model, in the regime of low temperatures and up to temperatures of chemical interest, one finds that for zero fractional charge, the thermodynamic hardness is proportional to T<sup-1</sup(I-A), where I is the first ionization potential, A is the electron affinity, and T is the temperature. However, the thermodynamic hardness is nearly zero when the fractional charge is different from zero. Thus, through the present definition, one avoids the presence of the Dirac delta function. We show that the chemical hardness defined in this way provides meaningful and discernible information about the hardness properties of a chemical species exhibiting integer or a fractional average number of electrons, and this analysis allowed us to establish a link between the maximum possible value of the hardness here defined, with the minimum softness principle, showing that both principles are related to minimum fractional charge and maximum stability conditions.",

It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

A recently developed quantum mechanical treatment of the problem is briefly summarized, putting particular emphasis on the realistic modeling of experimental measurements and nonequilibrium initial conditions. Within this framework, equilibration can be proven under very weak assumptions about those measurements and initial conditions, while thermalization still requires quite strong additional hypotheses. An analogous approach within the framework of classical mechanics is developed and compared with the quantum case.

We challenge this view and show that there may exist (protein) systems for which a van't Hoff analysis of experimental data cannot determine whether the system corresponds to two or three thermodynamical states when only temperatures in a narrow temperature region around the transition are considered.

We show that under certain conditions the heat capacity of the three-state system can be almost indistinguishable from the heat capacity for the two-state system over a broad temperature interval. The consequence may be that some three-state (or even more than three-states) systems have been misinterpreted as two-state systems when the conclusion is drawn solely upon the van't Hoff enthalpy.

We propose a direct analytical procedure to test if a generalized entropy satisfies the third law, assuming only very general assumptions for the entropy S and energy U of an arbitrary N-level classical system. Mathematically, the method relies on exact calculation of β=dS/dU in terms of the microstate probabilities p(i).

Finally precise error estimates for the numerical procedure to evaluate the transmission coefficient kappaS of the TST dividing surface are given, and it is shown that the relative error on kappaS scales as 1/square root(kappaS) when kappaS is small. This implies that dynamical corrections to the TST rate constant can be computed efficiently if and only if the TST dividing surface has a transmission coefficient kappaS which is not too small. In particular, the TST dividing surface must be optimized upon (for otherwise kappaS is generally very small), but this may not be sufficient to make the procedure numerically efficient (because the optimal dividing surface has maximum kappaS, but this coefficient may still be very small).",

We focus here on the behavior of entropy along the vapor-liquid phase coexistence and identify how the difference in entropy between the two coexisting phases vary in ideal and metallic systems along the coexistence curve. Using flat-histogram simulations, we determine the thermodynamic conditions of coexistence, critical parameters, including the critical entropy, and entropies along the binodal. We then apply our analysis to a series of systems that increasingly depart from ideality and adopt a metal-like character, through the gradual onset of the Friedel oscillation in an effective pair potential, and for a series of transition metals modeled with a many-body embedded-atoms force field. Projections of the phase boundary on the entropy-pressure and entropy-temperature planes exhibit two qualitatively different behaviors. While all systems modeled with an effective pair potential lead to an ideal-like behavior, the onset of many-body effects results in a departure from ideality and a markedly greater exponent for the variation of the entropy of vaporization with temperature away from the critical temperature.",

Measured acoustic velocities compare favorably with previous experimental studies but they are lower than velocities calculated from the extrapolation of the IAPWS95 equation of state above 3 GPa at 673 K and deviations increase up to 6% at 7 GPa. Densities calculated from the velocity data were used to propose an empirical EoS suitable in the 0.6-7 GPa and 293-673 K range with a total estimated uncertainty of 0.5% or less. The density model and thermodynamic properties derived from the experimental EoS have been compared to several EoS proposed in the literature. The IAPWS95 EoS provides good agreement, although underestimates density by up to 1.2% at 7 GPa and 673 K and the thermodynamic properties deviate greatly (10%-20%) outside the estimated uncertainties above 4 GPa. The refractive index n of liquid water increases linearly with density and do not depend intrinsically on temperature. The polarizability decreases with pressure by less than 4% within the investigated P-T range, suggesting strong intermolecular interactions in H(2)O that are consistent with the prevalence of the hydrogen bond network in the fluid.

This is a fundamental question in physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering. This question hangs in the minds of many students, instructors, and researchers. The first instinct is to answer \"Yes, for water between 0 and 4 °C\" if one knows that water expands as temperature decreases in this temperature range. The same question is asked in several Physical Chemistry and Physics textbooks. Students are supposed to answer that water contracts when heated at below 4 °C in an isobaric process. Because work is done to the contracting water, less heat is required to increase the water temperature in an isobaric process than in an isochoric process. Therefore, <iC<subP</sub</i is less than <iC<subV</sub</i . However, this answer is fundamentally flawed because it assumes, implicitly and incorrectly, that the internal energy change of water depends solely on its temperature change. Neglecting the variation of the internal energy with volume (internal pressure) will invalidate the Clausius inequality and violate the second law of thermodynamics.

The majority of these gas hydrates adopt one of two cubic cage structures and are called clathrate hydrates. Notable exceptions are hydrogen and helium which form 'exotic' hydrates with structures based on ice structures, rather than clathrate hydrates, even at low pressures. Clathrate hydrates have been extensively studied because they occur widely in nature, have important industrial applications, and provide insight into water-guest hydrophobic interactions. Until recently, the expectation-based on calculations-had been that all clathrate hydrates were dissociated into ice and gas by the application of pressures of 1 GPa or so. However, over the past five years, studies have shown that this view is incorrect. Instead, all the systems so far studied undergo structural rearrangement to other, new types of hydrate structure that remain stable to much higher pressures than had been thought possible.

Chemical reactivity is also substantially altered in the extreme pressure regime. In this feature paper we describe how synergy between theory and experiment can pave the road towards new experimental discoveries. Because chemical rules-of-thumb established at 1 atm often fail to predict the structures of solids under high pressure, automated crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods are increasingly employed. After outlining the most important CSP techniques, we showcase a few examples from the recent literature that exemplify just how useful theory can be as an aid in the interpretation of experimental data, describe exciting theoretical predictions that are guiding experiment, and discuss when the computational methods that are currently routinely employed fail. Finally, we forecast important problems that will be targeted by theory as theoretical methods undergo rapid development, along with the simultaneous increase of computational power. ",

These EOSs consist of typically three parameters to determine from experimental P-V-T data by fitting analyses. In the empirical approach to EOSs, one either refines such fitting parameters or improves the mathematical functions to better simulate the experimental data. Despite over seven decades of studies on EOSs, none has been found to be accurate for all types of solids over the whole temperature and pressure ranges studied experimentally. Here we show that the simple empirical EOS, P = α1(PV) + α2(PV)2 + α3(PV)3, in which the pressure P is indirectly related to the volume V through a cubic polynomial of the energy term PV with three fitting parameters α1 − α3, provides accurate descriptions for the P-vs-V data of condensed matter in a wide region of pressure studied experimentally even in the presence of phase transitions.",

This is confirmed by examples of polar and non-polar substances within the range of temperatures from 203.15 K to 491.48 K and pressures up to 1200 MPa. The proposed two states model is truly predictive for the high-pressure density and isothermal compressibility using several easily measurable physico-chemical quantities: the density, the isobaric heat capacity, and the speed of sound at atmospheric pressure only. The experimental data on the density for 15 different compressed liquids, given in the literature as a function of temperature and very high-pressures, were used for the comparison and its analysis.

The search for helium-3 superfluidity commenced; it continued for about ten years without success, and was all but abandoned by the time Douglas D. Osheroff began his graduate studies at Cornell University. \"The general wisdom was that the superfluidity of helium-3 was a pipe dream of the theorists,\" says Osheroff. \"But in fact, it did occur.\" In 1972, Osheroff - together with David M. Lee and Robert C. Richardson - demonstrated the transition of helium-3 to a superfluid state at temperatures near absolute zero (-273 degrees C). Twenty-four years after their discovery, Osheroff and colleagues won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Osheroff's scientifically inquisitive nature developed long before his landmark discovery. \"A lot of people did crazy things when they were young\" says Osheroff, whose wild experimentation including building a 100,000-volt X-ray machine as a teenager. Now as a faculty member at Stanford University, Osheroff stresses the importance of mentoring undergraduates to get them excited about science, and to guide them on what to do next.

In contrast, the Madelung energy ordering rule is not predictive for atoms under compression. Magnetism may increase or decrease with pressure, depending on which atom is considered. However, Hund's rule is never violated for single atoms in the considered pressure range. Important (and understandable) electron shifts, s→p, s→d, s→f, and d→f are essential chemical and physical consequences of compression. Among the specific intriguing changes predicted are an increase in the range between the most and least electronegative elements with compression; a rearrangement of electronegativities of the alkali metals with pressure, with Na becoming the most electropositive s<sup1</sup element (while Li becomes a p group element and K and heavier become transition metals); phase transitions in Ca, Sr, and Ba correlating well with s→d transitions; spin-reduction in all d-block atoms for which the valence d-shell occupation is d <supn</sup (4 ≤ n ≤ 8); d→f transitions in Ce, Dy, and Cm causing Ce to become the most electropositive element of the f-block; f→d transitions in Ho, Dy, and Tb and a s→f transition in Pu. At high pressure Sc and Ti become the most electropositive elements, while Ne, He, and F remain the most electronegative ones.",

It turned out to be possible to watch vibrational energy accumulating in three of carbon tetrachloride's modes following initial excitation of O-H and C-H stretches in methanol, in effect making those CCl(4) modes \"molecular thermometers\" reporting on methanol's relaxation. In this paper, we use the example of a CCl(4) molecule dissolved in liquid argon to examine, on a microscopic level, just how this kind of thermal activation occurs in liquid solutions. The fact that even the lowest CCl(4) mode has a relatively high frequency compared to the intermolecular vibrational band of the solvent means that the only solute-solvent dynamics relevant to the vibrational energy transfer will be extraordinarily local, so much so that it is only the force between the instantaneously most prominent Cl and solvent atoms that will significantly contribute to the vibrational friction. We use this observation, within the context of a classical instantaneous-pair Landau-Teller calculation, to show that energy flows into CCl(4) primarily via one component of the nominally degenerate, lowest frequency, E mode and does so fast enough to make CCl(4) an excellent choice for monitoring methanol relaxation. Remarkably, within this theory, the different symmetries and appearances of the different CCl(4) modes have little bearing on how well they take up energy from their surroundings--it is only how high their vibrational frequencies are relative to the solvent intermolecular vibrational band edge that substantially favors one mode over another.",

We use an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation lasting hundreds of nanoseconds to determine the behavior of a single molecule of C60 in a periodic box of water, and compare this to methane. A C60 molecule does not induce drying at the surface; however, unlike a hard sphere methane, a hard sphere C60 solute does. This is due to a larger number of attractive Lennard-Jones interactions between the carbon atom centers in C60 and the surrounding waters. In these simulations, water is not uniformly arranged but rather adopts a range of orientations in the first hydration shell despite the spherical symmetry of both solutes. There is a clear effect of solute size on the orientation of the first hydration shell waters. There is a large increase in hydrogen-bonding contacts between waters in the C60 first hydration shell. There is also a disruption of hydrogen bonds between waters in the first and second hydration shells. Water molecules in the first hydration shell preferentially create triangular structures that minimize the net water dipole near the surface near both the methane and C60 surface, reducing the total energy of the system. Additionally, in the first and second hydration shells, the water dipoles are ordered to a distance of 8 A from the solute surface.

In a \"size-down\" approach, smaller fullerenes are sometimes formed by losing carbon fragments in \"fall-off\" or \"pop-out\" annealing processes under prolonged heating of giant fullerenes, which were self-assembled at initial stages from C2's with lower concentrations. Both roadmaps are found to provide explanations for the appearance of C60 and larger fullerenes in combustion and carbon arc experiments.",

As the temperature is raised, the resistivity increases and the apparent mean free path is correspondingly reduced. In this semi-classical picture, the mean free path cannot be much shorter than the distance, d, between two atoms. This has been confirmed for many systems and was considered to be a universal behaviour. Recently, some apparent exceptions were found, including alkali-doped fullerenes and high-temperature superconductors. However, there remains the possibility that these systems are in exotic states, with only a small fraction of the conduction electrons contributing to the conductivity; the mean free path would then have to be correspondingly larger to explain the observed resistivity. Here we report a model calculation of electron conduction in alkali-doped fullerenes, in which the electrons are scattered by intramolecular vibrations. The resistivity at large temperatures implies l &lt;&lt; d, demonstrating that there is no fundamental principle requiring l &gt; or = d. At high temperatures, the semi-classical picture breaks down, and the electrons cannot be described as quasiparticles.",

Experimental data and their interpretation based on computational results are discussed both for fullerene C60 and C70, with particular attention to the properties of the isolated molecule. Concerning singlet state spectroscopy, it is shown that because of its high symmetry, only dipole-forbidden electronic states are found in the low excitation energy region of C60. Conversely, the lowering of symmetry in C70 leads to several complications in its electronic structure and spectroscopy, due to the presence of weakly allowed transitions in the low excitation energy region. A slightly less congested distribution of low lying excited states characterizes the triplet manifold of the fullerenes. It is concluded that while C60 is important in aiding understanding of the main features in electronic spectroscopy of fullerenes, such as the presence of strong absorptions in the high energy range, its spectra are deeply Influenced by its high symmetry and are very peculiar. On the other hand, C70, with its lower symmetry and more complex spectra, represents a more realistic model for the intricate details of the electronic structure and electronic spectroscopy of larger and smaller fullerenes and their derivatives, which are generally characterized by lower symmetry compared to C60.",

This allows for a full calculation of the population dynamics of the 24-site FMO trimer for long time scales with very little effort, and we present the first fully converged, exact results for the 7-site subsystem of the monomer, and for the full 24-site trimer.

Our exact results are then compared to calculations using the incoherent Förster theory, and it is found that the time scale of energy transfer is roughly the same, regardless of whether or not coherence is considered. This means that coherence is not likely to improve the efficiency of the transfer. In fact, the incoherent theory often tends to overpredict the rates of energy transfer, suggesting that, in some cases, quantum coherence may actually slow the photosynthetic process. ",

We critically compare these theories and assess their accuracy against available photoabsorption and photoelectron spectroscopy data. The first ionization potentials are consistently well reproduced and are similar for all the fullerenes and methods studied.

These results establish the validity of many-body theories as viable alternative to density-functional theory in describing electronic properties of confined carbon nanostructures.

Here we show that the concepts of cage connectivity and frontier π orbitals allow one to understand the relative stability of charged fullerene isomers without performing elaborate quantum chemistry calculations. The latter is not a trivial matter, as the number of possible isomers for a medium-sized fullerene is many more than 100,000. The model correctly predicts the structures observed experimentally and explains why the isolated pentagon rule is often violated for fullerene anions, but the opposite is found for fullerene cations. These predictions are relevant in fields as diverse as astrophysics, electrochemistry and supramolecular chemistry. ",

Our best estimated values are 2520.0 ± 20.7 (C60), 2683.4 ± 17.7 (C70), 2862.0 ± 18.5 (C76), 2878.8 ± 13.3 (C78), 2946.4 ± 14.5 (C84), 3067.3 ± 15.4 (C90), 3156.6 ± 16.2 (C96), 3967.7 ± 33.4 (C180), 4364 (C240) and 5415 (C320) kJ mol(-1).

Using the convergence behavior for the calculated per-atom heats of formation, we obtained the formula ΔfH per carbon = 722n(-0.72) + 5.2 kJ mol(-1) (n = the number of carbon atoms), which enables an estimation of ΔfH for higher fullerenes more generally. A slow convergence to the graphene limit is observed, which we attribute to the relatively small proportion of fullerene carbons that are in \"low-strain\" regions. We further propose that it would take tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of carbons for a fullerene to roughly approach the limit. Such a distinction may be a contributing factor to the discrete properties between the two types of nanomaterials. During the course of our study, we also observe a fairly reliable means for the theoretical calculation of heats of formation for medium-sized fullerenes. This involves the use of isodesmic-type reactions with fullerenes of similar sizes to provide a good balance of the chemistry and to minimize the use of accompanying species. ",
