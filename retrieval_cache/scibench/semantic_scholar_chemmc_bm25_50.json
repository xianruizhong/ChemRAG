Fig. 19a shows that at 3.0 µm, electrons can be generated with sub-Å de Broglie wavelength and high kinetic energies spanning hundreds of eV. Fig. 20a shows that 100 eV electrons can achieve a momentum transfer of approximately between 2 -10 Å for sufficient for accurate structural retrieval. Generating such high kinetic energies is due to the $ scaling of the ponderomotive energy, \" , which arises from the larger distance and longer acceleration time of the free electron in the oscillating electric field of a longer (e.g. mid-infrared, MIR) wavelengths laser pulse. Standard femtosecond laser systems employ Ti:Sapphire technology which have a central wavelength in the near-infrared (NIR) regime of ~0.8 µm, leading to typical electron kinetic energies of tens of eV and a Δ ≈ 4 − 5 Å )( . Thus, nearinfrared sources are therefore insufficient for LIED structural retrieval, requiring longer, MIR driver sources. Performing strong-field physics (SFP) measurements such as LIED in the MIR have additional benefits. Fig. 19c shows that at longer wavelengths (e.g. 3.0 µm), SFP measurements can be performed deeper into the quasistatic (tunnel ionization) regime (i.e. ≪ 1), leading to highly-energetic, classical electron trajectories and enabling the use of classical recollision models in describing SFP phenomena such as LIED. For example, the quantitative rescattering (QRS) model [7,221,222] can calculate and map electron trajectories to measured experimental features, which provides the propagation times and energy of the returning electrons at the instance of rescattering. This enables the study of changes in intensity of the electron signal at different kinetic energies arising from the molecular interference signal, Y , which is dependent on the molecular structure (i.e. Y depends on the internuclear distance of two-centre scatterings). The quasistatic regime (i.e. ≪ 1) can be reached by increasing the peak intensity of the laser field. However, this can lead to significant ionization and fragmentation of the molecular ion, depleting the number of ground-state neutral molecules readily available to perform LIED measurements",

In applying the theory to planar molecules, the corresponding boundary condition is C n point symmetry about an axis perpendicular to the plane [9]. In addition, it is necessary that the holes that are created in the HOMO band when the two electrons are excited are delocalized so as to rule out Frenkel exciton-like excitations where the hole and the excited electron are on the same or neighboring carbon sites. When these conditions are satisfied, there can be paired spin singlet states with energies on the order of several 10s of eV above the LUMO band and characteristic lengths on the scale of the C-C separation [6]. In [1,2] the authors point out that the energy of the 40 eV resonance is related to the distance between neighboring carbon atoms. To see the connection, we make the assumption that the Coulomb pair decays into a zero total momentum state with the two free electrons having the same kinetic energy. We express the energy in terms of the electron mass and the de Broglie wavelength, λ DB . With a resonance energy of 40 eV, we find λ DB = 2.6 Å, a value that is approximately twice the C-C separation of 1.4 Å. A similar argument can be made for the 10 eV resonance, with result that λ DB in this case is 5.2 Å. Expanding the localized state wave function, characterized by the length scale λ LOC , in terms of the symmetrized two-electron plane-wave functions, it becomes evident that plane-wave states with λ DB << λ LOC do not make a significant contribution to the expansion. It follows that the maximum spatial extent of the pair is on the order of λ DB . It should be noted that the introduction of the de Broglie wave presented here pertains to the 'free' electrons that result from the breakup of the bound pair. In contrast, in [1,2] the de Broglie wavelength is associated with the kinetic energy of the bound pair.\n\n\nAnalysis",

The theory is based on the one-dimensional Hubbard model where the resonant absorption of the incoming photon leads to a two-electron quasi-bound state or Coulomb pair. In our analysis, we made extensive use of the numerical and analytical results reported in [10,12]. All the aromatic hydrocarbon molecules that have been studied so far have high-energy resonances at  40 eV that we associate with carbon atoms on the perimeter of the molecule. Unique among the molecules studied, coronene and pyrene also have low energy resonances (10 eV) that we attribute to quasi-bound states of  electrons on carbon atoms inside the perimeter. The difference in the energies of the high and low energy resonances reflects the difference in the magnitude of the parameters U and Uint.\n\nThe high-energy resonances have energies much greater than the transfer integral. In this limit, the resonance peaks are centered at U. In the N-site Hubbard model (N >> 2), when U/t >> 1 there is substructure in the form of satellites at U  4t leading to a half width of 4t [12,13]. For the perimeter sites, the half widths of the high-energy peaks are  10 eV corresponding to a transfer integral  2.5 eV. Wehlitz et al. [1,5] have stressed the point that the high-energy peak is at an energy that matches the kinetic energy of a two-electron quasiparticle with a de Broglie wavelength equal to the C-C separation. Their finding is consistent with the identification of the doubly excited site in the Hubbard model as the analog of a de Broglie-like wave packet.",

This corresponds to an electron kinetic energy of ∼17 eV (see Fig. 6). At this energy or lower, the photoionization would likely probe a coherent delocalized state of water (or, using alternative language, reflect the interference between the photoelectrons ejected from the individual fragments). This is consistent with the recent measurements at low kinetic energies by Signorell and co-workers 21 that show a significant reduction in the β of valence bands from large water clusters. Therefore, at low energies, the single-center expansion of the photoelectron wave function is justified. In contrast, at high energies (e.g., above 150 eV where the photoelectron wavelength is 1Å), it is more appropriate to describe photoionization using localized orbitals. The observed persistent anisotropy of photoelectrons confirms that water's valence orbitals retain their identity, despite being slightly distorted (polarized and hybridized) by their environment. This implies that PES and photoelectron imaging can probe the local electronic structure of a molecule even in a solvent, as long as the ejected photoelectron has a de Broglie wavelength smaller than the proximity of nearby solvent molecules.",

At high kinetic energies (i.e., above 250 eV), β for bulk ionization ranges bulk water ionization can be described as incoherent superposition of the photoionization of individual water molecules rather than photoionization of delocalized entangled states. We can understand this in the context of Sanov and co-worker's molecular interferometer, 38 where the short-time evolution of time-resolved photoelectron images from dissociating I − 2 are discussed in terms of the interference between the two waves coming from the individual atoms. This interference can be described as ionization of a single entangled state spanning both iodine atoms at a short I − 2 bond length. However, at longer times (i.e., at large separations between the atoms) the variation in β ceases and it approaches the asymptotic value corresponding to the PAD of I − . The distance at which the atoms become independent and the coherences die off is related to the energy of the ionizing radiation, which in turn determines the energy of photoelectrons.

In order to further explore activities of photo-generated electrons, gibberellic acid has been spotted on TiO 2 nanoparticles whose band gap is similar as that of zinc oxide but electron mobility is about 20 times lower. However, all other experimental conditions including laser wavelength and strength of electric field voltages were maintained the same as that described for zinc oxide. It was found in this experiment that less fragmentation can be observed when GA was spotted on surfaces of TiO 2 nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 2 (B), the molecular ion (M-1) at m/z 345 is the dominant peak and other fragment ions are relatively very much low abundance. Compared with ZnO, TiO 2 has much lower electron mobility and thus much lower tunneling probability 29 . It has been discovered in our previous work that decreased kinetic energy resulting from decreased electron mobility not only causes decreased tunneling probability but also decreased fragmentations. The result shown in Figure 2 (B) confirms this discovery once again. However, under this situation, fragmentation can still be achieved by increasing the bias voltage between the sample plate and the aperture because photogenerated electrons are accelerated 29 . But it should be mentioned that different fragmentation mechanisms maybe involved and different fragment ions maybe obtained.

Additionally, because their energies are higher than typical ionization potential (7,15 eV), the impact of these hot electrons on organic molecules may be able to kick out lone-pair electrons and initiate extensively subsequent fragmentation. It is shown that the molecular ion at m/z 345 dramatically decreases but several other fragment ions can be observed when the potential difference increases to 40 volts.

This experimental result raises attention to different consequences of two different photo-generated electrons: (1) When bismuth cobalt zinc oxide nanoparticles are used, there is high tunneling probability because of high electron mobility. Kinetic energy obtained from external electric field is only about 20 eV. Therefore ionization of these molecules is caused by exothermic capture of tunneling electrons. (2) When titanium dioxide nanoparticles are used, there is low tunneling probability because of low electron mobility. While increased external electric field increases tunneling probability, these tunneling electrons are also accelerated in the external electric field. Kinetic energy obtained from external electric field is 40 eV or even higher that is high enough to kick out electrons with low ionization potentials such as lone-pair electrons. So ionization of these molecules may be caused by the loss of electrons. Additionally, at 40 eV or higher energies, de Broglie wavelength of electrons is more than organic bond length. These electrons are then able to cause intramolecular vibrational redistribution that may causes extensive non-specific bond cleavages or rearrangements. Taken together, although all these photo-catalytic reactions are caused by unpaired electrons in both two cases, exothermic capture of electrons is mild while electron impact is energetic and produces much more non-specific fragment ions. Elsewhere, stabilities of parent ions and product ions also play important roles in fragmentation pathways. This is in accordance with what have been observed. In addition to electron kinetic energies, we have further demonstrated in this work that fragmentation can also be achieved by increasing the strength of laser influx as shown in Figure 2 (D) where the laser influx was increased from routine 200 units to 250 units.",

The generation of an attosecond electron wavepacket is particularly important for the applications since it offers the possibility to combine an extreme temporal resolution, related to the strongly nonlinear dependence of the tunneling ionization process on pulse intensity, to an extreme spatial resolution, related to the de Broglie wavelength of the ejected electron. For typical energies of this electron the corresponding de Broglie wavelength is of the order of a few Ångströms. Such extreme spatial resolution is at the heart of molecular tomography, which has been proven to be able to reconstruct the molecular orbitals of a few molecules [15][16][17].",

On the other hand, the electron cannot leave the solid and enter the vacuum because it does not have enough energy to overcome the potential barrier. For obvious reasons, the electron cannot simply stop near the surface either [3]. From the quantum mechanical point of view, we can say that all possible final quantum states for that particular electron are forbidden. As all the final quantum states are forbidden, then the initial quantum state is also forbidden. As a result, the density of the quantum states inside the solid will be reduced. A 3D drawing of the solid is shown on Fig. 1b. If we regard the solid as potential energy box, there will be standing de Broglie waves inside the solid. Each standing wave corresponds to the quantum state which could be occupied by the free electron. The number of standing waves inside such a 3D structure is lower than in the case in which there were no indents and all the walls of the solid were plain.\n\nA theoretical analysis that starts with the Schrödinger equation and then calculates the density of the quantum states and diameter of the Fermi sphere in k space shows that the density of the quantum states is dramatically reduced when indents are introduced [4,5]. The calculation was made within the limit of the theory of free electron gas in the metal (later a similar method was used in [6]), and the result is shown on Fig. 2. The indents in the wall cause the density of quantum states to be reduced in whole energy region below the Fermi level (Fig.2b). Once the number of quantum states is reduced, given that there is no reduction in the number of free electrons, electrons are forced to occupy higher energy levels. As a result we have an increase of the Fermi level and a corresponding reduction of the work function. In practice there are two limiting factors in achieving the Avto effect. First, the surface roughness should be less than the de Broglie wavelength of the electron, in order to avoid the scattering of de Broglie waves on the surface and reducing the effect.",

Unfortunately, there is no exact analytical solution for NG geometry.

The LIED technique is based on probing the molecular geometric structure using the molecule's own emitted electron to elastically scatter against the atomic cores in the molecule during strong-field-induced recollisions. The intra-opticalcycle nature of the LIED process enables structural retrieval with subfemtosecond time resolution. Moreover, because of the small de Broglie wavelength of the electrons, the technique provides picometer (pm; 1 pm ¼ 10 À12 m) spatial resolution. Importantly, LIED is sensitive to hydrogen atom scattering as the kinetic energy of scattering electrons in LIED (i.e., 50-500 eV) is significantly lower than the tens or hundreds of keV used in UED. At these low impact energies, hydrogen exhibits significant scattering cross section values compared to those at the high energies and forward-only scattering employed in UED. Presently, improving sensitivity to hydrogen scattering with other methods is challenging. Moreover, the low-energy nature of LIED electrons also provides a probe of the angular dependence of elastic electron scattering, and thus the extraction of doubly differential scattering cross sections.",

We used the core-valence separation variant of EOM-IP-CCSD, fc-CVS-EOM-IP-CCSD [40], and the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. In the pentamer calculation, it was not necessary to enforce multi-core expansion since the five core 1s O orbitals were all localized. The results are shown in Fig. S12. As expected, owing to the localized nature of the 1s O , it has nearly perfect s character, leading to β=2 at energies above 30 eV, although we note a small reduction of β at low energies (<20 eV). The experimentally [1] determined β rises much more slowly, reaching the limiting value of β=2 only at around 100 eV. This slow rise can be attributed to the scattering from hydrogens, which is neglected in our calculations. We note that calculations by Decleva and coworkers [41] do capture this behavior because they include the interaction of the outgoing electron with the core. Nevertheless, these results indicate that for 1s O ionization, the scattering from the hydrogens becomes insignificant at energies considerably lower than one would expect from the de Broglie estimate (100 eV versus ∼160 eV).

A position-sensitive detector, consisting of a microchannel-plate stack, a phosphor screen, and a high-frame-rate camera, was used for counting and two-dimensional momentum-mapping of individual electrons. To lower the impact of focal-volume averaging onto the incident-intensity distribution, intensitydifference photoelectron-momentum maps [50] were obtained using peak intensities of 2.5 and 3.0 × 10 13 W/cm 2 . The resulting range of the ponderomotive potential ∆U p = 0.83 ω = 0.79 eV between these two peak intensities is still too large to resolve nonresonant ATI structures but represents a compromise between incident-intensity resolution and the amount of signal that is left in the intensitydifference momentum maps.

Angular distributions of photoelectrons produced by ionizing the valence band of neat water using X-ray radiation (250-750 eV) show a limited (<30 %) decrease in the β anisotropy parameter compared to the gas phase, indicating that the electronic structure of the individual water molecules can be probed. By theoretical modeling using highlevel electronic structure methods, we show that in a high-energy regime photoionization of bulk can be described as an incoherent superposition of individual molecules, in contrast to a low-energy regime where photoionization probes delocalized entangled states of molecular aggregates. The two regimes-low energy versus high energy-are defined as limiting cases where the de Broglie wavelength of the photoelectron is either larger or smaller than the intermolecular distance between water molecules, respectively. The comparison of the measured and computed anisotropies reveals that at high kinetic energies the observed reduction in β is mostly due to scattering rather than rehybridization due to solvation.Understanding how a solvent affects the electronic properties of solutes is of paramount importance for chemistry. Particularly important are the local solvent structure around solvated molecules and the changes in the shapes and energies of solute's orbitals induced by the interactions with the solvent. Understanding the local structure of water is crucial in the context of solution chemistry, water in confined environments (e.g., biological water), or water on interfaces (e.g., metal surfaces, or electrodes).Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) is a powerful tool for probing electronic structure. 1 The kinetic energies of ejected electrons contain the information about their energy levels within the molecules (molecular orbitals), whereas the photoelectron angular distribution (PAD) encodes the information about the shape of the orbital from which they originate. 2, 3 Although X-ray and ultraviolet PES (XPS 4 and UPS, 5, 6 respectively) were originally developed for gas-phase molecules in high or ultra-high vacuum, 7 the liquid-microjet technique 8 and ambient-pressure instruments 9 have extended PES to the liquid phase, giving rise to an increasing number of XPS and UPS studies of solutions and liquids. 10",

Thus, describing accurately the low-energy part of the spectrum and the parallel momentum (k x ) distribution of the photoelectrons is not essential.

LIED does not rely on the Coulomb explosion of a multiplycharged molecule, and instead uses elastic electron scattering to determine the geometric structure of the singly-charged parent ion. LIED is based on the laser-driven electron recollision process, with Fig. 16 showing the quantum mechanical nature of the recollision process that follows the three-step semi-classical model. Firstly, the field-free electron density distribution in an argon atomic orbital (see = −50 fs) is exposed to a strong laser field, causing strong field ionization and the subsequent emission of an electron wave packet (EWP; see EWP's wave fronts indicated by the blue area at = 0 fs). The EWP is emitted at portions of the laser's electric field with an intensity equal to or greater than the ionization potential of the argon atom, leading to an appreciable ionization probability (see red shaded at = 0 fs). Secondly, a portion of the emitted EWP is accelerated and returned back to the original electron density by the oscillating electric field. Thirdly, at three quarters of an optical cycle after ionization with a 2.0 µm laser field ( = +5 fs), the returning EWP elastically rescatters against the parent ion, generating a rescattered EWP with wave fronts containing interference patterns (see blue area at = +5 fs). Structural information of the target is embedded within the momentum distribution of the rescattered electron which is subsequently detected with a particle spectrometer (e.g. VMI or COLTRIMS REMI). The development of longer, mid-infrared laser sources have enabled the generation of electrons with relatively higher kinetic energies (i.e. 10 2 -10 3 eV order of magnitude). The relatively higher kinetic energies are sufficient to penetrate past the valence electrons, such that rescattering occurs against the core electrons under the first Born approximation. Thus, rescattering occurs close to the nucleus of the atom, and combining this with the sub-Å de Broglie wavelength of the rescattering electron, the atomic positions within the parent molecule can be determined with sub-Å spatial resolution at the time of",

Surface plasmon is absent, since size of the cluster reaches de Broglie wavelength of the electron at the Fermi energy of the metal (E Fermi 0 5.53 eV, 4.28 eV, 5.49 eV, and 7.00 eV for Au, Pt, Ag and Cu, respectively (33)) and it can no longer support the plasmon excitation (5). Their structure is distinctly different from those of nanoparticles and bulk. For instance, the QC Au 13 has an icosahedral structure (6, 10). As it is known, fraction of atoms on the surface plays an important role in determining certain properties and in the case of QCs, fraction of surface atoms is high due to their extremely small core size (1). Electronic confinement occurs due to the protection of the core with the ligand shell and energy levels of the core become discrete. Further, NMQCs exhibit highly polarizable transitions which scale in size with E Fermi /N 1/3 where E Fermi is Fermi energy of the bulk metal and N is the number of atoms (4). Luminescence in them arise from the transitions between the d 0sp interband and sp0sp intraband derived levels and these conduction electron transitions are the low-number limit of plasmons (4,6). Hence, by manipulating the number of atoms in the core, emission wavelength can be tuned. Luminescence combined with the non-cytotoxic nature, unlike the popular semiconductor QD analogues, make them unique for biological applications. NMQCs can be magnetic and may exhibit chirality (6Á8). Although physicochemical, structural and electronic properties of NMQCs are not covered in this short review (which may be found elsewhere (1Á3, 6, 10)), they pose several intriguing questions. For example, one may ask: Where does the transition from icosahedron to fcc start? How many atoms would be needed for plasmons to appear? When would a specific chemical property such as CO reactivity appear? In all of these properties, each atom counts.",

When this frequency is large, the coherences are washed out due to small variations of R AB (due to molecular vibrations or thermal motions in the bulk). However, for small frequencies (when the de Broglie wavelength is shorter than R AB ), the coherences between the waves coming off the two centers cannot be neglected. To reconcile this multi-center treatment with a single-center delocalized picture, it is instructive to think about the coherences in the energy domain. At short distances, the energy gap between the two delocalized states of the dimer is large and one can neglect the coherences between the two waves corresponding to photoionization of each state; this justifies the use of a single-center delocalized treatment. However, at large distances, the two delocalized states are degenerate and cannot be treated independently (in other words, the coherences between them cannot be neglected) -this is why the delocalized single-center expansion is physically incorrect when the energy gap between the delocalized states is small relative to the photon bandwidth of the ionizing pulse. Put differently, if the coherences between the photoelectrons produced from the two states are incorporated into the calculations, the correct behavior would be obtained, following the single-center result at low energies and the multi-center result at high energies. Therefore, the magnitude of coherences depends on the representation. In the spatial domain (localized multi-center representation), coherences can be neglected when the two centers are far apart relative to the de Broglie wavelength of the photoelectron. In the energy domain (delocalized single-center expansion), coherences can be neglected when the two centers are close and the energy gap between the delocalized states is large.",

Though the rotational transitions of individual water molecules correspond to energies orders of magnitude smaller (meV), the point we would like to emphasize is that the dipole-dipole modes of the aromatic networks do not couple to the rotational transition energies of individual water molecules but rather to the collective polarization modes present in the molecular water dipole field. The dipole-dipole modes of the aromatic networks become sources for radiative fields that stimulate this collective polarization, and thus, because this is a field effect, the electronic polarizability of individual water molecules is not involved. See, in particular, Eq. (20), which shows the collective polarization as a function of the phase shift (ω − ω 0 )t between the water dipole field and an individual water molecule. Please note that these polarization modes have been studied in the formalism of quantum electrodynamics since at least the 1980s [30].\n\nFurthermore, the infrared spectrum of liquid water (i.e., the 0.1 -1 eV range) is dominated by the intense absorption due to fundamental O-H stretching vibrations. Though there is no rotational fine structure in this region, the absorption bands are broader than might be expected because of collective behaviors in the water dipole field. Peak maxima for liquid water are observed at 3450 cm The collective polarization modes we describe are Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, which are generated in spontaneous symmetry breaking processes. Specifically, in our case, there is a breakdown of rotational dipole symmetry. In the infinite volume limit, NG modes are massless; however, as an effect of the system boundaries and defects, NG modes acquire a non-zero mass. The NG modes with nearly vanishing mass, as dictated by the Goldstone theorem, are low-energy (low-momentum) modes and thus couple to the longer wavelength range of the spectrum mentioned above. Indeed, in their condensation in the lowest energy state (the ground state), nearly vanishing momentum k implies due to the De Broglie relation (k = h/λ) that low-energy NG modes are quanta associated with long wavelengths (∼10-100 microns, much greater than the size of an individual water molecule). Namely, they contribute to the infrared transitions of the system mentioned above.",

It was noted that the loading of Cu NPs on ZnO nanostructures leads to a decrease in the optical band gap of the nanocomposite, which results in absorption edge redshi. The decrease in the optical band gap energy could be attributed to high density oxygen vacancies and syndromes corresponding to the difference in the ionic radius and electronegativity between the Cu and ZnO ions because of the substitution procedure of Zn 2+ by Cu 2+ in the matrix. E. Gurger et al. have evaluated the optical band gap of ZnO to be 3.24 eV and by introducing Ag and Cu impurity atoms in the nanocomposite, the band gap narrowed to 3.18 eV and 3.12 eV for ZnO-Cu and ZnO-Ag, respectively. 45 Chakraborty et al. 46 found that copper doping decreases the electron-hole recombination, and the optical band gap value was reduced from 3.21 eV (ZnO) to 3.07 eV (Zn 0.9 Cu 0.1 O); these values are similar to our results. In addition, these impurities created a special imperfection, which seems to raise the Fermi level toward the conduction band. 47,48 The light absorption in the semiconductor nanocomposites results in the transportation of the valence band electrons to a particular state through the conduction band to provide electron in the conduction band and hole in the valence band. If the size of the nanoparticle is equal to the de Broglie wavelength, then the conduction band is regarded as a quantum cavity of the electrons.

A decreasing in the optical band gap energy could be ascribed to the increase in density of vacancies by oxygen and disorders according to the ionic radius differences between the Cu and Co ions as a result of the substitution process. The decrease in values of the energy of the bandgap could be attributed to quantum confinement effect. As a result of the light absorption in the nanomaterial semiconductors the valance band electrons transport to a particular position in a conduction band to produce electron hole-pair in the two bands respectively, when the nanoparticle size is identical to the wavelength of de Broglie the conduction band considers as a quantum hole for the electrons.

Quantum interference of de Broglie waves leads to a reduction in the density of possible quantum states of electrons inside the solid and increases the Fermi energy level. This effect was studied theoretically within the limit of the quantum theory of free electrons inside the metal. It has been shown that if a metal surface is modified with patterned indents, the Fermi energy level will increase and consequently the electron work function will decrease. This effect was studied experimentally in both Au and SiO 2 thin films of special geometry and structure. Work function reductions of 0.5 eV in Au films and 0.2 eV in SiO 2 films were observed. Comparative measurements of work function were made using the Kelvin Probe method based on compensation of internal contact potential difference. Electron emission from the same thin films was studied by two independent research groups using Photoelectron Emission Microscopy (PEEM).*\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe wave properties of electrons inside a solid are well known and understood.",

Recent studies have found that pseudobosons are present in only certain \"aromatic\" compounds such as benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and coronene to name a few, but not in other supposedly \"aromatic\" compounds [18]. These compounds were investigated after experimental studies on other large molecules [19,20]. The evidence is a hump in the double to single photoionization ratio at an energy of about 38.3 eV. To obtain this match requires a particle of mass 2e, a pseudoboson; then, the de Broglie wavelength equals an average carbon -carbon bond length of 1.4 A in order to obtain consistency. Thus, it seems appropriate to present some new theoretical considerations in this area and discuss their connections with this and other possible experiments.\n\n3b. Theoretical. The benzene correlation energy is estimated to be 4 eV 3 [21,22,23], which suggests vibrational modes may be involved in the stability. Coherent phonons have been suggested for some time as correlation partners with electronic modes [24]. Indeed, a charge density wave (CDW) has almost identical equations to a SC since they have the same Peierls' origin [25], so a suitable vibrational correlation partner could be characterized as a CDW which optimizes the nuclei's position to further reduce energy. Considerable literature has been devoted to the competition between a CDW and SC, but several recent Hubbard model studies have suggested that there are regions where they can possibly coexist [26,27,28]; other studies are not supportive [29].\n\nOur approach rearrangements deviates from the usual Huckel's  solution which is two opposite spin electrons in the same angular momentum state. We choose pairing a +n α spin with -n β spin, and vise-versa for all of these orbitals; then, these are pairs of time-reversed states, all with angular moment 0 l = , resulting in s-(or extended s-) wave states [30] which have an energy gap. This arrangement leads to three pseudobosons which should equilibrate and all occupy the bosonic ground state, the lowest electronic energy state of the system.",

These so-called laser-assisted electron recollisions (LAERs) [1] play a critical role in shaping the observable photoelectron and high-harmonic emission spectra. For strong-field ionization in slowly varying laser fields (i. e., at wavelengths in the near infrared and longer), LAERs have been rationalized in the framework of the quantitativerescattering (QRS) theory [2,3]. This approach predicts that certain cuts through the three-dimensional (3D) photoelectron momentum distribution reflect the differential scattering cross sections (DCSs) of the field-free electron-molecular-ion scattering process. In the regime of high electron impact energies, the atoms of a molecule can be treated as point scatterers, an approximation that is known as the independent-atom model (IAM) [4].

The same cuvettes were used as for UV-Vis measurements. The detector is based on a gaseous electron multiplier (GEM) similar to those developed for use as large-area detectors in particle physics experiments [33][34][35] . The responsivity of the UV detector depends on its quantum efficiency (QE) and electron multiplication gain. The relative QE for a typical GEM detector was measured and is shown in Fig. 2a, together with the estimated transmittance of the water and cuvette walls. Note that the precise QE curve varies slightly from one GEM to another, but the main shared features are (1) zero QE above a threshold corresponding to the work function and (2) steadily increasing QE below threshold and (3) similarity to a reported quantum yield curve for Cu 36 . The gain varies slightly from experiment to experiment but is a constant across the spectrum. The detector automatically filters out visible light and soft UV light. Note that we have linearly extrapolated the QE curve below the measurement limit of 235 nm (this only affects measurements made with a deuterium lamp, being below the LED wavelength range). Figure 2b shows the combined spectral characteristics for the light source-cuvette-detector system, modelled by multiplying the spectrum of the light source by the transmittance and QE. Manufacturer data were used to define the light source spectra for a deuterium lamp and 3 LEDs with centre wavelengths 250, 280 and 310 nm. Because the QE is low near the threshold of the GEM detector, the spectral response of the 310 nm LED is weakest. It grows progressively larger for the 280 and 250 nm LEDs, with little overlap, and is strongest but broadest for the deuterium lamp. This suggests that even simple transmittance measurements at two wavelengths could provide some spectral information about substances with absorption peaks or edges in the 200-300 nm range. Figure 3 shows total normalised transmitted intensity for KHP at different concentrations using two light sources. It is immediately clear that the transmitted intensity decreases with increasing concentration much more quickly for illumination by the deuterium lamp than for the 250 nm LED. This is explained by the different overlap between the spectral response function (Fig. 2) and the absorption spectrum (Fig. 1).",

When the particle size is comparable to, or even larger than, the wavelength of photons that interact with it, the optical responses of these large metal nanoparticles to external electromagnetic fields are simply dependent on their sizes, free-electron density and their nearly bulk-like dielectric function relative to that of the surrounding medium; therefore, they can be quantitatively described with the Mie theory [3,5]. When the particle size approaches the electron mean free path (∼50 nm for Au) [3,5], the dielectric function and refractive indices become strongly size-dependent [2,3,5]. Generally, these two classes of metal nanostructures possess diameters larger than 2 nm. The third kind of particles have sizes comparable with the Fermi wavelength of an electron. The optical, electronic and chemical properties demonstrate large differences with respect to those in the other two size regimes. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that the particles with diameters larger than 2 nm are called nanoparticles, particles smaller  [39], The Royal Society of Chemistry © 2010.) than 2 and 1 nm are generally called NCs and sub-NCs, respectively [6,7]. In view of the similarity between NCs and sub-NCs in many regards (such as preparation approaches, structural features and luminescent behaviors), hereafter we will refer to clusters with sizes smaller than 2 nm as NCs.

The high-spin peak at Ϸ630 nm in the wild type enzyme is still visible in the variant (Fig. 1). No evidence for the formation of (low-spin) hydroxide-bound heme was observed at alkaline pH (data not shown); hence, the low-spin species was tentatively assigned as arising from coordination of an (internal) protein ligand.\n\nReaction of ferric W41A with various noncatalytic ligands is informative because it allows us to assess whether the proposed protein ligand is reversibly or irreversibly bound to the metal.

From the position of the modes in the transmission spectrum of Fig. 4(b), the physical thickness of the microcavity is found to be around 5.8 ± 0.2 μm. As shown in Fig. 5(a), above the laser threshold, dual wavelength laser emission was observed in both devices.

The FWHM of the laser modes was found to be around 1 nm, which is the resolution limit of our spectrometer. This dual wavelength laser emission is presumably due to the large pump spot size area used in this work.

The fruit juice products were labelled as samples A to J while the soft drink samples were labelled L to T.\n\n\nPreparation of Standards and Samples\n\nIndividual standard stock solutions (1000 mgL −1 ) of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate were prepared in distilled water. Working standard solutions for each of the preservative were prepared by diluting the stock solutions appropriately with distilled water to give concentrations between 50 mg L −1 to 300 mg L −1 . Hydrochloric acid (0.4 mL, 6 M) were added to a 5 mL portion of each standard solution and then extracted with 45 mL Petroleum ether.

However, it has been demonstrated that in some acrylic resins ITX can be used without a coinitiator, in a Type I process (Harke et al., 2012). Based on its absorption spectrum, ITX would appear likely to be excited by 2PA using light at wavelengths in the 800 nm range. However, experiments by Mueller et al. on a photoresist composed of ITX and pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) monomers suggested that excitation at 800 nm involves 4-photon absorption (Mueller et al., 2014). Such remarkably efficient 4-photon polymerization would be highly advantageous for high-speed, high-resolution MAP fabrication (Mueller et al., 2014). In contrast, Z-scan experiments have indicated that ITX in a solvent can be excited by 2PA at wavelengths in the 800 nm region (Kuebler et al., 1999). These results are not necessarily inconsistent, as promotion of an electron to the lowest excited singlet state of ITX might not lead to photopolymerization. On the other hand, the feature sizes reported for MAP for ITX-based photoresists with 800 nm excitation closely resemble what would be expected for 2PA. These seemingly contradictory results highlight the potential complexity of the determination of the true order of nonlinear absorption in multiphoton photoresists.

Our results showed a 21% increased evaporation rate was achieved following addition of methylene blue dye at a concentration of 200 ppm, whereas the highest increase (51%) was achieved with the biological approach. Methylene blue has two absorbance wavelength ranges (200-350 and 550-700 nm), whereas the pigments produced by halophilic bacteria often absorb maximally in the wavelength range (400-600 nm). This happens (through evolution) to correspond to the wavelength range of maximum solar energy output and, depending on what they are dissolved in, have a molar extinction coefficient that matches or exceeds that of methylene blue: Astaxanthin -125 000 in DMSO; bacterioruberin -141 000 in acetone; methylene blue -70 000 in water. Therefore astaxanthin and bacterioruberin should perform as well or better at absorbing and transferring solar energy (electronic excitation converted to energy of motion in the atoms of the pigment) to a body of water than dyes such as methylene blue. This is why the pigment produced by CP5-4 and EP3 perform  as well or better at absorbing and transferring solar energy compared to methylene blue (Harbeck, 1955;Moore and Runkles, 1968). In this study, the EP3 and CP5-4 pigment production was not constitutive, where pigmentation was absent when cultured in the NuWater brine, whereas pigmentation was observed in the synthetic brine supplemented with TSB. Schobert and Jahn (2002) proposed that changes in environmental conditions could lead to this as a result of an adaptation of the energy conserving electron transport chain and cofactors of various enzymes and thus causing significant changes in pigment production (Sutthiwong et al., 2014). The biological roles of ions such as potassium, magnesium, sodium, calcium and other transition elements like metal ions in microbes are difficult to study because they interact weakly with carrier ligands (Bhosale, 2004).

Some natural water data were also obtained (see Supplementary Material) and the flume data were obtained with unpurified water from the building's supply. The standard for UV spectrometry was 10 mg/L with several other dilutions measured to check concentrations. A Jasco V-660 UV-Vis spectrometer was employed with the solutions placed in standard quartz glass cuvettes of 10 mm optical path length. For the threshold absorbance measurements, UV LEDs supplied by ThorLabs Inc. were used. Solutions were placed in the same quartz glass cuvettes and mounted in front of a threshold UV detector. The transmitted intensity was measured for a series of dilutions of each contaminant, and several mixtures were also studied. The UV detector is based on a gaseous electron multiplier (GEM) operating in atmospheric pressure of argon. Electrons photoemitted from the GEM front face, around 10 mm by 10 mm in area and at ground potential, are accelerated through holes in the GEM on to an anode at around 1 kV positive potential. Multiplication of the photoelectron current takes place as electrons are accelerated through the argon gas and cause a collision cascade, providing a gain of around 10 3 . A picoammeter mounted directly behind the GEM housing measures the total drain current which is proportional to the intensity of UV light arriving at the GEM front face, weighted by the quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength. Since photons below a wavelength threshold defined by the work function cannot generate photoelectrons the device acts as a high-pass energy filter (low-pass wavelength filter) and can be described as a visible-blind thresholding detector. The quantum efficiency increases as the wavelength decreases below the threshold. No change of detector response is observed with changes in ambient lighting and even under direct illumination by a high power white LED torch (5 W), no signal is measured.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1Absorption spectra for metaldehyde, clothianidin, tryptophan, thiamethoxam, potassium hydrogen pthalate (KHP) and uric acid, at 10 mg/L for 10 mm optical path.Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:3682 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83322-w",

This supports the hypothesis from simulation-based studies that suggest that sperm cells swim more efficiently in highly viscous media by adjusting their flagellar waveform [47]. In this study, it is predicted that, by decreased cell yawing and reduced wavelength, the sperm cell increases its power output in higher viscosity by a factor of four. The change in flagellar waveform induces a greater efficacy (velocity per mechanical power) of the sperm motion, thereby reducing the need for increased energy expenditure. Our study also reveals that increasing the viscosity of the medium does not improve the separation power of sperm cohorts based on metabolic differences, because no differences in metabolic rates are observed in these settings. We, therefore, recommend that higher viscosity should not be used to separate sperm; among others this is to avoid the possibility of the Brynhild effect [48]. This effect applies if separation or quality control thresholds for sperm are set too high, in either the female or in artificial settings, sperm may actually incur reduced functionality or higher energy expenditure (as our data suggest) and not be useful for fertilisation. For example, a threshold that requires large energy expenditure may select for sperm utilising oxphos, which results in 15 times more ATP compared to glycolysis. However, oxphos, responsible for~90% of a cell's ROS production [49], may increase ROS damage of cell membranes and DNA [49] thereby reducing sperm function and disabling the threshold [50].

Unfortunately, during the preparation process, the oxide can easily agglomerate what leads to a material with an unsatisfactory catalytic performance. To optimize the performance and inhibit the aggregation of the catalyst, the use of MCM-41 as support have been recommended.\n\nIn 2015, H. Entezari et al.\n\n[123] studied the encapsulation of TiO2 within the silica framework for the removal of sulphur compounds of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The authors reported that the catalytic activity of supported TiO2 was higher than the unsupported ones due to long-lived photo induced charge separation, large pore size and high specific surface of MCM-41, which can adsorb some bulky species. However, TiO2 exhibits low catalytic activity under visible light conditions because it has a large band gap energy of 3.2 eV corresponding to a threshold wavelength of 388 nm. In order to overcome such issue, the doping of the silica framework with non-metallic elements such as carbon, sulphur and nitrogen have become an interesting strategy for improving the visible light activity of the catalyst.

TEA was selected because it served as a competing base for the less availability of octadecylsilane (ODS) stationary phase. The binding of TEA with the stationary phase reduced the prolonged retention time for L-lysine hydrochloride and LCLT also rectified the peak tailing. Several important factors were taken care of while selecting the suitable pH for the mobile phase. The optimal pH range while using silica column was kept between 2-8 as the stationary phase selected did not withstood pH less than 2 (phase loss due to hydrolysis). Conversely the pH greater than 8 did not work either because of ODS dissolution. Since L-lysine hydrochloride and LCLT contain amine functional group so pH ±1 of its pKa worked best for protonation of amines. Therefore, the final pH 7.5 provided excellent resolution and retention time. Phosphate buffers are also regarded as best as they can provide range of multiple options of buffer range for the compounds containing both amino and carboxyl groups with UV/Vis detector below 220 nm wavelength. Therefore, the buffer used for this experiment was potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Other buffers tried were acetate and citrate. Acetate buffer could hardly manage the desired pH value whereas the citrate buffer was not in agreement with UV/Vis detector below 220 nm. The wavelength selected for this experiment after scanning the standard solution in mobile phase at pH 7.5 in range of 190-380 nm.

The ion yield at a given fluence can be evaluated by integrating the TOF distributions in time. To obtain the values proportional to the total number of the plume particles at various fluences, this procedure should be corrected for angular distributions of expanding particles as a function of their velocity (usually fast plume species are more forward directed than slow ones [7,8]). The angular distributions were not measured in this work, but, since the ion velocity distributions are similar for different conditions (Fig.2), such a correction is not necessary for Si + ions. Figure 3 shows the yields of plume ions as a function of laser fluence for three laser wavelengths. These dependencies show a steep gradient that is nearly identical for 800 and 400-nm wavelengths. For 266-nm, it is slightly weaker. We note that the total number of detected particles varies by around 6 orders of magnitude in the studied fluence ranges. The threshold fluences, F th , for ion appearance in the plume, as deduced from MS measure- ments are around 100, 40, and 10 mJ/cm 2 for 800, 400, and 266 nm, respectively. It should be noted that our ion detection system has a high sensitivity to detect a single plume ion. As a result, the obtained values correspond to the real thresholds for ion appearance but not to the ion detection threshold. Cluster ions Si + n were observed throughout the laser fluence range studied, even at very low fluences close to the threshold for Si ions (at least for dimers). The clusters are found to be considerably slower than atomic ions. At near-threshold fluences, the TOF distributions for Si + 2 dimers are maximized at t d ∼ =18 µs for all wavelengths. The most probable velocity of the dimers is, therefore, approximately two times lower than that of Si + . This means that these plume particles have nearly the same momentum under these conditions. However, the Si + 3 trimers are faster than it would be expected for constant momentum (the TOF distributions are maximized at around 21 µs).",

From the most polar (water) to nonpolar (toluene) solvents investigated, we observed the increase in FQY from 2% to 69.3%, a 35-fold fluorescence enhancement (Figure 1b). Using the empirical polarity parameter E T (30) or its normalized value E N T [45], a general linear correlation between FQY and E N T can be observed ( Figure 1c, red line). This solventdependent FQY change is corroborated by a previous report on a red-shifted (versus p-HBDI) fluorescent aminated derivative of a conformationally locked GFP chromophore (compound 2b in that work) without the meta-OH group [46], which shows a smaller increase in FQY from water (5%) to dioxane (78%) and bluer emission (e.g.,~564 nm in water, 552 nm in ACN, and 532 nm in dioxane) than compound 1 in this work. In addition, the opposite direction of the chromophore emission wavelength change from water to ACN for these two aminated compounds suggests the important role played by the meta-OH group on the P-ring, both spatially (steric hindrance with the adjacent para-NMe 2 group) and electronically (double-donor strategy in effectively red-shifting the emission peak), for compound 1 to acquire the appealing properties (e.g., prominent fluorogenicity, high sensitivity of TICT formation rate to solvent polarity/H-bonding parameters) as dissected and discussed in detail below.",

Beer's law, which is the basis of quantitative work, is based on the assumption of monochromatic radiation. Additionally, in an emission mode, the most favourable signal ratio between the background and the analytical emission lines must be selected. To isolate a narrow band of wavelengths, filters or monochromators are used. However, we used the interference filters in the improved photometric system. These are optical filters that remove unwanted wavelengths of light by interference phenomena rather than by absorbance or scattering. They can be made to transmit a very narrow band of wavelengths. This type of filter is composed of an externally thin dielectric layer sandwiched between two semireflecting metallic films. The characteristic curve of the interference filter is shown in figure 2.\n\nThe system had a dual optical system. Both the reference and sample beam emanate from a single source.

Despite the vast biochemical data regarding the importance of metal ions for efficient protein synthesis and the increasing number of ribosome structures solved by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy, the assignment of metal ions within the ribosome remains elusive due to methodological limitations. Here we present extensive experimental data on the potassium composition and environment in two structures of functional ribosome complexes obtained by measurement of the potassium anomalous signal at the K-edge, derived from long-wavelength X-ray diffraction data.

The sharp intensity increase in the XPS spectra of Ag and Au correspond to their d-band energies (with respect to the Fermi level of the metal), which are in good agreement with the optical interband energy thresholds of the pure metals (∼2.3 eV for Au and 3.7 eV for Ag). Unlike the pure metallic PNPs, the alloy PNPs exhibit a valence band spectrum without a sharp intensity increase, and, therefore, a distinct interband energy threshold cannot be assigned to them. Instead of a sharp transition, the alloy d-band density of states increases progressively ( Figure 6) from ∼2.3 eV (interband energy threshold of Au) to ∼3.7 (interband energy threshold of Ag). Within this transition energy region the alloy is expected to generate less visible-light-induced interband excitations than Au due to the decrease in the d-band density of states revealed by the XPS spectra (cf. dashed arrow in Figure 6). A decrease in interband excitations increases the probability of intraband excitations (generation of energetic hot electrons), which can explain the visible light HEI response between ∼450 and ∼520 nm of the alloy PNPs (green data points in Figure 5A). Nevertheless, even though the XPS spectrum of alloy PNPs exhibits a more limited d-band density",

Emission optical spectra of products of gasification of coal of grade B2 of the Baganur coal deposit. Similar bands, of a higher intensity, were observed in emission optical spectra recorded during the gasification of coal of the J grade of the Kuznetsk coal deposit (Fig. 3). In the experience of gasification of solid fuel at temperatures of 900-990 °C, it is possible to expect the appearance in gasification products of spectral bands of methane CH 4 molecules, whose molecules are destroyed at temperatures in the reaction zone 1800-2000 °C of this work. To determine the temperature of the sample surface, the dependence of the spectral radiation intensity of the sample on the wavelength in the Wien coordinates [10] was used in the wavelength range of the emission continuum of 600-1000 nm (Fig.  4). When decoding the optical emission spectra of gasification products of all the listed solid fuel samples, the presence of sodium doublet lines with wavelengths of 589.0 and 589.6 nm was observed. For most spectra, the sodium doublet is represented by high intensity values. Based on the results of the spectral analysis of the five original solid fuel samples, only CO was detected from the combustible components of the synthetic gas. Therefore, the maximum value of the heat of combustion of the synthetic gas obtained after the processes of high-temperature plasma gasification can be no more than 12.63 MJ/m 3 . The purpose of the future experimental work is to carry out experiments to determine the optical emission spectra of the gasification products described in this work samples of the initial solid fuel with imitation of steam, air and steam-air blasting, as well as a decrease in the temperature in the reaction zone to 900-990 ºC at which there will be no Destruction",

In the former approach, nanopores were simply soaked in a bulk solution of the reagents, whereas in the latter approach, the nanopores were exposed to reagent in a typical nanopore sensing configuration and applied voltage was used to drive the reagents into the nanopore. In an extension of this work, coating with 1 was tried in situ on a large pore whose diameter, based on conductance, was estimated to be about 88 nm.

After extended soaking in the methanol-based TBACl electrolyte and return to the aqueous potassium chloride-based electrolyte, the conductance was no longer zero, but was 57 rather 4 nm. In both instances of in situ silane coating, a measureable reduction in the nanopore conductance, suggesting a reduction in its diameter, was recorded. The inability to detect DNA in the larger pore, coupled with the variability in modeldependent inferred nanopore diameter, suggested the need for additional characterization steps, however.

His results on the other hand often seem to approximate to such a formula with very small A and y at low temperatures (30° C.) and the same formula with larger A and y at higher temperatures (200° C.). This is explained by Richardson on a theory of patches with two thresholds. This theory of patches also accounts for the abnormal difficulty in getting saturation in the thermionic current at low temperatures. The photoelectric threshold has been observed for the same specimens in the same condition and is always greater than the greater value of the apparent work function.\n\nIt is interesting to compare with these observations what the theory gives us according to equation (8') bearing in mind condition (9).

In the intermediate region we get a steady change over from one type of emission to the other. This is almost exactly what Richardson observes, except perhaps that his curves straighten out before A has quite reached its normal value and when y + B -C is still somewhat less than the y for a clean surface, a detail which must not be over emphasised at this stage.

The excitation source for NT-PS is a Ti:sapphire laser system with a central wavelength of 800 nm, 82 MHz repetition rate, a pulse power of 1.5 W and a pulse duration of 100 fs. The output is frequency quadrupled by using two beta-barium borate crystals leading to the fourth harmonic of the fundamental with a photon energy of 5.95 eV. For both the UPS and the NT-PS the light incident angle was 45 • . The emitted photoelectrons are energy and spin selected by a spin detector based on spin polarized low-energy electron diffraction (Focus SPLEED) mounted on a commercial cylindrical sector analyzer (Focus CSA).

The change in work function with increasing Al(OP) 3 coverage extracted from the UPS spectra is depicted in the inset of figure 2. We observe a reduction of the work function with increasing Al(OP) 3 coverage up to 1.5 nm. This reduction is caused by a negative interface dipole with strength = −1.5 eV. This value is virtually identical to the interface dipole observed for the Co/Alq 3 system [11]. Note that the work function is almost constant for coverage above 1.5 nm (indicated by the vertical line in the graph), suggesting that at this nominal coverage the Co is completely covered by Al(OP) 3 molecules [19,20].

Non-thermal electrons have energy significantly above the Fermi level, a threshold energy level for electrons to engage in chemical reactions or leave the particle (ionization). Due to the electron-electron scattering effect, the non-thermal electron population becomes unstable for further thermalization, and the excess energy is redistributed among all the electrons in the particle, leading to hot electrons ( Figure 4C). The hotelectron population having a longer lifetime is responsible for chemical reactivity after plasmon excitation. Finally, as shown in Figure 4D, due to the electron-electron and, electron-phonon scattering the heat from the hot-electron is redistributed to the whole NP and increases its overall temperature resulting in photothermal effect (Kim et al., 2017;Carrasco et al., 2020). Most importantly, the rationale for designing plasmonic metallic NPs with desirable plasmonic properties i.e., LSPR and generated thermal energy is directly correlated with fine-tuning of their optical response which is greatly influenced by several factors such as the size and shape of metal NPs, the configuration of metal NPs, the wavelength of the incident light, dielectric function of the NPs and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium (Kelly et al., 2003;Khlebtsov and Dykman, 2010;Rycenga et al., 2011;Manzhos et al., 2021).

Briefly, the chemical enhancement mechanism of SERS in widely used metal nanoparticles contributes to the total enhancement effect only on the order of 10-100, whereas the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism is thought to be responsible for spectral enhancement as high as 10 6 times [31]. Thus, the electromagnetic enhancement should enhance the molecular spectra by a huge amount. Nevertheless, the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism depends strongly on the charge carrier concentration in materials and thus their metallic properties.\n\nDuring the last decade, the metallic properties of MXenes were investigated rather comprehensively. Similar to other 2D semimetals [16], MXenes show plasmonic behavior and the negative real part of the dielectric function in the near-infrared range [17,34,42,46]. Experimental findings for highly oriented MXene films reveal that at wavelengths longer than 1000 nm, the real part of the dielectric function becomes negative, indicating the onset of free-electron plasma oscillations [17,42,46]. The wavelength threshold at which MXene films become metallic depends on the film thickness [34,46], and thus can be slightly shifted. Furthermore, SEM [22] and atomic force microscopy [55] images clearly reveal the structure of MXenes as the flakes are packed in the form of multilayer sheets. After the delamination, these sheets part out. Extended studies of optical properties of the monolayer flake revealed that the free-electron plasma oscillations occur in two spectral regions: (I) at wavelengths longer than 885 nm and (II) in the narrow 615-740 nm region [42]. The surface plasmon in the latter region was assigned to transversal plasmon resonance (1.7 eV). The transversal plasmon resonance is insensitive to the size and shape of the flake, but it depends on the concentration of free charge carriers that can be altered with the different terminal groups [17,34,42,46].",

The temperature was set at 25°C. To make the LIP-N003G or LIP-SM complex, the LIP stock solutions and N003G or SM stock solutions, respectively, were mixed in phosphate buffer. The resultant mixture was equilibrated for 2 min before recording the steady-state fluorescence spectrum.\n\n\nStopped-flow measurements\n\nThe stopped-flow experiments were conducted on an Applied Photophysics Model SX20 stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter fitted with a xenon lamp. All reactions were performed in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 25°C with an LIP concentration of 5.88 μM and an N003G concentration of 600 μM. A volume of 50 μL was injected from each syringe each time, and the reported concentrations are the concentration observed in the reaction chamber. The fluorescence emission intensity was monitored at wavelengths above 310 nm using a 305-nm cut-off filter with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and a slit width of 1 nm.\n\n\nLDH efflux measurements\n\nFor determination of the LDH efflux from the cells, the medium was centrifuged to remove floating cells. Next, the supernatant was mixed with the solution of the LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Takara), and the optical densities at 490 nm were measured with a microplate reader model 550 (Bio-Rad). The amounts of leaked LDH were determined and represented as percentages of the LDH activity obtained after treatment of the cells with 1% (w/ v) Triton X-100.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Differences between treatment groups were determined by Student's t-test. P < 0.05 was set as the threshold for significance (*P<0.05, **P < 0.01).

[71], where the wavelength-dependent reaction rate measurements were performed at constant illumination intensity (250 mW/cm 2 ) of a white light source. Instead of using bandwidth limited sources (as e.g., in [28,69,70]), the authors of [71] measured the reaction rate for 7 different spectral bandwidths obtained by sending the illuminating light through a series of 7 long pass filters. The cutoff wavelength (the shortest wavelength at which the light can pass through) of these pass filters are, respectively, λ 1 = 400 nm, λ 2 = 425 nm, λ 3 = 450 nm, λ 4 = 500 nm, λ 5 = 550 nm, λ 6 = 625 nm and λ 7 = 675 nm (Here we denote the corresponding measured reaction rates asR(λ n )). Then they plotted the reaction rate difference (R(λ n ) −R(λ n−1 ))/(λ n − λ n−1 ) as a function of λ n . which corresponds to that of the light source used in that experiment. Peculiarly, however, the spectral peak of the Ag NPs used in this experiment occurs at much shorter wavelengths (∼ 430 nm, see the Supplemental Information in [25]).\n\nIn order to explain this observation, we revisit the thermal calculations we performed for this structure in [25] and follow the procedure described in [71] to calculate the reaction rate as a function of the cutoff wavelength. Specifically, first, to account of the non-uniform thermal conductivity in the system, we use COMSOL Multiphysics to perform a series of temperature calculations of the sample in which we mimic the experiment by cutting off the photons of the light source with wavelengths shorter than the threshold of the filter used in the measurement. To do that, we extend our formulation Eq. (1) in Section. 2 and Eq. (??) in Supplementary Information Section ??",

This is consistent with the previously proposed PSC model. 34 This simple model assumes (i) perfectly spherical particles, (ii) a constant surface charge density across a copolymer series regardless of the copolymer composition, and (iii) that there is no solvent present within the nanoparticle (i.e., x sol = 0). In this prior study, it was found that a critical fractional surface coverage (SA frac. ) by anionic (B) units is required for colloidal stability. The spherical nanoparticle surface area can be calculated from the particle radius (R).

Alternatively, if all of the B units are buried within the nanoparticle cores, k equals 0. In the latter case, the nanoparticles are not colloidally stable (N B,p tends to infinity, suggesting that an infinitely large particle would be required to form a stable dispersion). Since the size of particles formed by statistical copolymers is independent of their molecular weight, the chosen definition of N B,p (eq 1) enables the molecular weight to be excluded from the calculation.",

In contrast, the models of §3.2.4 with a higher CO depletion factor have a clearer structure of D N 2 H + frac following column density. Therefore, we try a series of combinations of initial OPR H 2 and CO depletion to survey whether D N 2 H + frac can have a stronger correlation with column density.

From the results of these eight models, initial OPR H 2 does not appear to enhance the spatial structure of D N 2 H + frac . Although the initial OPR H 2 does not further enhance the spatial structure, the models with high CO depletion factor and low initial OPR H 2 still show the possibility to obtain high values of D N 2 H + frac .

This dual approach produced new SA frac. values based on the real composition of the particle surfaces measured by SANS. Moreover, the linear relationship between log P and SA frac. remained valid for the new data (Figure 6a). A new linear regression was fit to the data, yielding SA frac. = 0.110 × log P − 0.085. This new equation can be used to predict particle size if it is assumed that k remains constant in the PSC model. The cationic copolymer series was similarly reanalyzed. Combining the data obtained for the anionic and cationic series (Figure 6b) produces a linear relationship (R 2 = 0.96) between log P and the modeled SA frac. (k = 0.5). This highlights the self-consistency of the refined PSC model. Finally, the linear equation representing the relationship between log P for the hydrophobic comonomer and the modeled SA frac. for the MAA copolymers crosses the x-axis (i.e., SA frac. = 0) at a log P value of between 0.5 and 1. This suggests that, at this log P value, the nanoparticles would require no ionic comonomer to be located at the surface to confer colloidal stability. Alternatively, a comonomer exhibiting a log P of between 0.5 and 1, or below 0.5, would not be sufficiently hydrophobic to induce self-assembly, hence, such copolymers would remain molecularly dissolved in an aqueous solution.\n\n\n■ CONCLUSIONS",

According to the PWL condition (Perdew et al., 1982), for the ground-state energy of systems (of M electrons) with fractional number of electrons (δ), the energy versus δ curve should be a straight line connecting the values at integer. It can be expressed as\nE frac N ( ) E N ( ) − E PWL N ( ), N M + δ, E PWL N ( ) 1 − δ ( )E M ( ) + δE M + 1 ( ), 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1, E PWL N ( ) 1 + δ ( )E M ( ) − δE M − 1 ( ), −1 ≤ δ ≤ 0, ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭(68)\nwhere E(N) and E PWL (N) define the energy and PWL interpolation of energy for fractional number of electrons, respectively. Here, E frac is a measure of deviation from PWL behavior. Depending on the choice of range, two different cases arise; when E frac < 0, the curve is convex and it is concave for E frac > 0. The well-known DFAs meet certain challenges, resulting in a smooth convex curve, whereas EEX demonstrates reverse trend. RSH functionals which comprise these two ingredients have shown improvement in this direction (Mori-Sánchez et al., 2006). According to Janak's theorem (Janak, 1978), for (G)KS HOMO, the change in ϵ HOMO as a function of fractional occupation number should be straight line. This is then followed by a finite jump at integer point (due to derivative discontinuity). After that again, the variation should be a straight line till the following integer point. With this realization, fractional occupation number n i , is introduced in density (ignoring degeneracy in HOMO and spin indices) as\nρ r ( ) i n i |ϕ i r ( )| 2 , n i 0, i> i max δ, i i max 1, i< i max ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ,(69)\nwhere i max corresponds to the HOMO level.",

The total thermal energy is determined assuming Maxwellian distribution of the particles: the electrons with a temperature profile T e (r, t), and all the ions with the same radial profile T i (r, t).

The model considers every single coiled coil to fold two-state like in thermodynamic equilibrium. The ratio between unfolded and folded coiled coils is Boltzmann-distributed where the energetic difference G(F) between the two states depends on the applied force F [23]:\nG(F) = G 0 + G stretch (F, L folded , L unfolded ) − F · L · x frac (F),(1)\nwhere G 0 denotes the folding free energy at zero force ( G 0 = 24 k B T for LZ10). G stretch accounts for the difference in the work required to stretch an unfolded coiled coil to a given force F compared to the work required to stretch a folded coiled coil to the same force. The last term in equation (1) denotes the reversible work upon unfolding of a coiled coil at a force F. x frac denotes the fractional extension of the coiled coil relative to its contour length. We calculated x frac by inverting the WLC-interpolation formula [24] with a persistence length of p = 0.7 nm.

Good data fits are obtained (Figure 4a), justifying the hypothesis that the nanoparticle size is determined by achieving the critical surface charge density required for a stable colloidal dispersion. Furthermore, the critical surface charge density or fraction of the nanoparticle surface area covered by DMAEMA repeat units (SA frac. ) can be determined using the PSC model. In agreement with the anionic copolymer series, SA frac. increases when using more hydrophobic alkyl methacrylate comonomers. If k = 1, only 26% of the nanoparticle surface needs to be covered by DMAEMA repeat units to form stable colloidal dispersions for the ED  On the other hand, 80% coverage is required for the EHD series (Figure 4a) since EHMA is a much more hydrophobic comonomer than EMA. The log P values for the hydrophobic comonomers were plotted against SA frac , as determined from the PSC model by assuming k = 1. In analogy with the anionic copolymer series, a linear function could be fitted to the data [SA frac. = 0.201 × log P − 0.091; R 2 = 0.96] (Figure 4b). This relationship between log P and SA frac. can be used to predict the behavior of other P(A-stat-DMAEMA) amphiphilic copolymers. Furthermore, a strong correlation between the linear fits is observed for the anionic and cationic copolymer series (Figure 4b, dashed line vs solid line). Thus, the PSC model appears to be universal for describing the aqueous self-assembly behavior of charged amphiphilic statistical copolymers that comprise a pair of hydrophilic and hydrophobic comonomers.",

It can be observed that Berl is the most expensive. Moreover, the Pall rings is more expensive than Intalox. It is therefore possible to blend the characteristics of Pall and Intalox to get a cheaper packing material.\n\n\nFigure 1.

When the gas temperature increases over 20 K and the CO on the icy mantles is released to the gas phase, D frac (N 2 H + ) decreases rapidly and reaches the steady-state value in less than 0.1 Myr. Even in the starless phase, if the core is turbulent and the temperature is higher than 20 K, D frac (N 2 H + ) can reach values lower than those typical in the low-mass starless cores. The same is true for D frac (HCO + ). Other molecules such as HCN and HNC need about 1 Myr to reach the steady the state and could be useful to age massive protostellar cores and UC Hii regions.

Biological therapies including monoclonal antibodies and immune effectors have been the subject of multiple research projects. Pore-forming proteins may become the other biological strategy to overcome the problems associated with current treatments. But detailed mechanisms of their action on target membranes remained to be elucidated. We aimed to study the cytotoxic effects of recombinant form of fragaceatoxin C on AML cell lines HL-60 and KG-1.Materials and Methods:We cloned the FraC gene in pET-28a (+) bacterial expression vector and the expressed recombinant FraC protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Then, cytotoxic effects of the recombinant protein were examined on two AML cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1. Effects of serum and calcium ion were explored by hemolysis assay in more details. Results: Our results showed that the recombinant C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged FraC protein has potent cytotoxic effects on both AML cell lines, with IC 50 =5.6, and 4.6 µg.ml-1 for HL-60 and KG-1 cells, respectively. Serum showed dose-dependent and also time-dependent inhibitory effects on the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the FraC protein. Pre-incubation of the toxin with different concentrations of calcium ion also inhibited hemolytic activity of FraC toxin. Conclusion: Results of the present study showed that FraC has potential anti-tumor effects. By detailed investigation of the inhibition mechanism of serum and calcium effects in the future, it can be possible to design target sites for clinical applications of the toxin.\n\nIntroduction",

It has been shown that the N-terminal amino acids of equinatoxin II are very important in toxin oligomerization and consequently pore formation in target cell membrane (30,31). In this study, NcoI restriction site of the pET-28a (+) expression system was used to have minimal modification of the N-terminal of the recombinant protein (only one Met was added to N-terminal of FraC protein). Also, the XhoI restriction site has been used to have minimal number of amino acids in the affinity tag on the C-terminal of the protein.\n\nResidues added to the C-terminal were as follow; [Leu-Glu-(His)6]. Of course it will be more interesting if the FraC toxin could be cloned without any additional amino acids other than affinity tag like streptolysin O in a recent study (32) to explore if there is any difference in IC 50 of the recombinant proteins. But, the data of the present study shows that any impact due to the additional amino acids in the C-terminal on hemolytic activity of FraC protein is unlikely. Cytotoxicity results of the present study using trypan blue assay show that recombinant FraC has potent antitumor activity against both HL-60 and KG-1 cell lines. These results were comparable to cytotoxic activity of other actinoporins on leukemic cells and RBCs (16,33).",

Taking, l 0 (eV) z 3/a (Å) 16 and a z 2Å, we obtain l z 3.3 eV and therefore DG 0 is in the range of À1 eV. Such a large driving force is required to overcome the intrinsic activation energy DG s 0 ¼ l/4. As the standard potentials of the electron donors are around À2.1 V vs. Ag + /Ag, a rough estimation of the standard potential of the N 2 O/N 2 Oc À redox couple is E 0 N2O=N2O $À z À 1:1 V vs. Ag + /Ag. Taking this value and l z 3.3 eV, the experimental data are tted with eqn (4) and (5) leading to Z hom [N 2 O] z 3 Â 10 8 s À1 (Fig. 3).",

Especially model Aged6e5 can reach D N 2 H + frac ∼ 0.1, similar to the levels achieved in model fDCO1000. However, now the effect is more global, i.e., there is not as strong a spatial concentration of D N 2 H + frac following the column density structure. We also see that the similar levels of D N 2 H + frac that arise in these models are achieved with quite different absolute abundances of N 2 H + and N 2 D + . We will return to these metrics as a way to distinguish between models in §3.3.\n\n\nCombination of initial OPR H 2 and CO Depletion\n\nIn §3.2.1, we saw that lower initial OPR H 2 helps the growth of D N 2 H + frac , while its spatial structure is not enhanced with density. In contrast, the models of §3.2.4 with a higher CO depletion factor have a clearer structure of D N 2 H + frac following column density. Therefore, we try a series of combinations of initial OPR H 2 and CO depletion to survey whether D N 2 H + frac can have a stronger correlation with column density. We consider two possible CO depletion factors: 10 and 1000, and four possible values of initial OPR H 2 : 3, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001. From the results of these eight models, initial OPR H 2 does not appear to enhance the spatial structure of D N 2 H + frac . Although the initial OPR H 2 does not further enhance the spatial structure, the models with high CO depletion factor and low initial OPR H 2 still show the possibility to obtain high values of D N 2 H + frac . We thus focus on two models, OPR0.01_fDCO1000 and OPR0.001_fDCO1000, which are listed in Table 1 and which will be considered further in the comparison to observed systems (below).\n\n\nCombination of N and CO depletion factors",

SAXS analysis has shown that the nanoparticle size is strongly dependent on the hydrophilic comonomer content of these amphiphilic statistical copolymers (Tables 2 and 3). This is consistent with the previously proposed PSC model. 34 This simple model assumes (i) perfectly spherical particles, (ii) a constant surface charge density across a copolymer series regardless of the copolymer composition, and (iii) that there is no solvent present within the nanoparticle (i.e., x sol = 0). In this prior study, it was found that a critical fractional surface coverage (SA frac. ) by anionic (B) units is required for colloidal stability. The spherical nanoparticle surface area can be calculated from the particle radius (R). Thus, if SA frac. is independent of the nanoparticle size, the mean number of anionic B groups per nanoparticle (N B,p ) can be estimated using\nN k R 1/ 4 SA CS B B ,p 2 frac. π = × × (1)\nwhere CS B is the cross-sectional area of a single B repeat unit calculated from the approximate volume of a single B unit, V B (CS B = V B\n\n\n2/3\n\n) and k is the fraction of the B groups located at the particle surface. k equals 1 when all of the anionic B groups are located at the nanoparticle surface. Alternatively, if all of the B units are buried within the nanoparticle cores, k equals 0. In the latter case, the nanoparticles are not colloidally stable (N B,p tends to infinity, suggesting that an infinitely large particle would be required to form a stable dispersion). Since the size of particles formed by statistical copolymers is independent of their molecular weight, the chosen definition of N B,p (eq 1) enables the molecular weight to be excluded from the calculation.",

Even in the starless phase, if the core is turbulent and the temperature is higher than 20 K, D frac (N 2 H + ) can reach values lower than those typical in the low-mass starless cores.

In reality, N depletion should also happen where CO depletion occurs, although perhaps at a more modest level (Flower et al. 2006b). The level of N depletion will naturally affect the absolute abundances of N 2 H + and N 2 D + .\n\nTo investigate the influence of N depletion, we run simulations using two higher N depletion factors ( N = 100, 1000), and with CO depletion factor set to 1000. The results are plotted in the left  two columns of Figure 8.

However, we have not yet investigated its influence on the models with higher depletion factors. Thus combinations of an higher cosmicray ionization rate of = 1.0 × 10 −16 with the fDCO1000 and fDN100_fDCO1000 models are carried out. The results are also plotted in Figure 8.

However, due to the effect of shortening chemical time scales, the enhanced cosmic ray models have generally enhanced levels of D N 2 H + frac by about a factor of 10 than in the lower cosmic ray cases.

Biological therapies including monoclonal antibodies and immune effectors have been the subject of multiple research projects. Pore-forming proteins may become the other biological strategy to overcome the problems associated with current treatments. But detailed mechanisms of their action on target membranes remained to be elucidated. We aimed to study the cytotoxic effects of recombinant form of fragaceatoxin C on AML cell lines HL-60 and KG-1.Materials and Methods:We cloned the FraC gene in pET-28a (+) bacterial expression vector and the expressed recombinant FraC protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Then, cytotoxic effects of the recombinant protein were examined on two AML cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1. Effects of serum and calcium ion were explored by hemolysis assay in more details. Results: Our results showed that the recombinant C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged FraC protein has potent cytotoxic effects on both AML cell lines, with IC 50 =5.6, and 4.6 µg.ml-1 for HL-60 and KG-1 cells, respectively. Serum showed dose-dependent and also time-dependent inhibitory effects on the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the FraC protein. Pre-incubation of the toxin with different concentrations of calcium ion also inhibited hemolytic activity of FraC toxin. Conclusion: Results of the present study showed that FraC has potential anti-tumor effects. By detailed investigation of the inhibition mechanism of serum and calcium effects in the future, it can be possible to design target sites for clinical applications of the toxin.\n\nIntroduction",

We see that D N 2 H + frac is increasing rapidly until H ∼ 3 × 10 23 cm −2 , after which it stays quite constant.

Here, E frac is a measure of deviation from PWL behavior. Depending on the choice of range, two different cases arise; when E frac < 0, the curve is convex and it is concave for E frac > 0. The well-known DFAs meet certain challenges, resulting in a smooth convex curve, whereas EEX demonstrates reverse trend. RSH functionals which comprise these two ingredients have shown improvement in this direction (Mori-Sánchez et al., 2006). According to Janak's theorem (Janak, 1978), for (G)KS HOMO, the change in ϵ HOMO as a function of fractional occupation number should be straight line. This is then followed by a finite jump at integer point (due to derivative discontinuity). After that again, the variation should be a straight line till the following integer point.

It is to be remarked that there can be significant uncertainty in the estimates of the observed column densities, e.g., due to excitation temperature uncertainties (e.g., see the case of the C1-S and N cores observed by Kong et al. 2016). Estimates of the abundances of the species bring in additional uncertainties associated with the measurement of H . The observed values of [N 2 H + ] range from about 10 −11 to 10 −9 , while those of [N 2 D + ] range from about 10 −12 to close to 10 −9 . Focusing on the abundance plots, we see that the range of observed core properties is well covered by the simulations. For example, the model CR4x_fDN100_fDCO1000 reaches the high values of D N 2 H + frac that are observed in some cores with typical abundances of [N 2 H + ] ∼ few × 10 −10 . We see that variation in , i.e., the parameter controlling the degree of N depletion from the gas phase, is one way that the simulations can be tuned to match a given observed system. Given the uncertainties in predicting the degree of N depletion from first principles, one strategy when modeling a population of cores in the same region (assumed to have similar environmental conditions) is to set this empirically based on observations of N 2 H + and then use any observed differences in N 2 D + abundance as a measure of evolutionary stage, with absolute age differences estimated from such simulations.\n\n\nSpatial structure of D N 2 H + frac",

In contrast, in the presence of SM/DOPC (1:1) vesicles, the bands of treated and untreated toxin display the same molecular mass (Fig. 7A). The mutein 8-69 OX bound to membranes was also employed, because its N terminus remains exposed to the solvent constrained by the disulfide bond. As expected, 8-69 OX was also susceptible to the proteolytic activity of PK in DOPC and SM/DOPC (1:1) vesicles. To determine the extent of the cleavage, the proteins were subjected to sequencing of their N-terminal regions. The sequencing data revealed that, in the presence of vesicles of DOPC, FraC WT and 8-69 OX were cleaved at the N terminus by PK, rendering products in which the first 4 and the first 11 residues, respectively, were missing (Fig. 7, B and C). FraC bound to SM/DOPC (1:1) was not digested by PK as expected from the position of the band in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, whereas 8-69 OX was cleaved at the same position seen after incubation with vesicles of DOPC. These results demonstrate that the N terminus of FraC in DOPC vesicles (prepore configuration) is accessible to PK, i.e. this region is not embedded in the lipid bilayer.\n\n\nDiscussion",

These oligomers, presumably corresponding to pore particles, cover the SM-rich domains in an arrangement previously observed in FraC and other actinoporins (44,45) or the SM-specific PFT lysenin (46). The crosssection profile of the oligomeric complexes reveals an average diameter of 7.5 Ϯ 0.6 nm, a value in good agreement with the  mean diameter (average of outer and inner diameters) of the pore determined by x-ray crystallography (ϳ8 nm). Eight protein chains are observed in three well resolved pore particles encountered (see for example Fig. 5C). Because prepores of FraC were not resolved in DOPC (high diffusivity prevented AFM contouring), a construct of FraC bearing a double cysteine mutation (V8C/K69C, termed 8-69 OX ) was instead examined on supported membranes made of SM/DOPC (1:1). Under oxidizing conditions, the N-terminal segment of this mutein is covalently attached to the protein core by means of a disulfide bond, preventing the protein from generating a transmembrane pore, and thus inactivating the toxin (15,23). As with WT FraC, the construct 8-69 OX also gave rise to a dense array of pore-like particles (Fig. 6), indicating that the protein readily oligomerizes in the presence of membranes even if the N-terminal region remains attached to the protein. The average diameter of these particles (6.2 Ϯ 0.7 nm) is somehow smaller than that of WT protein, reflecting the influence of the N-terminal region attached to the ␤-core region. Because of the constraints imposed by the disulfide bond, the conformation of the N-terminal region in 8-69 OX is likely to differ from that of WT FraC bound to liposomes made of DOPC (Fig. 3, D and E). To further investigate this question, we employed biochemical assays (see below).",

This dual approach produced new SA frac. values based on the real composition of the particle surfaces measured by SANS. Moreover, the linear relationship between log P and SA frac. remained valid for the new data (Figure 6a). A new linear regression was fit to the data, yielding SA frac. = 0.110 × log P − 0.085. This new equation can be used to predict particle size if it is assumed that k remains constant in the PSC model. The cationic copolymer series was similarly reanalyzed. Combining the data obtained for the anionic and cationic series (Figure 6b) produces a linear relationship (R 2 = 0.96) between log P and the modeled SA frac. (k = 0.5). This highlights the self-consistency of the refined PSC model. Finally, the linear equation representing the relationship between log P for the hydrophobic comonomer and the modeled SA frac. for the MAA copolymers crosses the x-axis (i.e., SA frac. = 0) at a log P value of between 0.5 and 1. This suggests that, at this log P value, the nanoparticles would require no ionic comonomer to be located at the surface to confer colloidal stability. Alternatively, a comonomer exhibiting a log P of between 0.5 and 1, or below 0.5, would not be sufficiently hydrophobic to induce self-assembly, hence, such copolymers would remain molecularly dissolved in an aqueous solution.\n\n\n■ CONCLUSIONS",

FraC was engineered to generate strong EOF to attract the proteins into the pore lumen. Using EOF as the driving force makes it a versatile method for analyzing proteins carrying different surface charge. Five protein analytes ranging from 1.3 kDa to 25 kDa were investigated. They generated distinct ionic current blockades for identification with FraC. Particularly FraC was shown to resolve endothelin proteins with just a single amino acid variation. This is a well conducted work, where a new biological nanopore is introduced for protein identification with high resolution. The manuscript is clearly written and enjoyable to read. I recommend the publication of this work i n Nature communication with minor revision. We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment.\n\nThe minor issues are the following: Page 5 line 102: \"Since the constriction of ClyA is lined with aspartic acid\" the ClyA should be FraC. We fixed this.\n\nIn the SI, page 17 line 220: The same mistake We fixed this.",

To calculate the [NH 2 D]/[NH 3 ] ratio, we took the NH 3 column density derived by Montalban et al. (1990) from the integrated intensity maps of the (1,1) and (2,2) lines observed with the Effelsberg telescope. The beam of the NH 3 observations was ∼42\". Taking into account possible calibration differences between the two telescopes and that the pointings are not exactly the same, we consider that the uncertainty could be as large as a factor of ∼5.\n\n\nComparison of the IF and MP2 positions\n\nIn this section we compare the chemistry of the different velocity components. The 10 km s −1 component presents similar abundance ratios toward the two positions, and these ratios are different from those in the 12 km s −1 and 8 km s There are no important chemical differences between the 8 km s −1 and 12 km s −1 components, suggesting that they correspond to gas at a similar kinetic temperature, probably because they are equidistant from IRS 1.\n\nThe values of the deuterium fractions are quite similar for the three velocity components. Values around 0.01 are found for all of the observed species except for DCO + and N 2 D + which present a deuterium fraction 10 times lower. The largest differences are found for C 2 D, D frac (C 2 H) being ∼4 times higher in the 8 km s −1 component toward the MP2 position than in the others. The hydrogenated compound of this species is also very abundant in this component, suggesting that opacity effects could contribute to this higher value of the deuterium fraction. We would need to observe the 13 C isotopolog to obtain a more accurate value of D frac (C 2 H). The deuterated species N 2 D + and D 2 CO have only been detected in the more shielded components at 12.0 km s −1 (N 2 D + ) and 8 km s −1 (D 2 CO), again consistent with these velocity components being associated with colder gas, farther from IRS 1.\n\n\nComparison with other sources",

The model considers every single coiled coil to fold two-state like in thermodynamic equilibrium. The ratio between unfolded and folded coiled coils is Boltzmann-distributed where the energetic difference G(F) between the two states depends on the applied force F [23]:\nG(F) = G 0 + G stretch (F, L folded , L unfolded ) − F · L · x frac (F),(1)\nwhere G 0 denotes the folding free energy at zero force ( G 0 = 24 k B T for LZ10). G stretch accounts for the difference in the work required to stretch an unfolded coiled coil to a given force F compared to the work required to stretch a folded coiled coil to the same force. The last term in equation (1) denotes the reversible work upon unfolding of a coiled coil at a force F. x frac denotes the fractional extension of the coiled coil relative to its contour length. We calculated x frac by inverting the WLC-interpolation formula [24] with a persistence length of p = 0.7 nm. The overstretching and unzipping linkage geometries differ by the length increase L upon unfolding (unzipping: L zip-folded = 0.9 nm, L zip-unfolded = 25.6 nm, L zip = 24.7 nm; overstretching: L str-folded = 5.5 nm; L str-unfolded = 12.8 nm; and L overstretch = 7.3 nm). The contribution of all coiled coils to the extension of the polyprotein at given force F is then:\nX (F) = N unzipping x frac (F) · L zip-unfolded 1 + e G zip (F) + L zip-folded 1 + e − G zip (F)\n+N overstretching x frac (F) · L str-unfolded 1 + e G str (F) + L str-folded 1 + e − G str (F) . Fitting this expression to the force extension data allowed us to determine the number of unzipping linkage geometries (N unzipping ) and the number of overstretching geometries (N overstretching ).",

Fractionality as an indicator of efficiency in DFT+U corrections\n\nWithin the context of reducing E dev errors with electron addition and removal, a motivating factor for employing DFT+U is that in the limit of a single atom with an orbital being emptied or filled, the fractionality should rise from zero at the endpoints to a maximum value of 0.25 when a ½ charge is added. In real systems, the fractionality of the endpoints is not zero, but a rise in fractionality may occur as fractional charge is added. Since we are interested in the correction to the curvature of the energy, we focus on the deviation of this fractionality (frac dev ) from a linear interpolation of the fractionality in the endpoints:\nfrac dev (q)  Tr[n Nq (1  n Nq )] qTr[n N1 (1  n N1 )] (1 q)Tr[n N (1  n N )],(30)\nwhere the first term is the fractionality of the occupation matrix obtained with partial charge N+q and the second and third terms are the linear average of the N+1-and N-electron fractionalities.",

The quantity that we are after is simply the cumulative distribution of the so called first-passage distribution [62][63][64]. The first-passage density, which we will denote by f (t), is the probability density function that a particle arrives at the absorbing surface for the first time at a certain time t, given the initial condition. Thus, its cumulative distribution, F(t) =´t 0 f (t )dt , gives the probability that a particle arrived at the surface by time t, and was irreversibly adsorbed.\n\nFor the delta-function inital condition considered in Eq. [62]. Of course, one can think of any other normalized initial condition and find the proper cumulative distribution. However, note that in this case F(t) will simply be given by an integration of erfc L 2 √ Dt over the initial distribution. In fact, we can calculate in this manner M(t) of unnormalizable concentration profiles as well. For example, if we assume an initial uniform concentration c b , we have\n(15) we indeed have F(t) = erfc L 2 √ DtM(t) =ˆ∞ 0 c b erfc L 2 √ Dt dL = c b 4Dt π ,(26)\nwhich is indeed the expression in Eq.

Thus, we can express the first term in the Ward-Tordai relation for any initial condition and surface dynamics in terms of the solution to the corresponding absorbing boundary problem with delta-function initial condition. This is not a mere coincidence -the delta function initial condition is special, its propagator is the so called Green's function. From here onwards we will denote the Green's function of the absorbing boundary problem by g(x,t | x , τ), namely the probability to find a diffusing single-particle at x at time t, given that it was introduced to the semi-infinite line at x < L at time τ ≤ t, and in the presence of an absorbing boundary at x = L. In what follows, we will show that the Green's function can be utilized to (re)derive, interpret, and generalize the Ward-Tordai relation.",

As a consequence such low mass ρ's may propagate to the vacuum without collisions and radiate dileptons for a long time in the vacuum since their lifetime, given by the inverse 2 pion decay width, is very long in the vacuum for low invariant mass. This 'artefact' is enhanced by the dilepton radiation probability which -due to the virtual photon propagator and a phase-space factor -is ∼ M −3 .

Specifically, while a lot of work has been dedicated to the classical random walk in discrete space and time, it seems that the gated version of the corresponding first-passage and return problems was first solved here. That said, solutions to the gated problem in continuous time and space and in continuous time and discrete space have been presented before, and in the following we will review these cases for comparison.\n\nContinuous time and space -In his work on coagulation, Smoluchowski's was the first to build a model where diffusive transport is the rate limiting step of the reaction kinetics. To find this so called diffusion-controlled reaction rate, Smoluchowski solved for the flux of particles, initially uniformly distributed in an infinite pool of particles, into a 3D spherical symmetric sink fixed to the origin. 38 Many great reviews have been written on Smoluchowski's model and its generalizations. 31,32,39,40 Although here we consider the first-passage to the boundary of a single-particle diffusing on the semi-infinite line, the treatment of the boundary is essentially the same. The solution can be obtained by solving the diffusion equation with an absorbing boundary condition c(0,t) = 0, where the first-passage distribution through the origin is given by the flux to the origin f (0,t) = D ∂ c(x,t) ∂ x | x=0 . The equation is supplemented with the delta initial condition c(x, 0) = δ (x 0 ). Note that here x 0 = 0 is the trivial case in which the particle is immediately absorbed.

It is seen that the total number of hadrons increases with time due to the continuous production of hadrons from quark coalescence as well as inelastic and decay channels in the hadronic phase. The different production times of hadrons from quark coalescence are a result of different quark freeze-out times from their last scatterings. Although the final hadron number is much larger at 200 GeV than at 7.7 GeV, hadrons are mostly formed at earlier times at lower collision energies due to the shorter lifetime of the partonic phase. The continuous production of hadrons makes it not possible to define unambiguously the chemical freeze-out time. Instead, we consider the phase-space distribution in the hadronic matter at different times. The resulting time evolution of the effective pion/nucleon ratio is shown by filled squares in Fig. 2 for collisions at both 200 GeV (left panel) and 7.7 GeV (right panel). In calculating the effective pion/nucleon ratio, we include those from the strong decays of resonances.

The thorough analysis shows that despite all the claims the present work has nothing to do with the thermalization process in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In contrast to the authors' beliefs I show that their main result is not derived, but is a combination of mathematical mistakes and hand waving arguments.  25.75.Nq   Thermalization phenomenon observed in heavy ion collisions at intermediate and high energies is one of the pillars of modern nuclear physics. It means a transformation of two colliding pieces of cold nuclear matter, which produce the highly excited non-equilibrated strongly interacting matter, into a media being in local thermal equilibrium. There exist a large number of theoretical works devoted to its explanation on a basis of various approaches and models. The latter are varying from the gluon transport model [1] and hadronic cascade model [2, 3] to rather sophisticated hydrokinetic approaches[4].In the present work [5] the authors claimed no less than they found \"an explanation for the thermalization phenomenon, starting from such basic concepts as the conservation laws of energy and momentum and leaving the details which are characteristic of every specific process, aside for further researches\". However, their model, the maximal isotropization model (MIM), has nothing to do with the collisions of heavy ions and, as shown below, does not shed any light on a thermalization process at all.The authors, indeed, account for the energy and momentum conservation in all two particle collisions and in this way they redistribute the total energy and momentum of the system among the ideal Boltzmann particles. However, the authors have neglected any inelastic reaction in the system and production of any particle in it. Therefore, from the beginning the possible range of applications, if we consider the hadrons, is restricted from above by the lab. energy per particle which must be below the pion mass m π ≈ 140 MeV. However, the authors of [5] continue to use the relativistic expression for particle energy and even apply their model to pions with the mean energy up to 800 MeV. After I realized this, it became clear to me that the thorough discussion of such 'tiny issues' as spherical symmetry of the momentum distribution after each elastic collision assumed by authors, or an absence of any cross-sections in all their equations, or the energy and time dependence of the momentum integration volume V p",

In some cases these nuclei live for only very short times and especially for nuclei beyond the neutron dripline they can only be measured as resonances. Nevertheless the masses can be determined by transfer reactions or by invariant mass measurements and the lifetimes can be determined from the width of the resonance. However, especially for nuclei which are removed by two or more neutrons from the last particle-stable isotope, these resonant states can be very broad and it becomes questionable if the corresponding lifetimes are long enough to be called a nucleus [5]. Only unbound nuclei for which a resonance was observed are included, the first \"non-existence\" for an unbound nucleus has been compiled elsewhere [5].\n\nFor heavier isotopes we have adopted the practice to accept the observation of isomeric states or excited proton unbound states prior to the determination of the ground states as the discovery.

As already noted, the production of resonances consumes a large share of this energy, which will be released later in the form of pions (black dotted line). Their number is continuously increasing to reach the final value at about 30-40 fm/c. Pions are strongly interacting with nucleons. Therefore, pions propagating in the dense medium have a high chance to be reabsorbed and to feed the number of deltas. This effect explains the slow increase of the pion yield when the density is high. The deltas themselves are also reabsorbed by the nuclear matter in N∆ → NN collisions. This effect can be seen looking at the total number of deltas and pions (full red line). It shows a maximum at about 10-12 fm/c and decreases slightly afterwards. From 20 fm/c on it stays roughly constant. Now only the relative contribution of deltas and pions to the total yield is changing.\n\nThe right hand side of Fig. iii.9 shows the time evolution of the rapidity distribution of nucleons (top), deltas (middle) and pions (bottom) at different times.

The matching efficiency is found to be high (over 90% at low p T , over 95% for p T >10 GeV). For embedded p embed T and matched jet p reco T , we quantify the response of the hybrid system to the embedded jet via:\nδp T = p reco T − ρ · A reco − p embed T ,(1)\nwhere A reco is the area of the matched reconstructed jet and ρ is determined prior to the embedding step.

Virtual particles\n\nThe production of kaons in this energy domain is a very rare process with a production cross section of only a few nanobarns, in comparison to the total NN cross section of about 20-40 mb. The probability of producing strangeness is thus very small. Then, the method presented above will lead to severe limitations in statistics for the investigation of kaon production. Nevertheless, simulation codes oriented toward higher collision energies, like UrQMD [67,85] apply successfully this method for reactions above the threshold. Results of such calculations (without a mean field) on global kaon spectra and rapidity distributions in Ni+Ni collisions at 1.93 A GeV are quite comparable to IQMD results [86]. However, detailed investigations of triple differential cross sections and differential flow patterns (like v 2 (p t , y c.m. )) cannot be addressed in those approaches.\n\nA way to overcome this problem is the method of \"perturbative production\" of kaons, which was used in Ref. [87]. In this method one determines the probability for producing a kaon in a collision from Eq. (73). The production probability P , the c.m.-momentum p and the invariant mass √ s of the collisions are stored but the strangeness production is not executed (the momenta of the incoming particles are not changed). Instead, the collision branches into another collision channel which is then executed. At the end the stored data are analyzed to calculate the production of kaons in these elementary collisions by summing up the probabilities. However, this method has the disadvantage that further interactions of the perturbatively produced particles can only roughly be estimated. To overcome this we use the method of virtual particles:\n\n• With each particle i we associate a probability P i . Protons, neutrons, deltas and pions initially have P i = 1.",

[21] note a substantial discrepancy in the ρ 0 /π − ratio in semi-central Au-Au collisions. We give their discussion in what follows: These mesons have been reconstructed in STAR [22] via their decay channel into 2 charged pions. Comparing the preliminary results from STAR with the thermal model predictions of BRS [21], reveals that the measured values exceed the calculated values by about a factor of 2. This is unexpected, especially considering that BRS use a chemical freezeout temperature of 177 MeV for the calculation. One might expect these wide resonances to be formed near to thermal freezeout, i.e. at a temperature of about 120 MeV. At this temperature the equilibrium value for the ρ 0 /π − ratio is much smaller than the 0.11 found at 177 MeV. Even with a chemical potential for pions of close to the pion mass and taking into account the apparent (downwards) mass shift for the ρ 0 it seems difficult to explain the experimentally observed value of about 0.2. In fact, recently the STAR paper was published [23] where they give the final ρ 0 /π − ratio as 0.169 ± 0.003(stat) ± 0.037(syst) for peripheral Au+Au collisions, slightly lower than the preliminary ∼ 0.2. Other statistical models [24,25] also have difficulty in explaining this large a ratio. We return to this below.\n\nNow this excess is difficult to explain with the ρ width that of the free ρ, Γ ρ ∼ 150 MeV, during the drop in temperature from 175 to 120 MeV. This gives the strongest hadronic interaction and would surely be large enough to equilibrate the ρ's and π's down to thermal freezeout, the ρ's changing back and forth between two π's several times. Since they are obviously not equilibrated, the assumption that the ρ-meson has its free-particle width must be wrong, and we adduce the Harada and Yamawaki argument to say that only that part of the Γ which originates from explicit chiral symmetry breaking remains at T c ; in any case, that the in-medium width is substantially smaller than the free-particle one.",

In the hadron gas, the principal hadronic reactions, e.g. ππ → ρ → ππ, πK → K * → πK, πN → ∆ → πN, do not change the yields of pions, kaons, and nucleons. Nevertheless, these reactions provide a mechanism for thermalization during the hadronic evolution. Thermal equilibration times at a temperature of T ≈ 160 MeV are typically ∼ 2 fm/c [8]. In the strong interactions of light hadrons there are only three conserved currents: baryon number (J µ B ), strangeness (J µ S ), and isospin (J µ I ). Other hadronic reactions (for instance πN → N * (1530) → ∆π → Nππ) do change the total yield of pions, kaons and nucleons. Because of these reactions the system approaches chemical equilibrium. The yield of pions, kaons, and nucleons changes via such reactions until the Gibbs free energy reaches a minimum. However, the time scale of chemical equilibration is much longer than that of thermal equilibration; chemical equilibration times are typically τ ch ∼ 200 fm/c [9,10]. Therefore in the hadron gas, there are two disparate time scales, τ th and τ ch .\n\nIn heavy ion collisions, the lifetime of the hadronic stage is approximately ∼ 10 fm/c, which is very short compared to τ ch , but longer than τ th . Therefore, on the time scale of the collision, although the chemical composition is fixed at the time of hadronization, the system continues to evolve kinetically for some time until the particles breakup. The stages of the collision have been described with the following picture. First, there is chemical freezeout (hadronization). Then the hadrons evolve as a hadronic fluid until thermal freezeout (breakup). In this picture, the particles develop chemical potentials during the hadronic evolution since the total number of particles is fixed and the temperature decreases.\n\nThere is some evidence for this chemical/thermal freezeout picture. First, hadronic cascades indicate that following hadronization pions and nucleons rescatter for ∼ 10 fm/c.",

In the absence of noise (coming from the self-consistent bath of surrounding particles) it is impossible to have multiple collisions, and the first iteration for the memory kernel thus gives the force-force correlation during the first (and only) collision that the particles are possibly undergoing. This correlation decays over time scales of order 1/ ε, and it is delta-peaked in the HS limit as one expects for instantaneous collisions. The same result can be obtained for the SQS potential, leading to a memory function which is different from Eq. (33) but which, as expected, also converges to Eq. (34) in the HS limit.

We have investigated the behavior of the described system confined between two electrodes separated by a distance of 15 nm with single slit-pore geometry, as shown in Fig. 9. This is a simple model which is called a slit-pore model for simulating porous media, introduced by Breitsprecher et al. 9,11 . Recently, Biagooi et al. 13 have used this geometry to simulate the IL-based supercapacitors. The pore size is often comparable of the bulk region; therefore the slit-pore length was set to be 15 nm like the bulk region, and its width was 2.5 nm (greater than twice the ion size) to allow the coverage of both pore walls 30 and let unless two ions enter the pore. The electrodes were built from carbon atoms with the following parameters: σ C = 3.37 Å and ε C = 1 kJ/ mol. These are surfaces with the constant potential.

It has been solved first for the simplest case [7], when the diffusion of the vacancy is unbiased (all diffusion barriers are equal; the tracer atom behaves in the same way as the other atoms), the lattice is two-dimensional and periodic or infinite. There is a single vacancy present, it takes a nearest neighbor step in a random direction at regular time intervals, and has an infinite lifetime, as there are no traps. The solution is constructed by separating the motion of the tracer and the vacancy. The correlation of the steps of the tracer atom is calculated from the probability that the vacancy returns to the tracer from a direction which is equal, perpendicular or opposite to its previous departure. The distribution of the tracer atom spreads with time, and on an infinite lattice for large times it approaches the following functional form:\nP t (r) = 2(π − 1) log t K 0 r [log t/(4π(π − 1))] 1/2 ,(1)\nwhere K 0 is the modified Bessel function [11], time t measures the number of steps of the vacancy, and at t = 0 the vacancy is near the tracer atom. The non-Gaussian shape of the spatial distribution function is typical for vacancy mediated diffusion. The average displacement of the tracer particle diverges with time. This is a direct consequence of the fact that two is the marginal dimension for the return probabilities in the random walk problem.\n\nFor higher dimensional problems, the probability that the vacancy returns to the tracer particle is less than unity and the average displacement of the tracer particle remains finite. However, for dimensions equal to or smaller than two, the vacancy always returns to the tracer particle and as a consequence its displacement diverges.\n\nThe same problem has been solved in an alternative way for all dimensions [8]. From this solution one can calculate the number of tracer-vacancy exchanges up to time t: in two dimensions its distribution is geometric, with mean (log t)/π. The continuum version of this problem has been considered as well in the form of an infinite-order perturbation theory [9]; the solution matches the asymptotic form of the lattice model.",

For this reason, density was measured by weighing a defined volume of the material. It is also important to quantify mechanical durability, which was done by measuring crushing strength and testing attrition resistance. Crushing strength is the average force required to break 30 individual particles in the size range of 180-250 µm. This was done by using a digital force gauge (Shimpo FGN-5). Attrition resistance was obtained in a jet cup attrition rig when particles were exposed to a high-velocity gas jet. The fines produced, after specific time intervals, were collected in a filter and weighed. The attrition index A i can be used to compare materials and is calculated according to Equation (3).\nA i = m f ,t=60min − m f ,t=30min m s · 60 30 ·100 [wt.%/h](3)\nm f,t is the cumulative elutriated mass at time t, and m s is the initial mass of the sample. The attrition index is not to be interpreted as an estimation of the expected lifetime of the oxygen carrier. This measurement is only the relative mechanical durability of the particles. A thorough description of the set-up and procedure for attrition measurements can be found elsewhere [10]. A measure of the mechanical properties of the particles is required for most applications. The fluidizing conditions in the small quartz reactor do not put much physical stress on the particles, however, if break-down of the particles occurs in this setup it is a sure indication of them being too soft. For oxygen carrier applications, it has been concluded that the crushing strength is not a good measurement of the particles' physical properties during hot fluidized conditions. For this reason, the attrition index measurement was introduced [10].\n\nThe specific surface area (BET) of the oxygen carriers was measured. This was done both before (fresh state) and after (used state) reactor testing. N 2 adsorption was measured in a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 apparatus. The phase composition was determined using powder X-ray diffractometry (Siemens D5000, Cu Kα1 radiation). All materials were analyzed before and after reactor testing.",

Progress on the former requires enhanced size and chemical characterisation of the ambient particles to which populations or panel members are exposed, whilst progress on the latter requires experiments testing potential causal mechanisms either in vitro or, ideally, in vivo using model or genuine particulate matter. A major criticism of most mechanistic studies is that the exposure route is artificial and the PM dose is very high. In the last few years, however, instrumentation has been developed that is designed to deliver a continuous flow of air in which the concentration of ambient PM in the sampled air stream is increased in real-time by roughly an order of magnitude [5,6]. The concentrated PM is generically referred to as CAPs (concentrated ambient particles). The advantage of these instruments is that they can provide genuine inhalation exposures, at PM concentrations not much greater than ambient, with the subject of the exposure (animal or human) assessed under controlled conditions. In example studies using human volunteers, exposure to fine or coarse CAPs has been shown to induce mild pulmonary inflammation in healthy adults [7], and to change heart rate variability in the elderly [8] and in asthmatic and healthy younger adults [9]. It is important that particle concentrators do not alter the size distribution (within the fraction being concentrated) or chemical composition of the particles. In the past, particle composition has been checked using off-line chemical analyses of bulk filter-collected samples [5] but this requires a raft of different analytical techniques, is timeconsuming, does not provide information on the state of chemical mixing of individual particles and is necessarily time-averaged. Very recently, single particle mass spectrometers have been deployed for more detailed investigation of the effect of concentrators on the ensembles of individual particles. Using an Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS) alongside particle sizing instrumentation, Moffet et al. [10] showed that the Harvard/ USEPA Ambient Particle Concentrator (HAPC) did not induce observable changes to particles in the coarse (PM 2.5-10 ) size fraction.

In other words the active forcing on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) is equivalent to non-Markovian noise with a persistence time τ r = 1/D r . This key property of ABP arises because in this minimal model of active colloids the single-particle angular dynamics is decoupled from interactions and from the angular dynamics of other particles. As a result, ABPs do not exert torques on each other nor on the walls of a container. This simplification has allowed substantial theoretical progress, but has important limitations discussed in Section 6. Note that Eqs.1 and 4 are distinct from Gaussian colored noise due to the bounded speed distribution here. In the limit τ r → 0, for fixed D a , the exponential decay can be approximated by a delta function, e −|t−t |/τ r /τ r → δ(t−t ). In this limit, a single active Brownian particle behaves like a thermal Brownian particle with an effective temperature k B T eff = v 2 0 2µD r [22]. In interacting ABP the thermal limit is only realized, however, if the orientational correlation time τ r is much smaller than all time scales present in the system. In particular, τ r must be small compared to the mean free time between collisions, τ f (2av 0 ρ) −1 , and to the interaction time τ k = (µk) −1 . The dimensionless ratio ζ = τ r /τ f is especially relevant for phase separation, whose onset has been interpreted in terms of a critical value of ζ [27]. A recent study has also pointed out the crucial role played by ζ in active suspensions, where hydrodynamic interactions are important [58].",

The distribution of the temperature and the gas velocity at different moments of time under coal particle mass ρ k,b = 0.068 kg/m 3 are shown in Pic 1. The curves 11 correspond to the state of the temperature and the gas velocity after the burn out of the whole mixture in the volume. It has been determined from the calculations that the particle velocity was almost the same as gas velocity. We have obtained the pressure-coal particle mass curve (Pic. 2) and the time-coal particle mass curve (Pic. 3) at the end of the burning. The increase of the coal particle mass leads to the increase of the pressure in the volume (Pic. 2) and to the decrease of the mixture total burn out time (Pic. 3). The hot spot ignites the mixture in the center of the volume. The amount of the methane in the mixture is not enough to support the burning therefore the flame front propagation depends on the amount of the coal dust in the volume. According to the obtained results the flame front doesn't propagate along the volume when the coal dust mass is less than 0.065 kg/m 3 and the particle size is more than r k,b = 10 -6 m. The particles don't have enough time to react and the burning is extinguished. But if the particle size is less than r k,b = 10 -7 m and the coal dust mass is less than 0.065 kg/m 3 the burning of the coal dust methane-air mixture becomes possible. It is largely due to the quick burning of the small particles which are able to support the burning front.\n\nPic. 4a shows the pressure growth-time curves under ρ k = 0.068 kg/m 3 \n\n\nConclusions",

The latters are large and should be used for tests. For the reduction of particles size the process of so called laser fragmentation has been applied. In this case individual particles are molten under the laser pulse, and their average size gradually decreases. Fig. 1, A shows the evolution of the mass distribution function of Se particles subjected to laser fragmentation. One can see that the main mass of particles is contained in particles with size about 800 nm in diameter. With gradual increase of laser fragmentation time the main mass shifts to smaller sizes arriving finally to size less than 100 nm. X-ray diffractograms of obtained Se particles.

Several theoretical works [6,7] and works based on numerical simulations [8][9][10][11] have been devoted to this question. The main problem addressed in these works was that of the determination of the lower bounds of the size and mass ratios above which, to a good approximation, the motion of the solvated particles is Brownian. The criterion chosen to locate these bounds was that the diffusion coefficient of the solvated particles obeys to the relation between the diffusion coefficient D and friction coefficient ξ strictly valid only for brownian particles D = k B T /ξ (k B is Boltzmann's constant, T the temperature of the solvent). The main concern, when the Stokes estimate of ξ is used, is the choice of the hydrodynamic boundary condition between solvated particles and solvent which is well defined only when the solvated particle has a macroscopic size. This last shortcoming can be overcome by computing ξ from its exact expression for a Brownian particle derived by Kirkwood [12] and later, more rigourously, from multi-scale analysis [2,13]. Obviously this method seems the correct way to proceed in order to check the brownian behavior of a solvated particle. However, as it was discussed in the literature [8,10,12,[14][15][16], this method is not easy to use in simulations due to important finite size effects. This work is devoted to discuss this problem and to establish in what conditions, in a numerical simulation, the friction coefficient of a solvated particle of large mass and size can be credibly determined.\n\nThe friction coefficient ξ is given in terms of the integration on time t of the equilibrium autocorrelation function < F(0) .

Are we to believe that \"polyatomic gas molecules do not adsorb thermal radiation, i.e., the above vibrational energy is all attained from what, their collisions with wall molecules?\" Such an assertion is troublesome, especially when one contemplates all the various shapes, and sizes of gas molecules.\n\nThere remains only one viable solution, which explains why most polyatomic gases adhere to (14). That is as follows. All polyatomic gas molecules absorb and, then reradiate thermal radiation, as part of their vibrational energy. So, the next question becomes, \"is this thermal radiation, actually blackbody radiation?\"\n\nAnswering yes, then one begins to fully understand why there are such strong discrepancies between their heat capacities, and the traditionally accepted infrared spectrums of so many polyatomic gases. For example, it is traditionally thought that homonuclear gases have no absorption spectra in the infrared [10], even though they all clearly absorb thermal energy, as indicated by their heat capacities [11,12].\n\nOne must conclude that all polyatomic gases adsorb, and then re-radiate infrared thermal radiation, when in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, even when inside of a spectrometer. This is part of any polyatomic gas' vibrational energy, and that this is infrared thermal radiation, as defined by the Stephen-Boltzmann law, i.e., blackbody radiation! In other words, the above 2) is correct, while traditionally accepted 1) has to be wrong.\n\nThe above further means that in traditional infrared spectrometry, what one traditionally has witnessed, are the parts of a gas' infrared spectrum that are not necessarily directly attributable to the molecule's normal thermal signature, e.g., its dipole moments.\n\nCan we now conclude that \"all thermal energy is blackbody radiation?\" No, such a conclusion cannot be had, at this point.\n\n\nVIII.

Arguably at such temperatures the energy associated with the surrounding atmosphere will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a system at 300 K radiates thermal centered blackbody energy, which disperses into the atmosphere, whose thermal radiation energy is clearly a linear function of temperature.\n\nSimilarly, the kinematic energies of the atmospheric gases are influenced by their absorption of the surrounding atmosphere's thermal radiation. This occurs even though they are not necessarily in a fully enclosed system, as is used to calculate their heat capacities and their relations to kinetic theory. This applies whether it be the traditional, or the more exacting kinetic theory developed by this author [11,12].\n\nInterestingly, at T=3 K, the blackbody radiation is dominated by microwave radiation, which is not exactly what one considers, as being true/pure thermal energy. It becomes increasingly obvious that as T→0, any clear relationship between temperature and thermal energy density will be lost.\n\nOf interest, the traditional assertion is that the heat capacities are not constant for all temperature regimes, e.g., heat capacity falters as T→0. One can now consider that it is not the notion of heat capacity that falters, rather it is our concept of temperature that collapses. Of course, this raises the question of, \"when is a system's temperature no longer directly proportional to its thermal energy density?\" At this time, the answer is really a guess, 10 K, 100 K, 250 K. Clearly, the relationships between the thermal energy density, and blackbody radiation is not the same for all temperature regimes.\n\n\nXIII. IMPLICATIONS TO GLOBAL WARMING\n\nThis author has previously challenged traditional assertions concerning climate change [10]. \"Does what was discussed herein change our modelling for global warming?\"\n\nConsider that our Sun's insolation is better depicted by Fig. 2, than Fig. 1. Therefore, the Sun's insolation is actually dominated by thermal photons, that being at infra-red frequencies. Such thermal photons are readily adsorbed and then radially re-radiated by most all of our atmospheric gases, including the so-called greenhouse gases.",

The emissivity ϵ (λ, T) describes the spectral emittance of a blackbody as a function of wavelength and temperature, whereby the limit ϵ (λ, T) = 1 represents the case of an ideal blackbody radiator. Typical blackbody emitters are the Nernst glower and the globar, whereby either a ceramic rod (e.g., SiC) or a tungsten filament, respectively, are resistively heated.\n\nEven though thermal emitters are inexpensive, the emitted radiation-central wavelength and radiant intensitycan only be controlled by the temperature of the emitter element. Figure 1 shows the blackbody radiation of an ideal emitter and the temperature dependence of the emitted radiation in terms of wavelength. This dependence renders thermal emitters for specific applications in the fingerprint region (e.g., 6-15 µm) of limited utility, as for this spectral regime a thermal emitter would have to be operated at room temperature, and thus would have only low emissivity. To overcome these limits, one may refer to Kirchhoff's law of radiation. Kirchhoff's law states that the emissivity of a blackbody radiator at a given temperature and wavelength is equal to the ratio of emissivity ϵ and absorptivity α at that same wavelength and temperature constant:\n\nwhere R is the reflectivity, T the transmissivity and θ the angle of incidence of the light. Thus, following from Kirchhoff's law an adequate absorber must also be an adequate blackbody emitter, which can be exploited for the development of advanced thermal emitters. Despite evident progress in light source technology, a large number of the systems reported to date are based on either a change of a specific property of a natural material or a temperature change, and are, therefore, limited by operation at high temperatures, a limited operating frequency, or a slow modulation speed.",

Arguably, some frequencies may be considered as thermal energy, although not necessarily in the same manner as infrared.\n\nPart of the reason that it is so awkward to properly visualize and then interpret may be the constant changing of scale of wavelengths, e.g., nm, , mm. \"Does this help explain the assertion that temperature is directly proportional to the thermal energy density here on Earth's surface?\" It is certainly getting interesting but it is still not conclusive. Namely, \"how does one now explain the reality that system's here on Earth radiate blackbody radiation whose thermal signature cannot be approximated as some linear function of temperature?\"\n\nTemperature is a comparative based upon the Zeroth law. Here on Earth, all comparisons are made to our atmosphere, whose temperature is strongly influenced by our Sun's insolation. Arguably, our atmosphere's temperature adheres to the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation.\n\nFurthermore, thermal equilibrium does not mean that two systems in thermal contact exchange precisely the same radiation spectrum. Rather that they exchange the same quantity of thermal energy. And here on Earth, as the biggest of all heat sinks/baths, our atmosphere will govern the relationships that define any exchanges of thermal energy.\n\nSo perhaps, the best explanation for thermal energy witnessed here on Earth generally being a linear function of temperature is as follows. \"Our atmosphere has its thermal energy density (ET/V) directly proportional to temperature (T). And since all our systems are ultimately compared to the comparatively massive atmosphere then they too can be contemplated in terms of, ET/V ∝ T.\"\n\n\nXI.

Moreover, it would help explain what is witnessed, whether one is considering the blackbody radiation from either condensed matter, or from a polyatomic gas, i.e., the witnessed radiation is due to molecular collisions, and this creates a blackbody spectrum.\n\nCertainly, it would explain why one witnesses blackbody radiation in an enclosure, whether that enclosure is a vacuum, or is filled with a gas. Equally, it should help provide a correlation between P-T relationships and the sun's insolation. In so far as this would explain so much, at this point, it still must be taken as speculation.\n\nAnother question arises, \"to what degree is the measured solar radiance at sea level actually due to our Sun's solar influx, versus being a result of heat created during the numerous atmospheric intermolecular inelastic collisions [10,14], e.g., P-T relation [10,15]?\" It should be some combination of both. And if they are all related by similar Stephen-Boltzmann relationships (blackbody radiations) then thermal equilibrium may mean that we may never be able to separate them, when taking a measurement.\n\n\nXII. TEMPERATURE'S LIMITS\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, at the temperatures of hot blast furnaces (T=1,800 K) the peak radiation is in the near infrared. At such high temperatures, the thermal energy density is best defined by (2), e.g., it is not a linear function of temperature. Moreover, at such high temperatures the energy density associated with the blast furnace will be significantly greater than that of the surrounding atmosphere, hence the blast furnaces thermal energy will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a blast furnace is a system whose interaction with other system's cannot be expressed in terms of a linear function of temperature. This explains the white-hot blackbody radiation witnessed from hot molten metal, even though the visible part of the spectrum remains rather small for blackbody spectrum for T=1,800 K.",

In the environment, it occurs naturally in soils and sediments. In solution  [27,109,110]. Currently tungsten is classified as an \"emerging contaminant\" of concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [111]. Its average concentration in the lithosphere varies in the range of 0.2-2.4 mg/kg [112]. The residence time of tungstate in the solution amounts to about 20,000 years, which is ten times longer than the time needed for ocean mixing resulting in total homogeneity of water worldwide [113]. This phenomenon causes an increase of tungsten pollution all around the world. Tungsten was believed to be inert in the environment and less-toxic than other heavy metals, so it was used in many fields of industry [27,114]. Its major uses are tungsten-cemented carbides, metal wires, turbine blades, high temperature lubricants, catalysts, incandescent lamp filaments, television sets, heat sinks, and golf clubs [110,115]. Some phosphate fertilizers may contain 100 mg of tungsten per kg. Moreover it had been treated as an alternative to lead to produce fishing weights and ammunition. After the ban on lead shot in the USA and Norway for hunting waterfowl it was used in hunting and recreational shooting. Pollution prevention program, the Green Armament Technology (GAT), developed by the US Army proposed the usage of tungsten-tin and tungsten-nylon composites as less hazardous materials for low caliber ammunition [27,114,116]. Thus in sites of firing activities, such as combat operation zones, military, commercial, and private shooting ranges, the concentration of tungsten in soil may be higher. In 2005 Strigul et al. [112] reported in probably the first paper on the treatment of tungsten as an environmental threat revealing that its levels above 1% mass basis (i.e., 10,000 mg/kg) resulted in the death of 95% of bacterial components (Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescen) in 3 months, and caused death of ryegrass plants and red worms. Such tungsten concentrations also inhibit the growth of bacterial colonies, what could possibly deteriorate process performance",

Electron Sources. The standard electron source is a tungsten filament heated to 2000À3000°C. At this temperature, the electron energy is greater than the work function of tungsten. The thermally emitted electrons are accelerated by an electric field between the anode and filament. Another common electron source is a LaB 6 crystal, which produces electrons from a smaller effective area of the crystal vertex whose emitting surface is at a lower temperature because of a lower work function. This beam has higher coherence and current density. At present, the most advanced electron source, used in high performance microscopes, is the field emission gun (FEG). 59 The FEG beam is still smaller in diameter, more coherent, and ∼500Â brighter, with a very small spread of energies. 59 This is achieved by using single  crystal tungsten sharpened to give a tip radius ∼10À25 nm, as compared to 5À10 μm for LaB 6 crystals. The tip is coated with ZrO 2 , which lowers the work function for electrons. Thermally emitted electrons are extracted from the crystal tip by a strong potential gradient at the emitter surface (field emission), and then accelerated through voltages of 100À300 kV.",

The most widely used method for producing the thermal plasmas employs electric arcs. Most particularly, a free-burning arc is a simple method for producing such plasmas. 1) In the materials processing by thermal plasmas, it is important to take into consideration not only heat conduction mechanism in the materials but also heat transfer mechanism from the thermal plasma to the materials, because temperature of the plasma would strongly affect the heat input into the materials and then it would decide the results through the heat conduction in the materials. Furthermore, in the materials processing by the free-burning arc, the materials generally become an anode electrode opposite a tungsten cathode electrode. The mechanism of the anode heat transfer is more difficult to understand in comparison with simple heat transfer between thermal plasma and materials, because an electric current, namely, arc current exists in the anode. There are the anode fall heating, the electron enthalpy entering the anode and the electrical potential energy of work function of the anode material other than the conduction and the radiation in the anode heat transfer from the arc plasma. [1][2][3] Thus, understanding the relation among the temperatures of the arc plasma, the distributions of current and heat input on the anode, and the results is quite important for the ma-terials processing by the free-burning arcs.

He assessed the effects of the process parameters such as arc current, arc length, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric gas and gas flow rate on the current and heat input distributions in free-burning arc. However, no relation between thermodynamic state of the arc plasma and the distributions of current and heat input on the anode was shown in the assessment for the",

Consider a thermometer placed in a vacuum filled with blackbody radiation. When in thermal equilibrium, based upon (2) the measured temperature is:\n= ( / ) 1/4(3)\nAgain, ask did the vacuum have a temperature prior to the placement of the thermometer into it? Based upon (3), I would argue that it had a temperature. Of course, this assumes that the vacuum is sufficiently immense that its total thermal radiation is significantly greater than the total thermal energy that was contained within the thermometer, prior to its placement.

WHAT IS THERMAL ENERGY?\n\nThermal energy resides within condensed matter, as both intermolecular vibrations that are between molecules, and intramolecular vibrations that are between the various atoms within a molecule. A better definition may be that thermal energy consists of a spectrum of thermal photons (thermal radiation) whose wavelengths are sufficiently long that they are readily absorbed by condensed matter plus any phonons that are associated with molecular vibrations (both inter and intra). Of course, a most rudimentary definition being that thermal energy is heat.\n\nHere on Earth, thermal energy primarily involves frequencies at, and/or close to the infrared spectrum with the emphasis on the \"thermal infrared\" [aka mid infrared: (3μm < λ < 8μm)] and into the far infrared [aka long infrared (8μm < λ < 15μm)].\n\nShorter wavelength photons, such as those in the near infrared (740nm < λ < 3μm) and those considered as visible light (380nm < λ < 740nm) can also contribute as thermal energy, e.g., when they are absorbed by matter. This absorbed energy becomes part of that matter's various vibrational energies. And this energy is generally, then reradiated as thermal photons, i.e., at a lower frequency (infrared) than the absorbed frequencies.\n\n\nVI. WHAT ABOUT BLACKBODY RADIATION?\n\nBlackbody radiation is theoretically limited to cavities within crystalline matter. Strangely, it is also association with radiation from both our Sun, and very hot molten metal, neither of which are crystalline.\n\nMoreover, both liquids and amorphous solids lack any crystalline structure, and yet it is accepted that the thermal energy resides. \"Is this not also blackbody?\"\n\nBased upon accepted theory one might argue that there is some profound difference between thermal energy and blackbody radiation beyond their associations with temperature. Yet when considering their heat capacities, all condensed matter fundamentally adheres to the same principles, e.g., the law of Dulong and Petit. It strikes this author as odd that crystalline solids thermally behave the same as amorphous solids, yet theoretically they are not theoretically considered the same it comes to their radiation.",

The gas that is used to facilitate the arc of electrons is what gives the lamp its spectrum, as well as determining the stability of said spectrum [33].\n\nUnlike arc lamps, tungsten-halogen bulbs function by passing electricity along a wire of tungsten in the presence of a halogen gas [35]. This causes the tungsten to heat up and release gaseous tungsten, which then reacts with the halogen, producing light, before redepositing the tungsten onto the wire [36]. As the tungsten of these lamps needs to reach very high temperatures in order for it to function, they do not have a very long life compared to other light sources [37].\n\nLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a light source of growing popularity owing to their comparatively small size and low cost [38]. Unlike previously described lamps, multiple different colored LEDs are required in a fluorimeter in order to cover the same wavelengths emitted by a lamp [39]. LEDs function by using running electricity through a semiconducting material (e.g., GaAs), which causes electrical holes to be filled, releasing energy as light [40]. Additionally, the intensity of light offered by conventional LEDs is low compared to available lasers, despite both having similarly narrow spectra [41].",

A cryogenic cell can easily have surface area of >100 cm 2 , and would therefore have to experience a heat load of several watts. This would overwhelm most cryogenic refrigerators, so it is necessary to surround the cell with cold surfaces. Surrounding the cell by a blackbody shield cooled by a liquid nitrogen cryostat (77 K), or the first stage of a pulse tube cooler (∼ 30−50 K) will reduce the blackbody heat load on the cell to < 1% of the 300 K blackbody heat load. This heat load will instead be deposited into the blackbody shield; however, a typical liquid nitrogen cryostat or pulse tube cooler can easily handle these heat loads at these temperatures. The blackbody heat load can also be further reduced by covering the blackbody shield with several layers of thin aluminum-coated mylar \"superinsulation\".\n\nThe cell is also sometimes additionally enclosed in an inner radiation shield, typically around 4-5 K. This can help reduce the heat load further, since it could be eas-ier to superinsulate a radiation shield instead of the cell itself. Additionally, the 4 K shield could help to protect cryopumps, as discussed below.\n\n\nCryopumps\n\nEnclosing the cell in radiation shields means that the gas conductance to the external vacuum chamber is very low. If no pumping occurred inside the radiation shields, the buffer gas would build up to the point where the residual pressure was too high to allow for a beam. In the case of neon buffer gas, this can be solved by surrounding the cell with a radiation shield kept at a temperature where the vapor pressure of neon is acceptably low, which is simple to achieve with standard cryogenic refrigerators or liquid helium (for example, the vapor pressure of neon is < 10 −9 torr at 7 K). A neon cooled buffer gas beam inside a 4 K radiation shield can operate for extended periods of time; Hutzler et al. [7] operated such a beam continuously for over 24 hours without beam or vacuum degradation.",

Charged water droplets formed by nESI with diameters ranging from a few nanometers to ∼32 nm have been trapped in either Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) [42][43][44] or electrostatic ion trap based charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) instruments. 44 Water nanodrops with diameters around 20 -30 nm trapped for one second in an electrostatic ion trap lose 100's of kDa in mass corresponding to the continuous evaporation of many thousands of water molecules. 45 The rate at which solvent evaporation occurs depends on the effective droplet temperature, which is reduced in vacuum by evaporative cooling. When ions are trapped in high vacuum, ions reach a low steady state effective temperature where heat loss by evaporative cooling is balanced by energy absorption by blackbody radiation in the low-pressure trapping region (∼10 −9 Torr) of both FT-ICR MS and CDMS instruments. 46 Some collisional activation also occurs in CDMS due to the high ion kinetic energy and large collisional cross sections of nanodrops with diameters of 10's of nm. The slow rate of water evaporation in ultra-high vacuum is due to the very low effective temperatures of the trapped nanodrops. 43,45,47 Results from highly charged ions that are preserved in aqueous nanodrops but do not survive as bare ions in the gas phase clearly show that aqueous nanodrops can survive intact through the instrument and throughout the measurement process. 48,49 However, survival of these aqueous nanodrops requires unusually \"so\" interface conditions that minimize activation with rapid transfer to high vacuum where the rate of water evaporation is low.

INTRODUCTION\n\nTraditionally in thermodynamics the notion of thermal energy lacks the precision of clarity. One considers temperature (T) as the parameter that relates to the kinematic motions at the molecular level in most matter. This actually forms the basis of statistical thermodynamics, as can be found in most contemporary books [1,2]. Statistical arguments are based upon the kinematics of matter, hence the bizarre notion that all vacuums have no temperature, has become accepted. When measuring a system's temperature, a thermometer is placed into thermal contact with that system. Thermal equilibrium occurs once the influx of thermal energy equals the efflux between both the thermometer, and the system. This actually forms the basis of the transitive property known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics which states that \"If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other\" [1, pg 282]. Intuitively, the third system may be considered a thermometer.",

To better understand what happens inside the MoS 2 transistor, the spectral electron and phonon current distributions in Fig. 6(a-b) are investigated as next step. It can be observed in sub-plot (a) that electrons loose a substantial portion of their energy through phonon emission after passing the maximum of the electrostatic potential energy barrier, when they are accelerated by the strong electric field on the drain side. From subplot (b) it can be inferred that at the location with the highest phonon generation rate (and therefore the highest lattice temperature too, as explained later) at around x=31 nm, the phonon current is equal to 0 and the created lattice vibrations either propagate towards the drain (x=40 nm, positive current) or the source (x=0 nm, negative current) contact. The phonons that reach the source can interact there with electrons moving towards the drain and increase their backscattering rate 36 , thus leading to the current reduction visible in\n\nFig. 4 .\n4To complement this analysis, it is demonstrated in\n\nFigure 8 (\n8b) then reports the maximum effective lattice temperature increase extracted from the same transistors as before versus the electrical current I d . What matters in this sub-plot is no more the number of phonons that is generated (heat dissipation), but once they have been created how efficiently they can leave the active region of the logic switch.If the emitted phonons have a high group velocity, they more rapidly diffuse away from the region where they originate such that the effective lattice temperature at this location cannot rise as much as it would have if the phonon population would keep accumulating. Hence, the thermal transport properties determine to a large extend the magnitude of the self-heating effects. For example, in WS 2 , less power is dissipated at a given I d than in MoS 2 , but the lattice temperature increase ∆T is the same in both 2-D materials: less crystal vibrations are generated in WS 2 due to the weaker electron-phonon coupling and lower electron effective mass, but they propagate slower due to the higher atomic mass of tungsten.

The anode A and the photo electric sphere, which were of copper as before, were freed from gas by a pre liminary strong heating after the bake-out.

Immediately after the initiation of a dielectric barrier discharge of atmospheric pressure in mixtures of cadmium diiodide with inert gases, a filamentary regime of dielectric barrier discharge burning was observed. With an increase in the pump pulse repetition rate, a change in the shape of microdischarges was observed from cylindrical (at f ~ 10 kHz) to coneshaped -with a top on a metal electrode and a base on the inner surface of a quartz tube (at f ~ 100 kHz). As the mixture warmed up, the discharge color became pink. In this case, a more diffuse and homogeneous nature of the discharge was observed, and the brightness contrast in the volume discharge and filaments was significantly smoothed out.\n\nVol. 1, Issue 1 -47 © G-Labs 2020",

The compound must possess a dipole moment for microwave irradiation. A dipole is orients itself with an oscillating electric field and the electric field inverses in its every oscillation when a dipole is exposed to an alternating current and the dipole also rearrange itself to follow inverse electric field. The induced or permanent dipole respond to electric field and transfer power from electric field to the dielectrics and the dielectrics possess some residual energy as the polarization cannot follow an extremely rapid reversal pathway which is known as the hysteresis loss. The remaining energy induces heating in the dielectric material. This phenomenon is known as dielectric heating. The number of reversal of the dipole of the dielectric is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation and in every reversal of the dipole there will be hysteresis loss. So a household microwave oven commonly used irradiation frequency (2450 MHz) oscillates 2 x 2450 × 10 6 times per second and each oscillation is associated with a residual hysteresis loss and this total energy is transformed into the heat energy. [2][3][4][5] Kappe 6 and Von Hippel. 7 reported some values for the dissipation factor and based on the values are showed in Table 3.  So the basic concept of heating is the ability of the radiation to introduce polarization of charges within the dielectric material. The amount of energy absorbed by a domain depends on the microwave intensity and the absorption cross section of the domain. Molecules possessing a large absorption cross-section are selectively heated and such molecules molecular radiators. To summarize, it is principal note that MW irradiation dielectric constant and dielectric loss both the properties are a function of microwave frequency. However, both laboratory and domestic used microwave gadget generally operate at 2.5 GHz to admit a deeper penetration MW into the substances, result a more uniform heating.\n\n\nConduction Mechanism",

Kerosene was chosen as a fuel in this investigation due to its broad uses from household to combustion engines. The flame can be characterized using four different optical signals (see Fig. 1b). First, flame luminosity is essentially a combination of blackbody radiation of hot soot particles and chemiluminescence signals from chemical reactions of combustion intermediates such as OH, CH, or C 2 43 . The other three signals are induced by excitation by a nanosecond laser pulse 25,44,45 . The first laser-induced signal is ELS, which in a first approximation may be treated as Rayleigh scattering of the soot particles with sizes <1/10 of the laser excitation wavelength 46,47 . The ELS signal has a time span close to that of the excitation laser pulse (see Fig. 1b). Second, LII is the blackbody radiation from the soot particles when these nano-sized particles are heated up to their sublimation temperature of~4000 K, i.e. about twice the flame's natural temperature of~2000 K 48 . The size of the particles can be determined using time-resolved (TiRe) LII since larger soot particles cool slower than the smaller ones, in the range of several hundreds of nanoseconds (see Fig. 1b) [49][50][51] . Finally, LIF is the spontaneous emission of photons when the valence electrons in PAH molecules are excited to the conduction band by laser light absorption. PAH molecules usually produce LIF signals with lifetimes shorter than 100 ns 44 . Therefore, traditionally, for collecting a specific signal of interest, time-gated cameras are used. For example, a short and sufficiently delayed time gate allows the detection of LII while rejecting flame luminosity and most of the LIF.",

As illustrated in Figure 2A, hemolysis activity of the toxin was dose-dependent and its IC 50 was measured to be 8.9 nM (as calcuated by Graphpad Prism ver. 11). Activity of the FraC toxin was very rapid since the ¼ dilution of the purified toxin completely lysed the RBC solution in 1 min ( Figure 2B).\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, FraC toxin loses its hemolytic activity after pre-incubation with FBS. By increasing the time of FraC incubation with serum, the all activity has been lost. This result shows that there might not be a competing   agent in the serum, which inhibits the activity of FraC toxin. As shown in Figure 4, there is no statistically significant difference between intact FBS and heated FBS. The rational for this assay was that if there were any proteinaceous fractions in FBS that inhibits hemolytic activity of the FraC by such an enzymatic reaction (e. g. any kind of proteases), so the heating could reverse the inhibitory effect of the serum. As the results show, it seems that there is not any enzymatic activity responsible for the inhibitory effect of the serum.\n\n\nSerum inhibitory effect on cytotoxic activity of FraC\n\nSeveral cell viability experiments in our laboratory have shown that FraC toxin has not activity against cell membranes in the presence of FBS. As shown in Figure 5, HL-60 and KG-1 cells were completely lysed (permeabilized to trypan blue) in the presence of higher concentrations of FraC toxin only if they had been resuspended in serum-free RPMI media or PBS buffer. In the presence of serum, not only the activity of the FraC toxin was orders of magnitude lower, but it was not dose-dependent too.

Both serum and urine were analyzed for the levels of phosphorous (P) and calcium (Ca) (Figs 1 and 2). In the OVX control group, as well as in other treatments, there was no significantly change in serum P and Ca. The level of P and Ca in urine increased significantly in the OVX group over sham control. Administration of both doses of FRAC and raloxifene significantly reduced (p<0.05) the OVX-induced increase in urine levels of P and Ca. Levels of bone markers, ALP and TRAP were significantly enhanced (p<0.001) after OVX. Both ALP and TRAP levels were reduced significantly (p<0.001) and dose-dependently after FRAC treatment (versus OVX). Serum ALP and TRAP level were also reduced significantly (p<0.001) after raloxifene treatment (Fig 1). The OVX caused a significant increase (p<0.001) in the level of urine hydroxyproline (HP) compared to sham control. However, the level of HP in raloxifene and FRAC (100 and 200 mg/kg) treated groups were distinctly lowered (p<0.001) compared to the OVX group (Fig 2).

This dual approach produced new SA frac. values based on the real composition of the particle surfaces measured by SANS. Moreover, the linear relationship between log P and SA frac. remained valid for the new data (Figure 6a). A new linear regression was fit to the data, yielding SA frac. = 0.110 × log P − 0.085. This new equation can be used to predict particle size if it is assumed that k remains constant in the PSC model. The cationic copolymer series was similarly reanalyzed. Combining the data obtained for the anionic and cationic series (Figure 6b) produces a linear relationship (R 2 = 0.96) between log P and the modeled SA frac. (k = 0.5). This highlights the self-consistency of the refined PSC model. Finally, the linear equation representing the relationship between log P for the hydrophobic comonomer and the modeled SA frac. for the MAA copolymers crosses the x-axis (i.e., SA frac. = 0) at a log P value of between 0.5 and 1. This suggests that, at this log P value, the nanoparticles would require no ionic comonomer to be located at the surface to confer colloidal stability. Alternatively, a comonomer exhibiting a log P of between 0.5 and 1, or below 0.5, would not be sufficiently hydrophobic to induce self-assembly, hence, such copolymers would remain molecularly dissolved in an aqueous solution.\n\n\n■ CONCLUSIONS",

In reality, N depletion should also happen where CO depletion occurs, although perhaps at a more modest level (Flower et al. 2006b). The level of N depletion will naturally affect the absolute abundances of N 2 H + and N 2 D + .\n\nTo investigate the influence of N depletion, we run simulations using two higher N depletion factors ( N = 100, 1000), and with CO depletion factor set to 1000. The results are plotted in the left  two columns of Figure 8. It is easy to see that the column densities of N 2 H + and N 2 D + are reduced and the spatial structures of D N 2 H + frac are enhanced (note that in this figure the range of D N 2 H + frac now extends up to values of 10).\n\n\nCombining higher cosmic-ray ionization rates with other models\n\nIn §3.2.3, it was shown that cosmic-ray ionization rate has a strong impact to the level of D N 2 H + frac and its spatial structure. However, we have not yet investigated its influence on the models with higher depletion factors. Thus combinations of an higher cosmicray ionization rate of = 1.0 × 10 −16 with the fDCO1000 and fDN100_fDCO1000 models are carried out. The results are also plotted in Figure 8. These models do not show a strong effect of further enhancement of the spatial structure of D N 2 H + frac . However, due to the effect of shortening chemical time scales, the enhanced cosmic ray models have generally enhanced levels of D N 2 H + frac by about a factor of 10 than in the lower cosmic ray cases. Final values of D N 2 H + frac that are > 1 can be achieved in some regions.\n\n\nAverage Core Properties and Comparison to Observed Cores\n\n\nAverage core abundances and D N 2 H + frac",

Especially model Aged6e5 can reach D N 2 H + frac ∼ 0.1, similar to the levels achieved in model fDCO1000. However, now the effect is more global, i.e., there is not as strong a spatial concentration of D N 2 H + frac following the column density structure. We also see that the similar levels of D N 2 H + frac that arise in these models are achieved with quite different absolute abundances of N 2 H + and N 2 D + . We will return to these metrics as a way to distinguish between models in §3.3.\n\n\nCombination of initial OPR H 2 and CO Depletion\n\nIn §3.2.1, we saw that lower initial OPR H 2 helps the growth of D N 2 H + frac , while its spatial structure is not enhanced with density. In contrast, the models of §3.2.4 with a higher CO depletion factor have a clearer structure of D N 2 H + frac following column density. Therefore, we try a series of combinations of initial OPR H 2 and CO depletion to survey whether D N 2 H + frac can have a stronger correlation with column density. We consider two possible CO depletion factors: 10 and 1000, and four possible values of initial OPR H 2 : 3, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001. From the results of these eight models, initial OPR H 2 does not appear to enhance the spatial structure of D N 2 H + frac . Although the initial OPR H 2 does not further enhance the spatial structure, the models with high CO depletion factor and low initial OPR H 2 still show the possibility to obtain high values of D N 2 H + frac . We thus focus on two models, OPR0.01_fDCO1000 and OPR0.001_fDCO1000, which are listed in Table 1 and which will be considered further in the comparison to observed systems (below).\n\n\nCombination of N and CO depletion factors",

The extraction method of the flavonoid fraction from A. membranaceus stems and leaves was the same as described in Section 2.3. The separation and purification processes are as follows: the EAF fraction (3.2 g) was separated by AB-8 macroporous resin and eluted with different concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, and 95%) to obtain four fractions (Frac. 30,50,70,and 95).

One of the main challenges in biological nanopores analysis is to obtain nanopores with different size and shape. Most biological nanopores are formed by multiple repeats of individual monomers. Hence, different nanopore sizes might be obtained by engineering the protein oligomeric composition 36 . We noticed that at pH 7.5 a small fraction of wild-type FraC (Wt-FraC) nanopores showed a lower conductance (1.26 ± 0.08 nS, −50 mV, type II Wt-FraC) compared with the dominant fraction (2.26 ± 0.08 nS, −50 mV, type I Wt-FraC), suggesting that FraC might be able to spontaneously assemble into nanopores with a smaller size. At pH 4.5, type I and type II FraC nanopores were also observed, however, a smaller nanopore conductance was identified alongside (0.42 ± 0.03 nS, type III Wt-FraC, −50 mV, Fig. 1b). Occasionally, nanopores with a yet smaller conductance were observed, however, their appearance was too rare for meaningful characterization. We noticed that the reconstitution of lower conductance nanopores depended on several purification conditions (Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). In particular, the occurrence of type II and type III nanopores increased when the oligomers were stored in solution for several weeks or when the concentration of monomeric Wt-FraC was reduced during oligomerization (Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). In an effort to enrich type II and type III FraC nanopores, we weakened the interaction between the nanopore and the lipid interface by substituting W112 and W116 at the lipid interface of FraC ( Fig. 1a) with serine. We reasoned that a lower concentration of monomers, during oligomerization, would increase the population of lower molecular mass oligomers. Rewardingly, we found that at both pH 7.5 and pH 4.5 the proportion of type II and type III FraC nanopores increased dramatically. For example, W112S-W116S-FraC formed 60% of type II pore at pH 7.5, and 40% of type III pore at pH 4.5 (Fig. 1b,  Supplementary Figure",

In spite of various designed drugs, chemoresistance remains the main obstacle in cancer cure. Therefore, developing novel strategy for treatment of CML is an urgent need. Fragaceatoxin C (FraC) is novel protein toxin from a sea anemone called actinia fragacea with great impacts against cells by pore formation and disturbing cell membrane integrity. The aim of this study was evaluation of FraC toxin toxicity against K562. The bacteria cells harboring expression vector of FraC were induced by IPTG and purified by Ni 2+ -NTA sepharose affinity chromatography. Then, purified toxin activity was evaluated using RBC hemolytic test. Eventually, evaluation of FraC cytotoxicity and apoptosis were performed using MTT and flow cytometery assays, respectively. Our results revealed that FraC toxin decreased K562 cells viability in a dose-and time-dependent manner with a whole destroy of cancer cells at 35.00 µg mL -1 after 72 hr. Furthermore, flow cytometery analysis indicated that FraC toxin enhanced necrosis along with apoptosis in K562 cells in a dose dependent manner. We speculated that FraC toxin could be considered as a novel candidate for cancer cell researches and treatments provided that it should be turned into a specific agent by engineering and directing to cancer cell membrane.\n\nIntroduction",

FraC was engineered to generate strong EOF to attract the proteins into the pore lumen. Using EOF as the driving force makes it a versatile method for analyzing proteins carrying different surface charge. Five protein analytes ranging from 1.3 kDa to 25 kDa were investigated. They generated distinct ionic current blockades for identification with FraC. Particularly FraC was shown to resolve endothelin proteins with just a single amino acid variation. This is a well conducted work, where a new biological nanopore is introduced for protein identification with high resolution. The manuscript is clearly written and enjoyable to read.

Biological therapies including monoclonal antibodies and immune effectors have been the subject of multiple research projects. Pore-forming proteins may become the other biological strategy to overcome the problems associated with current treatments. But detailed mechanisms of their action on target membranes remained to be elucidated. We aimed to study the cytotoxic effects of recombinant form of fragaceatoxin C on AML cell lines HL-60 and KG-1.Materials and Methods:We cloned the FraC gene in pET-28a (+) bacterial expression vector and the expressed recombinant FraC protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Then, cytotoxic effects of the recombinant protein were examined on two AML cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1. Effects of serum and calcium ion were explored by hemolysis assay in more details. Results: Our results showed that the recombinant C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged FraC protein has potent cytotoxic effects on both AML cell lines, with IC 50 =5.6, and 4.6 µg.ml-1 for HL-60 and KG-1 cells, respectively. Serum showed dose-dependent and also time-dependent inhibitory effects on the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the FraC protein. Pre-incubation of the toxin with different concentrations of calcium ion also inhibited hemolytic activity of FraC toxin. Conclusion: Results of the present study showed that FraC has potential anti-tumor effects. By detailed investigation of the inhibition mechanism of serum and calcium effects in the future, it can be possible to design target sites for clinical applications of the toxin.\n\nIntroduction",

                    "contents": "Control of Particle Size in the Self-Assembly of Amphiphilic Statistical CopolymersFor the copolymer series with differing hydrophobic A units (Figure 3a), incorporating a more hydrophobic comonomer at a given (fixed) MAA content always produces larger nanoparticles. This is because of the difference in critical surface charge density required for colloidal stability. For example, the PSC model indicates that the HM copolymer series requires 52% surface coverage of the nanoparticles by MAA units, whereas only 14% surface coverage is required for the MM copolymer series (Figure 3a). These observations are consistent with the greater hydrophobic character of HMA compared to MMA. To achieve a higher surface charge density for the same mole fraction of MAA units, the copolymer aggregation number must increase to reduce the particle surface-to-volume ratio and hence increase the number of surface-confined MAA units. This leads to a larger overall copolymer volume per nanoparticle and hence a corresponding increase in the mean nanoparticle radius (Figure 3a, compare nanoparticle radii observed for copolymers with comparable MAA contents). For the EHM series, the modeled SA frac. reaches the PSC model's theoretical limit of 1 (i.e., the entire nanoparticle surface is covered with MAA units), which is not physically realistic. It is rather unlikely that all of the MAA units are simultaneously co-located at the nanoparticle surface owing to the statistical distribution of this comonomer along the copolymer backbone. Hence, the earlier assumption that k = 1 may not be valid. If k < 1, then the modeled SA frac. will be reduced accordingly so the EHM series will no longer achieve the maximum SA frac. of 1. It should also be noted that the dispersions were formulated so that the MAA units were fully ionized (pH ∼ 8). However, it is probable that a reduction of MAA ionization will lead to a higher SA frac. being required for stabilization and could eventually lead to mass precipitation due to insufficient charge stability. Although this simple PSC model provides good fits to the experimental data, it would be more useful to relate the model parameters to the hydrophobic character of the alkyl methacrylate comonomer. The partition coefficient (log P) is commonly used to rank the hydrophobic character of compounds: it is defined as the concentration distribution of a compound between two immiscible solvents,",

Ethanol extract of tubers of Pueraria tuberosa and its various fractions (hexane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and aqueous) were analyzed for total phenolic and flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity. The ethyl acetate fraction showed maximum phenolic and flavonoid content, and antioxidant property (Tables 1 and 2), and was selected as the FRAC.\n\nThe antiosteoporotic activity of the FRAC was evaluated in OVX rats by determining biochemical and biomechanical parameters, body and organ weights, and histopathology (Figs 1-6). The pattern of change in bone mineral parameters such as P and Ca in the present study confirms earlier findings of minor bone mineralization and balanced mineral homeostasis [4]. The FRAC did not change homeostasis, which may be due to enhanced absorption of calcium \n\n\nPLOS ONE",

In contrast, in the presence of SM/DOPC (1:1) vesicles, the bands of treated and untreated toxin display the same molecular mass (Fig. 7A). The mutein 8-69 OX bound to membranes was also employed, because its N terminus remains exposed to the solvent constrained by the disulfide bond. As expected, 8-69 OX was also susceptible to the proteolytic activity of PK in DOPC and SM/DOPC (1:1) vesicles. To determine the extent of the cleavage, the proteins were subjected to sequencing of their N-terminal regions. The sequencing data revealed that, in the presence of vesicles of DOPC, FraC WT and 8-69 OX were cleaved at the N terminus by PK, rendering products in which the first 4 and the first 11 residues, respectively, were missing (Fig. 7, B and C). FraC bound to SM/DOPC (1:1) was not digested by PK as expected from the position of the band in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, whereas 8-69 OX was cleaved at the same position seen after incubation with vesicles of DOPC.

These oligomers, presumably corresponding to pore particles, cover the SM-rich domains in an arrangement previously observed in FraC and other actinoporins (44,45) or the SM-specific PFT lysenin (46). The crosssection profile of the oligomeric complexes reveals an average diameter of 7.5 Ϯ 0.6 nm, a value in good agreement with the  mean diameter (average of outer and inner diameters) of the pore determined by x-ray crystallography (ϳ8 nm). Eight protein chains are observed in three well resolved pore particles encountered (see for example Fig. 5C). Because prepores of FraC were not resolved in DOPC (high diffusivity prevented AFM contouring), a construct of FraC bearing a double cysteine mutation (V8C/K69C, termed 8-69 OX ) was instead examined on supported membranes made of SM/DOPC (1:1). Under oxidizing conditions, the N-terminal segment of this mutein is covalently attached to the protein core by means of a disulfide bond, preventing the protein from generating a transmembrane pore, and thus inactivating the toxin (15,23). As with WT FraC, the construct 8-69 OX also gave rise to a dense array of pore-like particles (Fig. 6), indicating that the protein readily oligomerizes in the presence of membranes even if the N-terminal region remains attached to the protein. The average diameter of these particles (6.2 Ϯ 0.7 nm) is somehow smaller than that of WT protein, reflecting the influence of the N-terminal region attached to the ␤-core region. Because of the constraints imposed by the disulfide bond, the conformation of the N-terminal region in 8-69 OX is likely to differ from that of WT FraC bound to liposomes made of DOPC (Fig. 3, D and E). To further investigate this question, we employed biochemical assays (see below).",

The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16.

[70] Note that the very convenient \"tunnelling\" picture holds because we implicitly express the laser-electron interaction within the dipole approximation, as stressed e.g. in [68]. It is nevertheless a safe approach in the intensity range we are dealing with in the present tutorial, as non-dipole contributions become significant only far beyond the barrier suppression threshold.\n\n[71] The electrons we are concerned with-the ones that eventually recollide with the parent ion-are never really ionized because this would mean they remain in the continuum after the process is over. In fact, they must be considered quasi-bound. It is thus more precise to speak of \"birth in the continuum\". Nonetheless, within this tutorial, we will often speak of \"ionization\", knowing that this is a bit sloppy.\n\n[72] The second of these is a simplification neglecting the finite distance from the nucleus (cp. figure 2, where x0 ≈ 10 a.u.= 0.5 nm) at which the electron is \"born\".\n\nAlthough the electron will follow trajectories leading it only a few nm away from its parent ion, it is not worth worrying about this, since at this birth instant, the electron has so little kinetic energy (actually, in this model none at all), that its de Broglie wavelength is much larger than the 'problem' anyhow.\n\n[73] As we consider only the x-component of the electron movement with one initial condition, this quantum spreading is not included in our description. It can be described by launching for every birth time many trajectories with different small initial velocities in all three dimensions and counting all trajectories that pass through a given finite cross-section around the origin as \"returns\". This was done in [135].\n\n[74] Philippe Antoine, Anne L'Huillier, and Maciej Lewenstein, \"Attosecond pulse trains using high-order harmonics,\" Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 1234-1237 (1996).",

The theoretically expected value of k H /k D is 7-10 (18). Perdeuterated linoleic acid yielded a similar kinetic isotope effect as [11S-2 H]linoleic acid, which implies a small secondary isotope effect. The reason for the large primary kinetic isotope effect is unknown but might be related to proton leakage through a potential barrier (18). The de Broglie wavelengths are 0.5 Å for 1 H and 0.3 Å for 2 H at 10 kJ mol Ϫ1 , and the probability of proton tunneling is a function of these wavelengths and the barrier width (25,26).

The scaling was implemented by the transformation ϑ → ϑR 0 /λ, where ϑ is the scattering angle, R 0 is the molecular size and λ is the de Broglie wavelength. Whereas the alignment moments furnished by the Fraunhofer model coincide exactly upon scaling in ϑ (black solid line), such a scaling brings the exact moments (filled circles, squares, and triangles) quite close to one another, but does not result in their exact matching. The remaining differences among the scaled exact moments corresponding to different collision energies attest to non-diffractive contributions to scattering, the influence of the attractive branch of the PES, and a breakdown of the sudden approximation. For instance, the scaled exact moments corresponding to 520 and 1000 cm −1 come close to one another, while the oscillations for 150 cm −1 are quite off, especially for the a 2 0 (j ) moment. We ascribe this discrepancy to the potential well of 25 cm −1 [13] that brings about non-diffractive contributions ing channels.

These changes in the case of non-volatile oxide smokes were proved to be caused by the aggregating of the smaller particles to form larger complexes. Now, in order to follow this process in a quantitative manner, it is necessary to determine the average mass of a particle at different periods in the age of the smoke. That is to say, some method must be used which can be carried out quickly, so that the particles have not time to increase appre ciably in size. Now, none of the usual methods which deal with the movement of individual particles are suitable, because, apart from the validity of the Stokes-Cunningham equation(2), on which the majority of them are based, they are in practice too slow, and require the mean of a large number of observations if a representative value for the average size is to be obtained.

Identical particles are those which have the same intrinsic (or \"internal\") properties (and the same values associated with those intrinsic properties), i.e. mass, charge, spin. So two electrons are identical to each other. And two protons, or two neutrons, are similarly identical to each other. But electrons are clearly not identical to protons, nor to neutrons. (We apologise for labouring the point to this extent but the terms \"identical\" and \"indistiguishable\" are often used interchangeably -including in many textbooks -and this has led to quite some confusion at times).\n\nIf we have a collection of identical particles then they are indistinguishable if we cannot separate them on the basis of their \"external\" properties such as position or momentum. But classically it is possible to distinguish between identical particles (at least in principle): we can effectively \"label\" individual identical particles on the basis of their positions or trajectories and distinguish them accordingly 4 . Quantum mechanically, however, the standard argument is that due to delocalisation we lose this ability to label particles on the basis of their trajectories and they then become indistinguishable.\n\nBut to what extent is this true? Are quantum particles indeed indistinguishable? One can find undergraduate-level descriptions of quantum statistics [30] which claim that quantum particles can in fact be distinguished on the basis of what might be called a \"Rayleigh criterion\" for wavepackets: if two particles are separated by a distance greater than their de Broglie wavelength (i.e. such that the wavefunction overlap is minimal) then they are distinguishable on the basis of their respective positions. Versteegh and Dieks [27] invoke similar arguments about the spatial extent of wavepackets enabling identical quantum particles to be distinguished.\n\nHowever, whether this is a valid condition for distinguishability is far from clear-cut. In his commentary on Ginsberg et al.'s work [22], Fleicschhauer [23] states the following:\n\nIn the quantum world, particles of the same kind are indistinguishable: the wavefunction that describes them is a superposition of every single particle of that kind occupying every allowed state. Strictly speaking, this means that we can't talk, for instance, about an electron on Earth without mentioning all the electrons on the Moon in the same breath.",

If the inner membrane has only electrical connectivity across the two macroscopic phases and is \"conveniently directional\" (permits only an energy-aided \"in to out\" pumping of protons and a facile \"out to in\" return), then the energy expended for \"in to out\" proton mass transfer would concomitantly increase with any incremental concentration or potential gradient that needs to be set up. Further, the buildup of such a higher potential cannot happen if the \"out to in\" proton movement is facile and does not incur energy expense (that is-if there is no resistance to the inward movement of protons). As soon as a proton goes out expending energy, the proton would return spontaneously. So, the inward proton movement must also be restrictive. This scenario would be countered with the outer-membrane's permissivity. If the inner membrane becomes restrictive, then the protons escape through the outer membrane, thereby dissipating the potentials. In both scenarios, the pumping-based harnessing of an \"accumulated or generated\" potential difference would become non-viable. Now, it is known that in biological systems, the potentials of most resting plasma membranes are usually found to range between -40 to -80 mV (the inside being usually negative), and it is generally understood that these potentials are primarily dictated by potassium or chloride ions' permeability/concentrations. These ions are found (in or out) at concentration ranges of 10 -3 to 10 -5 M. The plasma membrane potential is generally not modulated by proton permeability or concentrations because protons are available in the range of only ~10 -7 M. Now, you can see that if the resting potential is in some small way affected by nM to μM levels of protons, it would be rendered insignificant by the greater operational principles. This is because the overall proton equilibriums are connected with other ions' equilibriums. There would be adsorbents/chelators on both sides that could give & take the various ions.

The generation of an attosecond electron wavepacket is particularly important for the applications since it offers the possibility to combine an extreme temporal resolution, related to the strongly nonlinear dependence of the tunneling ionization process on pulse intensity, to an extreme spatial resolution, related to the de Broglie wavelength of the ejected electron. For typical energies of this electron the corresponding de Broglie wavelength is of the order of a few Ångströms. Such extreme spatial resolution is at the heart of molecular tomography, which has been proven to be able to reconstruct the molecular orbitals of a few molecules [15][16][17].",

As lias been explained, the criterion employed to obtain a constant temperature so far has been a constant resistance of the wire. Now the resistance measures the average temperature of the wire across its section, whereas what is required in these measure ments is a constant surface temperature, so that any change which alters the temperature gradient from the centre of the wire to the circumference will alter the surface temperature at constant resistance. Increasing the gas pressure facilitates the flow of heat from the surface of the wire and must therefore increase the internal radial temperature gradient. It is evident, then, that increasing the gas pressure lowers the surface temperature when the resistance is kept constant. It might be thought that this effect would be small in the thin wires used (0'01 centim. diameter), but the leak is a very rapidly varying function of the temperature, so a small temperature error produces a big change in the leak.",

Here, four cases were examined in which the amount of acid initially added was varied. At room temperature, it can be assumed that the deacetylation reaction proceeds at a much slower rate in comparison to the ash neutralization scheme. Under this assumption, the toy model reduces to which has been solved numerically in MATLAB using a Runge-Kutta scheme (ODE23s) coupled with a rootfinding procedure for the proton concentration. The equations are solved simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 6, at low initial pH (series 13), pH is constant as the concentration of added acid is in excess of the neutralization potential of the ash. With decreasing initial added acid (series 14-15), the neutralization reaction proceeds until all the ash is reacted. With series 16, no added acid, the pH varies weakly with time. We interpret this result through the toy model, and advance the argument that the neutralization reaction proceeds but the kinetics are extremely slow due to the low proton concentration.   We now move to perhaps the main findings of this work and examine the evolution of pH during prehydrolysis treatment. In our final set of experiments, we examine the evolution of the proton concentration at elevated temperatures. Here we must include the effect of deacetylation and as a result, the full toy model must be solved numerically using MATLAB. We treat Eqs. 16-17 as a system of equations and solve this initial value problem in conjunction with a root-finding procedure to estimate [H + ] from Eq. 15. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Again at low initial pH, proton concentration varies weakly with time (cf series 17 and 18) and remains essentially at its initial value. This was the expected result as demonstrated earlier through steady-state analysis under excess acid conditions, the pH should remain essentially constant. Below this limit complex behavior is observed. Under autohydrolysis conditions (series 20 and 21), there is a rapid initial drop in pH followed by a diminished rate at longer times. However, the most curious result is given by series 21 where non-monotonic behavior, i.e. the pH initially rises and then falls, is observed.

The photoelectron is pulled out from a localized inner-shell molecular orbital by an X-ray photon. We show that a transient change in the atomic positions from their equilibrium will lead to a sensitive change in the alignment-averaged PADs, which can be measured and used to retrieve the former. Exploiting the experimental convenience of changing the photon polarization direction, we show that it is advantageous to use PADs obtained from multiple photon polarization directions. A simple single-scattering model is proposed and benchmarked to describe the photoionization process and to do the retrieval using a multiple-parameter fitting method.One of the most important goals of ultrafast atomic, molecular, and optical physics is to observe dynamic structure changes of isolated molecules, in particular, the change of atomic positions versus time so that a molecular movie can be created. Several methods have been proposed or demonstrated, including ultrafast X-ray diffraction (UXD) 1-3 using the recently developed femtosecond free-electron X-ray lasers, ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) 4-7 using short pulses of electron beams, and laser-induced electron diffraction (LIED) 8-10 using recollision electrons that have tunneled out previously from the target.Another proposed method, also taking advantage of the femtosecond free-electron X-ray lasers, is ultrafast photoelectron diffraction (UPED) 11-13 . The idea is simple: An electron can be pulled out from an inner-shell orbital that is localized to an emitter atom by absorbing an X-ray photon, and on its way out to the detector the electron can be scattered by the surrounding atoms. The detected electron diffraction pattern is the result of the interference between the direct, or unscattered, electron wave and the scattered electron wave, therefore it encodes molecular structure information, or the transient structure of the molecule in a typical pump-probe scheme after some dynamic structure change has been initiated.Comparing to the UXD method, which uses X-ray scattering directly, the UPED method needs to convert an X-ray photon into a photoelectron. Doing so gives the following advantages: First, a lower X-ray energy is needed to achieve the same de Broglie wavelength. For example, to achieve the same 1 Å de Broglie wavelength, an X-ray",

In applying the theory to planar molecules, the corresponding boundary condition is C n point symmetry about an axis perpendicular to the plane [9]. In addition, it is necessary that the holes that are created in the HOMO band when the two electrons are excited are delocalized so as to rule out Frenkel exciton-like excitations where the hole and the excited electron are on the same or neighboring carbon sites. When these conditions are satisfied, there can be paired spin singlet states with energies on the order of several 10s of eV above the LUMO band and characteristic lengths on the scale of the C-C separation [6]. In [1,2] the authors point out that the energy of the 40 eV resonance is related to the distance between neighboring carbon atoms. To see the connection, we make the assumption that the Coulomb pair decays into a zero total momentum state with the two free electrons having the same kinetic energy. We express the energy in terms of the electron mass and the de Broglie wavelength, λ DB . With a resonance energy of 40 eV, we find λ DB = 2.6 Å, a value that is approximately twice the C-C separation of 1.4 Å. A similar argument can be made for the 10 eV resonance, with result that λ DB in this case is 5.2 Å. Expanding the localized state wave function, characterized by the length scale λ LOC , in terms of the symmetrized two-electron plane-wave functions, it becomes evident that plane-wave states with λ DB << λ LOC do not make a significant contribution to the expansion. It follows that the maximum spatial extent of the pair is on the order of λ DB . It should be noted that the introduction of the de Broglie wave presented here pertains to the 'free' electrons that result from the breakup of the bound pair. In contrast, in [1,2] the de Broglie wavelength is associated with the kinetic energy of the bound pair.\n\n\nAnalysis",

(All the while, we have to also accept the assumption that the membrane is impermeable, or should I say, \"conveniently permeable\" to protons!! If Mitchell had used this term, his hypothesis would have had more appeal!) But let us keep indulging this consideration even further. Let us accept that reduction of a protein could reorganize its electronic distribution and therefore, potentially effect a change in its conformation or induce some specific channeling/relays and thereby, enable flipping of protons across membranes. But that would require an undisturbed \"surrounding stature\" to rest on and considerable time for the process to occur. That is-once a protein gets an electron, there should be no significant amounts of redox active agent(s) nearby, that could mess with (or quench) its 'excited state'. Then, the protein should flip and upon this event, it should lose the proton and thereby revert to its natural state.\n\nThis requirement too is rather unlikely to be met because the phospholipid interface would be subjected to a barrage of different types of species. 13 Furthermore, the passage of an electron through a given point within a relay could potentially lead to an expulsion of a single proton to the outside.

This instability initiates near the laser spot where the chemical potential (or surface tension) is lowest, and propagates away from the spot to a point along the tubule at which the local surface tension falls below the critical tension Σ cr = κ/R 2 0 which characterizes the instability. Typical growth frequencies are ω ∼ 25 s −1 [7], which corresponds to times τ ω ∼ 10 −1 s. We note that the experiments find a significant time delay of order seconds before the instability, [20], a still-unexplained observation.\n\nThe estimate above for τ ss assumes a bare 2D compression modulus B, while GNPS (see [13]) pointed out that B undergoes significant softening at the lengthscale of the tubule, due to the thermal fluctuations at low surface tension, and estimated a decrease of up to three orders of magnitude. This, correspondingly, would increase the value of τ ss to 10 −2 s, so that an accurate quantitative calculation must include the dynamics of the increase in surface tension. This leads to, effectively, a smaller applied tension σ and hence a slower propagation speed. This spirit was followed in the approach of Granek and Olami [5].\n\nOur interpretation assumes that the trap accommodates material by folding, or some other means.

This level varied from preparation to preparation (80-120 mv), apparently related to the amplitude of the presynaptic spike and resting potential level. The rising portion of the curve, from 60 to 100 mv depolarization, is seen to correspond to the relationship found in the control case, using directly evoked spikes (Fig. 2 A). Beyond this maximum level, the PSP amplitude decreased and finally was completely blocked during strong depolarization (Fig. 10 A8).\n\nThe \"turning-off\" of transmitter release with increasing presynaptic depolarization was completely graded and must represent the mobilization of a process which qualitatively competes with the normal mechanism of transmitter release.

The dependence of the molecular beam width, defined as the outermost radius at which the signal falls to 1/ √ e of its maximum value, on detuning (∆) is shown in Fig. 4a. The sign of this dependence is opposite that of Doppler cooling and is a clear signature of the magnetically-assisted Sisyphus effect. Both Sisyphus heating and cooling are optimized at detunings of ∆ ≈ ±20 MHz, and we observe a ∼ 3x decrease in molecular beam width for optimal cooling, corresponding to a significant increase in on-axis beam brightness. The dependence of the molecunumber density and λ dB i ∼ 1/ √ T i is the de Broglie wavelength defined in terms of the temperature along the ith spatial direction. Because we cool in 1D only, ρ scales as 1/ √ T . lar beam width on cooling laser intensity is shown in Fig. 4b. For both Sisyphus cooling (∆ > 0; circles) and Sisyphus heating (∆ < 0; squares), the beam width changes monotonically from its unperturbed value until saturating around an intensity of 600 mW/cm 2 . This corresponds to a maximum cooled fraction of 60(7)%, defined as the portion of molecules captured by the Sisyphus effect and cooled into the narrow central peak. This saturation indicates that we are able to cool all molecules in our cryogenic beam with velocity v trans < v c , given the initial Gaussian velocity spread σ v ≈ 1.6 m/s ≈ v c . Finally, we plot the cooled fraction as a function of applied magnetic field for ∆ > 0 (Fig. 4c).

This analysis explains why most highly porous materials, including polymers, can adsorb a relatively large amount of H 2 at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K), some of them up to 8.0 wt%, but the capacity drops to < 1.0 wt% under ambient conditions. Therefore, to increase H 2 adsorption ability at room temperature via physisorption, we must increase the adsorption enthalpy . To achieve this, several methods from the theoretical perspective have been proposed. A first approach is to create as many as ultra micropores (< 1 nm) at the atomic scale as possible. Theoretical simulations show that at low pressure and high temperature (desired conditions of the DOE), graphite with an inter-layer distance of 6 Å (0.6 nm) has the highest adsorption capability, of above 10 kJ/mol, achieved through the overlap of adsorption potentials from the opposite walls [27]. In addition to such 1D slit pores, 2D cylindrical and 3D spherical pores exhibit the same principle: cylindrical pores with r ≈ 2.0 Å and spherical pores with r ≈ 3.8 Å have maximum adsorption abilities [28,29]. Furthermore, although the free H 2 molecules at room temperature behavior classically, when localized in ultra micropores, H 2 molecules manifest quantum confinement behavior via the quantum sieving effect [30,31], which persists up to 300 K [26].

That was an awful lot of money; maybe a third of the agency's entire budget! Christian: So it looks like the politician reached his goal anyway. How did you get around that one?\n\nMartin: Through intense rounds of discussions with government representatives like Jack Manion and Harry Rogers, it was agreed that the money we had already saved by integrating our operations and rationalizing our publications would be included in the 100 million. At the end of the day, that left me looking for some 40 million only! Gordon: That's still a hefty sum of money. Martin: Through additional negotiations and reflection, we came up with a big package in which Statistics Canada absorbed maybe 10 million dollars on its own. Another chunk came through contributions from some departments that had vested interests in the census. And then the rest came as a credit for student hirings. You see, we estimated that over 40,000 people would have to be hired to run the census, but the money was not actually needed until 1986! Gordon: All this happened within a very short period of time too. It must have been quite a stress.",

Commun\n46201010.1039/c0cc00125b\nMatter waves, as introduced by de Broglie in 1923 [1], are a fundamental quantum phenomenon, describing the delocalized center of mass motion of massive bodies and we show here their sensitivity to the molecular structure of constitutional isomers. * http://www.quantumnano.at; markus.arndt@univie.ac.at\n\nIn quantum textbooks, matter wave phenomena are often associated with the equation λ dB = h/(mv), where the de Broglie wavelength λ dB is only determined by Plancks constant h and the particles momentum p = mv. It is a common conjecture that this relation still holds for bodies of arbitrary mass, size and complexity. But what is the role of the detailed internal molecular composition if λ dB does not include any such information?\n\nAs already shown before [2], the centre of mass motion can be well described by quantum delocalization and interference of each entire molecule with itself -even if the internal atoms may populate a thermal mixture of vibrational and rotational modes at a temperature of about T = 500 K. The conceptual separation of the internal and external degrees of freedom allows us to discuss two different cases:\n\nIf the interaction between the molecule and its environment makes it possible, even only in principle, to retrieve position information, the initially delocalized particle will be localized and quantum interference can no longer occur [3].",

On the other hand, the electron cannot leave the solid and enter the vacuum because it does not have enough energy to overcome the potential barrier. For obvious reasons, the electron cannot simply stop near the surface either [3]. From the quantum mechanical point of view, we can say that all possible final quantum states for that particular electron are forbidden. As all the final quantum states are forbidden, then the initial quantum state is also forbidden. As a result, the density of the quantum states inside the solid will be reduced. A 3D drawing of the solid is shown on Fig. 1b. If we regard the solid as potential energy box, there will be standing de Broglie waves inside the solid. Each standing wave corresponds to the quantum state which could be occupied by the free electron. The number of standing waves inside such a 3D structure is lower than in the case in which there were no indents and all the walls of the solid were plain.\n\nA theoretical analysis that starts with the Schrödinger equation and then calculates the density of the quantum states and diameter of the Fermi sphere in k space shows that the density of the quantum states is dramatically reduced when indents are introduced [4,5]. The calculation was made within the limit of the theory of free electron gas in the metal (later a similar method was used in [6]), and the result is shown on Fig. 2. The indents in the wall cause the density of quantum states to be reduced in whole energy region below the Fermi level (Fig.2b). Once the number of quantum states is reduced, given that there is no reduction in the number of free electrons, electrons are forced to occupy higher energy levels. As a result we have an increase of the Fermi level and a corresponding reduction of the work function. In practice there are two limiting factors in achieving the Avto effect. First, the surface roughness should be less than the de Broglie wavelength of the electron, in order to avoid the scattering of de Broglie waves on the surface and reducing the effect.",

Fig. 11 displays The importance of possible quantum effects is hard to estimate. As mentioned in Section II.C, classical gas-phase photodissociation calculations with purely repulsive excited states give good agreement with quantum dynamics. Regarding motion through the ice, the initially high kinetic energy of the H atom suggests that classical dynamics should be a reasonably good approximation. As the kinetic energy of H becomes smaller and its de Broglie wavelength larger, quantum effects will become more important. The statement above that the distances traveled by the H atoms are underestimated is actually only true as long as the motion of H is reasonably well described using classical dynamcs. At lower kinetic energies, tunneling through barriers to diffusion could become important. This would then lead to longer distance traveled by the H atoms than predicted by a classical model. On much longer time scales than considered in our calculations, H atoms could potentially diffuse longer distances as well, either through tunneling or thermal hopping.\n\n\nIV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nA potential energy surface (PES) has been developed for describing the interaction of a Desorption of H atoms is more probable from amorphous ice than for crystalline ice for all layers studied. The kinetic energy distribution of the desorbing H atoms is also hotter for amorphous ice than for crystalline ice. OH radicals formed from photodissociation can only desorb from the top two (three) monolayers in crystalline (amorphous) ice. The desorption probability of OH is much higher for crystalline ice than for amorphous ice.",

Thus, a fairly rapid intracellular acidification, analogous to that seen with the onset of CO2 exposure, is not to be expected with HCN. Furthermore, because [CN-]~ is so low (we calculate -2/~M), the permeability of the membrane to CN-would have to be exceedingly large to explain the long-term intracellular acidification on the basis of the shuttling hypothesis. It is more likely that the acidification seen is due to some metabolic inhibitory effect of HCN, and the resultant buildup of intracellular acids. Fig. 3 B and C show the effects of long-term exposure of an axon to DNP and azide, respectively. Each type of experiment was performed on three axons. Mitchell (1961) has interpreted the ability of DNP (pKa' ---4.0) to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation on the basis of its acting as a proton shuttler across mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, exposure to DNP may decrease pHi in at least three ways: (a) by penetrating the plasma membrane as DNP and dissociating to form H + and dinitrophenoxide ions (DNP-), (b) by shuttling H + across the plasma membrane via the influx of DNP and the efflux of DNP-, and (c) by causing a buildup of metabolic acids due to its effect on mitochondria. It is very difficult to distinguish among the three alternatives experimentally. It should be pointed out that the initial fall in pH~ started shortly after exposure to DNP, and 7.1 f >E that its initial rate of fall was more than five times greater than that produced by CN. We have no explanation for the changes in Vm.\n\n\nDNP and Azide Experiments",

This underlines that ultra-low temperature conditions are ideally suited to study strong hydrogen bonds, while for weaker hydrogen bonds the results need to be carefully transferred to ambient conditions. Let us next analyze the contribution of NQEs on the quantum de/localization of the individual atoms participating in the hydrogen bond, i.e. oxygens and hydrogens. As introduced above for the harmonic oscillator, this property features a strong dependence on the temperature. Indeed, recent studies at ultra-low temperature have revealed an unexpected localization of the nuclear wavefunction in finite hydrogen bonded complexes 72 , es-pecially for the light hydrogen atoms participating in intermolecular interactions. This effect is even further increased due to helium-solute interactions 73 . At the same time, the heavy donor and acceptor atoms of these hydrogen bonded clusters are less affected and can even be more quantum delocalized than the much lighter protons in the hydrogen bond. Recall that the thermal de Broglie wavelength λ th of a free particle scales with 1 / √ M . From this consideration it is usually expected that protons are much more quantum delocalized than the heavier oxygen nuclei at the same temperature, which highlights the unexpected character of the previously discovered 72,73 larger delocalization of the oxygen atoms in these hydrogen bonds at temperatures on the order of 1 K. This so-called \"interaction induced localization effect\" on protons trapped in hydrogen bonds is far from being understood and needs further investigation as a function of temperature.",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range.

However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

The methodology is a step-by-step approach in order to validate hypotheses and approximations that we made. The computations of the ground and the excited state structural and vibrational parameters are necessary for the understanding of theoretical and experimental spectra. Because the main effect on the luminescence data is commonly accepted to originate from the inner-sphere coordination, the first hydration sphere chloride ligands were substituted by bromides to discuss the trends, validate our method, and evaluate its applicability to other types of uranyl complexes. We will also quantify the effects of outer-sphere counter ions and long-range solvation on the computed spectra.\n\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nA.

The aqueous solution was prepared by dilution of this stock solution into a 5 m hydrochloric acid solution to get a uranium (VI) concentration of 10 −5 m.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

Experimental luminescence spectra\n\nThe time-resolved luminescence spectrum of the uranyl sample in the presence of chloride ions and Aliquate ® 336 in n-dodecane with 1% of 1-decanol is shown on Figure 5 (black line). It is superimposed with the spectrum (red line) acquired by Görller-Walrand et al. in similar conditions and in acetone [7]. The spectrum also compares well to those obtained earlier in chloroaluminate [17], tetraalkylammonium [9] and pyrrolidinium [8] ionic liquids. The spectrum of [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane in Figure 5 show an electronic transition maximum (\"hot band\") at low energy about 21 000 cm −1 followed by a series of vibronic peaks in the 20 300 cm −1 to 16 000 cm −1 range, which is typical of the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2species with a D 4h coordination symmetry [46]. A mono-exponential decay with a fluorescence lifetime of 0.3 µs was measured for the uranium(VI) sample in a presence of chloride ions, Aliquate ® 336 and n-dodecane. It confirms the formation of a unique complex, which was assumed to be [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] with four chloride ions coordinated to uranyl in its equatorial plane, consistently with the extracted complex stoichiometry [10].",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref. [16].",

The value for a is much greater than the radius of an individual C 60 molecule, while the value of r is much less than the expected separation for unclustered fullerenes given the spin density. Both these facts are evidence for the clustering of fullerenes in our sample. However, the observed spin-spin separation is larger than the separation expected if the cluster were formed of close packed fullerenes. Such a cluster would have a spin-spin separation of approximately 5 nm given the purity of the sample and the diameter of an individual fullerene. However, the values are consistent with a porous structure for the fullerene clusters, which would reduce the effective spin density in the cluster. The structure of fullerene clusters depends on the formation process. 19 Slow aggrega-tion leads to densely packed clusters, whereas mechanical agitation 19 and exposure to light 18 lead to the formation of fractal clusters. It is therefore possible that the concentration procedure, during which nitrogen was bubbled through the solution under ambient light conditions, promoted the formation of porous clusters. Furthermore, the 15 N@C 60 sample used in this work was stored under ambient conditions for approximately one year after the initial purification procedure. The fullerene molecules may have oxidised during this storage period, which further promotes the formation of large clusters by forming epoxide bonds",

We show the limits on D/H in each of these systems in Fig. 1. Two of the systems, towards Q1251+3644 and Q1759+7539 have larger uncertainties for different reasons. Q1251+3644 is a faint QSO (V=19), and over 10 hours of observing time yields a spectrum with modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 10) at high-resolution. The SNR drops quickly at lower wavelengths, and we cannot extract useful information from the highest order Lyman lines as a result. The system towards Q1759+7539 is a complex system of absorbers with a very high neutral hydrogen column density, log N(H I) > 10 19 (all column densities expressed in cm −2 ). The analysis of that system gives only an upper limit on D/H, at the 95% confidence level; the constraints are obtained from comparing the line profiles of Lyβ and Lyγ to the profile of Lyα . The method used to extract the limits on D/H will be described below. These results are preliminary, and improved constraints will require more data to allow a robust analysis. Tytler et al. (1996) made the first measurement of low D/H in the absorption system at z = 3.572 towards Q1937-1009. We analyzed the highresolution spectrum (8 hrs of exposure), which resolved the entire Lyman series up to Ly-19, as well as associated metal lines. By profile fitting the Lyman lines, with the position of the velocity components given by the metal lines, we find D/H = 2.3 ± 0.3 ± 0.3 × 10 −5 (statistical and systematic errors). The largest uncertainty in the measurement is the neutral hydrogen column density, log N(H I) = 17.94 ± 0.06 ± 0.05, and the uncertainty stems from the saturated Lyman profiles (discussed in detail below). We then obtained a high quality low-resolution spectra from Keck with LRIS (Oke et al. 1995), which gave better sensitivity shortward of the Lyman limit, to showing residual flux and model fit shortward of Lyman limit.

However, some important molecules exhibit a spectrum of narrow lines even at wavelengths as short as 100 nm. The carbon monoxide (CO) molecule has its first dissociation limit beyond 10 eV, and its spectrum in the range 80-120 nm is characterized by strongly perturbed rovibronic resonances, where virtually all lines undergo predissociation. These phenomena are of great importance for the investigation of the chemical dynamics of the interstellar medium, in particular of star-forming regions, where the photodissociation of CO is the governing dynamical process and CO is, at the same time, the coolant molecule [1]. The nitrogen molecule (N 2 ), iso-electronic to CO, has an onset of a dipole-allowed absorption spectrum at 100 nm, while its spectrum is similarly perturbed and prone to predissociation. The photoabsorption of N 2 is of great importance for the dynamics of the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere, and recently the importance of N 2 photo-predissociation for the interstellar medium is increasingly recognized [2]. The dipole-allowed absorption spectrum of molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) has its strongest lines in the Lyman and Werner bands in the wavelength range 90 − 115 nm. High-resolution spectroscopic studies and high-accuracy wavelength calibration studies of these sharp H 2 resonances has become of specific relevance for studies searching for a possible variation of the proton-electron mass ratio on a cosmological time scale [3,4].\n\nIn the domain of high-resolution studies of atoms in particular the ground state of the Helium atom has been the target of many detailed studies over decades. This two-electron system is amenable for accurate ab initio calculations including quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. The accurate determination of the ground state Lamb shift has been a driving force for the development of VUV-lasers and VUV-laser spectroscopic techniques since the first laser excitation of the first resonance line in the Helium atom [5].",

Due to vibronic excitation of the hydrogen molecule, the measured ranges do not completely cover the emission bands.

The first order approximation is that the change of vibrational levels in electronic excitations follows Franck-Condon factors [16].

These bands, which he calls the Lyman bands, were first observed by Lyman, who already in his book ( cit.) mentions some of the bands. In discharges in argon containing a trace of hydrogen the ordinary hydrogen many-lined spectrum is weakened very much and the Lyman bands dominate the spectrum between 1050 A and 1700 A. According to Witmer, these bands are due to changes in the total (electronic) quantum number nt from 2 to 1 together with changes in the vibrational quantum number n from 0 to 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . 11 respectively. Witmer has not published the details of his measurements of the bands, and a comparison between the Lyman bands and the present bands can only be made by means of the reproduction of the bands in his paper. It is, however, clearly seen that the Lyman bands Nos. 0, 1, 2, 3 are not observed among the stronger lines on my plates ( figs. 1 and 2), and it is doubtful whether they are present at all. It is difficult to recon cile this absence with the observation of Lyman ( . tit., p. 79) that some of the other bands (Nos. 7,8,9,10) are readily seen among the lines of the many-lined spectrum in pure hydrogen. On the other hand, several of the stronger lines of figs. 1 and 2 are present on the reproduction in Witmer's paper. We may therefore conclude that the Lyman bands are due to a manner of excitation of the molecule, the probability of which is very small in discharges in pure hydrogen, but when hydrogen is present as a trace in argon, this probability is greatly enhanced. Compare Witmer (loc. tit.) and also J. Franck and P. Jordan.* If the bands are described as Q-branches, the value of the constant c in Table III indicates that there is a large difference of the moment of inertia in the initial states and in the end states.

Ratios of rate coefficients (plasma process vs. Lyman-band or molecular continuum emission) and volumetric reaction rates in the line of sight volume. The ratios of rate coefficients for molecular processes are from Ref. [10] and their variation to the ranges of unknown plasma parameters (T e =3-15 eV and T vib =100-10000 K). Volumetric emissions rates of transitions are from Table 2  the plasma and because a significant fraction of atomic emission can originate from dissociative excitation of hydrogen molecules. Furthermore, the dominant electron impact processes with same order of magnitude cross sections are excitations to 2P state, resulting directly to Lyman-alpha emission, and excitations to metastable 2S state with a lifetime on the order of 100 ms. The dynamics of the 2S excited atoms is complex. The 2S state can decay via Lyman-alpha emission with collisional quenching by neutral particles [23] or via interaction with the wall of the plasma chamber. On the other hand, 2S excited atoms can be readily re-excited or ionized because the threshold energies of those processes are low and corresponding cross sections are large. A rough estimate for the production rate and density of 2S excited metastable atoms can be presented similar to the molecular metastable density presented in Ref. [10]. This requires assuming that (1) the lowest excited states (2P and 2S) are mainly populated directly via electron impact excitation from the ground state, (2) the electron impact excitation rate from ground state to 2S is 0.2-0.6 times the electron impact excitation rate to 2P state (calculated with cross section data from Ref. [24] and T e =3-15 eV), (3) molecular emission in the range of 115-145 nm is 1.65-1.94 times the measured (molecular) emission in the range 145-165 nm and (4) the plasma is homogeneous and uniformly distributed into the chamber, i.e. the measured average volumetric emission is not disturbed by the opacity.

In these systems, most of the lines of the Lyman series have saturated (optical depth, τ > 3) line centers. We obtain spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the region shortward of the Lyman limit to independently constrain N(H I). It is possible to obtain a direct measurement of the total H I column in systems with 17 < log N(H I) < 18, 0.6 < τ LL < 6.0, where τ LL is the optical depth of Lyman continuum absorption at 912Å (rest frame). The residual flux shortward of the Lyman limit provides a direct estimate of N(H I), independent of other characteristics of the system (e.g. velocity dispersion or deuterium column density). To obtain an accurate measurement, we must account for unrelated Lyman absorption from other systems and the uncertainty of the intrinsic QSO continuum near the Lyman limit (see sec. 4.1). The majority of the Lyman absorption features can be specified by their related absorption features in high-resolution spectra (at higher wavelengths). The remaining features are statistically included from well determined Lyα forest distributions (Kirkman & Tytler 1997). The QSO continuum near the Lyman limit can be determined to better than 10% by utilizing high-resolution spectra (c.f. Burles & Tytler 1997a).

As seen in Table 2, the observed Hα/Hβ ratio varies among data taken during different runs and at different telescopes. Since the ratios of all the remaining hydrogen lines look normal, within the error bars, we are inclined to think that this Hα problem has no influence on the derived chemical composition. Nevertheless, we feel it important to try to understand the reason for the observed values of Hα/Hβ.\n\nIn the present study, we have done the computations with the full treatment of hydrogen as offered by CLOUDY (this, and not case B, is actually the default option in CLOUDY). Under the physical conditions in this nebula, one indeed does not expect the Balmer lines to be emitted under case B, not even with the added effect of collisional excitation. The ionization parameter of the emitting regions is high and the nebula is optically thin, making it a good candidate for case C as described by Baker & Menzel (1938) and reconsidered by Ferland (1999). In such a case, absorption of Lyman photons from the star contributes to the emission of the Balmer lines, and the Balmer decrement depends on the number of respective Lyman line photons in the star. However, we are far from reproducing the Hα/Hβ ratios observed in the various slits. Of course, the computed Balmer decrement strongly depends on the fluxes at the wavelengths of the H Lyman lines in the model atmosphere used. But the differences in the Hα/Hβ ratios in the different observing runs make it doubtful that simple stellar fluorescence can explain the observations.\n\nThe reference model predicts a ratio of about 2.81. The differences in the observed Hα/Hβ ratios cannot have a nebular origin since the associated time scales are far too long.",

The rest of the time, the electronically excited H2 molecule decays back to a bound ro-vibrational level in the electronic ground state. A small fraction of these decays put the molecule back in the v = 0 vibrational ground state, but in most cases, the H2 molecule is left with a considerable residual internal energy in the form of vibrational excitation. In low density gas, this energy is simply radiated away as the H2 molecule undergoes a series of radiative transitions that eventually place it back in the vibrational ground state.

Furthermore, the performance of the studied plasma source, especially as a function of the coil current outside the optimum magnetic field, was observed to be somewhat sensitive to different assemblies of the waveguide system and level of impurities in the plasma chamber. Therefore, the accuracy of the results is not only determined by the accuracy of the measurement technique but also by the level of reproducibility. Hence, the following discussion and conclusions are limited to the absolute values of VUV-emission at the order of magnitude level, which is the novelty of the presented research, and conclusions which can be tested and reproduced in other plasma sources, e.g. by repeating the described measurements or studying the effects of mechanical changes as discussed below.\n\nThe significance of different molecular plasma processes can be estimated by comparing the number of photons emitted the corresponding transitions [10]. The comparison of Lyman-band and molecular continuum photons yields information on the dissociation and ionization of hydrogen molecules. In the microwave discharge discussed here the ratio of Lyman-band emission to molecular continuum emission is 2, while in a filament drive arc discharge studied in Ref. [11] the given ratio is 4. This implies that in the microwave discharge the fraction of inelastic collisions leading to dissociation of hydrogen molecules in comparison to molecular ionization is higher. The observed difference between the plasma sources can be explained by different electron energy distribution functions (EEDF), and consequent reaction rates reflecting the different functional shapes of electron impact cross sections [10,24]. The EEDF of the microwave discharge has a higher fraction of electrons in the energy range of 7-15 eV in comparison to energy range of E e > 15 eV. This also means that the EEDF of the microwave discharge is less efficient for ionization, i.e. electron impact excitations dominate the energy dissipation in comparison to ionization.",

We evaluate this using the photodissociation rate in the optically thin limit, D = 5.18 × 10 −11 s −1 (Röllig et al. 2007), which was derived for the Draine (1978) interstellar radiation field (ISRF).

The photodissociation threshold is 1600 Å (Huebner et al. 1992), although in the practice the cross section becomes vanishingly small at wavelengths longer than ∼1100 Å.

HCN\n\nHydrogen is ionized by photons with wavelengths shorter than the Lyman cutoff and thus photoionization of HCN is not con-sidered here. We have adopted the photoabsorption cross section measured by Nuth & Glicker (1982) up to λ = 1469.2 Å. We assume that at longer wavelengths the contribution to photodissociation is small and that the main photodissociation channel leads to the CN radical.\n\n\nA.20.

More recently, Aguado et al. (2017) have extended those calculations including higher electronic states to cover the 7-13.6 eV energy range. We adopted the cross section calculated by Aguado et al. (2017) and assumed that absorption in the studied wavelength range leads mainly to dissociation rather than fluorescence.

The data were obtained during a whole series of measurements on low-Z ions interacting with Li [19,20], but never released. Experimental details and procedures can be found in Refs. [19,20]. The systematic absolute uncertainty in the data is some 20% mainly due to the normalization to proton data. Statistical uncertainties increase from 10% to 20% when going from the highest (5 keV/amu) to the lowest (1.5 keV/amu) energy used. We also add the CTMC line emission cross sections for the bare Li projectile as well, to visually display the differences arising from the filled K shell of the projectile. While for Li 3+ projectiles cascade contributions from higher n shells have been accounted for by using the hydrogenic transition rates [21], for B 3+ projectiles we have used the transition rates tabulated by Fuhr and Wiese [22]. There is very good agreement between the experimental data and the CTMC predictions except at the highest energies.  A more detailed inspection of the line emission cross sections can be made via the exploration of the Lyman lines (np → 1s transitions). A useful way to highlight whether capture takes place to low or large l values is by means of the hardness ratio (R) which provides the ratio of the intensity arising from the higher Lyman lines (np → 1s transitions with n ≥ 3) to the Lyman-α line (2p → 1s).",

The presence of such atoms results in extended \"wings\" in the line profiles. The Balmer lines spectra emitted by different types of DC glow and RF discharge plasmas have typical multimode behaviour, i.e., they exhibit widely broadened \"wings\" and a sharp top [3,4]. Different processes and mechanisms can be at the origin of such phenomena. Usually two or three components of the line profiles may be clearly distinguished [4]. The central, narrow component originates from low-energy dissociative excitation and direct electron impact excitation processes. Collisions of highly energetic electrons with vibrationally excited H 2 molecules result in dissociative excitation, whose products may have high kinetic energies depending on the molecular state [1]. Dissociative broadening contributes to the overall processes, but it does not explain far-lying \"wings\" found in some DC and RF discharges, corresponding to fast atoms with kinetic energies of hundreds of electron volts. Since high DC electric fields are present in near-electrode sheaths, excessive broadening may result from acceleration of charges such as H + , H 3 + ions, with subsequent conversion into fast neutrals. Two sources of these fast atoms have been suggested, viz., charge exchange collisions between fast ions and the background H 2 gas molecules producing energetic atoms that move towards the electrode and the formation of energetic H atoms at the electrode surface due to fast ion bombardment [4−7]. Microwave and HF discharges are, however, free of such strong DC electric fields and the radiated profiles usually exhibit single mode behaviour [8,9]. Nevertheless, generation of fast H atoms, with energies in the range 2−4 eV, in microwave plasma has also been reported in [10]. In a series of works, selective hydrogen line broadening has been detected in microwave discharges and its afterglows when there is no significant broadening of noble gas lines or hydrogen molecular lines [8,11,12].",

Negative polarization degrees are obtained for 2p-1s and 3d-2p lines from the excited H atoms receding along surface normal at velocities smaller than the Bohr velocity.Protons hitting metallic target materials are quickly neutralized by electron capture above the target surface. Some of the neutral particles are back-scattered (reflected) from the surface after collisions with target atoms in the surface layers. Photon emissions of the reflected H atoms directly in excited states have been observed for a variety of target materials [1, 2]. Winter and Hagedorn studied polarization of the Lyman-α line from H atoms specularly reflected at grazing angles on a Ni(111)surface[3].In the present work [4], it is assumed that the excited states are formed via single electron capture by a proton from conduction bands of target metals. The electron transfer is calculated by using semiclassical methods. Once incident H atoms dive into the metal surface, the excited states are depopulated quickly via Auger cascades and resonance ionization. Thus, only the receding part of classical trajectories of H nucleus is taken into account in the present calculations.Fig. 1shows fractional populations of excited levels as a function of nuclear distances from W surfaces for H atoms receding along the surface normal at 0.44×10 6 m/s. At large distances, populations of magnetic sub-levels are aligned (the quantization axis is along the surface normal).

(2005) in fully dynamical models with respect to hydrostatic ones, which they attribute to expansion cooling, is actually the result of some other process? The only idea that comes to mind is departure from ionization equilibrium. For an average temperature of 30 kK, and an average density of about 200 cm −3 , the recombination time for hydrogen is of about 10 3 yr. From the apparent size, expansion velocity and distance to TS01, one can estimate an expansion time of ∼ 7×10 3 yr. Therefore, the nebula should not be far from ionization equilibrium. On the other hand, the dynamical model shown in Schönberner et al. (2005) was for a 0.595M ⊙ star with an effective temperature of 100 kK, corresponding to an evolution time of ∼ 5 × 10 3 yr. The average density of the nebula in their simulation is then about 100 cm −3 . In such a situation, the nebula is farther from ionization equilibrium. Since their star is in a phase where the number of ionizing photons increases with time, the ionization level of the dynamical model should be smaller than that of the corresponding static model. Hence, Lyman alpha cooling should be more important, and the electron temperature lower than in the hydrostatic model, which is indeed what their dynamical model gives. In TS 01 the dynamical effects on the ionization and temperature of the nebula should be much smaller than in the case computed by Schönberner et al., if noticeable at all. In their model, the temperature drop due to dynamical effects is of about 10 kK. Given the argumentation above, we consider that any dynamical effect on the electron temperature in TS 01 would be of 2-3 kK at most, with respect to the temperature we compute in our model. As an experiment, we computed a model where we use the CLOUDY parameter cextra with a value of 10 −20.3 erg cm 3 s −1 to simulate an extra cooling factor that reduces the average electron temperature by about 3 kK with respect to the reference model. We then adjust the abundances so as to reproduce the observed line ratios. We find that the abundances in this model are not very",

Direct excitation to the continua of higher electronic states is allowed, but requires absorption of a photon with energy larger than 14.7 eV, which is more likely to photoionise H (threshold 13.6 eV) or H 2 (threshold at 15.5 eV). Thus, direct photodissociation is very inefficient (Coppola et al., 2011). Photodissociation of H 2 mainly occurs by a two-step process (also called Solomon process): absorption of the Lyman (X 1 Σ + g → B 1 Σ + u , threshold at 11.2 eV) or Werner (X 1 Σ + g → C 1 Π u , threshold at 12.3 eV) band UV photons, followed by radiative decay into the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state (Stecher and Williams, 1967;Glover, 2007). On average, ∼ 15% of all radiative decays following absorption in the Lyman-Werner bands results in dissociation. Since the Lyman-Werner bands arising from the lowest rotational levels in the ground state comprise several hundred absorption lines between 912Å and 1100Å, the photodissociation rate of H 2 depends mainly on the intensity of the UV radiation in this wavelength range, quantified in terms of the J 21 .",

Next, we explain why the correspondence between Nmax and a peak of the distribution of n quantum numbers is more pronounced for electron attachment to He + * versus H * . For hydrogenic atoms, the difference between two energy levels corresponding to subsequent n quantum numbers is larger for the higher charged nucleus. In our case this energy difference is four times larger for the He atom. Moreover, we find that the energy of the electron that finally remains bound in a Rydberg state is similar both for attachment to He + * and to H * . Given the above, each small interval of this final energy of the electron that remains finally bound encompasses more n quantum numbers for attachment to H * than for attachment to He * . Therefore, the intertwined dynamics of the finally bound electron with the nuclei, which is directly related to the final energy this electron has, is imprinted with a higher \"resolution\", i.e., smaller spread over n quantum numbers for attachment to the higher charged ion. This is consistent with the higher number of peaks in the distribution of the n quantum number for pathway A and B of FDI for final attachment to He + * for HeH + , see Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), compared to the distribution of the n quantum number for pathway A and B of FDI for final attachment to H * , see Fig. 7(a)",

Mesoturbulent profiles will significantly differ from Voigt profiles only when the turbulent component is comparable or larger than the thermal component. Both components contribute to the total velocity dispersion (b total ) which is measured in high resolution spectra: b 2 total = b 2 meas = b 2 turb + b 2 therm . Comparisons of the metal line widths (e.g. C, Si) to the hydrogen and deuterium line widths place strict limits on the turbulent component. The heavy metal lines (Si and above) are dominated by turbulence at temperatures T < 10 5 K and their velocity dispersion usually gives a good measure of the turbulence in the system. In the two systems we have measured D/H, towards Q1937-1009 and Q1009+2956, the metal lines are very narrow, which give very low velocity dispersions, b(Si) < 6 km s −1 . The hydrogen lines are much wider, with typical widths b(H) ≈ 20 km s −1 , which shows that thermal, uncorrelated, line formation is dominant in the optically thick Lyman lines.\n\n(2) The line profiles of mesoturbulence can be distinguished from Voigt profiles by fitting the entire Lyman series (Levshakov & Kegel 1996). The requirement for invoking mesoturbulence should be determined by the observational data. If the Lyman series lines show evidence for mesoturbulent profiles, then one should take it into account. In D/H systems to date, simple Voigt profiles can explain all of the profiles in the Lyman series and do not require the mesoturbulent model.\n\n(3) Mesoturbulence is likely to play an important role in a wide variety of absorption line studies. The hydrogen lines in QSO spectra which do show deuterium belong to a class of absorbers with the narrowest intrinsic widths, and are therefore subject to the least amount of turbulent broadening. On the other hand, optically thick absorption lines of heavy metals (for instance, in damped-Lyα systems) are prime candidates for studies of mesoturbulence.\n\n\nLine blending",

Since there is no time lag during the transition, so fluorescence fades away as soon as the illumination is turned off. Phosphorescence, on the other hand, is observed when an electron undergoes a transition from triplet excited state to the singlet ground state. During this transition, the spin state of the molecule changes twice; once during singlet excited state to triplet excited state transition and the other during triplet excited state to singlet ground state transition, and both of these transitions are spinforbidden. However, due to spin-orbit coupling and vibronic coupling among the energy states, these transitions become allowed. Due to the change in spin orientation during transition, the electrons take a much longer time to come back to the singlet ground state, giving rise to a time gap between absorption and emission. Hence, phosphorescence fades after a long time, once the illumination is stopped. Therefore, the lifetime of phosphorescence is much longer than that of fluorescence, and is generally in the range of 10 À 3 -10 0 s. These radiative processes are governed by Kasha's rule, which states that electrons can get excited to any of the excited electronic states (like S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , etc.) depending on the wavelengths of absorbed radiation; however, most of the photons will emit from the lowest excited electronic state (i. e. S 1 or T 1 ). This happens due to rapid internal conversions from higher excited states to lower excited vibrational states. In other words, the emission wavelength is independent of absorption wavelength. The fluorescence intensity originating from a particular electronic level depends on the population of that level. According to the Boltzmann distribution law ð1 1 =1 2 ¼ e À D E = kT Þ when the temperature is increased, the thermal population of higher energy levels increases. The degree of the population of the higher levels also depends on the energy difference between two involving energy levels. The lower energy gap facilitates a higher population in exciting level. Hence, fluorescence intensity originating from those levels is higher compared to lower levels. [211] The efficient phosphors are the ones that have a high",

The experiments with the CO matrix (Exps. 6 and 7) are less reliable in tracing m/z 31, because not desorption peaks, but rather desorption plateaus are seen for this mass. The same effect is observed for m/z 30. Finally, results of the 13 CH 4 experiment (Exp. 3) are included at the non-isotope masses presented in this figure. From Fig. 9 it becomes clear that CH 3 NH 2 , CH 3 NCO and CH 3 C(O)NH 2 are present in all experiments, masses m/z 73, 74 and 88 in most and intensity ratios are relatively similar. The presence of Lyman-α (Exps. 5-7) is not a prerequisite for the formation of these species. The CO matrix (Exps. 6 and 7) does hinder the formation of the products associated with m/z 74 and 88, however. Since CH 4 mainly absorbs far-UV radiation around the Lyman-α transition (Cruz-Diaz et al. 2014), it either implies that the small amount of available high-energy radiation is enough to make a sufficient amount of CH 3 radicals, or this radical is formed efficiently by H-abstraction reactions with other atoms and molecules, such as N and NH (see also discussion in Bossa et al. 2015). The experiments conducted in a CO matrix hint that not hydrogenation, but radical recombination reactions are responsible for forming the products. The H-atoms produced in the photodestruction of the precursor species are thermalised by the interaction with the CO matrix and thus have no, or limited, excess energy. Since hydrogenation with non-energetic H-atoms has been shown not to be able to hydrogenate HNCO into NH 2 CHO (Noble et al. 2015) at low (10-17 K) temperatures, hydrogenation of HNCO",

Although the intensity of the light scattering increased temporarily, it slightly decreased after about 10 h. Because of the possible fluctuation of the concentration and length of fibrils, it was difficult to reproduce exactly the intensities of light scattering and ThT fluorescence. However, the difference among the different experimental conditions as shown in Fig. 4 was reproducible, indicating that we can address the effects of laser irradiation on the basis of the relative intensities of light scattering and ThT fluorescence. The transient increase of the light scattering is likely attributable to the aggregation of K3 fibrils induced by the stirring because notable increase was observed for the samples without ThT or laser irradiation. After a long period of irradiation, the light scattering intensity was stable as the decrease in ThT intensity ceased. Although the concentration of ThT we used (10 M) is close to its CMC (29), the similar light scattering for the sample with ThT and without laser and that without ThT and with laser (Fig. 4, A and B) suggests that the possible self-aggregation of ThT does not affect the results.\n\nIt was thought that the saturation of photobleaching of ThT also stopped the decrease in light scattering intensity. However, the results raise the possibility that the agitation during laser irradiation broke the K3 fibrils. Thus, the same experiment was carried without laser irradiation. The intensity of neither the ThT fluorescence nor light scattering decreased notably, confirming that the effects depend on the irradiation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, when laser excitation at different wavelength (632.8 nm by a helium-neon laser) was used, the results were similar to those without laser irradiation at 442 nm by a heliumcadmium laser (Fig. 4B). Then, to examine the participation of ThT, the experiment was carried in the absence of ThT. The light scattering intensity did not decrease (Fig. 4A), indicating that ThT is directly involved in the decrease. In other words, ThT plays a critical role in the laser irradiation-dependent damage of K3 fibrils.",

A pseudo colour-coded image of the fluorescence signal in counts per pixel was produced and the fluorescence intensity in each tissue layer was quantified digitally by averaging over specified areas. All fluorescence measurements were corrected for background autofluorescence and structures were identified by correlation with the adjacent H & E stained section. Two measurements were made and averaged per section. Intensity calibrations were performed using a 0.1 mm thick ruby disc which emits near 690 nm under 633 nm excitation. A previous study using the same system [38] on normal rat colon using intravenous ALA has demonstrated that the CCD fluorometric measurements of porphyrin fluorescence correlated well with chemical extraction measurements. Statistical analysis between the means of the ALA only and ALA plus CP94 groups, at the time of maximum fluorescence, was conducted using an unpaired student t-test and error bars were determined by the standard error of the mean.\n\nFluorescence emission spectra were also recorded from separate representative frozen specimens to confirm that the fluorescence observed in the imaging was indeed produced by PpIX and no other fluorescent porphyrin.

The sensor (silica or HA) was clamped in a temperature controlled enclosure allowing the temperature to be maintained at 36.8°C for all experiments. Polarised light from a helium neon laser (wavelength, 632.8 nm) passed through the sensor via two optical paths. One light path close to the chip surface in contact with the sample through its fringe field, and the other independent of the surface was used as a reference signal. This light was oscillated between two polarisations: transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) at a frequency of 50 Hz (Cross et al. 2008). Essentially, TE and TM respond differently to protein adsorption/displacement and therefore provide two independent measurements of the adsorbing material, permitting determination of the mass, thickness and density of the adsorbing film. By solving Maxwell's equations simultaneously for the phase change of the TE and TM, values for the mean RI (n f ) and thickness (d f ) of the adsorbed film can be obtained (assuming a single homogeneous isotropic layer) using a model analogous to the 'threephase model' used in ellipsometry (Arwin 2000). Because the RI is a linear function of the concentration over a wide range of concentrations, the absolute amount of the adsorbed molecules (Γ) (referred to as pellicle 'polymer' mass) can be obtained via the de Feijter formula (Feijter et al. 1978); where n buffer is the RI of the water and dn/dc the RI increment of the adsorbed pellicle:\nC ¼ d f n f À n buffer dn=dc(3)\nThese calculations were carried out using the Analight Explorer software (version 1.5.4.18811, Farfield Scientific, Manchester, UK) (For more detail on DPI see Cross et al.

The light used (usually generated by a laser) in such an approach must, obviously, not have any adverse effects (e.g., due to phototoxicity or heating) on host tissue. The helium/neon laser is a device emitting light with a wavelength of 632 nm, and, at the light energy doses and densities needed to activate photosensitizers such as tin chlorin e6, it does not result in damage to human tissue. Indeed, irradiation of wounds with light from a helium/neon laser (without the application of a photosensitizer) has met with some success as a means of stimulating wound healing in humans (29,30). One possible problem with the use of lightactivated antimicrobial agents is that the singlet oxygen produced during the process has the potential to also damage neighboring host cells. There is, therefore, great interest in developing methods of targeting the photosensitizer to the infecting organism. As well as achieving selectivity, another advantage of using a targeted photosensitizer is that the antimicrobial effectiveness of lethal photosensitization is also increased. This is because, following binding of the targeted photosensitizer to the organism, subsequent irradiation results in the generation of singlet oxygen only in the vicinity of the pathogen and not at extraneous sites. Consequently, less photosensitizer needs to be applied, and because there is less attenuation of the incident light by unbound photosensitizer, a lower light dose can be used. Those targeting systems which have shown promise in laboratory and in vivo studies include the use of antibodies (4,7,8) and chemical modification of the photosensitizer itself (12,32). In the present study we investigated the possibility of another targeting strategy, one based on the use of bacteriophages.",

The REDLS setup is described in detail elsewhere [10]. A surface plasmon is excited in a standard Kretschmann-Raether configuration [15]- [17] and is used as the illumination beam in a DLS experiment (figure 3). The monochromatic light from a helium-neon laser (λ = 632.8 nm) passes through a polarizer (p-polarization) before being reflected at the metal-coated base of a prism attached to a quartz cell. The reflected light is detected with a photodiode. To find the incidence angle for SP excitation ψ P , angular reflectivity scans are performed. Probes like particles in solution interact with the electromagnetic field of the surface plasmon and scatter light. The scattered light is recorded on the opposite side of the cell by a DLS detector system, consisting of the following: a single-mode fibre with a fibre coupler, a Static and Dynamic Enhancer (ALV GmbH, Langen, Germany), a fibre-beam splitter, two avalanche photodiodes and an ALV7004/fast multiple tau digital correlator. The Static and Dynamic Enhancer is necessary for minimizing the contribution from thermal fluctuations of the single-mode fibre. A detailed treatment of this problem is given in section 5.

The liposome suspensions were pumped through a 0.2 mm ID square, hollow glass capillary of 0.1 mm wall thickness (#8320 Vitro Tubes, VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, NJ) at controlled rates. The pump beam diameter was set to 300 µm and was tilted at 15° so the pump beam would miss the lens used to collect the light from the probe beam, which was aligned normal to the capillary. The pump beam fluence was measured by registering the image of the pump beam on the capillary and measuring the beam diameter at the sample plane with a photodetector/imaging device (Luka, Andor Technology, Northern Ireland). The pulse energy was measured using a pulse energy meter (Ophir Optronics, Ltd., Israel).\n\nThe continuous low power probe beam is scattered by the refractive index difference caused by the generation of nanobubbles around the HGN, and the light intensity measured by the photodetector is collected by an oscilloscope (Teledyne LeCroy, Wavesurfer MXs-8). A decrease in the transmitted light intensity is the characteristic signal of nanobubble generation and growth, followed by a rapid rise (100 nsec) in the transmitted intensity as the nanobubbles collapse.\n\nNanobubbles are transient events, lasting a few hundred nanoseconds. The decrease in transmitted light intensity is due to the collective light scattering from a large number of nanobubbles being generated within the irradiated volume, rather than the scattering signal from single bubbles.",

If one assumes that the same θ current occurs in the φ intersection, the charge is the same in either kind of intersection with the plane. The change in the orientation of the intersection from θ to φ like, accompanied with the 50:50 stochastic process is reveling in regard with the uncertainty principle. The θ orientation is what produces the sinusoidal electric field pattern printed in the plane and it is the way to know the momentum of the particle with precision. However, to do so the particle is in two places of the plane at the same time, therefore, the measurement of its exact position is even nonsensical. It is pure non-local to produce the wave that leaves in the plane. The stochastic change to the φ intersection stops the particle being non-local, to occupy just one place in flatland, thus its position can be measured very precisely but in doing so, it stops also to produce the sinusoidal pattern, ergo its momentum is completely unknown and there is no way to avoid this, because it is a particle-space intrinsic property. Fig. 12 and 13 show, clearly, that simple symmetry will explain zero and 100 • / • correlation experiments, respectively. On Fig.14, however, it is clear that knowing the position, i.e. φ like intersection with the plane of the up-going accelerated, retained or even stopped electron makes a lost in its identification in 2D space, as well as the information about its momentum, as discussed before. Therefore, the act of measuring the position of the up-going particle, affects the original entanglement and the precision in the measurement of the system total momentum; making it impossible to deduce, with precision, the momentum of the up-going particle by subtracting the momentum of the down-going particle from the system total momentum. Ergo, the EPR paradox is solved without the \"spooky action at a distance\" [26], i.e., uncertainty prevails no matter the arrangement of the experiment, because it accompanies the particle wherever it goes.",

To do so, we consider symmetric intervals of varying confidence around the mean and compare them to the empirical probabilities of belonging to each interval. In a well-calibrated model, the x% of the predictions should fall in the x% confidence interval.

In other words, all static and dynamic arguments of the resultant IT descriptors are all sharply specified by the corresponding expectation values of the associated observables. However, the localization experiment alone cannot remove all the uncertainty contained in a general electronic state, which exhibits a nonvanishing local phase component φ(r, t) and hence gives rise to a finite current density j(r, t). This probability flux vanishes only in the stationary state of Equation (6) Since the current operator j(r) includes the momentum operator of an electron, P(r) = −iħ∇,\nj(r) = (2m) −1 [Pp(r) + p(r)P], p(r) = |rr|, {r |r' = r'|r'},(27)\nwhich does not commute with the position operator r(r) = r,\nPr − rP ≡ [P, r] = −iħ,(28)\nthe incompatible observables r and j(r) do not have common eigenstates.

Therefore, the position dispersion σr cannot be simultaneously eliminated with the current dispersion σj in a single type of experiment, e.g., The information given us by carrying out the given experiment consists of removing the uncertainty existing before the experiment [32]. If we carry out the particle-localization probe we obtain some information, since its outcome means that we then know exactly, which position has actually been detected. This implies that, after repeated trials performed for the specified quantum state, the initial uncertainty contained in the position probability scheme has been completely eliminated. The average information gained by such tests thus amounts to the removed position uncertainty. The larger the uncertainty in p(r), the larger the amount of information obtained when we eventually find out which electron position has actually been detected after the experiment. In other words, the amount of information given us by the realization of the classical, probability scheme alone equals the global entropy in the classical probability scheme of Figure 1 [31,32].",

From the uncertainty principle, if the electron wave function were to be squeezed into a small area described by Eq. 3, the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron would increase. In other words, as the electron goes through the contact, it could change momentum due to the uncertainty principle. As a result, Vk ;α;p is nonzero in general fork ≠p. Furthermore, if the contact size were to increase (larger uncertainty in position), the uncertainty in momentum would decrease. Therefore, Vk ;α;p fork ≠p becomes smaller and smaller as the contact size increases. We consider two extreme cases. First, if V ðrÞ = δðr −r 0 Þ, which corresponds to the case for STM, Vk ;α;p = 1. This case means that an electron with momentumk has an equal probability of changing momentum top after going through the delta-function point contact. On the other hand, for the planar tunnel junction (large contact regime), we assume that the matrix elements of electrons tunneling throughout the entire interface are the same; that is, V ðrÞ = V for r z = 0. In this case, because the uncertainty in the position of the interface is infinite, the uncertainty in the in-plane momentum is zero. Therefore, we have Vk ;α;p ≠ 0 only if the inplane momentum is conserved ðk k =p k Þ. This limit gives us the wellknown tunneling model.",

N is then coupled with the electron spin angular momentum, S, giving the total angular momentum, J. In Hund's case (b), J = (N ± 1/2) for the F1 and F2 manifolds, respectively. J is coupled with the nuclear spin of H (I = 1/2) to give the grand total angular momentum, F. The calculations of the state-to-state rotationally inelastic rates have been carried out for the collisions of the CH neutral molecule with He atoms 9 for a variety of changes of the lower quantum numbers and over a range of temperatures up to 300 K. It turned out that all such rates were practically negligible at the lowest temperatures and reached their largest values of ≈10 −13 cm 3 s −1 only above about 200 K. Such values are therefore more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those we have obtained for the present anion, the CH − partner, in the same temperature range relevant for the ISM conditions. This finding thus confirms the essentially marginal significance of the collision-driven rotational state changes induced in CH by the He present in these environments. The comparison also clearly confirms the much larger rate coefficients which occur in collisions involving charged molecular partners as opposed to the neutral ones.

And yet the use of standard statistical methods to quantify this uncertainty is often absent from published reports. This article covers the basics of confidence interval estimation for molecular modeling using classical statistics. Alternate approaches such as non-parametric statistics and bootstrapping are discussed.\n\nWhen we report a number what do we mean by it? Clearly our intention is to convey information: after an experiment we think a property has a certain value; after this calculation our prediction of quantity X is Y. In reality, we know whatever number we report is only an estimate. For instance, we repeat an experiment to measure a partition coefficient between water and octanol five times and get an average, or we apply a computer model to a set of ten test systems and calculate a mean performance. In the former case, will a sixth measurement produce a similar number? In the latter case, do we know if the program will perform as well over a new test set? In other words, how do we know if these numbers are useful?",

This is different from what usual wisdom would suggest for a two-dimensional system (1/r decay) [60,80], and has also been described in Refs. [81,82].\n\nAs briefly outlined above in section Graphene FT-STS fundamentals, the underlying physics of this result stems from the chirality of the graphene quasiparticles [83,84]. The graphene quasiparticles, due to the presence of two atomic sublattices, have an additional degree of freedom deemed pseudospin, such that one says that a quasiparticle belonging to sublattice A has pseudospin \"up\", and a quasiparticle belonging to the sublattice B has pseudospin \"down\". By chirality, the pseudospin vector is parallel to the quasiparticle momentum, so that if we know the momentum of a quasiparticle, we automatically know its pseudospin, thus to which sublattice it belongs and in which proportion. Due to the chiral properties of the quasiparticles, backscattering of quasiparticles by extended impurities is forbidden [85,86], because when a quasiparticle is backscattered flipping its momentum by 180 o , by chirality, its pseudospin also flips. Since an extended impurity cannot flip the pseudospin of an electron (the wavelengths associated with backscattering are much larger than the atomic lattice constant), the backscattering cannot take place. Nevertheless, if the impurity is localized, the backscattering is not forbidden [87]. However, the incident and backscattered particle have opposite pseudopspins, and thus their wavefunctions cannot interfere constructively, same as the wavefunctions of two electrons with spin up and spin down cannot give rise to constructive interferences. This lack of interference yields a reduction of the Friedel oscillations in the vicinity of the impurity, which no longer decay as 1/r as in a regular two-dimensional electron gas, but much faster, as 1/r 2 .",

For applications, one needs a multidimensional generalization of this formula. Then, the decoherence time may depend on P I,η , F I,η , ṘI ,η , and R I,η , which are the ηth components of momentum, force, velocity, and position (where η is the index of the nuclear degrees of freedom of the primary subsystem) of the nuclear wave packet on the Ith potential energy surface (associated with the Ith electronic state). In practice, since semiclassical nonadiabatic trajectory calculations involve a single trajectory, one does not know what velocities and momenta the nuclear wave packets have on different surfaces, and this gives some flexibility in the generalization. For example, the difference in momentum on two surfaces may be approximated as in a surface hop. 123 Depending on the system and initial conditions of the trajectories, either the force-change term or the momentum-change term may dominate. A similar approach to the above wave packet derivation is the overlap decoherence correction of Granucci, Persico, and Zoccante. 128 These authors explicitly compute the overlap matrix in real time by spawning frozen Gaussians to different states (although they propagate these spawned Gaussians in an approximated way). 128 Subotnik and Shenvi also proposed a way to estimate the decoherence time based on explicitly modeling the decoherence of wave packets; in their case, this was accomplished by propagating additional variables along with the trajectories. 129 To cut down on the expense, a simplified version was proposed, 130 and it has also been used by Plasser et al. 131 Some models in the literature assume that there is no decoherence on parallel surfaces, but that neglects decoherence due to wave packets getting out of overlap (see eqs 52 and 53), because they have different momenta.

In practice, it is common to see 5 or 10-fold implementation, 5 for smaller data sets (say n < 100) and 10 for large data sets (n > 1000). These values tend to strike a good balance between training with lots of observations, while leaving enough for testing to get an adequate estimation of performance. As suggested previously, the k-fold method performs somewhere between the other, more extreme methods. While LOOCV tends to have lower bias due to the number of training observations being maximal, the viewpoint of modern theory is that in practice, it can be better to have a biased estimate with smaller variance. Recalling the bias-variance trade-off, LOOCV will indeed have higher variance that k-fold CV. This can be further explained due in part to the high positive correlation between the outputs of LOOCV. Notice that the training sets in LOOCV are nearly identical from iteration to iteration, and hence knowing the performance of a model trained on one gives us a good idea of the performance of the same model trained on the others. In contrast, outputs in k-fold CV are less positively correlated due to having more varied training sets, and hence a comparatively smaller variance. This can be expressed mathematically using the identity for the variance of the sum of random variables. Let F i and F j represent two different folds with randomly chosen members. Then\nVar(F i + F j ) = Var(F i ) + Var(F j ) + 2Cov(F i , F j ).\n(1.15) We see that the variance becomes smaller when the covariance term is closer to 0. As a final note, it is clear to see that k-fold CV requires far less computational time to execute when compared to LOOCV. As important as test error is to assessing models, its actual value may not always be of interest. If we want to identify a method or level of flexibility that results in lowest test error, it really doesn't matter what this value is. Rather, we want to know the location of the minimum test error in terms of level of flexibility, either across multiple curves (in the flexibility-MSE plane) representing different methods, or along the same curve representing one method.",

DISCUSSIONUnderstanding chemical bonding means understanding all processes that contribute to the stabilization of a molecular system. The most important quantum particles involved in these processes are electrons, which are charged fermions. Fundamental for the electron structure of atoms and molecules is the PEP, which prevents identical electrons from coming close, and which has the effect \" of a fictitious, highly effective, mutual repulsion being exerted within the system, irrespective of any other actual interactions that might be present\", 10 sometimes called \"Pauli repulsion\". It is responsible for the shell structure of atoms, for the local spin arrangements in atoms and molecules, related to concepts like Hund's rule, dynamic spin polarization, or spin waves. And it is mainly responsible for the spatial arrangement of fragments in chemical reactions. Although Maynau et al. discussed in their 1983 paper spin waves in molecules with conjugated π systems, the title of their paper is programmatic: \"Looking at Chemistry as a Spin Ordering Problem\".50 Understanding chemical bonding means also to critically question traditional concepts and their use to explain chemistry. For example, what causes hybridization when the perturbation and its symmetry is never mentioned, which is necessary to destroy the spherical symmetry of atoms and to enable superposition of orthogonal eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator. Is it possible to make meaningful statements about hybridization of atoms from period 3 or higher of the periodic table, unless one knows of and considers the different structures of the valence shell in period 2 and in all other periods of the periodic table? It is necessary to know that there is an interplay of PEP, hybridization as a result of perturbation, the position of an element in the periodic table, and the energetic stabilization caused by interference. The projection probabilities of the OVB CSFs are the most important source of information for changes in the spin distribution, every change of the local spin state correlates with characteristic changes of geometry data, especially bond angles.

This might lead to relaxation via photon emission. Photon emission entails three complementary processes: Firstly, the molecule provides some information about its position. From Bohr's complementary principle we know that you cannot have particle character (position) and wave character (interference) at the same time. Secondly, we can follow Heisenberg's microscope argument for motivating his position-momentum uncertainty relation: if we want to resolve a very small distance, we need light of very short wavelength, incident from the broadest possible angle. This means that a position measurement will add a momentum perturbation. Thirdly, we can argue that the emission of a photon entangles the molecule quantum mechanically with the environment. It turns out, that these three pictures are all quantitatively equivalent.\n\nFor undergraduate teaching, Heisenberg's microscope argument is often the most intuitive of all three. If a single photon cannot resolve the different paths the molecule takes through the grating, scattering more photons can actually provide more optical information: The barycenter of a point spread function can be measured ever more precisely, the more photons are scattered. In Heisenberg's words, this will however, induce a momentum diffusion, which after scattering of many photons will destroy the interference.\n\nThermal decoherence has actually been observed in molecule interference experiments. 68 Note, that in complex molecules, rotational emission typically occurs in the microwave region, while vibrational photons have usually a wavelength between 3 − 20 m, depending on the bond strengths.

Naively, one can grasp the potential magnitude of such differences in MP by considering a substance such as cocoa butter, and the fact that its industrially relevant polymorphs are known to be separated by nearly 20 K [63]. To more quantitatively approach the issue, we have examined the MPs of 119 unique crystal polymorphs gathered from the experimental literature [64,65]. In this data set, we have computed the size of the MP interval in K for all polymorphs for each molecular structure (∆T m ), and histogrammed the distribution of MP intervals in figure 2(b). To compute this interval, we take the difference between the maximum and minimum recorded MPs for polymorphs of a given molecule. The data in figure 2(b) represents the maximum potential error in MP prediction if we assume the ML algorithm predicts a value somewhere within this interval.\n\nWe observe that over half of the examined molecules would exhibit polymorph-related predictive errors of less than 10 K, which is an encouraging result for QSPR predictions. Moreover, over 80 percent of molecules would have their errors bounded by 20 K, though it is somewhat troubling that for some polymorphs MP variations as large as 57 K have been measured. However, the fact that 96 percent of molecules exhibit a MP interval of less than 30 K, along with the fact that only a fraction of the molecular structures in a data set will exhibit multiple crystal polymorphs, suggests that crystal polymorph induced inaccuracies are likely not the sole feature limiting the performance of MP prediction. The first and second moments of the simple crystal polymorph MP distribution correspond to a range of~11-16 K, which we tentatively use as a lower bound for our expected error due to polymorphs. Note, that the previously obtained intervals of 35-50 K MP prediction accuracy are significantly worse than that derived from the simple analysis of figure 2(b).\n\n\nExperimental and chemical uncertainties",

The need for such generalized information-theoretic (IT) measures of the entropy/information content in electronic states has been emphasized elsewhere [10][11][12][13][14]. Such descriptors combine the classical terms due to wavefunction modulus (or probability density), and the nonclassical contributions generated by the state phase (or its gradient determining the convection velocity). The overall gradient information, the quantum extension of Fisher's intrinsic accuracy functional for locality events, then represents the dimensionless measure of the state electronic kinetic energy [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. This proportionality relation between the state resultant information content and the average kinetic energy of electrons ultimately allows applications of the molecular virial theorem [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] in an information interpretation of the chemical bond and reactivity phenomena [4,6,9,30].\n\nIn principle, all these entropic contributions can be extracted by an experimental removal of the position and momentum uncertainties in the system quantum state [31,32].

The detector consisted of a grid electrode for anion post-acceleration and a pair of 75 mm diameter chevron microchannel plates that amplified each detected particle onto a two-layer delay line anode, allowing the event-byevent acquisition of the 3-dimensional momentum of each ion, encoded in the time and position of each ion hit. Extensive shielding of the detector and spectrometer prevented most of the background scattered electrons from entering the spectrometer or hitting the detector. In the list-mode data record, the 3-dimensional momentum of each detected ion fragment was stored, allowing for both on-the-fly and offline analysis. Momentum imaging experiments require several hours of data collection to achieve acceptable statistical uncertainties in the momentum-differential data. To produce mass-resolved anion fragment yields, the same experimental approach was employed for a much shorter time of 120 s per incident electron energy, to reduce the systematic uncertainties originating from instabilities in the molecular beam density. The anion fragment yields are not calibrated to an absolute scale and the relative yields for each of the two target molecules, HCOOD and DCOOH, were measured in different experimental runs under very similar conditions. Therefore the yields for each target are only approximately normalized to the same arbitrary scale, with the scale uncertainty for each target molecule estimated to be ±50%.\n\n\nResults\n\nThe relative yields of anions produced by C-H and O-H break, measured as a function of incident electron energy are presented in figure 1. To better identify the transient anion resonances associated with the incident electron energydependent structures in the DEA product yields, we examine the measured three-dimensional momentum images in figure 3 for the fragment anions produced at a few relevant incident electron energies. Each image displays the momentum of D − , originating from the site indicated by the inset cartoon of each panel, in the laboratory frame defined by the electron beam direction. The longitudinal or transverse coordinates correspond to anion fragment dissociation in the same direction or orthogonal to the electron beam, respectively.

As we saw, under some conditions this may be a fair approximation but in others, specifically those that approach conditions of natural flight, it definitely is not. One may wonder whether this latter observation is more generally valid. Here the report by Gur et al. (1997) offers an important clue: The authors studied cells in monkey primary visual cortex, and noticed that these showed marked sub-Poisson statistics when care was taken to exclude episodes with eye movements from the analysis. Thus, from the point of view of specifying neural reproducibility, eye movements add variability. But that of course is by no means necessarily true for the monkey if it knows when it holds its eyes still. It is thus quite possible that sub-Poisson firing is a more general phenomenon, and relevant to natural stimulus conditions; this could be revealed in experiments designed to control carefully for variability in the neural response that is knowable by the animal.\n\nWe have encountered an example of this in the H1 data presented in section 4.2. Fig. 17C shows the arrival times of spikes with reference to the stimulus, and these jitter by 0.73 ms. Fig. 17D shows the jitter in the interspike interval beginning with the spike depicted in panel C, which at 0.18 ms is much tighter. This implies that the fluctuations in the absolute timing of the two spikes are strongly correlated. If the interval length plays a role in the interpretation of H1 somewhere downstream, then in a sense the fly corrects for the fluctuations by knowing that they are correlated.\n\nIt would even be more interesting if fluctuations correlated among different neurons, as that would mean that the relative timing between spikes from different cells may carry extra information. Preliminary data from double recording experiments indicate that this is indeed the case for the two H1 neurons in the left and right lobula plates, again under approximately natural stimulus conditions.\n\nFigure 1 :\n1Two flies in a chase.

Such point lie in a zone where our model does not really know what to expect, hence by performing the experiment on the real system we alleviate this uncertainty, which in turns improves our model of the system. Those steps are really simple conceptually and represent steps C to G of our algorithm. In practice, implementing them on the computer requires some tricks and tips that we will explain in detail next, but first let us look at what happens if we query 10 more experiments using our uncertainty sampling method ( Figure S13). Figure S14 shows just that. It is really interesting to see how most of the experiments are performed at the boundary between the green and purple area, the algorithm somehow understood that this area is of particular interest to understand and better model the boundary between crystal and no crystal. As a result, our model (right) is now an extremely good approximation of our real system (left), and this despite most of the experiment performed being located in a small region of the chemical space.\n\nFinally, an important question will be to compare the performance of such active learning strategy with a control strategy, which for example could be selecting random experiments to cover the chemical space uniformly. On Figure S15 we can see how the distribution of experiments performed (middle) is a lot less structured and targeted than when using the uncertainty based algorithm. As a result, the model (right) is much less accurate. Random is the baseline we used in this work to S18 compare our algorithm, and we also interestingly compared with how human experimenters would select experiments.

Indeed, a removal of σ j ultimately calls for an additional momentum experimental setup, which is incompatible with that required for determining the electronic position. Only the repeated, separate localization and momentum experiments, performed on molecular systems in the same quantum state, can fully eliminate the position and current uncertainties contained in a general electronic state.

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

This view is confirmed by systematic tests, in which we increased or decreased all binding energies by 0.2 eV and in both cases found only small differences in the extension of the bistability region at more pronounced changes in its position in (p O 2 , p CO )-space. Correspondingly, we do not expect that the predicted gas-phase conditions for the bistability are accurate to better than some orders of magnitude in pressure. Its actual existence, however, should be very robust with respect to the uncertainties of present-day DFT functionals.This leaves as final important aspect the employed lateral interaction model on the Pd(100) surface. Already the comparison to the experimentally determined maximum CO coverage (0.75 ML 35 versus 0.5 ML in Fig. 2) indicated the site-blocking rules in the default Pd(100)-2NN model to be too repulsive. We assess the consequences for the bistability region by determining this region with the less repulsive Pd(100)-1NN model, where now only configurations that would result in CO adsorbed in nearest-neighbor positions are excluded.The resulting 1p-kMC bistability region at 600 K is shown inFig. 5and compared to the corresponding bistability region deduced before within the default Pd(100)-2NN model. Obviously the eased stabilization of CO at the Pd(100) surface (maximum coverage now 1 ML) blocks the O adsorption even more effectively and consequently leads to a much increased range of gas-phase conditions where both surface states are predicted to be stable. If we take the comparison to the maximum CO coverage from experiment as measure, we would expect the true CO-CO repulsion to be somewhere between the one represented within the Pd(100)-1NN and Pd(100)-2NN site blocking models. Correspondingly, we would estimate the true extension of the bistability region to be somewhere between those predicted within the two models. While thus not fully quantified in its extension, the actual existence of a bistability region per se is robust against the uncertainty in the employed lateral interaction model.",

In the following, we will consider two different definitions which extend calibration in a regression setting: confidenceintervals based and error based calibration. • Error-based calibration, originally described by Levi et al. 22 , proposes to directly compare the uncertainty to the empirical error, as in Eq. (10).\nE (µ (x) − y) 2 | σ 2 (x) =σ =σ, ∀σ(10)\nThis defines a perfectly calibrated model as one outputting an uncertainty matching the expected error. As in the classification case, in practice, to assess calibration it is necessary to split the test data ordered by estimated uncertainty in K bins and average uncertainties and errors for each bin. It is then possible to define the Calibration Curve by plotting the MSE of the i-th bin as a function of its average uncertainty v .\n\nNotice that, unlike classification and confidence-interval calibration cases, here the Calibration Plot is not bound in the [0, 1] interval but ranges between 0 and the maximum uncertainty. As in the other cases, perfect calibration corresponds to a diagonal line.\n\nEach of these two approaches has its pros and cons. Confidence-based calibration has the advantage of considering all the predictions to compute each point of the plot, thus resulting in more robust empirical calculations. However, as recently highlighted, 22 one can re-calibrate practically any output distribution using this evaluation method -even an entirely uncorrelated uncertainty. While this is not a limitation for the present work, since we do not address uncertainty re-calibration, it is something to be taken into consideration in general. The main advantage of error-based calibration is that it directly ties computed uncertainty to expected error, thus reflecting what the user would expect. The main limitation is represented by the fact that, since only a fraction of uncertainty estimates contributes to each computed point, and the uncertainty estimates are not uniformly distributed, the subsets used to compute the different points are not homogeneous.",

Knowing the distribution of the different parameters that contribute to the R 10 , we may also provide a confidence interval for the age thus determined.

Since we cannot measure absolute angular positions with this precision by our setup, there is a systematic error in the peak positions determined by the uncertainty in the geometry of the detector-sample assembly. Therefore we have to fit the position of the peaks, in spite of knowing F 00 and F 11 . However, this way the fitted values of the peak positions cannot be used as a consistency check for F 00 and F 11 . In what follows we do not draw any conclusions from the fitted position parameters. For phase determination, the important parameters are F 01 and F 10 . Their phase determines the shape of the Kossel lines. By definition, F 01 and F 10 are not independent; F 01 = A 0 /sin(ϕ 1 ) × e iΦ while F 10 = A 0 /sin(ϕ 0 ) × e −iΦ where A 0 is the magnitude of the structure factor and Φ is its phase. This means that we have to fit the Kossel line profile by a minimum of 3 parameters: A 0, Φ and a position parameter. However, in practice we have one more fitting parameter determined by the experimental conditions: the line broadening. It comes from three factors: the energy width of the fluorescent lines, the imperfection of the crystal, and the angular resolution of the experimental setup. The energy width of the fluorescent lines can be precisely given but the other two factors change from line to line depending on the geometry and in practice they cannot be easily derived. Estimating their contributions we found that the crystal imperfection dominates, followed by the angular resolution of the setup, and the smallest contribution comes from the energy width of the fluorescent lines. We took into account the line broadening by convoluting the theoretical lines (given by equations (1) and (2)) with a Gaussian. In the fitting procedure we obtained 20-100 times total broadening of the theoretical line width. It is important to point out here, that the line broadening and A 0 are correlated in the fitting procedure. Therefore no conclusive information can be drawn for any one of them. However, this does not affect the determination of Φ, which is our goal. We show below, that even with this relatively large broadening the line profiles give the phase with about",

Analysis technique and calibration\n\nThe anion fragment initial momentum data was generated through offline analysis. The fragment dissociation direction and kinetic energy distributions were determined from the measured time and position coordinates. Since all anions of interest in this experiment are of the same charge, anions of different mass are distinguished by their recorded time-of-flight to the detector, which is proportional to the square-root of the singly-charged anion mass. The time-of-flight also encodes one coordinate of momentum, limiting the mass-resolution of the system. This technique does not allow O − and NH − 2 to be distinguished by their time-of-flight, therefore we rely on previous work [32] to identify the dominant fragmentation channel at each incident electron energy. Momentum calibration was performed by measurements of H − and O − anions from DEA to H 2 O [35][36][37].\n\nFor each anion fragment of interest we determine the ion dissociation distribution in 3D momentum space. To display the distribution on two axes with a constant solid angle, we display a conical slice of the 3D momentum sphere. The kinetic energy and angular distributions are derived from the unsliced momentum. Note, that in the analysis we exploited the symmetry about the electron beam direction axis for the electron attachment and subsequent anion dissociation dynamics.

In reality, the membrane will adopt a shape that minimizes the system ' s total energy. A priori we have no way of knowing what that shape is, nor do we know if the shapes shown in Fig. 5 (E and F) are stable for the given arginine positions. We circumvented this shortcoming by carrying out a set of calculations in which the helix remained fi xed with the arginine at the membrane center, but we varied the degree of leafl et compression. As the leafl et compresses from its equilibrium value, the electrostatic component of the helix transfer energy drops by 35 kcal/mol (see Fig. 6 A ), again highlighting the importance of water penetration and lipid head group bending. Over 90% of this energy is gained by compressing the membrane down to a height of 5 Å , and very little further electrostatic stabilization is gained by compressing farther. The reason for this can be seen from Fig. 5 F in which the arginine \" snorkels \" up toward the extracellular space. Therefore, once the membrane height comes down to ‫ف‬ 5 Å , the charged guanidinium group is completely engulfed in a high-dielectric environment. When the nonpolar, lipid deformation, and membrane dipole energies are added, the energy profi le produces a noticeable free energy minimum at 5 Å ( Fig. 6 B ). Thus, by extending our simulation protocol we have shown that these structures with deformed membranes are mechanically stable, and we have removed the uncertainty regarding the proper placement of the membrane at the protein interface.",

This relation may be mathematically expressed by means of the Boltzmann-Shannon information entropy (entropic uncertainty relation) in a much more appropriate and accurate way than the standard deviation 1 . The information entropy is a superior measure of a spread and then of quantum uncertainty, a property of fundamental relevance for adequate characterization of position and momentum of single-particle densities 2 . These entropies have been used for various practical purposes such as the measurement of squeezing of quantum fluctuation 3 , reconstruction of charge and momentum densities of atomic and molecular systems 4 . In physical sciences, Shannon entropy measures the spread of the electron density. The concentration of the wave function of the state is higher when Shannon entropy is small 5 . Thus, Shannon entropy is used to determine the stability of a given system. A system is conceived to be more stable when Shannon entropy is small and becomes unstable when Shannon entropy is higher. Shannon entropy is related to fundamental and experimentally measurable quantities such as the kinetic energy and magnetic susceptibility which makes them useful in the study of the structure and dynamics of atomic and molecular systems 6 . It is noted that Shannon entropy has drawn many attentions due to its usefulness in different areas. Despite the various studies on Shannon entropy by different authors, Dehesa et al. 7 , stated that the analytical determination of the information entropies of physical systems is in its infancy. Recently, Yahya et al. 8 and Onate et al. 9 separately studied the Shannon entropy for some potential models using different traditional techniques. Motivated by this, we intend to investigate the analytical determination of Shannon entropy and Variance for a multiple potential which is proposed in the concept of the work.

Consider the process Ag Z N → Ag Z N −1 + Ag 0 in which one of the products is a neutral monomer. We have calculated the dissociation energies D Z 0 (N, 1) for all values of Z=1, 2, 3, 4 and N ≤ 100. The calculated values show pronounced shell effects as in previous figures of the most favored channels. However, the mean behaviors have asymptotic constant values. For Z = 1, 2, 3, 4, these asymptotic values in electron-volts are 0.95, 1.00, 1.08, 1.15, respectively. This means that the monomer evaporation from a singly charged cluster needs a smaller energy than from a doubly charged and so on. The same analysis for the dimer evaporation in the process Ag Z N → Ag Z N −2 + Ag 0 2 shows also constant asymptotic mean behaviors for the D Z 0 (N, 2). The obtained values in electron-volts are 0.49, 0.59, 0.72, 0.87 for Z=1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. This means that, as in the monomer evaporation, the detachment of a dimer from singly ionized cluster is easier than from a doubly ionized cluster and so on. However, comparing the dissociation energies for monomer and dimer evaporation (keeping the charge constant) shows that atomic evaporation needs more energy than dimer evaporation. Now, we consider the fission processes Ag Z N → Ag Z−1 N −2 + Ag 1+ 2 and Ag Z N → Ag Z−1 N −3 + Ag 1+ 3 in which one of the fission products is a singly ionized dimer or a singly ionized trimer.

With the exception of this fact, all the results of the present investigation, in so far as it is concerned with these lines and with the line 4686 of the enhanced series, are in accord with Bohr's theory of radiation. The necessity for the occurrence of ionisation before the emission of the orthohelium and parhelium series lines can take place seems, however, to indicate some limita tion of those electron transitions within the helium atom which involve an increase in the potential energy of the atomic system, not predicted by Bohr's theory. The limitation indicated is one which prevents direct transitions within the atom from the normal orbit to any orbits of either the crossed system, or the coplanar system, except the 2, S and the 2, s orbits.\n\nThe results of the present investigation are thus directly opposed to the conclusion drawn by Franck and Knipping that the bends in their currentvoltage curves in helium between 21/2 volts and 25'2 volts are due to the excitation of successive lines of an ultra-violet series, by the return of the electron after displacement to successive outer orbits of the helium atom. On the other hand, the results of the present investigation of normal uncharged helium are in complete agreement with the results of the investigations of McLennan and Ireton on the vapours of zinc, cadmium, and mercury, and of Foote and Meggers on caesium vapour.\n\nThe excitation of \\ 4686 at voltages above 50-8 volts, and not below this value, indicates that a similar limitation does not hold in the case of the stimulation of this line from a helium positive ion. It would be of interest to ascertain whether such a difference between neutral and ionised atoms occurs in other cases, for instance in mercury, zinc, or cadmium, vapour.",

[13] reported the very first DWBA calculation for ionization of helium in 1977 and numerous DWBA papers can be found in the literature (for a representative sample of DWBA papers since 1990 see ).In general, the DWBA tends to give reasonable agreement with the dominant features of the fully differential cross-section (FDCS) measurements for electron-impact ionization of atoms if the incident electron has an energy of about 100 eV or larger.",

[13] In order to estimate the average distance between the nearest neighbor ions in the cluster, we have assumed a bcc structure as in the bulk of Na. Then the shortest distance between the ions, d, is related to the lattice constant, a, through d = a √ 3/2. But, in the bcc structure for Na, there are two electrons in a cell and therefore, a = 2 π/3 r s . Combining these two relations results in d = √ π r s . The value r s = 3.99 is appropriate for room temperature (T = 300 K) which results in a value of d = 7.07 bohrs whereas, for T = 0 K the appropriate value for r s is 3.93 which gives rise to the value d = 6.96 bohrs. Therefore, our results should lie above the MD results [ see Fig 15(a) of Ref. 13] because, the MD calculations have been performed for zero temperature. In Fig. 3(c) we have shown the plots of equilibrium r s values for singly ionized sodium clusters as functions of number of electrons, N. The behavior is more or less the same as neutral one. Figure 4(a) compares the SSPJM2 results for neutral Al clusters with the results obtained using the SJM1. Here, we have taken the effective value of z * = 1. The diamonds and squares in the plot show the physical points. The main difference between our results and the SJM1 is in the size of the jellium atom of Al. In Fig. 4(b) we have compared the results for singly ionized Al clusters. The results show some differences for values of N away from shell closings. Looking at the above-mentioned figures, we note that in all the three cases of Cs, Na, and Al the SSPJM2 results in a larger or equal values for the average distance than the SJM1, and in addition show alternations for small clusters. Finally, in Fig. 5(a) we have compared the plots of the total energies per electron in the two schemes of the SSPJM2 and the SSPJM1 for Na clusters. It is seen that in the SSPJM2 the energies are relatively lower than those of the SSPJM1 for smaller clusters but the same for larger ones. We have also calculated the ionization energies",

In 1930, Dirac [4] produced an equation which included a relativistic correction for the electron energy levels. Lamb and Retherford [5][6][7] were able to show that there is a small shift (now known as the Lamb shift) in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom not included in the Dirac equation. When the Lamb shift is taken into account, the actual ionization energies of one electron atoms are slightly less than that calculated by the Dirac equation. The calculation of the Lamb shift now forms an essential part in the theoretical calculations of energy levels and ionization energies of one and two electron atomic ions [8,9].\n\nIn this work, we begin by showing the expressions with relativistic corrections to calculate ionization energies which give excellent agreement with the literature values. However, as the number of electrons in the sequence increases, the expressions become more and more complex and less predictable. Hence, we discuss alternative simple equations to calculate energies of isoelectronic sequences in excess of five electrons and show that it is more practical to adopt a simple expression to reproduce ionization energies which still provide very good agreement with generally accepted values. To maintain our aim of simplicity, the expressions/equations only contain fundamental constants or values derived from fundamental constants and fairly simple numbers.\n\n\nSources of Data\n\nMoore [10][11][12][13] provided very detailed tables of atomic energy levels and ionization potentials in wave numbers (cm −1 ) and values converted from wave numbers to electron volts 2 The Scientific World Journal (eV) (where 1 cm −1 equals 1.2398418 × 10 −4 eV) for atoms and atomic ions with estimated experimental errors and references to original work.

Because of their small binding energy of only 90 nano electron volts helium dimers [1,2] can be considered as the most weakly bond atomic systems. Investigating them in atomic scattering experiments requires special constraints for the setup. The fact that -though the existence of helium dimers was theoretically predicted in 1928 [3] -they could be observed experimentally for first time in 1994 [4] gives an idea for these difficulties. However, following these results and also further experimental studies on this subject [2,5,6] the use of a precooled supersonic gas jet system provides good conditions for the production of helium dimers [5]: In a small region following the nozzle the density of the expanding gas is sufficiently high so that dimers can be created in three-body collisions. Having passed this region all particles have nearly the same velocity and move within a short distance (within the so called \"zone of silence\") without interaction.\n\nCompared to usual internuclear distances in molecules and also other Van-der-Waals bound clusters the distance between the two atoms in a helium dimer is huge. Theoretical calculations predict an average bond length of 52 angstroms and a maximum interatomic distance of 200 angstroms [4,7]. In this case the mutual interaction of the fluctuating dipole in one atom with the dipole induced in the other atom can not be considered as instantaneous. In fact the propagation speed of the electric dipole field is limited by the speed of light which means that also the propagation time is finite (retardation). According to theoretical studies [7] this relativistic effect should have a significant influence on the potential energy curve of the dimer and therefore on the distribution of interatomic distances. The goal of the presented measurement was to determine the interatomic distance experimentally.\n\nThe principal idea of achieving this is based on the so called reflection approximation: If the helium dimer is doubly ionized and dissociates into two ionic fragments the interatomic distance R at the instant of ionization can be determined experimentally from the kinetic energy of both fragments in the center-of-mass frame (i.e. from the kinetic energy release (KER)):",

This method is based on the accounting of the many-electron correlations up to the fourth order of the perturbation theory and is free of any adjustable parameters. Figure 5 demonstrates that in spite of the simplicity, the jellium model turns out to be rather reliable approximation able to reproduce reasonably well the dependence of binding energy per atom for both neutral and singly charged sodium clusters. To illustrate the importance of the exchange and many-electron correlation interaction in the cluster, we plot on figure 6 the total energy per atom calculated both in the HF and LDA spherical jellium approximations for neutral (Fig. 6a) and singly charged (Fig. 6b) spherical sodium clusters as a function of cluster size. The spherical cluster shape was assumed in this calculation for the sake of simplicity.

We compare the jellium model results with those obtained in [3] using ab initio theoretical framework and with the available experimental data [8]. This comparison demonstrates that the jellium model reproduces correctly most of the essential features of the ionization potential dependence on N. Some discrepancy, like in the region 11 ≤ N ≤ 14, can be attributed to the neglection of the tri-axial deformation in the axially symmetric jellium model.\n\nIn spite of the fact that ab initio results are closer to the experimental points, one can state quite satisfactory agreement of the jellium model results with the experimental data, which illustrates correctness of the jellium model assumptions and its applicability to the description of sodium clusters.    \n\n\nIV.

The absolutely normalized triple differential experimental cross sections are in excellent agreement with convergent close-coupling (CCC) calculations. We conclude that the problem of electron impact single ionization of helium has been solved accurately in the present energy regime.Kinematically complete experiments for electron-impact single ionization of atoms, socalled (e, 2e) studies, determine the momentum vectors of all continuum particles for known final-state configuration of the remaining ion thus ultimately benchmarking all facets of quantum few-body Coulomb dynamics.Recently, the fundamental three-particle quantum dynamical problem, electron-impact ionization of atomic hydrogen, was claimed having been rigorously solved numerically by the methods of (i) exterior complex scaling (ECS) [1], (ii) time-dependent close coupling (TDCC) [2] and (iii) convergent close coupling (CCC)[3]. The non-perturbative CCC and TDCC methods have also been successfully applied to describe electron-helium ionizing collisions yielding in general excellent agreement, see e.g.[4]. Thus the question was posed recently by Bray et al. [4]  \"whether the problem of single ionization of helium by electron impact, leaving the ion in the ground state, has also been computationally solved\" in the light of some systematic discrepancies that still exist for some of the coplanar data. Therefore, comprehensive measurements are urgently required to confirm the accuracy of these theoretical approaches to the electron-helium scattering problem. To comprehensively test theory, experimental data are required that are normalized to an absolute scale for any final-state continuum configuration and also cover 4π solid angle of electron emission.Absolutely normalized triple differential cross sections (TDCS) as 3D emission patterns for experiment and CCC calculation are presented inFigure 1(a) and (b), respectively, for the scattering angle of θ 1 = −10° of the fast final state electron as function of the emission direction of a slow ejected electron with E 2 = 8 eV energy.

This new technique is able to measure energy distribution of ions from thermal energies up to few electron volts and allows measuring the energy distribution of singly charged ions which is difficult to obtain through the more usual method using the increase of the width of the peaks in the time-of-flight spectrum.The energy distribution function of the molecular fragments is a key quantity to determine the reaction rates of the subsequent steps following primary molecular dissociation by photons or charged particles. The energy of the fragments are usually estimated through measurements of the average Kinetic Energy Release (KER), which is usually obtained for violent fragmentation processes resulting in doubly charged or higher-charged species. The experimental determination of the energy distribution function of singly charged fragmentation is very scarce because it is more difficult to measure [1].This work was carried out at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro using a pulsed electron beam with a time-delay extraction technique, together with a time-of-flight spectrometer, to measure the energy distribution function for both the parent molecular ion as well as the fragments. The electron beam interacts with the gas in a cell which keeps the gas at thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The distribution function is obtained from the measured yields as a function of the delay time, by modeling a free-fall escape of the ions from the interaction region.The method here presented is reliable to measure energy distributions from thermal to supra-thermal energies up to few eV. The energy distribution of N + produced by 400 eV electron impact ionization of N 2 will be shown as example. The measured parent N 2 + ion follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic energy distribution at room temperature while the N + fragment presents a pronounced maximum for kinetic energies near 1 eV and an average KER of ~ 1.8 eV. This value is smaller than the average KER of N + by N 2 fragmentation, in the ionization channel, by He + projectiles with the same velocity, which is ~ 3.5 eV[2], showing that the KER is dependent of the collision dynamics even for projectiles with velocities well above the average electron orbital velocities.",

Especially, the case of HBC, which is rather large and by comparison very stable, is compelling. The apparent absence of electronic features of neutral and cationic HBC in the diffuse ISM suggests that, due to molecular diversity, the abundances of individual PAH species of this size are probably too low to allow detection in the UV-VIS spectral domain.

The non-perturbative CCC and TDCC methods have also been successfully applied to describe electron-helium ionizing collisions yielding in general excellent agreement, see e.g. [4]. Thus the question was posed recently by Bray et al. [4] \"whether the problem of single ionization of helium by electron impact, leaving the ion in the ground state, has also been computationally solved\" in the light of some systematic discrepancies that still exist for some of the coplanar data. Therefore, comprehensive measurements are urgently required to confirm the accuracy of these theoretical approaches to the electron-helium scattering problem. To comprehensively test theory, experimental data are required that are normalized to an absolute scale for any final-state continuum configuration and also cover 4π solid angle of electron emission.\n\nAbsolutely normalized triple differential cross sections (TDCS) as 3D emission patterns for experiment and CCC calculation are presented in Figure 1",

The initial addition step to [i1] has no barrier because it represents an association of two species, each of them having at least one unpaired electron, in this case a radical (SiH) and a diradical (O 2 ). During the association process two unpaired electrons from the two interacting moieties form an electron pair thus creating a new Si-O single bond. Such radical/(di)radical reactions occur without barriers. While the complex [i1] is formed, the total spin of the doublet/triplet pair is converted to a doublet due to the formation of the extra electron pair. The   calculated spin density distribution in [i1] shows that the remaining unpaired electron in HSiOO is localized on the terminal oxygen atom, which exhibits a spin density of 0.91 (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that the related reactions of Si with O 2 (diradical/diradical) and singly ionized silicon (Si + ) with O 2 (radical/diradical) are also barrierless 41,42 . However, these reactions cannot produce SiO 2 or singly ionized silicon dioxide (SiO 2 + ) under single collision conditions as prevailing in the low density ISM. Here, SiO 2 and SiO 2 + represent highly exothermic reaction intermediates residing in deep potential wells, and their internal energy due to chemical activation has to be dissipated. The energy dissipation may occur either via deactivation through third-body collisions or via fragmentation to SiO plus O or singly ionized silicon monoxide (SiO + ) plus O, respectively. Whereas third-body collisions prevent the dissociation of SiO 2 when the reaction of Si with O 2 takes place in a 0.37 K superfluid helium droplet 43 , the fragmentation channels take over at low pressures where collision deactivations are inefficient. Indeed, the reaction of Si with O 2 is usually invoked as one of the main source of SiO 44 . Crossed molecular beam studies of this system have firmly established SiO plus O as the reaction products under nearly zero-pressure conditions 45 as corroborated by theoretical quasiclassical trajectory calculations 46 .

As the field strength increases, we observe the characteristic quadratic polarization effect on the energy (which can be described by perturbation theory). 83 Higher lying states are more polarizable, so this effect becomes more evident. These high energy excited states are also more easily ionized and the transition between the quadratic behavior characteristic of a bound state to a linear dependence of the energy on field strength happens at lower fields. At F = 0.175 a.u., we observe an avoided crossing between the first singlet state (which has been previously ionized) and the unionized ground state. This leads to a change in character of the ground state after the avoided crossing: initially unionized, with both electrons localized around the atom, the ground state becomes singly ionized, with one electron detaching from the atom and localizing at the edge of the box. The second ionization is characterized by yet another avoided crossing between the singly ionized S 0 and doubly ionized S 1 at a field of F = 0.36 a.u. Between these two field strengths, we note that the singly ionized T 1 state is degenerate with the ionized ground state S 0 . It is worth noticing that the potential energy curves presented here as a function of field strength are very similar to stabilization graphs proposed by Simons 84 and widely used to describe temporary ions and other atomic/molecular resonances 85 . There, information about the resonance's lifetime can be obtained by an analysis of the avoided crossing that arise by changing the variational parameters associated with the basis set. Here, however, the basis set is fixed and the energy is plotted as a function of varying field strength.",

For many years, the values of EFG produced by external electrodes in the laboratory were too small to yield a measurable effect when interacting with a charge distribution of nuclear dimensions. As an alternative, the EFG produced by electrons in atomic or molecular environments, or by other charged particles (such as muons or kaons in bound orbits), or produced during the bombardment of a target nucleus with energetic ions were used. This section presents a brief outline of these experimental methods.\n\n\nAtomic or molecular environments\n\nIn a solid, electric field gradients of up to a few 10 18 V/cm 2 can be obtained from atomic or molecular charges. The hyperfine interaction between this kind of EFG and the quadrupole moment of an excited nuclear state can be measured from: (i) the magnitude of the hyperfine splitting in atomic transitions (energy differences), (ii) the Mössbauer effect (in case of lowenergy gamma transitions E γ ≤ 130 keV); (iii) the attenuation of the angular distribution of deexcitation gamma rays.\n\n\nMössbauer effect\n\nWhen a nucleus is in a solid, fixed within a lattice, there is considerable probability that it can absorb and emit γ-rays without energy loss going into the recoiling nucleus (Mössbauer effect [17], [2]). The recoil energy and Doppler broadening of the γ-ray are characterized by the mass and random velocity of the whole crystal and are therefore completely negligible. This high precision resonant absorption effect can be used to investigate very small changes in the nuclear energy levels that result from the hyperfine interactions between the nucleus and its electronic environment.\n\nThe probability of such a recoilless event depends on the energy of the gamma-ray, the temperature and vibrational properties of the solid. In general, the Mössbauer effect is optimized for low-energy gamma-rays and low temperature lattices.\n\nThe finite energy spread of the Mössbauer gamma ray can be related to the lifetime of the nuclear excited state. Whereas the interaction of the nuclear quadrupole moment with the EFG gives rise to a splitting of the nuclear energy levels that correspond to different alignments of the quadrupole moment with respect to the principal axis of the EFG.",

The kinematics and the reaction cross section for the 9 Be(α, n) interaction determine the state of the recoiling 12 C nucleus produced in the reaction. The calculations of Vijaya and Kumar [22] (for example) suggest that the relative populations of the ground/first/second excited states for the recoiling 12 C nucleus are ∼35%/∼55%/∼15%. If the recoiling 12 C nucleus is left in its first excited state, it will promptly decay to the ground state via the isotropic emission of a 4.44 MeV gamma-ray. Mowlavi and Koohi-Fayegh [23] as well as Liu et al. [24] have measured R, the 4.44 MeV γ-ray to neutron ratio for Am/Be, to be approximately 0.58.

It also offers the possibility of measuring the elemental density of most elements in inspecting materials. Melamine (C3H6N6) contains 67% nitrogen by mass.

The process of neutron capture by target nucleus followed by the emission of prompt gamma ray, delayed gamma and beta particle.\n\nThe basic principle of prompt gamma activation analysis techniques is illustrated in Figure 1 [1]. When neutron emitted by a neutron source (i.e. 252 Cf) enter a medium of the target, depending on the type of material, neutrons can pass through with long distance before interacting with the nucleus. Neutrons can interact with the nuclei of materials in two ways to yield characteristic prompt gamma-ray emission. First, fast neutron (> 1 MeV) can scatter in-elastically from a nucleus, losing energy in the process and exciting the nucleus to a higher energy state. Immediate excitation of the nucleus produces a gamma-ray characteristic of the excited nucleus. Next, neutrons with energy around the thermal value (0.025 eV) can be captured by a nucleus. A compound nucleus is formed in an excited state and the prompt de-excitation of this capture nucleus causes the emission of a characteristic capture gamma-ray. The presence of a gamma-ray line with a particular energy is used for qualitative analysis. In addition, the intensity of the line is used for quantitative analysis. The range of gamma-ray in a typical bulk medium is approximately 20 to 25 cm.\n\n\nMaterials and method",

The reported levels form what appears to be a ground state band and a negative parity band (with spins up to 9 -). These studies did not observe the 2 + 2 state. In this work, we report the observation of a state at 1579.4 keV that de-excites by a 927.3 gamma transition to the 2 + 1 and a 1579.4 keV gamma to the ground state. We assign this level as the 2 + 1 state based on the systematics of lighter Cd isotopes and predictions by the shell model code OXBASH [21]. The previous beta decay study did not observe this transition because it was masked by contamination from a 928.3 keV gamma-ray from the decay of 126 Sb [24].   Figure 8 shows the decay scheme below 2450 keV. Although there are a few new levels observed in the energy region of interest, they are spread out in energy, and are not good candidates for 3-phonon levels. Unlike the lighter even-mass Ag isotopes, the beta decay of 126 Ag is dominated by a large amount of feeding to negative parity states. Analog states to the ones discussed above for 120,124 Cd may be present in this nucleus, but are not observed in this work due to the small feedings of these states via beta decay. In order to make a conclusion about whether or not these states exist, either a lot more statistics is needed, or the states must be populated by another method. Ag.\n\n\nConclusions",

The normalised delayed coincidence time distribution is given by the expression [7],\nF i (t) = ∞ ∞ P(t − x) f i (x)dx (2)\nwhere P is the prompt time distribution which describes the response function of the experimental equipment and f i is the probability for the decay of the level of interest, i at time x. A second, related way of analysing such data is to use the centroid shift method which compares the moments of the delayed and prompt response time functions.\n\nMuch modern nuclear spectroscopy is performed using arrays of hyper-pure germanium detectors to measure discrete energy gamma rays as they decay from excited states in cascade. The use of such germanium detector arrays is well established and their excellent energy resolution (typically approximately 2 keV FWHM for the fullenergy peak from a 1.33 MeV gamma-ray emitted from a 60 Co source) has enabled a wide range of complex nuclear energy level schemes to be disentagled [6]. The direct coincident timing method between excited states in nuclei as measured using coincidence germanium detectors is generally limited to lifetimes of the order of 1 ns (10 −9 ) due to the finite time for charge collection to occur in such semiconductor detectors (e.g., [8].)\n\nFaster, direct coincidences between discrete nuclear states can be measured using scintillation detectors such as BaF 2 [9], but such detectors suffer a much poorer energy resolution compared to germanium and thus are usually only suitable for coincidence measurements between well separated nuclear transitions in spectrum, such as following β-decay to excited states, or for well-separated transitions fed in the decay of long-lived isomeric states.",

For example, with a 5-MeV electron, the most probable photon energy is about 300 keV, the average photon energy is near 1.0 MeV, while the maximum photon energy is 5.0 MeV.

Despite all the benefits, a number of barriers still persist and prevent irradiated foods from being widely marketed, mainly related to the cost of their use and the resistance from the consumers due to a lack of information on food induced radioactivity [38].\n\nIn order to ensure the quality of a food, from the microbiological point of view and the nutritional quality, several methods are available for the food industries, including the use of radiation.

GCRs interact with near-surface materials (to depths of a few meters), liberating neutrons from atomic nuclei. These neutrons subsequently interact with other nuclei, placing them in higher-energy excited states that subsequently decay via the emission of gamma rays at element-characteristic energies ( Figure   2.1b). Compared with the shallow origin of planetary X-rays, however, the detected gamma rays arise from the top tens of centimeters of the surface.

The ACS was used to discriminate background signals in the Ge detector from the gamma-ray signals of interest coming from Mercury.

Actinides are particularly relevant because most of them emit intense L X-rays, ranging from a few photons per 100 decays up to one hundred (Table 1). These actinides decay by alpha or beta minus emission and the daughter nuclei de-excite through many gamma transitions. Some intense transitions have low energies (<100 keV) and are strongly converted, meaning that many atomic vacancies are created in the L shells or in the outer shells, followed by X-ray emission during the atomic rearrangement. Even though the L X-ray emission intensities are quite intense they are not experimentally precisely known. Table 1 summarizes, for some actinides, the X-ray emission intensities extracted from decay data evaluations [1,2]. The majority of them are calculated. The calculations have larger uncertainties than recent measurements, and they do not always agree. The calculations require many fundamental parameters (FPs) both nuclear (internal conversion coefficients (ICCs), transition probabilities) and atomic (fluorescence yield, Coster Kronig transition probabilities, emission rates. . . ) and some of these have large uncertainties, in particular the atomic FPs.

In the first, the delayed gamma coincidence technique was used requiring a delayed time condition for gamma rays selected by gates placed on previously known transitions in the corresponding isomeric decays. In this way it was possible to identify states above isomers with half-lives of less than a few µs. In order to identify states above much longer-lived isomeric states, the method of gamma cross-coincidences had to be applied. In the case of the 48 Ca + 238 U data, for example, gamma rays associated with the complementary Sm isotopes were found in mutual coincidence with the prompt gamma rays emitted by Sn nuclei. The fairly complex analysis of such data allowed to unambiguously identify the most intense gamma transitions located above the states with long half-lives in the respective Sn isotopes. These also include transitions occurring in the decay of higher-lying isomers. The cross-coincidence technique also allows to determine the number of evaporated neutrons in fission of the compound nucleus and serves as an important observable that can be used in studies of the reaction mechanism [11]. Following the crucial identification of the most intense gamma transitions above the isomers, a standard analysis of the data involving prompt and delayed gamma coincidence techniques established fairly detailed level schemes for all the Sn isotopes of interest.\n\n\nResults",

Subsequent indirect measurements placed this excited, isomeric state (I p = 3/2 + ) to be (3.5 ± 1.0) eV above the ground state (I p = 5/2 + ) [2]. The prospects of a laser-accessible nuclear transition touched off a flurry of proposals to utilize this apparently unique nuclear transition as a sensitive probe of both nuclear structure and chemical environment [3], to constrain the variability of the fundamental constants [4][5][6], to check the exponentiality of the decay law of an isolated metastable state [7], to realize a qubit with extraordinary features [8], to demonstrate a gamma-ray laser [9], and to construct a clock with unprecedented performance [10][11][12].\n\nHowever, as these applications generally required probing the nuclear transition with a narrowband laser system, it was necessary to first more precisely determine the transition energy. Therefore, several efforts were undertaken to spectroscopically resolve the expected ultraviolet (UV) emission from this magnetic dipole (M1) transition, where the excited state was typically expected to be populated in the α-decay of 233 U [13]. Despite initial claims of observation [14,15], these searches were unsuccessful [16][17][18].\n\nIn 2007, using a significantly improved γ-ray spectrometer, the energies of the γ-rays emitted following 233 U α-decay were remeasured. The 229 Th isomeric transition was found to actually be in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum [19], with an energy of (7.8 ± 0.5) eV [20], thus explaining why previous searches, which used VUV insensitive detection methods, failed, and re-energizing the community in the search for direct observation of this nuclear transition. And recently, the result of a search for VUV emission from the nuclear excited state, again expected to be populated in the α-decay of 233 U, suggests that the transition energy is < 7.75 eV [21]; though it is the subject of controversy [22].",

The reason is that the excitation energies of most known excited nuclear states lie far above the range of modern lasers. The only known exception is a long-lived thorium-299 isomeric state known also as 'thorium isomer', whose energy is extremely close to the nuclear ground state. In 2007, an isomer energy of 7.8(5) eV was obtained from indirect measurements with a NASA x-ray microcalorimeter 4 Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed. [7,8]. Recent measurements of spectra of internal conversion electrons emitted in-flight during the decay of the excited nuclei of neutral 229 Th atoms shifted this value to 8.28 (17) eV [1]. This energy is within the reach of modern optical laser spectroscopy, and the isomer transition could serve as a clock transition in a nuclear frequency standard [9], which might reach an unprecedented uncertainty level of 10 −19 [10]. It would also be a very sensitive probe for testing the stability of fundamental constants [11,12]. Frequency shifts and broadenings of this transition in a solid-state environment might be used in studies of material properties, as is commonly done in Mössbauer spectroscopy [13]. It has also been shown that an ensemble of thorium nuclei doped into a transparent crystal may demonstrate superradiance with non-trivial temporal dependences [14], and may be used for constructing a nuclear gamma-ray laser [15].\n\n\nThe solid state approach and magnesium fluoride as a possible host crystal",

DISCUSSION\n\nIn previous report [6,17], it was emphasized that the primary interaction of gamma photon would not, by itself, induce an effect on the substance, except for few circumstances of the interaction with the atomic nuclei with an energy sufficient to induce atomic displacement or a photonuclear reaction. The reason was behind this was based on the fact that gamma interaction with matter is at the atomic scale of single-photon absorption with a short electromagnetic interaction time (τ = /E γ ∼ 10 −21 s for 60 Co gamma lines), while bond breakage requires interaction on longer timescales of order of femtoseconds [16]. The missing photo-electron or the Compton electron is, quickly recovered, by an electron from the molecular system or a lattice electron.\n\nBecause of the small probability of photo-nuclear interaction, the merely available courses for gamma interactions are those involving transfer of energy to an electron. Electron-nucleus interaction has also a small probability compared to Coulomb's interaction. Hence, even when using energetic photons we must quickly think in terms of the electrons. The emergence of secondary electrons is responsible for subsequent x-ray emission/reabsorption, ionization, and excitation of the surrounding atoms in the material, either in Markovian pattern and/or in cascade. The time elapsed between the states of PI, whatever are they, and the states of full acquisition of the energy by the bulk of the material are long enough to affect the thermodynamic properties of the substance within a limited volume (spores) around the PI.\n\nThe interaction of radiation with matter can be summarized in the time scale shown in Figure 1 adopted from Ref. [6] and lately from Ref. [18]. Primary interaction (PI) occurs in a very short time, the cascade excitation (CE) forms the electron cloud, a kind of plasma (P) that holds for a limited time. After a while, electron relaxation (ER) and lattice relaxation (LR) bring the material into thermodynamic (TD) equilibrium. In exceptional situations, collisional interactions displace atom(s) from their position leading to the formation of point-defect (PD) and dislocations loops (DL) inside the solid crystals.",

This is known as an orbital. The further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the more they gain potential energy associated to a determined orbital. Quantum Mechanics explains that orbitals have quantized energy levels and for moving an electron to another level, it has to receive or emit the exact amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the two electronic levels (ΔE = E 1 -E 0 ). The amount of energy required to move and electron from energy level E 0 to energy level E 1 can be provided by heat due to a collision with other particles or absorb the energy of a photon. In this case, the energy of a Photon (E = h = hc/ ) should be equal to the difference between the orbitals (ΔE), this is, only a Photon of a particular wavelength is absorbed and can promote that transition. This phenomenon is known as atomic absorption. A more stable electron configuration of an atom is the one with less energy, also known as ground state configuration. The difference of energy between the last full orbital and the next empty orbital of the atom in a ground state is of the same order of magnitude of photons with wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm, this means, photons in ultraviolet regions and visible light of electromagnetic spectrum.

This contrasts with the classical Mossbauer effect, which results from the absorption of a photon to excite the ground state nucleus to an excited nuclear state without a change in the vibrational state, thus achieving a recoil-free absorption of a photon with energy exactly equal to the energy difference between the nuclear ground state and the excited state. When the nucleus is in a bound state, the vibrational energy can only change by discrete amounts determined by normal mode frequencies. Under these circumstances, the absorption spectrum includes peaks displaced from the recoilless Mossbauer resonance by energies equal to the vibrational quanta. Although this phenomenon was predicted 16,17 shortly after the original Mossbauer report, 18 the practical observation of vibrationally shifted nuclear absorption required intense X-ray beams as described below. Materials containing the isotope 57 Fe have yielded the majority of NRVS results to date, and of course, iron is at the center of hemes and heme proteins as well as many other biologically important centers. See, for example, the report by Cramer and co-workers on the hydride bridge in [NiFe]-hydrogenase for a significant nonheme NRVS result. 19 The iron NRVS experiment selectively yields the complete set of modes that involves motion of the iron atom. The method has a selectivity that is reminiscent of that of resonance Raman spectroscopy, but again note the significant advantage that NRVS is not subject to the electromagnetic selection rules of Raman or infrared spectroscopy. Indeed, NRVS provides the ultimate limit in selectivity because only the vibrational dynamics of the probe nucleus contribute to the observed signal. Importantly, the NRVS intensity is directly related to the magnitude and direction of the motion; hence, the method has Figure 1.

Ideally, this triggering level can also decay directly or via a cascade to the ground state, thus releasing the stored energy [181]. This sketches an effective Λ-type threelevel system, as illustrated in figure 31(a), with the triggering state 3 as the upper level and two ground states: the nuclear isomer as state 1 and state 2, which can either be the ground state directly or rapidly decay to it. By shining just one pump radiation pulse to promote the nucleus from the isomeric state 1 to the triggering level 3, one can expect that part of the nuclei will decay to state 2 (and further to the ground state if applicable) releasing their stored energy via spontaneous emission. However, such nuclear-state control would depend on branching ratios of incoherent processes, and its efficiency would therefore be low. The STIRAP technique presents the advantage that it can transfer population from state 1 to state 2 ideally with up to 100% efficiency.\n\nCompared to transitions in atomic or molecular systems, nuclear transitions have much higher energies, typically in the x-ray or gamma-ray regime.

As a consequence, the nucleus is transformed ( A Z Z → A Z+1 Z + e − + ν e ) into the nucleus of another element with one charge more, Z + 1, and a constant mass number A.

In this case, the nucleus transmutes into a new nucleus of an element with one charge less ( A Z Z → A Z−1 Z + e + + ν e ). Note that the mass of the neutron is larger than the mass of the proton; therefore, β + -decay occurs in nuclei with more than one proton, since the missing mass is taken from the binding energy of the whole nucleus. An example of β + -decay is the decay of the artificial isotope of the fluorine atom 18 9 F → 18 8 O + e + + ν e , which is employed as a radiotracer in nuclear medicine. From the numerical point of view, β + -decay parameters are very difficult to be calculated, since the final atoms are negatively charged, and the additional atomic electron can be weakly bounded, therefore being difficult to determinate these states using quantum mechanical methods.\n\nThere are two other types of β-decay. In the electron capture, nuclei which are rich in protons capture an electron from the K or L shell. The electron vacancy is filled by another electron of the atom, which passes to occupy a lower shell emitting an X-ray or, in some cases, when the atom is in an excited state, a γ -ray (p + + e − → n + ν). In the bound-state β-decay, the emitted β-electron does not leave the atom and it is kept in a bounded orbital.",

The total kinetic energy of the electron-positron couple is equal to the photon energy, which is lower than the sum of and the rest-mass energies of the electron and the positron (1.02 MeV). These electrons and positrons act as directly ionizing radiation. As the positron continues its path, it loses its kinetic energy. As a result, they encounter an electron and destroy each other (the pair disappears). As a result of the pair production, two gamma photons come to the foreground.

This low-lying isomeric state gathers much attention since laser excitation from the ground state to the isomeric state may be possible, potentially leading to an ultraprecise nuclear clock[5]. The 229 Th nuclear clock is expected to have higher accuracy than current atomic clocks[6]. Moreover, the nuclear clock would be useful for testing fundamental physics [7] such as the measurement of the temporal variation of the fine structure constant [8]. The existence of 229m Th has been recently confirmed by the measurement of internal conversion (IC) electrons[9,10]. The excitation energy of 229m Th has been measured accurately enough to start laser excitation experiments of the 229 Th nucleus[1][2][3][4]. Moreover, the laser spectroscopy of the electronic states in 229m Th 2+ revealed nuclear properties of the isomer such as magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments[11], which are important parameters to realize the nuclear clock.The ultraprecise nuclear clock requires a narrow natural linewidth between the ground and isomeric states.

Since the energy and the direction of the scattered particles are known, the velocity and the direction of the 96 Ru recoil nucleus can be calculated. Hence, the angle between the direction of the γ-ray emission and the direction of motion of the recoil nucleus can be extracted on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, the centroid shift of the peaks in the γ-ray spectra can be determined from proton-gated spectra so that feeding from higher-lying states is eliminated. The slowing-down process of the 96 Ru recoil nuclei in the target and stopper material was modeled by means of the Monte-Carlo simulation program dstop96 [19] which is based on the code DESASTOP [21]. In total, the lifetimes of 30 excited states have been obtained, 24 of them for the first time. In the case of already existing lifetime data, our results are in excellent agreement with the previously measured ones [22,23,24] As pointed out in Sec. 1, a strong M 1 transition to the symmetric octupole state along with an E1 transition to the symmetric one-phonon quadrupole state is predicted for the mixedsymmetry octupole state in the U πν (1) ⊗ U πν (5) ⊗ U πν (7) dynamical-symmetry limit of the sdf -IBM-2 [9].

In experiments on mixed CH 4 :HNCO ices, far-UV radiation can produce a number of radicals and molecules, such as H, N, HN and CO from HNCO (Raunier et al. 2004) or CH 2 and CH 3 from CH 4 (Bossa et al. 2015).

The other low temperature setup that can simulate Titan's low temperature atmospheric chemistry is the COSmIC/THS chamber at NASA Ames. 27 The cooling mechanism of these two chambers is different for running low temperature experiments. The gas is cooled by flowing through a cooling coil in liquid nitrogen with the PHAZER chamber; 19 while the gas is cooled through free-jet supersonic expansion with the COSmIC/THS chamber. 27 Temperature is a crucial factor for atmospheric chemistry simulations because it not only determines the species available for reactions by impacting the stability and condensation of gas molecules, but also affects reaction rate constants and heterogeneous adsorption of gases onto particle surfaces. 4 In this study, we conduct a series of Titan atmosphere simulation experiments by exposing a range of N2-CH4 gas mixtures to plasma discharge at low temperature with the PHAZER chamber. Plasma discharges and UV photons are the two main energy sources used for initiating the chemistry in Titan simulation experiments. 3,4 Solar UV flux is the main driver for Titan's atmospheric chemistry, but charged particles (i.e., cosmic rays, magnetospheric protons, and electrons) also contribute to the energy inputs greatly, especially when Titan moves across the Saturnian magnetopause and is fully exposed to solar wind. 4 Plasma discharges may be able to simulate the chemistry induced by the charged particles. Moreover, the energy distribution of the plasma discharges provides a closer simulation of the solar spectrum energy distribution than that offered by UV photon sources. 4,27 Laboratory experiments with UV photons usually employ a typical Lyman alpha emission lamp 4,7,16 or EUV photons at selective wavelengths (60/82.5 nm 28 , 73.6 nm 29 , 85.6 nm 30 , and 89.2 nm 31 ).

Some hypotheses predict that H II galaxies evolve into dwarf or nondwarf spheroidal galaxies after the starburst fades (Bothun et al. 1986 ;Davies & Phillips 1988 ;). However, 21 cm neutral hydrogen observations of H II galaxies show considerable rotational support (van Zee, Skillman, & Salzer 1998) that is inconsistent with the observed stellar kinematics of most dwarf spheroidal galaxies (see review by Mateo 1998). Dwarf spheroidal galaxies also contain very little gas, requiring that H IÈrich H II galaxies either consume or lose all of their remaining gas if there is to be an evolutionary connection.\n\nKnowledge of the chemical properties of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts constitutes an additional constraint on their evolution.

We show the limits on D/H in each of these systems in Fig. 1. Two of the systems, towards Q1251+3644 and Q1759+7539 have larger uncertainties for different reasons. Q1251+3644 is a faint QSO (V=19), and over 10 hours of observing time yields a spectrum with modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 10) at high-resolution. The SNR drops quickly at lower wavelengths, and we cannot extract useful information from the highest order Lyman lines as a result. The system towards Q1759+7539 is a complex system of absorbers with a very high neutral hydrogen column density, log N(H I) > 10 19 (all column densities expressed in cm −2 ). The analysis of that system gives only an upper limit on D/H, at the 95% confidence level; the constraints are obtained from comparing the line profiles of Lyβ and Lyγ to the profile of Lyα . The method used to extract the limits on D/H will be described below. These results are preliminary, and improved constraints will require more data to allow a robust analysis. Tytler et al. (1996) made the first measurement of low D/H in the absorption system at z = 3.572 towards Q1937-1009. We analyzed the highresolution spectrum (8 hrs of exposure), which resolved the entire Lyman series up to Ly-19, as well as associated metal lines.

In these systems, most of the lines of the Lyman series have saturated (optical depth, τ > 3) line centers. We obtain spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the region shortward of the Lyman limit to independently constrain N(H I). It is possible to obtain a direct measurement of the total H I column in systems with 17 < log N(H I) < 18, 0.6 < τ LL < 6.0, where τ LL is the optical depth of Lyman continuum absorption at 912Å (rest frame). The residual flux shortward of the Lyman limit provides a direct estimate of N(H I), independent of other characteristics of the system (e.g. velocity dispersion or deuterium column density). To obtain an accurate measurement, we must account for unrelated Lyman absorption from other systems and the uncertainty of the intrinsic QSO continuum near the Lyman limit (see sec. 4.1). The majority of the Lyman absorption features can be specified by their related absorption features in high-resolution spectra (at higher wavelengths). The remaining features are statistically included from well determined Lyα forest distributions (Kirkman & Tytler 1997). The QSO continuum near the Lyman limit can be determined to better than 10% by utilizing high-resolution spectra (c.f. Burles & Tytler 1997a).

In addition to this, UV photons can also heat the gas by indirectly exciting the vibrational levels of the H2 molecule (Burton et al. 1990). As we have already mentioned, the absorption of a Lyman-Werner band photon results in photodissociation only around 15% of the time. The rest of the time, the electronically excited H2 molecule decays back to a bound ro-vibrational level in the electronic ground state. A small fraction of these decays put the molecule back in the v = 0 vibrational ground state, but in most cases, the H2 molecule is left with a considerable residual internal energy in the form of vibrational excitation. In low density gas, this energy is simply radiated away as the H2 molecule undergoes a series of radiative transitions that eventually place it back in the vibrational ground state. In dense gas, however, collisional de-excitation can be more effective than radiative de-excitation, and in this case most of this energy is redistributed as heat.\n\nThe rate at which vibrationally-excited H2 is produced -often referred to as the UV pumping rate -is related to the H2 photodissociation rate by kpump = fpumpkUV.\n\n(44)",

To investigate the possible effects of mutual shielding by these lines we note that the range of wavelengths for H2 dissociation (844.8 − 1108.5Å) fully overlaps that for the dissociation lines of N2 (914 − 980Å, van Dishoeck 1988, Carter 1972) and nearly the whole range for CN photodissociation (912 − 1133Å, peaking at 940Å). We are investigating the photochemistry well within a PDR (Av > 2) and the H2 lines will be extremely optically thick, to the extent that (a) the overlap with individual N2 lines will be extensive and (b) there will be significant blanketing of the Lyman/Werner continuum. To include these effects we therefore make the extreme assumption that N2 and CN are both fully shielded and that the effective rates of photodissociation can be set to zero. These assumptions are clearly very simplistic and will need addressing using more sophisticated radiative transfer techniques in a future study.\n\n\nShielding by Ci\n\nTo account for shielding by the Ci ionization continuum we take a more detailed and accurate approach. First of all, considering the situation when the continuum is very optically thick, the photoreaction rates are re-calculated using equations 2 and 3, but using a lower limit of 1102Å for the integral and excluding line contributions for λ < 1102Å. This implicitly assumes that the radiation field intensity is completely attenuated at these wavelengths shortwards of the Ci ionization potential; I(λ < 1102Å)=0. In Tables 1 and  2 we give the resulting shielding factors (Si), which represent the ratios of the photoreaction rates without and with the contributions from the 912 < λ < 1102Å wavelength range. Thus, in conditions where the carbon ionization continuum is very optically thick, the rate coefficient is just Si times the unshielded value. These ratios are calculated for all species/channels where cross section data is known.",

In particular optimum polarization leads to very large 2PA responses both at 970 nm (370 and 270 GM for compounds 14 and 15 respectively) and 700 nm (440 GM and 370 GM for compounds 14 and 15) while insertion of the uorenyl unit in the conjugated system leads to very large 2PA responses at 730 nm. Besides, the extension of electronic redistribution (d CT ) is detrimental to the uncaging efficiency. Hence both tuning of ICT in the groundstate and limitation of electronic redistribution upon excitation are key parameters which control the two-photon sensitivity (d u ¼ s 2 Â F u ).\n\nExtrapolated 2P uncaging sensitivities derived from previous measurements of 2PA cross-section and uncaging quantum yield are reported in Table 2. Although the nature of solvent does affect the 2PA response (vide supra), these values give consistent trends among the series of derivatives and allow direct comparison with DEAC450. For PPGs of the vinyl series 13-15, the increase in s max 2 is somewhat counterbalanced by a drop of Q rel u . Yet, in all three cases, the calculated d u values reach about 35 GM for irradiation in the higher energy band and 25-30 GM for the lowest energy band.

( 1).However, resultant improvements in detection limits are offset by an increase in noise associated with fewer photons arriving at the detector per unit time due to the accompanying reduction in light intensity transmitted through the cavity which is roughly proportional to 1 -R(λ).Sensitivity can also be improved by using a more luminous light source.This is because signal increases proportionally to the number of photons transmitted by the cavity, N, compared to the noise, which increases proportionally to √ N (when intracavity extinction is unchanged).For similar reasons, detection limits can also be improved by averaging successive measurements or by integrating the signal for longer periods on the spectrometers' CCD detector chip.Theoretically, averaging or integrating for longer times improves the signal/noise ratio by a factor of √ t where t is the averaging or integration time (t is proportional to N ).In practice, however, enhancements in detection performance gained by signal averaging or increased signal integration are often smaller than the expected factor of √ t, owing to systematic, time dependent drifts in the instrument (Werle et al., 1993).Following Langridge et al.

Figure 8 shows in the case of circumovalene C 66 H 20 that cooling by IR photon emission is 10 orders of magnitude faster than dissociation at wavelengths of maximum UV radiation. C 66 H 20 molecules bearing an internal energy close to the threshold energy (∼ 20 eV) after the successive absorption of several UV photons are found to be the most numerous to dissociate, despite their very low abundances (cf. Figure 8).\n\n\nTimescales",

The data were obtained during a whole series of measurements on low-Z ions interacting with Li [19,20], but never released. Experimental details and procedures can be found in Refs. [19,20]. The systematic absolute uncertainty in the data is some 20% mainly due to the normalization to proton data. Statistical uncertainties increase from 10% to 20% when going from the highest (5 keV/amu) to the lowest (1.5 keV/amu) energy used. We also add the CTMC line emission cross sections for the bare Li projectile as well, to visually display the differences arising from the filled K shell of the projectile. While for Li 3+ projectiles cascade contributions from higher n shells have been accounted for by using the hydrogenic transition rates [21], for B 3+ projectiles we have used the transition rates tabulated by Fuhr and Wiese [22]. There is very good agreement between the experimental data and the CTMC predictions except at the highest energies.  A more detailed inspection of the line emission cross sections can be made via the exploration of the Lyman lines (np → 1s transitions). A useful way to highlight whether capture takes place to low or large l values is by means of the hardness ratio (R) which provides the ratio of the intensity arising from the higher Lyman lines (np → 1s transitions with n ≥ 3) to the Lyman-α line (2p → 1s).",

The extraction spectra were sorted into groups corresponding to different power ranges, OPO frequencies and irradiation times. Figure 11 shows the fraction of undissociated HTyrAla + ions as a function of irradiated energy, given by the product of power and irradiation time. In this series of experiments, only HTyrAla + ions were trapped (in presence of He buffer gas), irradiated for different times and powers (at the fixed bean diameter), while the OPO wavelength was close to the central wavelength of the observed spectrum. The fraction decreases exponentially with irradiated energy, indicating that a linear process is occurring, where a one-photon process dominates. Note that the dissociation rate is very small. At a typical power of 10 mW and the beam cross section used here, it is 0.34 s −1 , much smaller than spontaneous or IVR rate (see below). Taking into account the beam cross section and correcting for the non-uniform intensity distribution of the Gaussian OPO beam, we can deduce a (peak) R-IRMPD dissociation cross section of at least σ diss,min = 1.5 · 10 −20 cm 2 under our conditions. As the buffer gas ion cloud may have had a larger diameter than the laser beam, thus reducing the effective intensity experienced by the ions, this value is a lower limit. On sympathetically cooled ions, which are all located within the OPO wave, only a few measurements of dissociation as a function of irradiation time were performed at low intensity.

Instead of using bandwidth limited sources (as e.g., in [28,69,70]), the authors of [71] measured the reaction rate for 7 different spectral bandwidths obtained by sending the illuminating light through a series of 7 long pass filters. The cutoff wavelength (the shortest wavelength at which the light can pass through) of these pass filters are, respectively, λ 1 = 400 nm, λ 2 = 425 nm, λ 3 = 450 nm, λ 4 = 500 nm, λ 5 = 550 nm, λ 6 = 625 nm and λ 7 = 675 nm (Here we denote the corresponding measured reaction rates asR(λ n )).

However, some important molecules exhibit a spectrum of narrow lines even at wavelengths as short as 100 nm. The carbon monoxide (CO) molecule has its first dissociation limit beyond 10 eV, and its spectrum in the range 80-120 nm is characterized by strongly perturbed rovibronic resonances, where virtually all lines undergo predissociation. These phenomena are of great importance for the investigation of the chemical dynamics of the interstellar medium, in particular of star-forming regions, where the photodissociation of CO is the governing dynamical process and CO is, at the same time, the coolant molecule [1]. The nitrogen molecule (N 2 ), iso-electronic to CO, has an onset of a dipole-allowed absorption spectrum at 100 nm, while its spectrum is similarly perturbed and prone to predissociation. The photoabsorption of N 2 is of great importance for the dynamics of the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere, and recently the importance of N 2 photo-predissociation for the interstellar medium is increasingly recognized [2]. The dipole-allowed absorption spectrum of molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) has its strongest lines in the Lyman and Werner bands in the wavelength range 90 − 115 nm. High-resolution spectroscopic studies and high-accuracy wavelength calibration studies of these sharp H 2 resonances has become of specific relevance for studies searching for a possible variation of the proton-electron mass ratio on a cosmological time scale [3,4].\n\nIn the domain of high-resolution studies of atoms in particular the ground state of the Helium atom has been the target of many detailed studies over decades. This two-electron system is amenable for accurate ab initio calculations including quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. The accurate determination of the ground state Lamb shift has been a driving force for the development of VUV-lasers and VUV-laser spectroscopic techniques since the first laser excitation of the first resonance line in the Helium atom [5].",

Ultraviolet photodissociation of MoO\n\nThree distinct dissociation channels are again observed, the rings for which demonstrate wavelength-dependence as indicated. The same procedure as that in Section III A was used to determine the nature of the parent molecule. Only two plausible assignments emerge: single photon dissociation of MoAr or dissociation of MoO at the two photon level. In this case, the former cannot be discounted on energetic grounds. However, assuming a likely dissociation energy of <200 cm 1 for MoAr, single-photon photolysis at these energies would leave >30 000 cm 1 in Mo* electronic excitation. The few dissociation channels observed in the VMI images (at most three clear rings are observed) are inconsistent with the high density of Mo* terms (and thus open dissociation channels) at this energy. Fitting assuming MoO dissociation is more convincing. Figure 4 shows the TKER spectra as a function of photon wavenumber assuming MoO fragmentation. Again three main series (labelled I, II, and III) can be identified and, on the basis of the match between the energetic separation of these series and those between low-lying Mo* states, the series are assigned as follows:   The different spin-orbit components of the fragment terms produced are not resolved again leading to broad TKER features. This is most significant in the case of Series III, where the 1381 cm 1 difference in wavenumber between the J = 0 and 4 levels of the a 5 D term results in a particularly broad TKER peak. By way of comparison, the narrowest individual TKER peaks observed in this study have FWHM ca. 500 cm 1 . These images therefore represent two-photon dissociation into two of the same channels involved in the three-photon dissociations in Section III A. case, the excited states accessed lie just above the MoO ionization energy.

CONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented energy-and angle-resolved experimental and theoretical results on the photoionization dynamics of N 2 , analyzing ionic-state-selective photoelectron angular distribution following NOTPSI of neutral nitrogen molecules using coincidence 3-D momentum imaging and intense 9.3 eV femtosecond pulses produced via 400 nm driven HHG. Two-photon single ionization populates the first three ionic states of the molecular nitrogen cation, where we find that the PADs associated with the X 2 Σ + g and A 2 Π u ionic states of N + 2 both vary with minor changes in the photoelectron kinetic energy. We attribute this strong variation in the electron emission patterns on the photoelectron energy to the exci- tation and decay of dipole-forbidden autoionizing resonances of different total symmetry that belong to the Hopfield series. In addition to the direct ionization channel, these continuum-embedded discrete states provide an indirect pathway to the X 2 Σ + g and A 2 Π u final states. Despite our limited theoretical treatment, only invoking a single intermediate state and hence treating the two-photon ionization as resonant, our calculations provide insight into the non-resonant two-photon ionization dynamics, highlighting the important role of the dipoleforbidden autoionizing states on shaping the PADs and resulting β parameters. Further calculations involving a larger number of intermediate states lie beyond the scope of this work, however, the computed energies of the dipole-forbidden autoionizing states are insensitive to the intermediate state chosen, which suggests that such autoionizing resonances will remain important in the non-resonant regime.",

As can be seen, the trend of the cracking efficiency curve does not change when introducing a W catalyst but the values are slightly increased. This indicates that the W surface either dissociates a part of non-cracked nitrogen from the plasma or the increase is only due to the surface consumption of nitrogen molecules or atoms. In fact, the cracking efficiency is not a direct measurement of dissociated nitrogen molecules but a parameter that presents the missing N 2 molecules in the plasma compared to the gas phase including therefore the dissociated molecules, but also adsorbed molecules on the surface. The high cracking efficiencies in plasma only (red curve) suggest then that the plasma dissociated the precursor molecules already before they come into contact with a surface. Hong et al. 14 reported that, in low-pressure plasmas (typically operating at pressures in the range from 1 Â 10 À2 mbar to several mbar), the dissociation of the gaseous precursors is provided by the energetic plasma environment so that the surfaces surrounding the plasma are bombarded with dissociated species. The direct adsorption of atoms is therefore the dominant process. Particularly, nitrogen molecules are dissociated in the gas phase through the reaction of ionized molecule in the plasma with electrons (e À + N 2 + -2N). The dissociation of the nitrogen triple bond (that requires 9.8 eV of energy) can be also caused by the photons emitted by the excited hydrogen in the plasma and specifically by the Lyman-alpha series lines at 121.6 nm (corresponding to 10.2 eV). Note here that, in thermal ammonia processes, the existence of surface defects is essential for the dissociation of nitrogen (the rate limiting step under these conditions). In particular, the authors in ref. 52 showed that only step sites are active for the N 2 dissociation. Based on the results of Fig. 3a), this condition is overcome in the case of plasma assisted ammonia catalysis. However, it would be interesting to study (either experimentally or by DFT calculations) the impact of surface defects on the ammonia formation under plasma assisted catalysis conditions, which lies beyond the scope of this study. The decrease of the cracking efficiency with increasing N 2 fraction, both with and without catalyst, can be explained by the increase of the recombination rate",

It is useful to compare similar molecules of differing size to determine whether this molecular paradigm is scalable. Molecule TMC-3 is made by increasing the length of the bridge in Molecule TMC-2. β 0 of Molecule TMC-3 is about an order of magnitude larger than Molecule TMC-2; but most importantly, the intrinsic hyperpolarizability is also larger by almost an order of magnitude. Twisted chromophores [46] are thus an example of a new scalable paradigm where larger molecules in the series take full advantage of the additional electrons.\n\nPrevious calculations that used numerical optimization to identify molecular design rules found that the best molecules have oscillating potential energy functions, which led Zhou and coworkers to suggest that modulation of conjugation may lead to improved nonlinear response. [27] Perhaps the twist in the molecule provides an effective kink in the potential energy function that leads to an enhancement. Figure 2 shows a plot of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability at the measure-ment wavelength, β int (ω, ω), and the off resonance value, β 0 /β MAX 0 , as a function of the measured hyperpolarizability, β(ω, ω). The intrinsic hyperpolarizability at the measurement wavelength, β(ω, ω), is systematically larger than β int 0 . We stress that both of these metrics of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability must be smaller than unity. Since Molecules 1-4 were measured at an incident photon energy twice that of the measurements on the twisted systems, each group needs to be considered separately since the intrinsic hyperpolarizability is being determined at a different fundamental wavelength.",

Direct excitation to the continua of higher electronic states is allowed, but requires absorption of a photon with energy larger than 14.7 eV, which is more likely to photoionise H (threshold 13.6 eV) or H 2 (threshold at 15.5 eV). Thus, direct photodissociation is very inefficient (Coppola et al., 2011). Photodissociation of H 2 mainly occurs by a two-step process (also called Solomon process): absorption of the Lyman (X 1 Σ + g → B 1 Σ + u , threshold at 11.2 eV) or Werner (X 1 Σ + g → C 1 Π u , threshold at 12.3 eV) band UV photons, followed by radiative decay into the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state (Stecher and Williams, 1967;Glover, 2007). On average, ∼ 15% of all radiative decays following absorption in the Lyman-Werner bands results in dissociation. Since the Lyman-Werner bands arising from the lowest rotational levels in the ground state comprise several hundred absorption lines between 912Å and 1100Å, the photodissociation rate of H 2 depends mainly on the intensity of the UV radiation in this wavelength range, quantified in terms of the J 21 .",

Recent studies revealed, that the surprising lack of S 0 to S 1 transition is not due to β-carotene symmetry properties as was thought for a long time, but rather it must have another physical origin, such as deformation of the molecule in the low-lying S 1 state [8]. The excited S 2 state can very quickly decay to the state S 1 (internal conversion) or to S 0 (via FRET or heat dissipation); this decay lasts 100-300 fs, on average [9]. From the state S 1 , the molecule undergoes the transition to S 0 in about 9 ps [10], also via FRET or heat dissipation. Hence, the whole process of releasing energy lasts no longer than 9.3 ps on average, but it may vary, as the excited state lifetimes are given by exponential distributions. Thereby, both the S 1 and S 2 states function as energy donors, however the transfer from the S 1 state was shown to be less favored [1]. On the other hand, a chlorophyll-a molecule, after absorbing energy from sunlight or via FRET from a βcarotene, contributes to the initial reactions of photosynthesis. An excited chlorophyll-a starts this reaction by releasing an electron and returning to the ground-state in about 10 ps [11]. Comparing with synthetic fluorescent dyes like AlexaFluor, DyLight or GFP, where excited state lifetimes are measured in nanoseconds, it is clear that photosynthetic molecules are at least 2 orders of magnitude faster in emitting their energy. It has strong implications on the possible data throughput and will be touched upon in Section 5. What is very important, a chlorophyll-a, after getting a FRET signal from a β-carotene releases exactly one electron. This electron usually activates next steps of photosynthesis, but we can implicate that it could be caught by other devices as well. Thus, molecules of chlorophyll-a can be thought of as FRET-to-electron converters.",

Information about the lifetime τ k of each vibration mode k is needed. For solids, calculation of the lifetime has been established on the basis of perturbation theory. 53 For liquids, the effect of lifetime is so large that the perturbatic treatment is inappropriate. Direct application of the fluctuation-dissipation relation can provide a calculation method for susceptibility without knowing {τ k }. 54 But, in the present implementation, it is unclear how the contribution of the structural energy is coped in the formula.\n\nThe above difficulties can be solved, at one stroke, by adiabatic MD simulations based on the total-energy approach. We do not need to know lifetimes {τ k } but only their consequences on the equilibrium states are sufficient for calculating specific heat. The maximumentropy principle guarantees that entropy S is uniquely determined by a given U when equilibrium is established under given constraints, from which T is uniquely determined by T = ∂U/∂S. The total energy E tot is conserved in adiabatic MD simulation. Accordingly, an infinite number of energy-dissipation processes finally lead the system to the unique state of equilibrium with T eq , which may be different from the initial temperature. All the effects of energy dissipation processes are included in the relation between the total internal energy U and the final temperature T eq in equilibrium, whatever energy dissipation processes are complicated. In this regards, use of adiabatic MD simulations is essential. When the temperature is controlled by introducing a heat bath, such as Nosé-Hoover thermostat, energy dissipations to the artificial heat bath destroy the intrinsic relationship between U and T , which is a property of a given material. In this respect, the present method is easy, because neither T nor V is needed to control.\n\n\nB.

While our simulations of excited-state absorption spectra do not indicate any clear absorption features for the S 1 (n S π*) of thioC, the minor transient absorption band at 345 nm might originate from partial population of another T 1 ( 3 ππ CS * ) minimum with the CS bond elongated and tilted out of the plane of the aromatic ring (S-oop in Figure 3c). Therefore, in contrast to the nucleoside, thioC base exhibits typical equilibrium between the ring-puckered and S out-of-plane (S-oop) T 1 minima, which was also reported for thionated uracil bases. 21 To evaluate the excited-state lifetimes of the nucleobase and nucleoside in a more accurate manner, we performed global fitting of excited-state decays in our time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy experiments within the entire range of our visible probe pulse (330−600 nm). This fitting procedure returned global excited-state lifetimes of 7.1 ± 1.4 ns for thioC and 1.5 ± 0.2 ns for β-thioCyd, thus confirming the observations for specific wavelengths discussed above. Most importantly, thioC exhibits a nearly 5 times longer excitedstate lifetime than its nucleoside, thioCyd. It is noteworthy that the opposite trend was observed in time-resolved studies of canonical RNA building blocks, for which pyrimidine ribonucleosides exhibited several times longer excited-state lifetimes than their respective nucleobases. 50 Here, we assign this surprising trend to the dominant population of longerlived 3 ππ ring * state in thioC.

Also the respective bit error rates (30-50%) are highly non satisfactory for telecommunication purposes. A solution for this (other than exciting the donor multiple times per bit, what however decreases the corresponding data throughput [25]) might lie in exploiting full MIMO communication, i.e. to excite all the donor dyes simultaneously. It might be realized with a very strong external laser impulse or using the energy of a local chemical reaction, in this latter case it is called Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer. The receiver decodes the bit as '1' if any of acceptors is excited, i.e. if at least one donor transfers its excitation energy to at least one acceptor. If no acceptors are excited, the bit is decoded as '0'. For the proper data transmission, it is crucial to correctly choose the rate (frequency) of sending bits. Obviously, from the telecommunication point of view the higher rate the better, but the FRET and fluorescence delays are going to put the limits here. As documented in Table II and Fig. 4, with average fluorescence lifetimes of about 1-2 ns, almost all excited molecules will go back to the ground state after 15-20 ns. Since we do not know the exact FRET rate between fluorophores in our experiments, we have to assume that the energy transfer can occur in any time between a few to about 20 ns, i.e. as long as we observe photons after a single laser pulse. Additionally, we should take into account the relaxation time of the acceptor molecule. When the acceptor is excited, it cannot receive another signal from the donor 3 . Thus, the acceptor should first pass the signal via another FRET to other molecules or emit a photon. It adds another 20 ns to the total delay of the signal transfer. Consequently, in this case the transmission rate should not exceed 1 bit per 40 ns, i.e. 25 Mbit/s.

[42,43] The first singlet excited state (S 1 ) of these dyes decays mainly through a non-radiative channel involving a torsional motion of the phenyl rings. The S 1 lifetime depends strongly on the viscosity of the environment. For instance, the S 1 lifetime of MG amounts to 550 fs in bulk water and to 1.1 ps at the air-water interface. [42] This shows that the friction exerted by interfacial water is substantially larger than that experienced in bulk water. Similar experiments have also been performed at alkane-(water-glycerol) interfaces. [43,44] Information on other interfacial properties can be obtained by performing TRSSHG measurements with appropriate probe molecules. For example, the excitedstate lifetime of Eosin B has been found to strongly depend on its ability to form hydrogen bonds with surrounding solvent molecules.

In order to find out which coordinate is responsible for this decay, the viscosity dependence of the S 1 state lifetime of this dye at liquid-liquid interfaces has been studied. Whereas the lifetime is independent of the viscosity of the polar phase, a substantial viscosity dependence of the nonpolar phase has been measured, indicating the involvement of a mode localised in the apolar part of the molecule.

Consequently, the major structural features of these pigments have been systematically examined as to how they influence the S 1 state energy, lifetimes, quantum yields, and pigment photostability. In particular, the effects of the macrocyclic π-electron system, central metal ion (CMI), peripheral substituents, and pigment aggregation, on these critical parameters are discussed. The results obtained confirm that the π-electron system of the chromophore has the greatest influence on the light energy conversion capacity of porphyrinoids. Its modifications lead to changes in molecular symmetry, which determine the energy levels of frontier orbitals and hence affect the S 1 state properties.

One may consider intersystem crossing, but it has been shown experimentally through quenching with various triplet-state quenchers that the photorearrangement does not proceed in the T 1 state, 4 and we can confirm this computationally (vide infra). Moreover, when benzene is excited to the S 2 state, Dewar benzene is formed in addition to benzvalene and fulvene. 23 Hence, one can conclude that an S 1 -state process is likely. In this state, benzene either becomes protonated to form a benzenium cation that rearranges to the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenium cation 3 (pathway A, Scheme 2), or rearranges to benzvalene 4 45 via the prefulvenic transition state 5 and an S 1 /S 0 conical intersection (pathway B). 46 Both mechanistic pathways involve relief of the S 1 -state antiaromatic character of benzene, but in different ways. Many pieces of evidence have been acquired for pathway A 31,32 and pathway B, 24,33 but no previous study has unambiguously confirmed one mechanism over the other. With regard to ESAA relief, any pathway that allows for disruption of the 6πelectron cycle which is antiaromatic in S 1 will provide for such relief. Which pathway is followed depends on (i) the excitedstate lifetime of S 1 -state benzene, as this determines the effective concentration of the reactive S 1 -state benzene, (ii) the concentration and strength of the acid, and (iii) the activation barriers for the different reaction steps. Thus, ESAA relief combined with other factors (concentrations and excited-state lifetimes) impacts which mechanism is followed. Further factors that can have an impact are the energy penalty for distortion of the σ-framework from the hexagon, which is ideal for sp 2 -hybridized C atoms, and the ability of substituents to reduce the antiaromaticity of a benzene ring in its S 1 state, similar to what was recently found for the T 1 -state antiaromaticity. 47",

The interpretation of these lifetimes requires a model of energy transfer in the thylakoid membrane. Gilmore et al. (1995) fit data from thylakoids with and without qE to lifetime distributions centered at 400 ps and 2 ns. The amplitude of the 400 ps component was larger in the ''qE on'' state than in the ''qE off'' state. Because the lifetimes were conserved between the thylakoids in the two states, the lifetimes were interpreted as ''puddles'' of PSIIs that cannot transfer energy to one another. Within a puddle, energy transfer was assumed to occur much faster than any of the decay processes. The faster 400 ps component was attributed to PSIIs that had access to a qE site and was the first assignment of an excited state lifetime for qE. However, the measurement and model were not able to extract detailed information about the energy transfer network with qE on, such as the location(s) of quenching sites.\n\nUnderstanding the energy transfer network with qE on requires a mathematical framework that incorporates that information.

These values can be compared to those given by Martsinovich and Troisi. 2 They adopted a\n\nHamiltonian-partitioning technique to compute the coupling elements between the molecule and substrate, and from that to obtain the lifetime for the LUMO state (taken as a whole). Their value, 0.68 ± 0.41 fs, corresponds to Γ ≈ 1 eV which is consistent with the splitting between the LUMO components that we report in Fig. 2. Therefore, our calculation confirms a strong interaction between the isonicotinic acid and the TiO 2 substrate as that reported by Martsinovich and Troisi.",

The background pressure of our vacuum chamber and the blackbody excitation rate of the rovibrational transitions both support a lifetime longer than a few tens of seconds. The light scattering by the trapping beam should also be fairly weak, and we do not expect it to limit the lifetime below 10 s. The lifetime could be limited by inelastic molecule-molecule and atom-molecule collisions. If the rovibrational ground state 40 K 87 Rb molecules are created in a single hyperfine state, then the Fermi nature of these molecules will preclude their collisions at this ultracold temperature. A possible loss mechanism is the collision of a K atom with a KRb molecule, resulting in a chemical reaction producing a K 2 molecule and a Rb atom. The potential minimum of K 2 molecules [38] is located below that of KRb [37], so that this process is energetically allowed. By removing most of the K atoms, we have measured a typical lifetime of τ = 70(8) ms for the ground-state polar molecules sitting in the optical dipole trap. Figure 6 shows one such measurement. When we purposely allow K atoms to remain in the same optical trap and when their number is similar to that of the KRb molecules, we observe a decrease of the trap lifetime to below 10 ms. On the other hand, the potential minimum of the Rb 2 molecules is above that of KRb, and introducing Rb atoms to the trapped KRb molecules does not seem to affect the trap lifetime. At this time, we are still searching for the reason behind the 70 ms limit for the lifetime. Planned measurements in the future include the purification of the KRb sample to a single hyperfine state to prevent possible KRb-KRb collisions and the measurement of incoherent scattering of ground-state molecules due to the trapping light.\n\n\nV.

This may be partially explained by comparing the excitation and emission ESTMs in Figure 4A,B, respectively. The emission ESTM indicates a higher sensitivity of the emission energy compared to the absorption. However, to determine if we can reproduce this effect in the QM/MM calculations, we repeated the ASEC-FEG calculations for both iLOV and iLOV-Q430E using the charges and gradient of the S 1 excited state of flavin instead of the S 0 ground state. We computed the S 1 − S 0 vertical emission energy at the excitedstate S 1 geometry. Note that, due to the use of excited-state charges for the flavin during the MD calculations, the protein adapts to the excited-state charge distribution. The 5 ns MD calculations have a similar time scale as a typical fluorescence lifetime, reflecting the time that the protein takes to rearrange around the excited-state configuration. In this case, it took slightly longer to achieve self-consistency of the ASEC-FEG calculations, so the first three steps were discarded and the excitation energy was averaged over the next four ASEC-FEG steps. The ASEC-FEG calculations indicate that iLOV-Q430E has a ca. 9 nm red-shifted vertical emission wavelength compared to iLOV (Table S3). Inspecting the MD simulations revealed that, on average, the E430 moves closer to the flavin in the excited state than in the ground state. The average distance between flavin's N1 atom and the C atom of the sidechain carboxylate ion is 8.4 Å for the excited state, compared to 8.9 Å in the ground-state geometry (E430 abs and E430 fl in Figure 6). Therefore, the more significant Stokes shift in iLOV-Q430E compared to that in iLOV can be attributed to two factors. One is electronic, since the ESTM already shows a higher sensitivity of flavin's S 0 − S 1 energy difference to charges near the N1 atom after flavin relaxes on its S 1 potential energy surface to the fluorescence minimum ( Figure 4). The second effect comes from the protein rearrangement; the deprotonated E430 is less repelled by the flavin excited state than the ground state and moves slightly closer,",

The quantum yield of fluorescence Φ fl is the number of photons emitted by S 1 in a given period of time divided by the number of absorbed photons in the same period; it can be calculated with Equation (3). Similarly, the phosphorescence quantum yield Φ ph (ratio between the number of photons emitted by T 1 and the number of absorbed photons) and the photoreaction quantum yields Φ cr and Φ′ cr (ratio between the number of transformed molecules and the number of absorbed photons) are given by Equation (4), Equation (5) and Equation (6).

The most important kinds of interactions in an encounter are those leading to energy transfer, electron transfer, and chemical reaction. Due to the occurrence of these processes, the intrinsic properties of *X are quenched; energy transfer also causes the sensitization of the excited state properties of Y.

Differently, for e + BeO we obtain -89.6642(5) hartree for Be + and PsO, and -89.7208 (4) hartree for e + Be and O, so that the most stable dissociation fragments present a positron-atom bound state. Using the lowest energy dissociation threshold for the two systems one gets a DE of 0.080(1) hartree for e + LiF, and 0.090(2) hartree for e + BeO. Both these values are larger than the APA, and this fact means that the two positron-molecule complexes do not dissociate after positron addition to the parent molecules.

To be specific we consider D adsorbed on Si(100). The D-Si bending mode of frequency 458 cm −1 has a lifetime of around 210 fs [38]. Using the data of [39], its radiative lifetime can be estimated to be 0.99 s. Choosing a standard molecule with a frequency of 500 cm −1 and a lifetime of 1 s in the vicinity of the surface, the coupling W[cm −1 ] = 296/R 3 [Å] 3 results. At R = 1 nm the lifetime of this molecule reduces due to the energy transfer from 1s to τ eff = 4.6 ns in spite of the detuning = 42 cm −1 . In another scenario, the long-lived molecule could also be an adsorbed molecule which is physisorbed and not chemisorbed to the surface of the solid and hence will have much weaker vibration-phonon coupling and thus maintain its long-lifetime.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, there is efficient vibrational energy transfer between a vibrationally excited long-lived molecule and a neighbour which would be short-lived when excited. The two molecules can be considerably off-resonance and still have a substantial transfer effect. Because of the generality of the effect, many applications are possible. Two remarks are in order. If the long-lived molecule has several short-lived neighbours, the effective lifetime will reduce further. For N equivalent neighbours, τ eff → τ eff /N, see [18]. The neighbour does not have to initially be in its ground state, it could also be in an excited long-lived state and be transferred by the effect discussed here to a higher excited short-lived level.\n\nCONTACT\nLorenz S.

Alternatively, in a competing process, the molecule in the T 1 state can interact with molecular oxygen in the ground triplet state via collisional quenching.

For smaller wavelengths, decay of phonons increases, and is commonly seen as widening of the intensity of the dynamic structure factor in either ω or k. For smallest wavelengths comparable to interatomic separations, the effective phonon lifetime can become smaller than the inverse frequency. For this reason, we might wonder to what extent we can talk about high-frequency excitations in liquids and glasses. Indeed, textbooks and recent research papers state that the concept of phonons or phonon-like modes in liquids is either questionable 10 or not well-defined due to strong damping. 11 Our analysis below shows that this is not the case.

Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

For the other explosive considered, NB, our calculations predict that the majority of the explosive will be present in the free form and the case for static versus dynamic quenching is less clear based on the stability constants and the percentage of explosives complexed alone. However, when taking into account that the dynamic Stern− Volmer quenching constant is the product of the quenching rate constant and the inherent fluorescence lifetime of the cage and the fact that the latter is very small (∼10 ns experimentally, 50−170 ns from static TD-DFT calculations, see above), the lack of dynamic quenching for NB might be related to this short fluorescence lifetime. Another contributing factor might be that NB has the smallest electron affinity of all explosives and thus the smallest driving force for photoinduced electron transfer, which, in the framework of Marcus theory, suggests that it might also have a relatively small rate constant for electron transfer. Assuming, following Kasha, rapid energy transfer from higher excited states to the lowest excited state, the photophysical mechanism of static quenching in the host−guest complex is predicted in all cases to be due to electron transfer rather than energy transfer; i.e. the lowest excited state of the analytesensor host−guest complex has charge-transfer character. Free conjugate base anions of the acid explosives, e.g., picrate, can quench the cage fluorescence through FRET/DET. However, when adsorbed, PET dominates because the attractive electrostatic interaction between electron and hole stabilizes charge-transfer states relative to local excited states. Hence in contrast to Acharyya and Mukherjee, we do not believe that FRET/DET at close proximity explains the \"super-quenching ability of PA\" for the amine cage.",

However, it is not only the lifetime of the photoactive excited state that matters and other properties need to be taken into account as well: ground-and excited state redox potentials need to be of suitable kind to drive the desired process after photoexcitation and allow recovery of the original oxidation state by redox mediators or sacrificial agents. For solar-energy conversion purposes, a broad absorption range and high attenuation coefficients are desirable. Yet, some of these properties are rather influenced collaterally than being rationally designed. While the CT excited state lifetime has been significantly increased, some of the presented compounds have comparably low extinction coefficients (<5000 M −1 cm −1 ) and/or narrow absorption windows, which is not ideal for energy conversion applications. Furthermore, strongly shifted potentials for the Fe(III/II) couple have been observed, which could for instance impede their use with certain redox mediators in DSSCs or lead to oxidation of the complex to Fe(III) under ambient conditions which in turn fundamentally changes the photophysical properties of these compounds, in a favorable or non-favorable direction, depending on application. Therefore, the design of new generations of ligands needs not only to address destabilization of the e g * orbitals that correlate to the MC states but also stabilization of t 2g orbitals to keep the ground state redox potential in a reasonable range.

Most studies in this review address ICD of excited cationic states created in some ionization process starting from a system in its neutral ground state. Including this primary process, roughly twice the ionization energy of the neutral system must be deposited into a single site to initiate ICD. In most studies presented below, single photon absorption of short wavelength electromagnetic radiation or impact of a charged particle beam were used as an excitation source. Further details are given in the next subsection (Section 4.1). Modifications to the ICD process due to absorption of multiple photons within the ICD lifetime will also be discussed (Section 5.7.1). ICD in anionic systems, which would require less excitation energy per event, so far was only studied theoretically, and could be an important future perspective. 120, 239,240 Detection Methods: Some experimental signatures of ICD are sketched in Figure 8. The excitation mechanism, the first step, is drawn as a photoionization process here, but ICD occurs also after other types of excitation, as long as they deposit a sufficient amount of electronic energy in the system. In the IC decay, a secondary electron in the continuum is produced; two cations, often on neighboring sites, are left behind. Direct detection of the secondary electron has been shown in a lot of experiments. The Coulomb repulsion in the final state leads to a nuclear dynamics (in most cases a violent fragmentation), which also is a clear indicator for the occurrence of ICD. The lifetime of the ionized excited state is finite due to its decay by ICD. According to the energy-time uncertainty relation, a broadening of the excited state in the energy domain is therefore induced. In the absence of other (fast) decay channels, and if the excited state is produced by photoionization, this width can be directly read as a Lorentzian broadening of the respective photoelectron line. Additionally to the mechanisms shown in the figure, after resonant ICD, the final state may also be detected by its fluorescence decay.",

The basic argument is that molecular dynamics (MD) publications show that a basic assumption of the traditional model is invalid, and in addition shows many examples of lipidic pores vanishing with a ∼100 ns lifetime. This has a major implication. For example, if there are ∼ 10 6 pores during a pulse, within about 2 µs after pulsing the probable number of pores is ∼0.001 (essentially zero). 8 Important MD examples include an illustrative progression of pore structures leading to pore destruction, 9 an associated pore energy landscape as a function of pore radius that shows a negligible barrier at all to pore destruction 10 and an exponential decay fit to a series of pore closures (destructions) that supports a ∼100 ns lifetime. 11 The concept of complex cell membrane pores In Figure 1 we show an initial, incomplete picture of a broad lifetime distribution that we propose for cell membrane pores created by large physical perturbations.

We advocate the direct solution of the nuclear motion Schrödinger equation; this methodology is sufficient to obtain quantitative answers. However, the current state-of-the-art in electronic structure methodologies is not. Indeed the predictions of what are considered high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations are so poor that even the correct ordering of the electronic states is hard to predict in many cases let alone the precise details required for spectroscopy.\n\nGiven this situation, experimental data will be required for the foreseeable future to help tune spectroscopic models for transition metal containing systems. In this context, the measurement of a large number of vibronic bands, rather than very high precision analysis of the rotational structure of a smaller number of bands is particularly useful. This can be best achieved in experimental conditions that lead to rotationally cold but vibrational hot transitions. Similarly, there are rather few absolute intensity measurements for open-shell transition-metal-containing systems, however radiative lifetime measurements are equally useful for testing computed Einstein-A coefficients and appear to easier to perform. New lifetime measurements for a range of systems would be very helpful.\n\nFinally, if anyone is still under the illusion that ab initio description of transition metal-containing diatomics is simple, we suggest that they look at the potential energy curves of FeO as given in Fig. 1 of Sakellaris et al.

[40][41][42][43] Implemented with gradient-based unconstrained optimization algorithms, this approach has been shown to be a more robust strategy for converging ground states with DFT than SCF-based methodologies. 40,44,45 However, the risk of variational collapse impedes straightforward application of DO methods for locating saddle points of the energy surface. One way of circumventing this problem is to convert the saddle-point optimization to a minimization of the squared norm of the gradient of the energy with respect to the electronic degrees of freedom. 21 Variational collapse is avoided by squared gradient minimization but there is a series of drawbacks that have to be considered. First, the computational cost is increased with respect to ground-state calculations, because the gradient of the squared norm of the gradient is needed. Furthermore, this strategy requires more iterations than SCF-MOM (when convergence can be reached), 21 because squared gradient minimization is less well conditioned than energy minimization. 21,46 Lastly, this approach can converge on points where the squared norm of the gradient has a minimum but is not zero. The initial guess, therefore, needs to be sufficiently good. 21 When the above-mentioned practical issues have not represented a problem, excitedstate calculations using KS functionals have given more accurate results than linear-response TDDFT for a number of challenging excited states. These include doubly excited states, 21,23 core excitations, 20 Rydberg 15,21 and charge-transfer 23,26,34,47 transitions, absorption spectra 48 and structural dynamics 24,49 in solution, including nonadiabatic dynamics 19,22,33 .

The same basic behavior is observed regardless of the heteroatom atomic mass: rapid internal conversion 1Bu → 2Ag following band-edge excitation, which under excess-energy excitation competes with the formation of short-lived TT states. Within the limits of the instrument used, the rates of these processes are scarcely affected; the similar relative weight for all polymers of \"additional\" excited-state absorption following excess-energy excitation confirms that the rates must be similar. This is not surprising for such a fast singlet fission system. Taking a typical 1 ns time scale for a process mediated by spinorbit coupling, the heavy-atom effect should accelerate that at most to ∼27 ps for P3SV and ∼4 ps for P3TeV, still orders of magnitude slower than 2Ag formation or singlet fission. We note that in principle the TT and 2Ag states may exhibit a more complex relationship than we have suggested here, for instance existing in dynamic equilibrium as has been proposed between S 1 and TT in some covalent dimers. 18 That can be directly ruled out in P3TV based on the large energetic difference between TT and S 1 (∼1 eV, see above), but the similarity in decay lifetime and uncertainty in state energies in P3SV and P3TeV mean that currently there remains a possibility in the new materials. Similarly, we cannot entirely rule out that excess-energy excitation populates a highly vibrationally excited region of the 2Ag surface that is susceptible of singlet fission. If the rate-limiting step is the 1Bu → \"hot\" 2Ag internal conversion rather than \"hot\" 2Ag → TT, then these measurements-even the sub-20-fs experiments in our previous work-would be unable to distinguish these pathways.

We studied water structuration using sensitizer triplet lifetime τ T . Triplet lifetime is dependent on media and water structuration has a noticeable effect on this parameter. Rose Bengal is a dye commonly used to produce singlet oxygen, O 2 ( 1 Δ g ). Singlet oxygen is an excited specie of molecular oxygen that cannot be generated by direct absorption of electromagnetic radiation, it must receive the required excitation energy from another excited molecule, usually called dye or sensitizer. The excited state lifetime of the sensitizer is dependent on the media, and water structuration has a noticeable effect on its value. The excitation process of photosensitization, involves at least two processes: photosensitizer excitation (to its singlet or triplet excited states), followed by energy transfer to molecular oxygen at ground state. If the lifetime of the first singlet excited state of the dye is long (in the order of 20ns), molecular oxygen can favor intersystem crossing to the triplet state of sensitizer (yielding also singlet oxygen). Triplet excited states, with longer lifetimes, are more prone to interact with molecular oxygen and the generation of O 2 ( 1 Δ g ) is favored. On the other side, if the lifetime of the excited singlet state is too short (in the order of nanoseconds) or the energy gap between triplet and singlet is smaller than the O 2 ( 1 Δ g ) energy, photosensitization will involve only the triplet states of the sensitizer.

Excited vibrational molecular levels in the electronic ground state decay rather slowly radiatively, their radiative lifetime is typically in the range of seconds to milliseconds [1], see also [2]. In contrast, fast non-radiative lifetimes in the range of pico-and even femtoseconds have been reported for even small polyatomic molecules [3][4][5].

When interband thermalization is efficient, we find that the lifetime has a minimum at intermediate temperatures, with optical recombination becoming slower both at very low and very high temperature. This unusual behavior occurs because the lowest-energy excitons are optically forbidden by symmetry [12,14]. We report the energy differences between singlet and triplet excitons of different symmetries, for a range of nanotube diameters. We also present the resulting temperature dependences of the radiative lifetime. Both the energies and temperature dependences are well described by simple scaling formulas. The optically allowed band has a non-analytic dispersion due to exchange, while the other bands have a mass enhancement of ∼50% over free electron-hole pairs. We find that symmetry plays a special role in this system. For photoluminescence of an ideal nanotube (and neglecting spin-orbit coupling), phonons cannot scatter excitons into the optically forbidden low-energy states, so optical emission is very efficient. However, extrinsic effects that break the ideal symmetry can qualitatively change the behavior, especially at low temperature. Such effects can also lead to multiple peaks in emission spectra with characteristic temperature dependence, perhaps explaining experimental observations [15,16].\n\nThe quantum efficiency η of light emission corresponds to the fraction of excitons decaying by radiative channels: η = τ nr /(τ r + τ nr ), where τ r and τ nr are the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes. The total decay rate (i.e. in-\nverse lifetime) is τ −1 tot = τ −1 r + τ −1 nr .\nIt has been measured [17,18,19,20,21], and environmental effects have been recently published [22]. But only one measurement of radiative lifetime has been reported [20].\n\nA photoexcited state has total momentum q = q(photon), hereafter approximated as q = 0. It is rapidly scattered by phonons into a different state with q = 0 [13], and cannot decay directly. Therefore what is relevant is not the lifetime of a specific excitonic state, but rather the lifetime of an exciton as it scatters from one state to another. If thermalization is inefficient, then the lifetime depends on the details of the excitation process and subsequent scattering pathways.",

The other is the 41-degree forward neutron beam line which is reserved and can be constructed in the future. In this paper, we will calculate the neutron spectra using the latest FLUKA and evaluate the fidelity of CSNS neutron spectra for SEE accelerated experiments.  \n\n\nWhite neutron beams at CSNS\n\n\n1) Spallation target structure and white beam lines at CSNS",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

After the production in a volume-type ion source, the protons are transported via the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) section which ends in a chopper device to impose a suitable time structure on the beam for the further processing. The acceleration to an energy of E p = 2 MeV is realized with a combination of RFQ and IH structure. This solution is very space saving and can handle the aspired high intensities up to beam currents of 20 mA. After this acceleration, a CH rebuncher is foreseen to tune the beam energy without losses in intensity within ±10% to allow a specific modulation of the energy spectrum of the produced neutron beam. At the FRANZ facility, different intensities of the neutron beam will be available. Using a fast calorimeter [4] at the experimental position labeled (a) in Fig. 1, the time-of-flight (TOF) technique provides the energy of the neutrons in an in-beam experiment. The bunch compressor samples nine of the proton bunches provided by the accelerating structures at the neutronproduction target. Therefore, the lithium target deals with a proton beam of a mean current of 2 mA but with a very pronounced time structure: bunches with a length of 1 ns are repeated with a rate of 250 kHz and contain a current of 8 A. The resulting neutron beam has the world's highest intensity of 10 7 neutrons s −1 cm −2 .  For the activation technique realized at position (b) in Fig. 1, the proton beam need not to be shaped by the bunch compressor. Hence, the beam is used in the quasi-continuous wave mode as provided by the accelerating structures. Mean currents of up to 20 mA provide a neutron beam in the keV energy-range with intensities of up to 10 12 neutrons s −1 . Position (c) in Fig. 1 is dedicated to the investigation of proton-induced reactions.

The lithium is evaporated as a thin layer on a backing material with high thermal conductivity, e.g., copper. In a prototype design (compare Fig. 3 and [7]), the copper backing is 1 mm thick and a µm layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) or lithium oxide (Li 2 O) serves as neutron converter target. The melting temperatures of LiF and Li 2 O are T M = 1118.15 K and T M = 1843.15 K, respectively, exceeding the one of metallic lithium (T M = 453.69 K) by far [8]. As the loss of neutron conversion due to the stoichiometry remains small and the spectral composition of the neutrons remains shapeable by the thickness of the lithium layer, these chemical compounds might be a good alternative compared to a liquid lithium target [9]. A primary cooling of high-pressure water-flow carries away the heat from the power deposited by the proton beam. To avoid modulation of the neutron spectrum towards lower energies, the water layer is restricted to a thickness of 0.2 mm. A secondary cooling circle prevents the mounting structure from heating. First tests at IRMM, Geel, Belgium, proved the vacuum-tightness and water-proofness of the prototype. In addition, the influence of the water cooling on the neutron spectrum was examined [7]. The high intensities of both the neutron and proton beams allow the investigation of reactions with very low yields as in the case of a radioactive probes [1].

NC can also provide detailed information on the hydration of biomacromolecules, including the exact orientation and coordination of water molecules. In addition to providing structural information, NC can be used to identify H atoms that can be exchanged with deuterium and the extent of this replacement, thus providing a tool for the study of protein dynamics, complementary to NMR techniques.\n\nThe Protein Crystallography Station (PCS) is the first NC beamline to be built at a spallation source . Neutrons are produced from a coupled high-flux water moderator (Schoenborn et al., 1999), in pulses at a rate of 20 Hz, and then travel 28 m down a vacuum pipe with collimation inserts tapering the beam to a final divergence, at the sample position, of 0.12 . The time and energy structure of the beam, and also its relatively small divergence, allow data to be collected efficiently and with enhanced signal-to-noise with time-of-flight (wavelength-resolved) Laue techniques . The data are recorded as three-dimensional time-offlight Laue patterns on a large position-sensitive electronic detector with a spatial resolution of less than a millimetre (Mahler et al., 1998). The PCS is run as a user facility with open access to beam time, protein deuteration, expression and robotic crystallization facilities, the synthesis of substrates with stable isotopes, structure refinement software, and support for data reduction and structure analysis.

Advanced facilities that have developed for macromolecular deuteration now permit the production of suitably labelled protein crystals on a routine and reliable basis 16 . It should be noted that this method may provide a useful complement to X-ray anomalous phasing approaches -particularly where structure determination at room or physiological temperature is advantageous 25 . In the current study the anomalous scatterer was introduced in the metal chelating site using chemical reagents to remove the native iron prior to isomorphous replacement with the 113 Cd isotope. In future studies one can envisage the soaking of anomalous scatterers into macromolecular crystals in a way that is routinely used in X-ray diffraction studies (see for example 26 and references therein). Anomalous protein phasing work using X-rays can be delicate when carried out at room temperature, and neutron approaches, for which radiation damage effects are essentially negligible, provide a way of tackling these problems. Experiments close to physiological temperatures can highlight structural differences induced by cryo-cooling, and which may be more representative of in vivo structures and their resulting functionalities. This is reflected in the recent upsurge of interest in room temperature structures stimulated by FEL studies, including the work of Lui et al. who determined a GPCR crystal structure at room temperature 27 . This structure showed distinct thermal motions and residue conformations different to the cryo-cooled structure. The confluence of new spallation neutron sources, high-performance detectors and ready access to perdeutered proteins is paving the way to practical perspectives for neutron phasing methods. The impact of this approach is likely to be greatly enhanced by the fact that time-of-flight measurement at spallation neutron sources will, in a single experiment, provide diffraction data over the whole wavelength range accessible to a given instrument. Plots of the real (b') and imaginary (b\") components of the neutron scattering length for selected isotopes are provided in Fig. 3, highlighting the availability of an anomalous signal across neutron wavelength ranges. This offers key advantages given that anomalous differences will de facto be available over a wide wavelength range encompassing the resonance energies of isotopes that are relevant for the study of biological crystals.",

The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section.

The measured energy structure of the beam agrees qualitatively with both previous measurements and theoretical calculations.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFast neutrons are important probes of matter and diagnostic tools [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14].\n\nSources of fast neutrons for controlled irradiations include nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, and radioactive sources. Drawbacks associated with nuclear reactors and particle accelerators include their accessibility and availability, as well as the very high cost per neutron. In contrast, radioactive sources provide neutrons with a substantially lower cost per neutron. Drawbacks associated with radioactive sources include the complex mixed field of radioactive decay products which complicate the experimental situation. As a first step towards developing a source-based fast-neutron irradiation facility, we have employed well-understood shielding, coincidence, and time-of-flight (TOF) measurement techniques to attenuate and subsequently unfold the mixed decay-product radiation field provided by an 241 Am/ 9 Be (hereafter referred to as Am/Be) source, resulting in a polychromatic energy-tagged neutron beam.\n\n\nApparatus\n\n\nAm/Be source\n\nThe heart of the irradiation facility consists of a (nominal) 18.5 GBq Am/Be radioactive source [15]. This source is a mixture of americium oxide and beryllium metal contained in an X.3 capsule 2 (see Fig. 1).\n\nRadioactive 241 Am has a half-life of 432.2 years and decays via α emission (5 different energies averaging ∼5.5 MeV) to 237 Np. The dominant energy of the resulting background gamma-rays from the decay of the intermediate excited states in 237 Np is ∼60 keV. 237 Np has a half-life of over 2 million years. 9 Be is stable.\n\nFast neutrons are produced when the decay α particles interact with 9 Be.",

For many system designs, and especially for highenergy, high beam-current applications, an important design factor is the neutron spectrum emitted from the ADS target.

The collimator is used for focusing the beam, and can be used as secondary safety equipment. It is one of the parts not currently being used but planned for the future.

The experiments were performed at ambient pressure and temperature. Using the D3 instrument with 0.5 Å wavelength neutrons [17,18], scattering intensities have been collected in both spin-flip and non-spin-flip modes over a uniquely wide momentum transfer range of 0.8-21 Å −1 (4-120 degrees in 2Θ). The hot neutron source of the Institut Laue-Langevin can provide a high flux of such short wavelength neutrons, which is the pre-requisite for studies like reported here. This outstanding coverage of the reciprocal space can be realized by making use of a Heussler-alloy polarizer and a 3 He analyzer cell that contains spin-polarized nuclei [19].

The DAE performed the time 6   stamping of these events and incremented the corresponding bin in the ToF histogram associated with this GEM pad, thereby creating a ToF spectrum S i (t) for each BAND-GEM pad. The bin width applied by DAE for ToF spectra reconstruction is 100 μs. Given that neutrons can travel up to about 96 mm in the 3D converter system, it is important to verify that the time spent by the neutron before being captured has a negligible effect on the ToF measurement. An error on the ToF measurement induces a wrong reconstruction of the neutron wavelength. Once captured, the delay introduced by the drift of the primary electrons (coming from charged neutron product ionization) in the 3D converter system can be considered negligible since the average electron velocity inside the 3D converter system is about 7 cm/μs [49], which is much higher than the velocity of incoming neutrons. The range of neutron velocity on EMMA is approximately between v 1 = 3950 m/s (λ = 1 · 10 −10 m) and v 2 = 990 m/s (λ = 4 · 10 −10 m). Neutrons with such velocities can introduce a delay up to 25 μs and 100 μs, respectively. Since this delay is comparable with the bin width used by the DAE, it may introduce a maximum absolute error on neutron wavelength determination that is less than 0.025 · 10 −10 m. The signal from the reference EMMA beam monitor was also routed to the",

One way of probing nuclear structure quantitatively is the application of nuclear reactions that selectively probe specific degrees of freedom, e.g. single-particle or collective degrees of freedom. Coulomb excitation of nuclei has long been used to investigate collectivity. Intriguing possibilities arise along isotonic and isotopic chains of nuclei where the onset of collectivity or the migration of single-particle levels can be tracked consistently as function of the neutron number. Oneand two-nucleon knockout reactions probe the single-particle degree of freedom with measured cross sections sensitive to the wavefunction overlaps between the projectile ground state and the knockout residue's final states.\n\nAt in-flight facilities, exotic medium-mass and light nuclei away from stability can be efficiently produced by fragmentation of stable, primary beams impinging upon stable targets at high beam velocities. The resulting secondary beams of rare isotopes are then available for experiments at velocities typically exceeding 30% of the speed of light. Well-established experimental techniques used for many decades to study the structure of stable nuclei are typically not applicable at the low beam intensities encountered for the shortest-lived rare isotopes. Powerful new experimental techniques have been developed to enable in-beam spectroscopy studies of fast rare-isotope beams with intensities several orders of magnitude less than what is required for measurements with traditional low-energy techniques. The intensities of rare-isotope beams are typically lower than stable-beam rates by orders of magnitude. The experimental technique of in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy compensates for the reduced intensities by employing thick reaction targets, taking advantage of the high beam velocity, and enabling experiments at luminosities comparable to stable-beam experiments but with projectile rates of up to factors of thousands less.",

In addition to x-ray and neutron pulses, the PF is a well-known source of energetic ion beams, of characteristic energy from hundreds of keV to tens of MeV [2]. This characteristic energy range exceeds up to several hundred times the maximum energy to be expected from the capacitor bank voltage. Most of the earlier studies on ion beam emission in PF were carried out in deuterium medium, to investigate the correlation between neutron production and deuteron acceleration. Several properties of PF emitted ion beams have been measured, including their angular distributions and energy spectra [3]. A comprehensive characterization of the PF ion beams, in terms of energy, flux, spatial distribution and ion compositions is desirable in order to advance the understanding of the fundamental physical processes involved in their generation. Several theoretical and computational models have been developed on the ion production and acceleration mechanism for PF discharges [4], however a complete explanation of the ion emission mechanism of the different ranges of PF bank energies is still not available. Low energy PF operating in the few kilojoules range are characterized by a modest operational cost and allow easy modification. These particular features of PF devices, combined with the wide energy range and high characteristic flux of the emitted ion beams, together with the possibility of high frequency operation, have attracted the interest of several researchers, in view of the potential applications in different technological fields, such as surface properties modification, ion implantation, thin film deposition, semiconductor doping and ion-assisted coating [5,6,7]. In the past, studies have been carried out on the general characteristics of ion beam emission in PF [3,8,9].

They reported that narrow bunches (with divergence less than 8 o ) of very high-energy ions are emitted among numerous low energy ion beams pulses.

Since the great variety of neutron techniques pose very different experimental conditions, the numerical simulations must be devised for each specific situation. Prior to the present work, a correction tool had been previously developed and benchmarked for neutron diffraction in liquid and amorphous materials [1]. In the particular case of light and heavy water, different models were explored, and it was determined that in the case of deuterated samples, the multiple scattering signal showed a structure very different from the oversimplified calculations borrowed from X-rays techniques.",

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS\n\nMeasurements were performed on a series of single crystals of URu 2−x Fe x Si 2 with Fe concentrations 0.025 ≤ x ≤ 0.7. Samples were grown using the Czochralski technique, where one of the samples (x = 0.1) was prepared in a tri-arc furnace with a continuously purified Ar atmosphere at Los Alamos, and all other samples were prepared in a Techno Search TCA 4-5 Tetra-Arc furnace under a zirconium-gettered argon atmosphere at UCSD. The quality of the synthesized single crystals was confirmed by x-ray diffraction measurements in a D8 Discover Bruker diffractometer. Typical sample masses for all samples were a few grams. Specific heat measurements were performed for 1.8 K ≤ T ≤ 30 -50 K in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System semiadiabatic calorimeter using a heatpulse technique. Neutron diffraction experiments were performed at the NIST Center for Neutron Research on the BT4 and BT7 triple axis spectrometers with incident energies of E i = 35, 75, 80 or 81.8 meV and various collimations. 37 Samples were oriented in the [HK0] scattering plane. For E i = 35 meV, pyrolytic graphite (PG) filters were used to reduce higher-order contamination from the monochromated neutron beam. Temperatures in the range 4 ≤ T ≤ 30 K were accessed using a closed cycle 4 He refrigerator. The higher incident neutron energies have been used to avoid extinction. The use of the analyzer crystal on both instruments further improved the signal-to-noise ratio, which is particularly important in the case of measuring the small magnetic moments in the HO phase. The phonon contribution to the specific heat was subtracted according to the procedure described in the text.\n\n\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS",

The chemical neutrons activation analysis is a well-known method used in advanced laboratories where, however, expensive neutron sources and very complicate gamma spectrometers for quantitative measurements of all kinds of elements with their myriads of spectral lines are being used. For reducing the analysis to few elements only, e.g. the nitrogen against another to detect chemical explosives (or fertilizers) carried around or packed in motor cars at distances up to ten and more meters, a simplified version of the gamma line detectors has to be developed for low cost mass production and a very low cost MeV neutron source is needed.\n\nUsing the fusion reaction of heavy hydrogen (deuterium D) involves no safety problems and results in neutrons of 2.4 MeV energy. For a longer distance detection of e.g. for checking large and compact containers, the 14 MeV neutron from the reaction of D with the super-heavy hydrogen tritium (T) is interesting. A problem is then only that the detectors must not be destroyed avoiding that the small amount of tritium is released to the environment. The level of neutron production in continuous or pulsed operation of the neutron can be left at such low level that no danger for human bodies is implied. The level of these reactions is so low that -regrettably -any exothermic fusion energy production is excluded by numerous orders of magnitude.\n\nFor the fusion reactions at such a low intensity level, there exist several options as a linear pulsed gas discharge with up to 100.000 Volts, or the plasma focus. A further option is the inertial electrostatic confinement, IEC, about which the following achievements are summarized in the following with the prospects for a development of the neutron source for low cost mass production. An advantage of these developments is given from the possible application of the IEC for a very safe nuclear fission reactor [1] where based on developments discussed by Dautray and Rubbia as competition by IEC [2][3][4] , the present research reactor Garching II could have used the fast switching and unlimited operated IEC with the same neutron fluxes as the very slow switched and frequently regenerated Cf 251 neutron source.\n\n\nTHE IEC CONCEPT",

Symmetry allows α = 0 or β ±i , where the former would result in a collinear spin-density-type modulation and the latter in a spiral structure. In the latter case, β = 1 represents a pure helix, whereas for β < 1 or β > 1 the helix exhibits an elliptical distortion. Although previous magnetic structure analysis by neutron diffraction selected the spiral structure using a Goodness-of-Fit parameter [6], the presence of a magnetic spiral can only be unambiguously determined using polarized neutrons [31][32][33][34][35]. SNP measurements allows the determination of the polarization tensor that describes how the polarization of the incident neutron beam changes during the scattering process due to the dipole-dipole interaction between the neutron spin and the magnetic moments in the investigated sample, as defined by the Blume-Maleyev equations [31][32][33][34][35]. Here the incident polarization can change in three distinct ways; (i) it can rotate around the Fourier transform of the magnetization of the sample, (ii) its magnitude can be reduced due to depolarization of the beam from magnetic domains, or (iii) the sample can act as a neutron polarizer and generate a new component of the neutron polarization. A magnetic helix can be easily distinguished from a spin-density wave via SNP measurements because it generates polarization of the neutron beam parallel to the direction of the scattering vector Q due to a finite chiral contribution to the magnetic scattering cross-section [36]. In SNP, the coordinate frame is typically defined to rotate with Q so that x is parallel to Q, z is perpendicular to the scattering plane and y completes a right-hand set. Thus, by measuring any element of the polarization tensor with the final polarization being along x, we can unambiguously confirm or eliminate the possibility of a spiral structure. Notably, any non-zero contribution in the spin flip channel of the polarized scattering cross section σ xx can unambiguously confirm the presence of the chiral contribution due to a spiral spin structure. However, because a magnetic helix may be left-or right-handed, in principle two chiral domains may exist.

Why is it not more popular? Both MX and NMX involve focusing a beam onto a crystalline sample. The diffraction of X-rays or neutrons from that sample gives us (after some computational work) the structure. The difficulties of NMX are mainly due to the very low flux of neutron sources compared with modern X-ray sources, such as synchrotrons, and the requirement to compensate for this by making very large samples, usually at least 1 mm 3 . This may not seem like a big effort, but modern biochemists are more used to making crystals at least a thousand times smaller in volume. However, the NMX community is slowly growing, with half of all the structures deposited over the past 3 years equivalent to the total output for the previous 30 years. For further details on the technology and history of NMX, the reader is directed to the excellent 2014 article in The Biochemist by Matthew Blakeley (see 'Further reading').\n\n\nNMX has become more accessible\n\nHappily, our study benefited from recent developments, both in the wet lab and at the neutron source.

In addition, the emergence of so-called spallation sources and improved instrumentation at reactor-based sources has led to an improvement in the neutron flux in recent years. Both of these developments meant that we were able to use smaller crystals or reduce the experimental time for a crystal of a given size.",

Levitation techniques have an increasing interest in recent years as important tools for scattering experiments. The main reasons for this interest are the low background signal, the purity of the sample and the possibility of performing experiments with small amounts of samples. In particular, we have shown that diffraction experiments are possible on D4, D1B and D22 with samples of only a few tens of mg. Among the different containerless methods, aerodynamic levitation combined with laser heating has proved to be a powerful and versatile technique for studying the structure, dynamics, and macroscopic properties of high-temperature liquids including insulating compounds (glasses, ceramics, and oxides) and metallic materials. The use this techniques is mainly adapted for studies of materials above the melting point and in the supercooled state condition maintaining a high degree of control in temperature. In particular, the atomic structure of liquid materials can be determined by measurements of the structure factor S(Q) and calculation of the corresponding pair correlation function g(r), as reported in this paper. The acoustic levitation is originally designed for the investigation of supercooled liquids and aqueous solutions in the temperature range from about −40 C to +40 C. This temperature range covers the supercooled region for water and many salt and biological solutions. By eliminating contact with container walls, sources of heterogeneous nucleation are avoided and it often becomes possible to cool liquids substantially below their equilibrium melting point. Here we show that this technique can be also adopted for powder diffraction with a small amount of sample in the beam obtaining good data quality necessary to make the data refinement. In particular, we have shown that diffraction experiments are possible on D4, D1B and D22 with samples of only a few tens of mg. The high adaptability on different neutron instruments of the levitation devices presented in this article offers the possibility to combine different neutron techniques. This is a very important point for an exhaustive analysis of materials based on multi-techniques and multi-scale approach.\n\n\nthis work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

With widespread applications of the large-scale high-integrated electronic devices in the past decades, the neutron single particle effects become more and more remarkable for aircrafts and low-orbit satellites. In late 1980s, IBM and Boeing used aircrafts to study SEE effects of the atmospheric neutron field and the experimental results validates the notability of the neutron field induced single event effects [4]. In 1995, Baumann et al. studied the effects of thermal neutron capture by 10 B in borophosphosilicate glass [5]. More recent progresses on neutron single particle effects can be found in [6]- [9].\n\nUsually the atmospheric radiation field is composed of neutrons, protons, alphas, muons, electrons, gammas an so on. In Fig. 1, the integrated flux for several types of main particles will be given. One can find that the neutron intensity is larger than other particles below about 30-km altitude. Obviously the studies for neutron SEE are significant for aircraft and low-orbit satellites. The atmospheric neutron field intensity will be affected by many factors such as time, longitude, latitude, altitude, solar activities and so on. Regardless of the solar high active years, the altitude is the most important by comparing with other factors. In atmosphere, the energy spectrum of neutron radiation field is very wide, namely a white neutron spectrum characteristic. Usually the neutrons above 1MeV are remarkable to contribute the SEE. There exist two important reference standard neutron energy spectra for SEE investigations in terrestrial and avionic environments. The JEDEC (formerly known as the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) provides a reference terrestrial neutron spectrum in JESD89A [11]. The neutron differential flux given in Eq. (1) is based on the reference conditions of sea level in New York City with mid-level solar activity. The total neutron flux of the reference spectrum above 10 MeV is 3.6×10 -3 cm -2 s -1 at NYC [11]. spallation neutron sources provide neutron beams over a wide range of energies, with the shape of the spectrum similar to that of the terrestrial neutron environment.

On one side of the phase diagram exists localized magnetism due to RKKY and on the other a totally Kondo-quenched paramagnetic state. Perhaps the most interesting scenarios are those in the middle of the phase diagram where the Kondo and RKKY energy scales are comparable. To find systems of this nature it is imperative to accurately measure these energy scales. CeRhIn 5 is one such system where these scales are believed to be competing.The temperature-pressure phase diagram of CeRhIn 5 is prototypical for heavy fermion materials; at ambient pressure, it displays incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) order below T N = 3.8 K, and with increasing applied pressure T N is suppressed to a quantum critical point at P c = 2.25 GPa around which a broad dome of unconventional superconductivity emerges[2][3][4][5]. In detail, however, the properties of the AFM ground state in CeRhIn 5 deviate from prototypical behavior. Namely, the ground state magnetic order was Abstract Two aspects of the ambient pressure magnetic structure of heavy fermion material CeRhIn 5 have remained under some debate since its discovery: whether the structure is indeed an incommensurate helix or a spin density wave, and what is the precise magnitude of the ordered magnetic moment.

Several stainless steel samples were used after the corresponding stress test investigations for extracting 44 Ti, 26 Al and 53 Mn. [9,41] From both sources, we manufactured batches containing up to 10 19 atoms of 53 Mn, this amounting to around five orders of magnitude more than ever available for experiments world-wide.\n\nAs visible in Fig. 4, the results for the thermal neutron cross section, measured at the research reactor LVR-15 in Rez (Czech Republic), and for the cold neutrons using the ICON beamline at PSI, reproduce well the values known from literature [36a] with an essentially improved uncertainty. [42] Moreover, it was possible for the first time, using the LiLiT source at SOREQ (Israel), to obtain a Maxwellian Averaged Cross Section (MACS), matching stellar neutron energies of 20-50 keV. [43] The work is completed by measuring the interaction of very cold neutrons at ILL with 53 Mn.\n\nIn parallel, a re-determination of the 53 Mn half-life was performed in order to utilize the isotope as a dating tool for geological and environmental samples. For this purpose, a mass separation had to be performed at the University of Mainz to produce an isotopically pure sample for the activity measurement of the 'hardto-measure' deexcitation radiation of 53 Mn. The obtained value for the 53 Mn half-life is slightly lower than the literature reference, but was, again, determined with a much-improved uncertainty of less than 2%. [39] Conclusion: No, due to recent improvements in the detection techniques and thanks to our results on cross section and halflife measurements as well as the newly provided AMS reference material, 53 Mn will no longer be considered a wallflower in the nuclear astrophysics landscape, but has the potential to develop into a powerful tool for geological, environmental and astrophysics research.\n\n\nSamples from Isotopes not Produced at PSI",

The thermonuclear runaway in degenerate white-dwarf matter subjects the reaction network to extreme conditions in this example: the difference between the fastest and slowest reaction timescales is more than 11 orders of magnitude and during the thermonuclear flash the temperature increases by 6.6 billion K in only 1.5 × 10 −7 Log Time (s)   s (a rate of temperature change corresponding to 4.4 × 10 16 K/s). The asymptotic plus PE method required 712 steps to integrate this problem, compared with 524 steps for the implicit calculation, suggesting that an optimized explicit code would be about twice as fast as the implicit code because it can compute a timestep about three times faster. In contrast, the purely asymptotic calculation gave accurate results but required almost 190,000 integration steps for the time range shown. As may be seen from Fig. 11(d), the partial equilibrium calculation becomes completely equilibrated after logt ∼ −5.2 and after that time the PE timesteps are limited only by accuracy. Choosing to restrict the subsequent timesteps to dt = 0.3t, continuation of the PE (or implicit) integration of Fig. 11 until the characteristic timescale for the supernova explosion of ∼ 1 s requires only a few tens of additional integration steps. In contrast, if the asymptotic integrator continued to take the timesteps it is taking at the end of the calculation in Fig. 11, it would require more than a billion additional integration steps to reach the full physical timescale for the supernova.\n\n\nSynopsis",

While in a perfect gas at fixed volume the temperature and pressure balance each other (PV = nRT ), in white dwarfs the matter is degenerate. As a consequence, if the temperature increases up to the C combustion threshold, a chain reaction will trigger the explosive burning of elements in the white dwarf, up to (and especially) its Fe-peak elements, leaving no remnant after the explosion. This way, SNIa act like thermonuclear bombs, and the energy of their explosion (i.e. their luminosity) should not depend on their intrinsic properties. For this reason, they are useful standard candles to estimate cosmic distances accurately (see also Chapter: X-ray cluster cosmology).\n\nWhat is not clear yet, however, is the exact scenario preceding the SNIa explosion. Is the white dwarf steadily accreting material from a main sequence companion until reaching the C burning temperature (the \"single degenerate scenario\") or is this burning triggered by a violent merger between two white dwarfs (the \"double degenerate scenario\")? Whereas the former scenario is generally expected for white dwarf explosions close to the Chandrasekhar mass (∼1.4 M ; near-Chandrasekhar models), the latter is expected to occur at lower mass (sub-Chandrasekhar models). A complete review on this unsolved issue can be found in Maoz et al. [53]. Another debate stands on the physics of the explosion itself. In fact, while the general consensus is that the burning flame starts to propagate subsonically, it is not clear whether it always remains so (i.e. \"deflagration\" models) or whether it reaches a supersonic velocity before disintegrating the white dwarf (i.e. \"delayed-detonation\" models).",

These are shown in Fig. 8 as functions of density. Both L min CJ and U CJ depend only on the mixture properties, which vary with local density. L CJ and U max l also depend on the turbulent integral scale l and velocity U l . They were calculated assuming l = 10 km and U l = 100 km s −1 , values found in large-scale calculations of the M ch explosions (51,52,75). The lack of fully developed turbulence on scales > 10 km greatly reduces flame packing on these scales. Figure 8 shows that L min CJ decreases below l = 10 km at densities > 10 7 g cm −3 , thus allowing the CJ conditions to arise in the flow (76). As the density increases, the minimum size of the critical flame region decreases rapidly. At ρ ≈ 3 × 10 7 g cm −3 , turbulent integral velocity U max l at the scale of 10 km required to produce tight flame packing associated with L min CJ becomes larger than the reference U l = 100 km s −1 . Therefore, at higher densities, high turbulent intensities not observed in full-star SNIa simulations (51,52,75) would be required 13 to pack the flame sufficiently tightly to achieve L min CJ . CJ conditions can be created by the turbulent intensity of 100 km s −1 , though they would correspond to a less tightly packed flame and a larger critical flame volume L CJ . Corresponding values of L CJ for the reference U l = 100 km s −1 , that we denote L ref CJ , as well as the turbulent velocity U CJ at that scale, are also shown in Fig. 8. After the critical flame volume reaches a minimum value at ρ ≈ 3 × 10 7 g cm −3 , it starts growing again, becoming larger than 10 km at ρ ≈ 1.5 × 10 8 g cm −3 .",

[15] reported flame broadening and formation of a distributed reaction zone in a DNS under the action of fast turbulence. This study considers the interaction of a thermonuclear flame, driven by 12 C-12 C reactions, with steady driven turbulence under the conditions characteristic of the interior of a white dwarf during the late stages of the type Ia supernova explosion. In the fastest turbulence case, the value of U l /S L ≈ 70 was achieved corresponding to the Karlovitz number Ka = 228, where Ka = (δ L /L G ) 1 / 2 and L G is the Gibson scale defined in eq. (11). This simulation showed the formation of a broad turbulent flame with a complex temperature and burning-rate structure. Moreover, joint PDFs of various quantities, such as carbon mass fraction and temperature, were characteristic of a Lewis number Le = 1 system, whereas the actual values of Le are extremely large. This fact, along with wide smooth averaged profiles of various quantities throughout the turbulent flame, led to the conclusion that the resulting flame is dominated by turbulent transport and presents an example of a broad distributed reaction zone.\n\nEven given the efforts discussed above, the physics of high-speed turbulent combustion still has many unanswered questions. With the exception of the experimental results of [10] and numerical results of [15], evidence of significant flame broadening and the formation of distributed reaction zones is scarce [5]. Moreover, results of all studies suggest that such broadening, even if it does occur, requires substantially higher turbulent intensities than traditionally predicted. It remains unclear whether the effects of turbulence are indeed so much weaker than can be expected based on simple physical grounds and, if this is the case, what mechanisms are responsible for suppressing the action of turbulence.\n\nThe work by [10] and [15] emphasizes the importance of detailed and reliable diagnostics. While both studies present interesting experimental and numerical investigations of the previously unexplored regimes, they both rely on indirect evidence in their determination of the observed flame broadening. Of paramount importance are the measurements that would, for example, directly answer questions regarding the actual multidimensional structure of the region in which most of the energy release takes place, the nature of flame broadening, and the effects of turbulence on different regions of the flame.",

Notably, as K G is obtained based on the product of the maximum pressure boost rate parameter and the volume constant of each group of mixed systems, the trends and amplitudes of both are consistent. Therefore, the following subsection will focus on the analysis of the maximum pressure boost rate parameters. As shown in Figure 3, in the lean methane system, the addition of hydrogen (group M1) promoted the explosion of 7% methane. The peak explosive overpressure of the mixed system increases with further addition, and the time required to reach the peak pressure decreases. After adding carbon monoxide (group M7), with the increase in the addition amount, the explosion of 7% methane showed a trend of initial inhibition and then promotion, which is consistent with previous experiments by Deng et al. 29 that CO has a certain damping effect on methane−air explosion. However, the difference is that when CO reaches a certain amount of addition, its damping effect does not appear, but its promoting effect is more significant. Figure 4 shows the effect of each ratio of H 2 /CO on the explosion pressure parameters of 7% methane. Overall, all groups of H 2 /CO, except M7 (pure carbon monoxide), showed a significant contribution to the 7% methane explosion overpressure peak and maximum ramp rate, and the R-value reached the maximum extent at approximately 60% and then appeared to be substantially weakened with an increasing Rvalue. As mentioned above, the addition of the M7 group has obvious stage effects on the explosion of 7% methane. When the R-value is lower than 30%, the pressure parameter of the system initially decreases and then rises slightly. Therefore, within this range of addition, the influence of CO is mainly the damping effect; when the R-value increases to 50−80%, the promoting effect begins to gradually appear, and the pressure parameter increases to the maximum value. When the R-value of the M7 group is 85%, and the corresponding CO volume fraction reaches 39%, the system still has the ability to explode, while other groups of H 2 /CO with the same R-value have made the mixed system no longer explode.

There also seemed to be little difference between the cases at fixed Bi as Ra varied. To elucidate further these effects, simulations were performed to capture the maximum temperature that occurs in the steady state for a stable solution on the explosion boundary (such as is shown in Fig. 1). This was done for a range of Bi and at three values of Ra, i.e. 10 3 , 10 4 and 10 5 . The results are plotted in Fig. 4. When Bi = 0, the system is perfectly mixed and as predicted by Semenov, 1 the maximum dimensionless temperature of a stable system is 1. When Bi is increased, it is clear that there is an increase in the maximum temperature that can be achieved before explosion occurs. Indeed, for Bi 4 5, for the range of Ra considered, it can be seen that the maximum temperature rises above the value of 1.6 that was predicted by Frank-Kamenetskii 2 for a purely diffusive system. For each Ra when Bi o B10 there is very little difference in the maximum temperatures achievable in a nonexplosive case. What is interesting to note, however, is that the maximum temperature for each Bi in this range is actually seen for the lowest value of Ra. This result is somewhat counterintuitive and will be discussed further below. Of course, it should be borne in mind that these maximum temperatures were derived numerically and the maximum temperature is sensitive to the proximity to the explosion boundary, nevertheless the trend is evident for all Bi o 10. This trend is reversed as Bi increases above 20, where the increased intensity of convection indicated by a larger Ra results in a higher temperature being achieved in a stable reaction. When Bi increases above 25, the maximum temperatures achieved diverge and the effect of the more intense convection is obvious. The maximum temperatures then clearly approach the values achieved in a constant wall temperature case (i.e. Bi = N) asymptotically. Thus, for Ra = 10 3 , the maximum temperature is approximately 2.5, for Ra = 10 4 it is 3.15 and for Ra = 10 5 it is 3.45. Unsurprisingly,",

Propagating such a shock through a 3D turbulent flame until detonation ignites is computationally expensive. Therefore, we demonstrate this process in a 2D calculation, in which a turbulent flame is represented by a series of spherical flames. An additional benefit of considering this problem in 2D is that we can model this process at a density ρ = 3×10 7 g cm −3 and in a realistic 50/50 12 C/ 16 O composition, which are closer to the DDT conditions expected in SNIa.

Such a configuration represents a loosely packed flame.

Similar resolution was used in prior detonation studies, where it was shown to reproduce the detonation velocity and resolve the characteristic multidimensional cellular structure of unstable thermonuclear detonations (73).

In this section we give some representative examples of those calculations. Because they are extremely challenging reaction network problems to solve, we shall concentrate on examples representative of conditions expected in Type Ia supernova simulations (temperatures in the range 10 7 -10 10 K, densities in the range 10 7 -10 9 g cm −3 , and initial equal mass fractions of 12 C and 16 O). Such conditions lead quickly to high degrees of equilibration in the approach to QSE (quasi-statistical equilibrium) and NSE (nuclear statistical equilibrium), and are a stringent test of partial equilibration methods. Our longterm goal is application of these methods to larger networks, but an alpha network provides a highly-stiff test system that is small enough to allow significant insight into how the algorithm functions. We also note as a practical matter that the most ambitious published calculations for thermonuclear networks coupled to hydrodynamical simulations have employed alpha networks. The reactions and corresponding reaction groups used in the calculations are displayed in Table 4. We use the standard REACLIB library [12] for all rates except for three of the heavy-ion reactions (corresponding to reaction groups 3, 5, and 6 in the table) which have inverse reactions that are absent from the REACLIB compilation and were taken from Ref. [14]. For typical Type Ia supernova conditions the rates for the capture and photodisintegration reactions in Table 4 become comparable and as large as ∼ 10 10 −10 12 s −1 . The corresponding maximum stable fully-explicit integration timestep will be of order the inverse of the maximum rate in the network, so timesteps as short as ∼ 10 −12 s may be required for stability of a fully-explicit integration. On the other hand, the characteristic physical timescale for the primary Type Ia explosion mechanism is of order one second. Thus integration of the alpha network coupled to a hydrodynamics simulation of a Type Ia explosion could require 10 12 or more explicit network integration timesteps, which is obviously not practical and indicates graphically that this is an extremely stiff system.

The results are nearly identical to those obtained with the nominal diffusion coefficient. Thus, any uncertainty in the diffusion coefficient does not translate into appreciable differences in the observational properties of SNIa. These conclusions are independent of the value of ρ DDT used in the supernova calculations, as can be seen in the next two rows where we show the results for ρ DDT = 3.0 × 10 7 g cm −3 . Figures 3 and 4 show the final chemical composition of the ejecta as a function of the ejecta mass (as a Lagrangian coordinate), for the two models with enhanced diffusion coefficient and ρ DDT = 1.6×10 7 g cm −3 . The main difference between the initial models (see Fig. 2) lies in the concentration of 22 Ne in the central 0.6 M , which leads to a larger 22 Ne mass fraction (∼50%) in the oldest model. However, the chemical profiles of the ejecta of both models are nearly the same below this Lagrangian mass. Between ∼0.6 M and 1 M , the oldest model (8.0 Gyr age) has slightly larger mass fractions of Si and S and less Fe and Cr, although the differences are quite modest. The reason for these differences is the following. As the thermonuclear wave propagates through the central regions of the white dwarf, it completely incinerates the material up to a composition in nuclear statistical equilibrium. The oldest model having a larger central neutron excess (larger 22 Ne mass fraction) releases less energy during the incineration of carbon and oxygen in reaching NSE, which causes a slightly slower expansion during the initial phases of the explosion, and higher densities at the position of the flame. As a consequence, the subsequent combustion of the layers above a ∼0.6 M Lagrangian mass is able to reach a more advanced combustion stage than if the expansion had been faster (as in the youngest model, of 0.6 Gyr age), and more Fe and less IMEs are produced in these layers.\n\n\nTransition density function of the chemical composition",

The higher the biomass becomes, the lower becomes the specific growth rate. It is a consequence of the Monod kinetics that this declining growth rate is related to a corresponding declining quasi-steady state substrate concentration (S) as illustrated in Figure 1A.\n\nWith the TLFB technique, the required declining growth rate and constant DOT are obtained by a declining temperature that keeps DOT at a constant level ( Figure 1B). If all substrate components are present at non-limiting concentrations, the cells always grow at µ-max at the actual temperature but the higher the biomass, the lower the temperature must be. This relationship between growth rate and temperature is usually described with the Arrhenius plot (Figure 2). This plot shows that P. pastoris is a quite psychrotrophic organism that can grow at a temperature as low as 12°C with the specific growth rate µ = 0.04 h -1 . In high cell density P. pastoris cultures, the growth rate reaches even much lower values [7].\n\nThe temperature profile of a TLFB P. pastoris process is shown in Figure 3. It shows that the temperature drop required to keep DOT constant initially becomes very rapid. Due to the rather psychrotrophic properties of P. pastoris, the TLFB technique resulted in very low temperatures that can be difficult to maintain, especially in largescale cultivation. The temperature reached 12°C at a cell density of 70 g L -1 , a concentration which is far below what was reached with a corresponding MLFB process ( Figure 4). For this reason a hybrid technique was used, in which the DOT was first controlled at the set point by the temperature, until the cooling capacity failed. Then the control mode was switched to a methanol feed rate controlled DOT (Figure 3). The biomass growth continued and reached about 165 g L -1 after 175 hours ( Figure 4).",

Because the explicit methods that we are developing can compute a timestep faster, and scale approximately linearly and therefore more favorable with network size than implicit methods, their relative advantage grows with the size of the network. Thus, for explicit methods to realize their full potential we must extend the previous partial equilibrium examples to include very stiff networks containing hundreds of reacting species.

This is due to the higher levels of population obtained under these conditions. Figure 3 illustrates the influence of T max on these levels. It is interesting to note that the maximum number density obtained for Al ground state with T max = 3000 K is of 10 23 m −3 approximately whereas this density reaches 10 25 m −3 with T max = 4000 K. This strong increase of the plasma density when T max is higher leads to the elastic collisions frequency increase and to an important reduction of τ eq . Moreover, figure 3 shows the absence of temporal symmetry between the production of the plasma and its recombination. The plasma is indeed formed during the increase of the laser flux  in few nanoseconds, whereas its recombination lasts some microseconds. Figure 3 gives also an insight into the behavior of n e when T max increases. The maximum electron density is concomitant with the maximum laser flux. When T max = 3000 K, this maximum corresponds to n e ≈ 10 22 m −3 whereas n e ≈ 10 23 m −3 with T max = 4000 K. In both cases, the plasma ionization degree remains smaller than 10%. However, additional calculations performed with higher values of T max put forward the rapid increase of the ionization degree with the interface maximum temperature: the plasma can even be totally ionized.\n\nIt is worth to further analyze the elementary processes contribution. Figures 4a and 4b display their time-dependent influence on the Al and Al + ground states number density respectively. The time scales non symmetry between the plasma creation and relaxation is again observed. Besides, figure 4a illustrates the fundamental role played by vaporization from the sample. The atoms reaching the gas phase are then ionized through MPI phenomena. The end of the laser pulse induces the relaxation of the excited states: this relaxation plays a preponderant role in the Al ground state dynamics. Three-body recombination does not play a significant role and spontaneous emission remains a minor process owing to the escape factors weak value.",

The fireball radius is given in the text 3 by equation 3 where W is the mass of the explosive charge:\nr = W/3(3)\nEquation 3 does not explain the relationship between charge mass and fireball radius effectively; as blast effects usually follow cube root scaling, the fireball radius could be scaled with the cube root of TNT equivalence of the charge mass to give r ~ W 1/3 .\n\n3) The nature of the surface: no surfaces within the zone in which detectable residues and traces may be expected should be neglected, but some surfaces, like fabrics, are more likely to have residues than wood, which will have more residue than metal 3 . The amount of explosives recovered from different surfaces is therefore also governed by the efficiency of the appropriate sampling method used to remove the residues from that surface, i.e. swabbing from non-porous surfaces, vacuuming from fabric surfaces or direct solvent extractions. The detection capability of each of these varies depending on multiple criteria such as: the type of swab; the solvent type and amount (if one is used); clean-up procedure required; extraction methods; vacuum detector LOD; contaminant collection; etc. [51][52][53] . Depending on combinations of these criteria, as well as the nature of the explosive analyte being detected (including whether it is thermally labile), the sampling efficiencies vary greatly 51 . Again, if no prior knowledge of the explosive material is available, sampling procedures must be able to collect residues from a wide range of potential explosives, which in turn can potentially raise the LOD, particularly in the case of choosing appropriate swabbing materials. This further highlights the importance of understanding where explosive residues are likely to have deposited in order to ensure sampling in, and from, optimum locations.",

Experiments consisted of monitoring the concentrations of SH and H2S when [SH] reached its maximum. Examples of the experimental data observed at three different temperatures with varied initial concentration of H2S are shown in Figure 6. The slopes of the straight lines in Figure 6 provide the k1/k2 ratios at respective temperatures. The experimental conditions and the results of these measurements are summarized in Table 2. The values of k2 presented in Table 2 were calculated using k1 = 1.86 × 10 −10 cm 3 molecule −1 s −1 (T = 220-960 K), determined in the present work. One can note that the kinetics of two reactants, F-atom and H 2 S, are well described with k 1 , determined above in an excess of H 2 S. The SH concentration, as expected, increases to a maximum and then drops due to the loss of SH in Reactions (2), (7) and (10). The dotted line in Figure 5 shows the SH profile calculated without taking into account the SH losses in its self-Reaction (7) and on the wall (10). The relative contribution of these reactions increases with the reaction time (as F-atom is consumed). At the maximum concentration of SH, the impact of these two reactions can be considered negligible (the error bar displayed at the top of the SH profile corresponds to 5%), even for the relatively high initial concentration of H 2 S used in this experiment. Hence, one can conclude that the maximum concentration of SH is determined with a sufficient degree of accuracy by only two processes, the formation of SH in Reaction (1) and the consumption in Reaction (2), with k 1 [H 2 S] = k 2 [SH] max at the time when [SH] is maximum. We did not perform the above analysis at other temperatures.

(Computer simulations such as those described in [12,15] might be able to shed light on the correct values of these Debye-Waller factors.) In the present case the overall intramolecular energy amplitude, E intra , is set to 150 kJ mol −1 to give sharp intramolecular peaks in the radial distribution function consistent with the diffraction data. All the parameters for the intermolecular potential are exactly the same as those described for Model 1. Initial simulations were run using the reference potentials (including of course the intramolecular potentials for Model 2) alone at a temperature T = 1000 K. Once equilibrium was established, the diffraction data were used to generate an empirical potential to perturb these reference potentials in the manner described in [18]. Neutron diffraction data were obtained from [2]. X-ray diffraction data were obtained from [9] and then renormalised to the single atom x-ray scattering as described in [20]. The purpose of this renormalization is that when x-ray scattering are put on an absolute scale of differential scattering cross section it is necessary to refer to the single atom scattering line. This line corresponds to what would be observed if there were no atom correlations in the material. Hence normalizing to this line in such circumstances would give a constant as a function Q which is what would be expected for a system with no correlations. As explained in [20], to normalize to the square of the average form factor as is traditionally done introduces a Q dependent bias that can prevent EPSR from obtaining the optimum fit to those data. This of course does not preclude the use of the square of the average form factor normalization for other purposes.

Taking the typical value of the Arrhenius number as = = .    Ar RT E / 003 0 , it can be easily seen that the characteristic temperature interval (at the ambient temperature of 300 K) would be of the order of ≈    RT E K / 10 0 2 . Entering, according to the definition of the Zeldovich number, this characteristic temperature interval    RT E / 0 2 into the denominator leads to straightforward conclusion that the change in Zeldovich number value of the order of unity corresponds to approximately 10 °C difference between the initial ambient temperature and initial temperature of reacting material. Therefore, the range of the Zeldovich number variation in Fig. 7 covers the range of ambient temperature variations within approximately 40 °C. This is a realistic upper estimation for seasonal temperature variations. Daily variations are typically much smaller. Further, choosing higher value of the Arrhenius number, used to make the estimation, would lead to more narrow range of Zeldovich numbers corresponding to the above upper variation limit (i.e. ≈40 °C). Therefore, − ≤ ≤ Zn 2 2 represents the widest practically relevant range for Zeldovich numbers.",

Here, a \"weak detonation\" means a carbon detonation in which the temperature is not high enough to burn oxygen directly (see García-Senz et al. 1999). In a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion, such an edge-lit weak detonation will strengthen as it moves into denser regions, reaching increasingly higher temperatures and allowing the completion of burning sequences from explosive oxygen burning until NSE. The successful launching of a carbon detonation wave is found to depend strongly on the A26, page 6 of 8 density and the altitude of He ignition, and weakly on the carbon mass fraction. For instance, for a density of 2 × 10 6 g cm −3 , the minimum altitude at which a carbon detonation develops in our simulations is 200 km for a composition of 50%:50% carbon and oxygen, and only 100 km for the two compositions richer in carbon that we explored. For the highest density we used, 6 × 10 6 g cm −3 , and an altitude of 5 km, a carbon detonation was obtained only for the largest carbon mass fraction, X( 12 C) = 0.81. Thus, the age of the progenitor system can determine the kind of dynamical event following He ignition in a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, i.e. either a central carbon detonation or a shell carbon detonation.\n\n\nExplosion models",

Correspondingly, we put δ = min(δ FU , δ BU ). In Fig. 6b, we show the free-energy profile F (Q) at the folding temperature. The free energy has a relatively sharp minimum at Q ≈ 0.9, corresponding to δ ≈ 3Å. This is followed by a weak barrier around Q = 0.7, corresponding to δ ≈ 6Å. Finally, there is a broad minimum at small Q, where Q = 0.2 corresponds to δ ≈ 13Å.  What does the nonnative population at the folding temperature correspond to in terms of R g and E hb ? This can be seen from the Q, R g and Q, E hb scatter plots in Fig. 7. These plots show that the low-Q minimum of F (Q) corresponds to expanded structures with a varying but not high secondary-structure content. Although a detailed kinetic study is beyond the scope of this paper, we furthermore note that the free-energy surfaces corresponding to the distributions in Fig. 7 are relatively smooth. Consistent with that, we found that standard fixed-temperature Monte Carlo simulations were able to reach the native state, starting from random coils.\n\nLet us finally mention that we also performed simulations of some random sequences with the same length and composition as the three-helix sequence. The random sequences did not form stable structures and collapsed more slowly with decreasing temperature than the designed three-helix sequence.\n\n\nSummary and Outlook\n\nWe have studied a reduced protein model where the formation of native structure is driven by a competition between hydrogen bonds and effective hydrophobicity forces. Using this force field, we find that the three-helix-bundle protein studied has the following properties:\n\n• It does form a stable three-helix-bundle state, except for a 2-fold topological degeneracy.\n\n• It undergoes an abrupt folding transition from an expanded state to the native state.\n\n• It forms more stable secondary structure than the corresponding one-and twohelix segments.\n\nAn obvious question that remains to be addressed is what is needed to lift the topological degeneracy. Not obvious, however, is whether this question should be addressed at the present level of modeling, before including full side chains.",

First, partial chemical equilibrium is established, without changes in the total number of molecules in the system. This is because the rapid bimolecular reactions that ensure the establishment of such partial equilibrium occur much faster than the dissociation and recombination reactions, which are responsible for establishing full chemical equilibrium. That is, even in cases where there is no chemical equilibrium, it suffices to know the molar mass of the mixture and two required thermodynamic parameters (for example, temperature and density) to determine the composition of the mixture.\n\nThe existence of quasi-equilibrium in exchange reactions was discussed in [6]. The authors of [6] used this assumption to perform approximate calculations of the composition of a hydrogenoxygen mixture. This same assumption underlies an approximate model for calculating the molar mass of gas mixtures at high temperatures [7]. The author of [7,8] proposed an approximate kinetic equation for calculating the molar mass of the mixture and then the thermodynamic parameters.\n\nIn [9] we made an effort to speed up directly chemical integrator for some special case. Another general approach have been taken in [10]. This approach does not solve the chemical equations directly; rather, it relies on a special precalculated database capturing the chemical model's input-output relations.\n\nIn [9] we developed a method for calculating the changing composition of the explosion products in the case where there is no full chemical equilibrium, but the bimolecular reactions are in equilibrium. A detailed kinetic mechanism is used, but without the need to solve the stiff system of equations. The core of our approach is to replace the complete system of chemical kinetics equations by an equivalent system composed of a differential and a few algebraic equations. What we offer is not an approximate kinetic equation, but an approximate method for solving the complete system of equations of chemical kinetics. This method is always consistent with the detailed mechanism and can be used together with solution of the stiff system, replacing it at the stage when bimolecular reactions are in quasi-equilibrium state.",

Optical emission spectroscopy at ultraviolet, visible, and nearinfrared wavelengths has been used to measure temperatures, atomic species, and some molecular species for the hot fireball conditions of the HE. [7][8][9][10][11] Combustion gases CO 2 , CO, and H 2 O have been measured using standoff Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to analyze the mid-wave infrared (MWIR, 3-5 μm) light emitted from HE detonations. [12][13][14][15][16] Imaging FTIR has also been used to measure emission from combustion gases in HE detonations. 17 FTIR emission spectroscopy can be performed at large distances from the source of an OD; for example, remote detection of air-dropped bomb detonations was reported using a standoff distance of 4.8 km. 16 The primary limitation of emissionbased optical techniques is that they can only be performed for times when the fireball temperature is high enough to produce emission intensity detectable above the thermal background. Thus, while highly useful for probing conditions during the initial detonation and combustion of the HE, emission spectroscopy is not well-suited to measure the persistent gases remaining after the fireball has cooled. Standoff (open-path) absorption spectroscopy provides a method to measure persistent gases produced from ODs, which is not limited to probing regions of high temperature. Standoff absorption spectroscopy probes the spectrum of light absorbed by molecular gases along a measurement path through the atmosphere between a source and detector, usually with a retro-reflector placed at one end of the path. The ability to perform measurements along an integrated path relaxes the requirements for sensor placement to intercept plumes. For example, the open path may be oriented perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction to measure plumes as they cross the path, allowing measurements if wind conditions change. The path may be located either close to the OD to probe plume gases and their temporal variations near the source or may be located farther away to measure plume gases after mixing and dilution with the atmosphere.",

Some others, such as the consequences of a wrong plant design or the incorrect management of equipment are more difficult *Correspondence: leonardo@ic.unicamp.br † Diego Sierra, Leonardo Montecchi and Ivan Mura contributed equally to this work. 2 Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil Full list of author information is available at the end of the article to understand and to account for. Catastrophic events are usually related to an initial hazardous event or scenario, which subsequently escalates to greater and more dangerous magnitudes. Escalation may trigger a chain of unwanted events whose effects progressively increase both in space and time, until producing a single, major accident. When this happens, we talk about a failure domino effect [3]. Failure domino effects in chemical plants can occur because of a handful of reasons. The very first occurring event in the chain of unwanted scenarios is known as the triggering or initiating event. This is usually a fire (either pool fire, jet fire, flash fire, fire ball, etc.) or an explosion, e.g., a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), or a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE). Subsequent events can be of any kind, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive, meaning that a triggering jet fire can end up causing both a BLEVE and a fireball [36]. In this paper, we study the domino effect of VCEs, where both the main triggering event and the subsequent events are VCEs [16]. VCEs occur when a large amount of flammable material is released into partially congested atmospheres and such material does not ignite immediately [14]. Rather, it accumulates and generates a cloud of flammable vapor, i.e., gas or mist, with enough chemical energy to generate flame speeds that accelerate to sufficiently high velocities to produce significant increase of vapor pressure (overpressure).",

At high temperatures, the total energy of the system increases continuously and then reaches a plateau (that corresponds to the complete melting of the solid). The behaviour at low temperatures is different. At the beginning (first 1-2ns), there is an increase of the energy but after that the energy remains approximately constant, apart from the thermal fluctuations. The analysis of the configurations of the TIP4P/2005 at T = 245 K, shows that the increase of energy during the first 1ns is due to the formation of a thin liquid layer at the surface of ice, which may indicate the onset of surface melting, mentioned already in the Introduction, and first proposed by Faraday [257]. The formation of a quasi liquid layer on the surface of ice below T m has been found both in experiment (see [258,259,260,261,262] and references therein) and in computer computer simulation for several potential models of water [263,264,265,266,92] and it has been explained by several theoretical treatments [258,260]. By repeating the simulation at several temperatures it is possible to determine the lowest temperature at which the block of ice melts T + , and the highest temperature at which it does not melt T − . By taking the average of these two temperatures we obtain what we call T s = (T + + T − )/2. T s provides an estimate of the melting point. The values of T s obtained for water models are presented in Table 7. As can be seen, T s is identical to T m , within the error bar. Thus for ice Ih, the presence of a free surface suppresses superheating and ice melts at the equilibrium melting temperature (although runs of about 10ns or longer may be needed).

If the enclosure was not present, higher concentrations would be reached only locally, which is inside the silos and in the proximity of sugar deposits and discharge points. While an explosion inside a silo is indeed a critical issue (but it is an object of the analysis dedicated to the specific silo node), for what concerns the 4B Node the absence of the enclosure would mean that only local fires are a potential accident, given the lack of confinement.\n\nAs recalled previously, the most important ignition sources were identified as high temperature from a sugar fire, intended as temperature > MIT (hhT a ), electric and friction spark. High temperatures are well represented by regular deviations, while electric and friction spark may not be necessarily basic events, and they must be developed separately. Considering the equipment, an electric spark can be generated by the faulty hand switch, which is highlighted in the FMEA (Table 5). This event was reported as unlikely [30].

Figure 8 shows the mean value of the temperature as a function of the mean value of the stream function for R p = 4 × 10 3 and for different values of σ . When using the first model of this section, we obtain a small \"butterfly\" in the bottom of the box (cf. Figure 6a). This model is a particular case of the model introduced in the last subsection if we formally put σ = 0. Numerical results in Figure 8 show the convergence of solutions of system (19)-(21) to the solution of system (7)-(10) as σ → 0. Figure 9 shows the critical value of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter as a function of the inverse of the Vadasz number for different values of the Rayleigh number R p .

Precise calculations clearly indicate a much higher temperature. At least 10 million degrees are necessary for 1 keV in thermonuclear reaction. At 400 keV it needs a temperature of 4000 million degrees to occur the hot fusion reaction. Hot fusion needs a temperature of about 4000 million degrees, or 4 billion degrees if we believe in the calculations the radius of deuterium static. If we believe in the calculations the radius of the real, dynamic deuterium, in movement, the temperature required to achieve the warm fusion reaction increases still 10000 times, reaching a value of 40 trillions degrees. Unfortunately, this clarification does not bring us closer to the realization of the hot fusion reaction, but on the contrary, us away from the day when we will be able to achieve it. Today we have only made 150 million degrees. A huge problem is even the achievement of such temperatures. For these reasons we are entitled to think up next following, namely achieving the cold fusion.

During this process, the raw material is not preserved because some of the mass of the fusing nuclei is converted into energy which is released (Shultis and Faw, 2002;Progress in Fusion, ITER;Moses et al., 2009;Kramer, 2011;Atzeni and Meyer-ter-Vehn, 2004).",

Because not found naturally pure, it can be produced industrially by chemical reactions or by reducing chlorine boron in a hydrogen atmosphere, using an electric arc between 1200-1400°C. Its energy of fusion is about 50.2 kJ/mol.\n\n\nResults\n\nWithout fusion, there would be no life on Earth. What we perceive in the form of light and heat is the result of fusion reactions occurring in the heart of the Sun and the stars. During this process, hydrogen nuclei collide and fuse to give rise to heavier helium atoms and considerable amounts of energy (Halliday and Robert, 1966).\n\nThe gravitational force of stars creates the necessary conditions for fusion. Billions of years ago, the hydrogen clouds of the primitive Universe gathered under the effect of gravity and gave rise to very massive stellar bodies. Their extremely dense and warm core is the seat of the Universe fusion process. All these processes which are lighting (Petrescu and Calautit, 2016b) and warming the Universe are processes of warm fusion, thermonuclear reactions.\n\nTo produce such a thermonuclear reaction on earth, some special conditions are needed. First the required temperatures should reach some values hard to imagine today and much hard to achieve them.\n\nIt has long been believed that the temperature required to heat the merger would be about tens or hundreds of millions of degrees.",

Baryons like protons and neutrons become dominant during the final stages of freezing. The finite volume size effects become evident at low density values, which corresponds to the last stages of fireball evolution. Although there is some uncertainty about the fireball's existence during The result of our calculations using formula 5 for the meson and nucleon stages of the evolution of the hadron fireball these late stages, a generalization of the vdW model to the nucleon fireball was proposed in [14] to describe nucleus-nucleus interactions during the last stage of freeze-out when new particles are not produced (T < 135 MeV). To simplify the model, the average energies of internucleon collisions are restricted to not exceed the production threshold of other hadrons, and only two varieties (protons and neutrons) are considered. The density of protons and neutrons is assumed to follow from the conservation of baryon number, and the nucleon composition of colliding nuclei is assumed to be known. The effective potential of the interactions between protons and neutrons, protons and protons, and neutrons and neutrons can be represented using the same model as in Fig. 4. The hard-core radius of the proton is assumed to be known, while the radius of the neutron is much smaller than that of the proton. Thanks to the known relationship between the number of protons and neutrons in heavy nuclei, n p = kn n , where k < 1, the two-component nucleon model essentially reduces to a one-component model. Similarly, since the lifetime of neutral pion mesons is much shorter than that of charged mesons, the same can be said for the two-component meson model. Interestingly, despite the crudeness of such a one-component approximation for the real multi-component vdW gas of the hadron fireball, as shown in Fig. 5, a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of calculations by other authors is obtained for the chemical potential (see, for example, Fig. 2 and Fig. 6).",

The explosion pressure is only slightly dependent on the vessel volume, which plays a role in the assessment of explosion hazard.From these results it was concluded that the isomer structure does not play a significant role in maximum explosion pressure development and for LEL and UEL.The slight difference between 0.02 m 3 and 1.00 m 3 is attributed to heat lost in the vessel walls [13].Figure 8 plots a comparison of the pure 1-propanol-air and 2-propanol-air mixtures at various initial temperatures, 11 equivalence ratios, and p 0 = 100 kPa.",

Critical conditions are described in terms of dependences A 0 (ω) at the critical boundary with all the other parameters being fixed. Since the parameter δ is assigned a subcritical value, then the procedure is to increase the amplitude A 0 (at fixed frequency ω) until some critical value of the amplitude is reached. Such a procedure correctly determines position of the critical boundary.\n\nEquation (5) is solved numerically using Crank-Nicolson scheme with a central difference approximation for the second derivative (only m = 0 is considered). Equation (6) is solved using implicit, first order in time difference scheme. Within each time step, an appropriate number of sub-iterations are performed to achieve convergence to a coupled solution satisfying both (5) and (6). To ensure appropriate level of grid-independence, spatial and time steps are refined to the point where relative error in output values does not exceed 10 −6 . Typically, ten internal sub-iterations are required within each time step.\n\nCritical boundary A 0 (ω) is determined by separating infinitely growing solutions from the bounded solutions. In the present intrinsically non-linear problem this can only be done numerically, to a certain accuracy.\n\nThe procedure followed in the present study is similar to 1 . Infinitely growing, corresponding to explosion conditions, temperature history profiles have an inflection point. First, the time interval [0, τ * ] is fixed and the amplitude is being increased until an inflection point appears at τ = τ * . Such an amplitude provides an estimate for the exact position A 0 (ω) of the critical boundary. To limit the dependence of this estimate on the actual value of τ * , similar estimation is obtained using the interval [0, 2τ * ]. The parameter τ * is increased until the relative error between the two estimates falls within 2%. The amplitude corresponding to the [0, 2τ * ] estimate is taken as a final position of the critical boundary.

For the constant-temperature curves γ SEOP increases steeply with temperature (as expected), owing to the growth of the γ SE term because of its dependence on [Rb]which approximately doubles with each ∼10°C increment in this regime. 28 Indeed, at 74°C γ SEOP is anomalously high: 77.8(±4.0) × 10 −3 min −1 compared to 29.9(±1.2) × 10 −3 min −1 at 72°C (just 2°C lower). This ∼2.6-fold increase indicates that [Rb] is significantly higher than what would be expected based on the externally measured OP-cell temperature, 28 indicative of metastable conditions where increased laser absorption begins to result in more elevated gas temperatures and greater energy dissipation into the inner cell walls (and hence higher [Rb] in the vapor phase)a condition dubbed \"Rb prerunaway\". 20 Values for %P max also increased with temperature but peaked at 72°C, with %P max (74°C ) being lower by 5.0% ± 1.2% (Table 1).

Furthermore, the ultimate goal of the SEOP procedure is to maximize %P max in biomedical applications, and even small gains in %P max are welcomed. Such behavior has been observed previously, 14,15,19,20,24 and can be explained by the decrease in the spatial average of the Rb electron spin polarization, ⟨P Rb ⟩, resulting from greater optical density and poorer overall Rb illumination, because %P max = ⟨P Rb ⟩γ SE (γ SE + Γ Xe ) −1",

Figure 4 shows level lines of the stream function for different values of R p and F K . If we put R p = 3500 and chose small Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, then we first observe two vortex regimes similar to those  shown in Figure 3. The center of the two vortices move to the corners by increasing the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter (the two first cases correspond to the stationary convective regime). For larger values of F K = 3.75, more vortices appear. They compress each other and pack vertically. This case corresponds to the oscillatory convective regime. Figure 5 shows the maximum of the stream function as a function of time for R p = 4 × 10 3 and for different values of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter. For F k > 2, instead of a stationary solution, we observe periodic oscillations. Figure 6 shows the mean value of the temperature as a function of the mean value of the stream function. The solution forms closed curves, which correspond to periodic oscillations. The structure of these curves changes with the increase of F K . For small values, it is a simple ∞-shaped curve. For large values, it becomes double ∞-shaped. The transition from one to the other is shown in Figures 6b and 6c where additional loops appear at the upper corners. A more complex structure of these curves for large F K can be related to more complex convective regimes with more vortices.\n\nIf we increase the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter even more and cross the boundary separating convection and explosion domains in Figure 1, the maximum of the temperature and of the stream function oscillate during some time and then begin unlimited growth (Figure 7). It is an oscillating heat explosion similar to that found before in the case where fluid motion was described by the Navier-Stokes equations (Dumont et al., 2002). Thus, along with usual heat explosion where temperature monotonically increases, there exists an oscillating heat explosion where temperature oscillates before explosion. This effect is due to the interaction of heat release and natural convection.\n\n\nTHE MODEL WITH NONSTATIONARY DARCY EQUATION\n\n\nThe New Model Setting",

The explosion limit and pressure change characteristics of the CO/CH 4 /air mixed gas were recorded using a 20 L explosion tank. With the increase of CO concentration in the gas mixture, both UEL and LEL of CH 4 decreased, and the explosion limit range became wider; at the same CO concentration, with the increase of initial reaction temperature, UEL increased and LEL decreased. As the initial temperature increased, the P max of the CO/CH 4 /air mixture decreased. At the same initial temperature and with a CH 4 concentration close to the LEL, P max decreased as the CH 4 and CO concentrations decreased.\n\nAs CH 4 concentrations approached UEL, the P max became lower as the concentrations of CH 4 and CO increased.\n\nThe CO/CH 4 /air reaction process was simulated under oxygen-lean and oxygen-enriched conditions, respectively. The time when the mole fractions of H•, O•, and •OH reach their peaks increases with the increase of the CO ratio in the mixture. The mole fractions of •OH and O• during the reaction in the oxygen-enriched conditions were larger than those in the oxygen-depleted conditions, while the H• concentration was the opposite. In oxygen-enriched reaction conditions, CO increased the concentration of radicals and promoted the explosive reaction; while in oxygen-deprived conditions, it had the opposite effect and weakened the explosive reaction. Normalized TSC values of each reaction process showed that the higher the proportion of CO in the mixture, the higher the TSC value, and the greater the effect on the temperature during the reaction.\n\nR155 CH 3 + O 2 ⇌ O• + CH 3 O in the positive reaction and R158 2•CH 3 (+M) ⇌ C 2 H 6 (+M) in the negative reaction have the greatest effect on the temperature change.

Depending on a physical problem different approaches are employed. For the calculation of nonrelativistic energies of a two-electron diatomic molecule the best way is by the use of Kolos-Wolniewicz basis functions, namely w 1 = 0 and arbitrary nonlinear parameters u, w, x, y. The master integral can be calculated numerically using Eqs. (34) and (37). Integrals with powers of interparticle distances can be obtained by using analytic recursions Eq.

The master integral can be evaluated according to Eq. (27), and integrals with additional positive powers of interparticle distance can be obtained through recursion relations Eq. (57).

The numerator of the rightmost term is the driving force for reactant transport from the GDL/CL interface (x = 0), where the reactant gas concentration is C CL (x = 0), to the Pt surface, where the reactant concentration is zero due to limiting current operation. The denominator thus gives R CL = coth(αL)/αD e f f CL . Because αL << 1, 16,43 using the first two terms of Taylor-series expansion of coth, we can thus express R CL as\ni lim = nFC CL (x = 0) R CL = nF D e f f CL dC CL dx x=0 = nF C CL (x = 0) coth(αL) αD e f f CLR CL = L 3D e f f CL + R Local ηa v L [6]\nThe first term on the right side of Equation 6 is the through-plane mass-transport resistance in the CL, and the second term gives the total local resistance close to the ionomer-covered Pt particles, summed over all Pt particles. Equation 6 demonstrates that the total local resistance dominates at low loadings since L decreases with decreased loading (for undiluted electrodes where thickness is proportional to Pt loading). η and a v remain constant for samples with constant primary particle loading (as mostly used in this study). 43 Other resistances such as ohmic, kinetic, and channel flow are minimal at limiting current and hence neglected. Our previous work provides a detailed derivation of these results and also accounts for ionomer-film thickness and agglomerate-size distributions. 43 Ono et al. also obtained a similar result using a transmission-line model. 16 However, they did not subdivide R Local into interfacial and transport components.

In the simplest case, this result follows by expanding the left bracket in the numerator of Eq. 11 to first (=leading) order in aF/kT and evaluating all the remaining integrals for aF/kT = 0 (leading=zeroth order in aF/kT ). In doing so, the integrals in Eqs. 7 and 10 become x-independent and, as a consequence, the denominator in Eq. 11 becomes equal to the right bracket in the numerator. An analogous (but more tedious) expansion resulting in 12 is also contained in (3). Both expansions, however, become questionable in the weak noise limit (small thermal energy kT ), since the expansion coefficients in general will inherit exponentially large values from the integrands exp{±[U (x)−U (y)]/kT } contributing via Eqs. 2, 7, 8 to the multiple integrals in 11. Our first remark is that Eq. 12 in fact still remains valid for asymptotically weak noise (kT → 0) and not too large F -values, so that the dynamics in Eqs. 1, 2 is governed by rare, thermally activated transitions between metastable states: In this case, the dynamics can be approximately described by a one-dimensional random walk between discrete sites at distance a with certain forward and backward hopping rates r + and r − , respectively. As a consequence (25), one obtains v = a(r + − r − ) and D = a 2 (r + + r − )/2. Furthermore, detailed balance symmetry (25) implies for the forward and backward rates the relation r + /r − = exp{aF/kT }.

We achieved this by the use of Slater orbitals, with the screening constants ®tted to modern wavefunction results (Clementi & Roetti, 1974) and so calculated using a modi®ed form of Slater's rules. For the energy dependence we have used a development of the model originally proposed by Thomas (1984) which gives an analytic result for the energy-dependent probability, normalized to the high-energy limit calculated in the sudden approximation.\n\nThe results obtained using this model agree well with experimental data, both for the standard EXAFS amplitude reduction factor S 2 0 (which is assumed constant, so is given by the high-energy limit) and for the energy-dependent probability as measured for rare gases.",

However, a finite probability density at the subsurface requires g(x,t | L − ∆x, τ) → C(τ), where C(τ) is some function that corresponds to the required subsurface probability density p(L, τ). To achieve this we counterbalance the loss of density as ∆x is made small by increasing the magnitude of the injected density at time τ by a factor ε(τ) such that lim ∆x→0 (ε∆x) = C(τ), and\nlim ∆x→0 ε(τ)g(x,t | L−∆x, τ) = (30) C(τ) L − x 2 √ π [D(t − τ)] 3/2 e − (L−x) 2 4D(t−τ) .\nComparing with the Taylor expansion in Eq. (29), we note that one can re-write Eq. (30) as\nlim ∆x→0 ε(τ)g(x,t | L − ∆x, τ) = −C(τ) ∂ g(x,t | x , τ) ∂ x x =L .\n(31) In the procedure above we have merely multiplied a solution of the diffusion equation (Eq. (27)) by a constant, and took the limit ∆x → 0, where higher orders of the expansion do not contribute, and the approximation in Eq. (29) is exact. Therefore, Eq. (31) is by itself a solution of the diffusion equation with an absorbing surface. A solution of this form is called a doublet (or a dipole in electrostatics).",

This section presents a method to reconstruct this from the discrete FDFs already obtained. When the width of each flame segment is sufficiently small, the change in flame response over one segment will also be small; the Taylor expansions for the gain and phase of the continuous FDF will be dominated by terms of zeroth and first order. The gain and phase can thus be approximated as linear functions of x , allowing the continuous flame describing function, F c , to be obtained by linear interpolation of the discrete FDFs, F j , for the series of compact flames. We assume that F c in the zone [ x j − l 2 , x j + l 2 ] takes the form:\nF c = N 0 (1 + β 1 (x − x j )) e i ( ϕ 0 + β 2 (x −x j ) )(20)\nwhere β 1 and β 2 are two linear coefficients for the gain and phase, respectively.

The fact that the second moment exists only ensures the applicability of the theorem in its most general form, where the normality of the distribution is reached in the limit of infinite sampling S → ∞. For a finite sampling S < ∞ the normal distribution is not generally satisfied, as it was indeed observed by J.R. Trail [82]  23 also sheds lights on the importance of the probability density function P . A bad choice of W leads to a variance V AR f (x s )ψ(x s ) 2 /W (x s ) that is not even finite, whereas a good W yields a finite value of V AR f (x s )ψ(x s ) 2 /W (x s ) , as we will see in the following sections. Moreover, whenever the estimator O L (x) =Ō is independent ofx we see an important property in the calculation of physical expectation values, namely that, for any choice of the weight W , the evaluation of the ratio: (24) yields always the same valueŌ, namely has zero variance, regardless of the fact that both the numerator and the denominator may have finite variances.

The issue comes from the combinatorial term, which does not cancel as in the limit of zero pressure the reduced density is ρ = ρ S = ρ S ρ * S and not zero. To ensure thermodynamic consistency the residual Gibbs energy of the adsorbed phase has to be corrected so that the combinatorial term is zero at zero pressure and a suitable expression is:\nG R A (T,P,N) RT = rN − ρ T + (1− ρ) ln(1− ρ) ρ + 1 +N ρ − ρ S 1 + ln ρ ρ S ∑ i x i ln φ i (1−φ S )x i + +N(z − 1 − ln z)(6)\nThe term multiplying the combinatorial part ensures that both the residual energy and the chemical potential of the adsorbates have the correct limit at zero pressure since\nlim P→0 ρ − ρ S 1 + ln ρ ρ S = 0(7)\nThis modification does not affect the single adsorbate case as the combinatorial term for a pure adsorbate is zero given that for a single adsorbate φ 1 = (1 − φ S ).

However, now the effect is more global, i.e., there is not as strong a spatial concentration of D N 2 H + frac following the column density structure. We also see that the similar levels of D N 2 H + frac that arise in these models are achieved with quite different absolute abundances of N 2 H + and N 2 D + .

In contrast, the models of §3.2.4 with a higher CO depletion factor have a clearer structure of D N 2 H + frac following column density. Therefore, we try a series of combinations of initial OPR H 2 and CO depletion to survey whether D N 2 H + frac can have a stronger correlation with column density. We consider two possible CO depletion factors: 10 and 1000, and four possible values of initial OPR H 2 : 3, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001. From the results of these eight models, initial OPR H 2 does not appear to enhance the spatial structure of D N 2 H + frac . Although the initial OPR H 2 does not further enhance the spatial structure, the models with high CO depletion factor and low initial OPR H 2 still show the possibility to obtain high values of D N 2 H + frac . We thus focus on two models, OPR0.01_fDCO1000 and OPR0.001_fDCO1000, which are listed in Table 1 and which will be considered further in the comparison to observed systems (below).\n\n\nCombination of N and CO depletion factors",

SAXS analysis has shown that the nanoparticle size is strongly dependent on the hydrophilic comonomer content of these amphiphilic statistical copolymers (Tables 2 and 3). This is consistent with the previously proposed PSC model. 34 This simple model assumes (i) perfectly spherical particles, (ii) a constant surface charge density across a copolymer series regardless of the copolymer composition, and (iii) that there is no solvent present within the nanoparticle (i.e., x sol = 0). In this prior study, it was found that a critical fractional surface coverage (SA frac. ) by anionic (B) units is required for colloidal stability. The spherical nanoparticle surface area can be calculated from the particle radius (R). Thus, if SA frac. is independent of the nanoparticle size, the mean number of anionic B groups per nanoparticle (N B,p ) can be estimated using\nN k R 1/ 4 SA CS B B ,p 2 frac. π = × × (1)\nwhere CS B is the cross-sectional area of a single B repeat unit calculated from the approximate volume of a single B unit, V B (CS B = V B\n\n\n2/3\n\n) and k is the fraction of the B groups located at the particle surface. k equals 1 when all of the anionic B groups are located at the nanoparticle surface.

In the latter case, the nanoparticles are not colloidally stable (N B,p tends to infinity, suggesting that an infinitely large particle would be required to form a stable dispersion).

When the gas temperature increases over 20 K and the CO on the icy mantles is released to the gas phase, D frac (N 2 H + ) decreases rapidly and reaches the steady-state value in less than 0.1 Myr. Even in the starless phase, if the core is turbulent and the temperature is higher than 20 K, D frac (N 2 H + ) can reach values lower than those typical in the low-mass starless cores. The same is true for D frac (HCO + ). Other molecules such as HCN and HNC need about 1 Myr to reach the steady the state and could be useful to age massive protostellar cores and UC Hii regions. D frac (H 2 CO) in only useful to prove the hot core phase. Once all the icy mantles are evaporated, D frac (H 2 CO) reaches the steady-state value in a short time. \n\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have determined the values of D frac for a large sample of molecules (C 2 H, HCN, HNC, HCO + , H 2 CO, N 2 H + , and NH 3 ) toward the PDRs IF and MP2 position, around the UC Hii region Mon R2.

In reality, N depletion should also happen where CO depletion occurs, although perhaps at a more modest level (Flower et al. 2006b). The level of N depletion will naturally affect the absolute abundances of N 2 H + and N 2 D + .\n\nTo investigate the influence of N depletion, we run simulations using two higher N depletion factors ( N = 100, 1000), and with CO depletion factor set to 1000. The results are plotted in the left  two columns of Figure 8. It is easy to see that the column densities of N 2 H + and N 2 D + are reduced and the spatial structures of D N 2 H + frac are enhanced (note that in this figure the range of D N 2 H + frac now extends up to values of 10).\n\n\nCombining higher cosmic-ray ionization rates with other models\n\nIn §3.2.3, it was shown that cosmic-ray ionization rate has a strong impact to the level of D N 2 H + frac and its spatial structure. However, we have not yet investigated its influence on the models with higher depletion factors. Thus combinations of an higher cosmicray ionization rate of = 1.0 × 10 −16 with the fDCO1000 and fDN100_fDCO1000 models are carried out. The results are also plotted in Figure 8. These models do not show a strong effect of further enhancement of the spatial structure of D N 2 H + frac . However, due to the effect of shortening chemical time scales, the enhanced cosmic ray models have generally enhanced levels of D N 2 H + frac by about a factor of 10 than in the lower cosmic ray cases.

Biological therapies including monoclonal antibodies and immune effectors have been the subject of multiple research projects. Pore-forming proteins may become the other biological strategy to overcome the problems associated with current treatments. But detailed mechanisms of their action on target membranes remained to be elucidated. We aimed to study the cytotoxic effects of recombinant form of fragaceatoxin C on AML cell lines HL-60 and KG-1.Materials and Methods:We cloned the FraC gene in pET-28a (+) bacterial expression vector and the expressed recombinant FraC protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Then, cytotoxic effects of the recombinant protein were examined on two AML cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1. Effects of serum and calcium ion were explored by hemolysis assay in more details. Results: Our results showed that the recombinant C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged FraC protein has potent cytotoxic effects on both AML cell lines, with IC 50 =5.6, and 4.6 µg.ml-1 for HL-60 and KG-1 cells, respectively. Serum showed dose-dependent and also time-dependent inhibitory effects on the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the FraC protein. Pre-incubation of the toxin with different concentrations of calcium ion also inhibited hemolytic activity of FraC toxin. Conclusion: Results of the present study showed that FraC has potential anti-tumor effects. By detailed investigation of the inhibition mechanism of serum and calcium effects in the future, it can be possible to design target sites for clinical applications of the toxin.\n\nIntroduction",

It can be expressed as\nE frac N ( ) E N ( ) − E PWL N ( ), N M + δ, E PWL N ( ) 1 − δ ( )E M ( ) + δE M + 1 ( ), 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1, E PWL N ( ) 1 + δ ( )E M ( ) − δE M − 1 ( ), −1 ≤ δ ≤ 0, ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭(68)\nwhere E(N) and E PWL (N) define the energy and PWL interpolation of energy for fractional number of electrons, respectively. Here, E frac is a measure of deviation from PWL behavior. Depending on the choice of range, two different cases arise; when E frac < 0, the curve is convex and it is concave for E frac > 0. The well-known DFAs meet certain challenges, resulting in a smooth convex curve, whereas EEX demonstrates reverse trend. RSH functionals which comprise these two ingredients have shown improvement in this direction (Mori-Sánchez et al., 2006). According to Janak's theorem (Janak, 1978), for (G)KS HOMO, the change in ϵ HOMO as a function of fractional occupation number should be straight line. This is then followed by a finite jump at integer point (due to derivative discontinuity). After that again, the variation should be a straight line till the following integer point.

In this study, NcoI restriction site of the pET-28a (+) expression system was used to have minimal modification of the N-terminal of the recombinant protein (only one Met was added to N-terminal of FraC protein). Also, the XhoI restriction site has been used to have minimal number of amino acids in the affinity tag on the C-terminal of the protein.\n\nResidues added to the C-terminal were as follow; [Leu-Glu-(His)6]. Of course it will be more interesting if the FraC toxin could be cloned without any additional amino acids other than affinity tag like streptolysin O in a recent study (32) to explore if there is any difference in IC 50 of the recombinant proteins. But, the data of the present study shows that any impact due to the additional amino acids in the C-terminal on hemolytic activity of FraC protein is unlikely. Cytotoxicity results of the present study using trypan blue assay show that recombinant FraC has potent antitumor activity against both HL-60 and KG-1 cell lines. These results were comparable to cytotoxic activity of other actinoporins on leukemic cells and RBCs (16,33).",

We then carried out an extensive survey of different astrochemical model parameters and properties, i.e., initial ortho-to-para ratio of H 2 , cosmic ray ionization rate, heavy element depletion factors, degree of chemical pre-aging, to investigate how high levels of deuteration, approaching unity, can be achieved, which are needed to explain the observed PSCs. We have found that a model with relatively high cosmic ray ionization rates (1.0 × 10 −16 s −1 ) and high depletion factors of CO (1000) and N (100) is able to match observed properties of some PSCs, i.e., D N 2 H + frac ∼ 0.1 to 1 and absolute abundances of these species, within the followed evolution of the core, i.e., within 0.8 ff = 61 kyr. However, it should be emphasised that this is just an example model and other combinations of parameters are expected to also be able to give similar agreement with these observational metrics. One additional metric that may help break degeneracies is the spatial structure of D N 2 H + frac , i.e., how it correlates with column density.

It is to be remarked that there can be significant uncertainty in the estimates of the observed column densities, e.g., due to excitation temperature uncertainties (e.g., see the case of the C1-S and N cores observed by Kong et al. 2016). Estimates of the abundances of the species bring in additional uncertainties associated with the measurement of H . The observed values of [N 2 H + ] range from about 10 −11 to 10 −9 , while those of [N 2 D + ] range from about 10 −12 to close to 10 −9 . Focusing on the abundance plots, we see that the range of observed core properties is well covered by the simulations. For example, the model CR4x_fDN100_fDCO1000 reaches the high values of D N 2 H + frac that are observed in some cores with typical abundances of [N 2 H + ] ∼ few × 10 −10 . We see that variation in , i.e., the parameter controlling the degree of N depletion from the gas phase, is one way that the simulations can be tuned to match a given observed system. Given the uncertainties in predicting the degree of N depletion from first principles, one strategy when modeling a population of cores in the same region (assumed to have similar environmental conditions) is to set this empirically based on observations of N 2 H + and then use any observed differences in N 2 D + abundance as a measure of evolutionary stage, with absolute age differences estimated from such simulations.\n\n\nSpatial structure of D N 2 H + frac",

In contrast, in the presence of SM/DOPC (1:1) vesicles, the bands of treated and untreated toxin display the same molecular mass (Fig. 7A). The mutein 8-69 OX bound to membranes was also employed, because its N terminus remains exposed to the solvent constrained by the disulfide bond. As expected, 8-69 OX was also susceptible to the proteolytic activity of PK in DOPC and SM/DOPC (1:1) vesicles. To determine the extent of the cleavage, the proteins were subjected to sequencing of their N-terminal regions. The sequencing data revealed that, in the presence of vesicles of DOPC, FraC WT and 8-69 OX were cleaved at the N terminus by PK, rendering products in which the first 4 and the first 11 residues, respectively, were missing (Fig. 7, B and C). FraC bound to SM/DOPC (1:1) was not digested by PK as expected from the position of the band in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, whereas 8-69 OX was cleaved at the same position seen after incubation with vesicles of DOPC. These results demonstrate that the N terminus of FraC in DOPC vesicles (prepore configuration) is accessible to PK, i.e. this region is not embedded in the lipid bilayer.\n\n\nDiscussion",

These oligomers, presumably corresponding to pore particles, cover the SM-rich domains in an arrangement previously observed in FraC and other actinoporins (44,45) or the SM-specific PFT lysenin (46). The crosssection profile of the oligomeric complexes reveals an average diameter of 7.5 Ϯ 0.6 nm, a value in good agreement with the  mean diameter (average of outer and inner diameters) of the pore determined by x-ray crystallography (ϳ8 nm). Eight protein chains are observed in three well resolved pore particles encountered (see for example Fig. 5C). Because prepores of FraC were not resolved in DOPC (high diffusivity prevented AFM contouring), a construct of FraC bearing a double cysteine mutation (V8C/K69C, termed 8-69 OX ) was instead examined on supported membranes made of SM/DOPC (1:1). Under oxidizing conditions, the N-terminal segment of this mutein is covalently attached to the protein core by means of a disulfide bond, preventing the protein from generating a transmembrane pore, and thus inactivating the toxin (15,23). As with WT FraC, the construct 8-69 OX also gave rise to a dense array of pore-like particles (Fig. 6), indicating that the protein readily oligomerizes in the presence of membranes even if the N-terminal region remains attached to the protein. The average diameter of these particles (6.2 Ϯ 0.7 nm) is somehow smaller than that of WT protein, reflecting the influence of the N-terminal region attached to the ␤-core region. Because of the constraints imposed by the disulfide bond, the conformation of the N-terminal region in 8-69 OX is likely to differ from that of WT FraC bound to liposomes made of DOPC (Fig. 3, D and E). To further investigate this question, we employed biochemical assays (see below).",

This dual approach produced new SA frac. values based on the real composition of the particle surfaces measured by SANS. Moreover, the linear relationship between log P and SA frac. remained valid for the new data (Figure 6a). A new linear regression was fit to the data, yielding SA frac. = 0.110 × log P − 0.085. This new equation can be used to predict particle size if it is assumed that k remains constant in the PSC model. The cationic copolymer series was similarly reanalyzed. Combining the data obtained for the anionic and cationic series (Figure 6b) produces a linear relationship (R 2 = 0.96) between log P and the modeled SA frac. (k = 0.5). This highlights the self-consistency of the refined PSC model. Finally, the linear equation representing the relationship between log P for the hydrophobic comonomer and the modeled SA frac. for the MAA copolymers crosses the x-axis (i.e., SA frac. = 0) at a log P value of between 0.5 and 1. This suggests that, at this log P value, the nanoparticles would require no ionic comonomer to be located at the surface to confer colloidal stability. Alternatively, a comonomer exhibiting a log P of between 0.5 and 1, or below 0.5, would not be sufficiently hydrophobic to induce self-assembly, hence, such copolymers would remain molecularly dissolved in an aqueous solution.\n\n\n■ CONCLUSIONS",

I recommend evaluating the kinetic rate constant and the constant of association/dissociation for the different protein biomarkers. We have added a comment on the voltage dependency of the capture rates.

We did this, separating β2-microglobulin; EGF and endothelin 1 from each other (See new Figure 4 in main text)\n\n\nReviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):\n\nIn this manuscript titled \"Electro-osmotic Capture and Ionic Discrimination of Peptide and Protein Biomarkers with FraC Nanopores\", the authors report a FraC nanopore-based approach for the identification and distinguishing of homologous peptides and proteins. FraC was engineered to generate strong EOF to attract the proteins into the pore lumen. Using EOF as the driving force makes it a versatile method for analyzing proteins carrying different surface charge. Five protein analytes ranging from 1.3 kDa to 25 kDa were investigated. They generated distinct ionic current blockades for identification with FraC. Particularly FraC was shown to resolve endothelin proteins with just a single amino acid variation. This is a well conducted work, where a new biological nanopore is introduced for protein identification with high resolution. The manuscript is clearly written and enjoyable to read. I recommend the publication of this work i n Nature communication with minor revision. We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment.\n\nThe minor issues are the following: Page 5 line 102: \"Since the constriction of ClyA is lined with aspartic acid\" the ClyA should be FraC. We fixed this.\n\nIn the SI, page 17 line 220: The same mistake We fixed this.",

To calculate the [NH 2 D]/[NH 3 ] ratio, we took the NH 3 column density derived by Montalban et al. (1990) from the integrated intensity maps of the (1,1) and (2,2) lines observed with the Effelsberg telescope. The beam of the NH 3 observations was ∼42\". Taking into account possible calibration differences between the two telescopes and that the pointings are not exactly the same, we consider that the uncertainty could be as large as a factor of ∼5.\n\n\nComparison of the IF and MP2 positions\n\nIn this section we compare the chemistry of the different velocity components. The 10 km s −1 component presents similar abundance ratios toward the two positions, and these ratios are different from those in the 12 km s −1 and 8 km s There are no important chemical differences between the 8 km s −1 and 12 km s −1 components, suggesting that they correspond to gas at a similar kinetic temperature, probably because they are equidistant from IRS 1.\n\nThe values of the deuterium fractions are quite similar for the three velocity components. Values around 0.01 are found for all of the observed species except for DCO + and N 2 D + which present a deuterium fraction 10 times lower. The largest differences are found for C 2 D, D frac (C 2 H) being ∼4 times higher in the 8 km s −1 component toward the MP2 position than in the others. The hydrogenated compound of this species is also very abundant in this component, suggesting that opacity effects could contribute to this higher value of the deuterium fraction. We would need to observe the 13 C isotopolog to obtain a more accurate value of D frac (C 2 H). The deuterated species N 2 D + and D 2 CO have only been detected in the more shielded components at 12.0 km s −1 (N 2 D + ) and 8 km s −1 (D 2 CO), again consistent with these velocity components being associated with colder gas, farther from IRS 1.\n\n\nComparison with other sources",

The model considers every single coiled coil to fold two-state like in thermodynamic equilibrium. The ratio between unfolded and folded coiled coils is Boltzmann-distributed where the energetic difference G(F) between the two states depends on the applied force F [23]:\nG(F) = G 0 + G stretch (F, L folded , L unfolded ) − F · L · x frac (F),(1)\nwhere G 0 denotes the folding free energy at zero force ( G 0 = 24 k B T for LZ10). G stretch accounts for the difference in the work required to stretch an unfolded coiled coil to a given force F compared to the work required to stretch a folded coiled coil to the same force. The last term in equation (1) denotes the reversible work upon unfolding of a coiled coil at a force F. x frac denotes the fractional extension of the coiled coil relative to its contour length. We calculated x frac by inverting the WLC-interpolation formula [24] with a persistence length of p = 0.7 nm. The overstretching and unzipping linkage geometries differ by the length increase L upon unfolding (unzipping: L zip-folded = 0.9 nm, L zip-unfolded = 25.6 nm, L zip = 24.7 nm; overstretching: L str-folded = 5.5 nm; L str-unfolded = 12.8 nm; and L overstretch = 7.3 nm). The contribution of all coiled coils to the extension of the polyprotein at given force F is then:\nX (F) = N unzipping x frac (F) · L zip-unfolded 1 + e G zip (F) + L zip-folded 1 + e − G zip (F)\n+N overstretching x frac (F) · L str-unfolded 1 + e G str (F) + L str-folded 1 + e − G str (F) . Fitting this expression to the force extension data allowed us to determine the number of unzipping linkage geometries (N unzipping ) and the number of overstretching geometries (N overstretching ).",

Fractionality as an indicator of efficiency in DFT+U corrections\n\nWithin the context of reducing E dev errors with electron addition and removal, a motivating factor for employing DFT+U is that in the limit of a single atom with an orbital being emptied or filled, the fractionality should rise from zero at the endpoints to a maximum value of 0.25 when a ½ charge is added. In real systems, the fractionality of the endpoints is not zero, but a rise in fractionality may occur as fractional charge is added.

The COSMO volume and surface for the pure species obtained from the COSMOSAC-2013 model have been used to calculate the combinatorial term. Since we use the same combinatorial term in the model for the asymmetric interaction due to the size and shape differences between the solute and solvent species, we changed the asymmetric contribution coming from the residual interaction by changing the standard state of the g asym i/S from 1 to 2.71 and hence by making the asymmetric contribution slightly more asymmetric towards the less solubility region based on our proposed assumption at the very beginning of this model i.e.; g LANL i/S Z 1. Therefore, we focus on obtaining a more accurate activity coefficient at infinite dilution.

However, simulations with the model developed in this study (eq 26) showed that breakthrough experiments would only give a change of 0.2 percentage points, which is probably in the same order of magnitude as the precision of most measurement methods. A total protein load of 120 g/L would, according to the simulations, give a change of more than one percentage point. It might, however, still be difficult to measure. A number of attempts with an in-line refractive-index detector were made, but the insulin had such a high impact on the signal that the potential change due to ethanol adsorption or desorption was undetectable.\n\n3.1.1. Case-Specific Model Simplifications. The retention and solubility data ( Figure 1) suggest an almost linear dependence of ln(A d ) and especially ln(x P ) on the molar fraction of ethanol in the solution. As a consequence, the flexibility of Wilson's equation needed to be restrained. The second last term of eqs 14a, 21, and 22, ln(φ + x M ), will become a constant if φ ≫ x M . If φ ≪ x M , the term will add a variation of approximately 0.25 to ln(A d ) and ln(x P ), which is rather small in this context. ln(φ + x M ) was thus assumed to be constant and was combined with ln(A 0 ) and ln(ω). Similarly, the denominator in the term including the unknowns α and β only changes by approximately 6%. Consequently, β/(χx M 2 + θx M + E W,M ) was also included in the constants. An even smaller variation, potentially changing ln(A d ) by ±0.01ν, was calculated for c tot . This variable is per se not problematic because its value can be calculated if the density is known, but both ν and A 0 cannot be estimated from the linear-range retention data. The assumption that c tot varies insignificantly enables the combination of the factor (Λ/c tot ) ν with A 0 .",

This minimum work of separation depends only on the composition, temperature and pressure of the initial mixture and different final fractions.

To derive this standardized effect size, the natural log of the response ratio (lnR) was calculated [25], except for CH 4 and SOCSR, as follows:\nlnRR = ln(X o /X m )(4)\nwhere X o and X m are the mean values of variable X (e.g., maize yield, NUE, N emissions, C emissions) in the organic and mineral fertilizer treatments, respectively.

The total Γ for TX165 and RL or SF calculated from Equation (6) for the aqueous solution of TX165 with the biosurfactants mixture at the constant concentration of one component and variable of the other one in the range of the constant concentrations below C sat min is close to the Γ calculated from Equation (5). However, for the aqueous solution of TX165 + RL and TX165 + SF at a constant composition, the differences between the values of Γ determined from Equations (5) and (6) are observed ( Figures  S35 and S36). There may be two reasons for that. One can refer to the value of n in Equation (5) used for calculations, which is connected to the anionic biosurfactants of the 1: 1 type electrolyte, but their molecules in the mixture cannot be completely dissociated and the n value used by us is not proper. The other reason may result from the fact that, as mentioned above, H 3 O + can be joined with the oxyethylene groups in the hydrophilic part of TX165 molecules [37]. In such a case, RL and SF can be treated as nonionic surfactants. In the calculations of Γ for TX165 and the biosurfactants, there are the x S values, whose determination is based on the contribution of particular components of the TX165 with RL and SF mixtures to the water surface tension reduction. For the determination of the composition of the mixed monolayer at the water-air interface, the relationship between the x S values calculated from the contributions of the components to the reduction in the γ W and their mole fraction in the mixed monolayer is of significant importance.

It represents the frequency of occurrence of lipophilic atoms exactly at five bonds from ring Carbon atoms. If the same lipophilic atom is simultaneously present at four or less bonds from any other ring Carbon atom, then it was excluded during the calculation of fringClipo5B. Thus, this descriptor highlights the importance of ring Carbon atoms and lipophilic atoms. Another molecular descriptor which indicates the importance of lipophilic atoms is flipoplaN2B.

If the same planer Nitrogen atom is simultaneously present at one bond from any other lipophilic atom, then it was excluded during the calculation of flipoplaN2B.

Having the information about calculated number of carbon atoms in the molecule, we can calculate the number of double bonds or rings, or DBE (double bond equivalent) number. This number can be obtained in the following way: DBE = X -(0.5xY) + (0.5xZ) + 1, where X -calculated number of carbon atoms, Y -number of hydrogen atoms, Z -number of nitrogen atoms. Due to lack of nitrogen atoms in the proposed molecule, the component (0.5xZ) shall not be used in calculation. In this way, if we take the C = 22, which is number of carbons in the proposed molecule, then we get DBE = 4 (the number of hydrogens in the proposed by authors molecule is H = 38).

For the purposes of this discussion we do not distinguish between and an ion and a molecule, and we may therefore use the terms interchangeably. The RMS energy uncertainty is given by:\n∆E = kT 2 C v(1)\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C v is heat capacity [1,2,3]. One can estimate the heat capacity using the equipartition theorem. By analogy to the Debye theory of heat capacity of crystals, at room temperature we can assume that most of the vibrational degrees of freedom of a large protein molecule are low frequency modes and can therefore be considered to be fully thermally active. Each oscillator will contribute to the heat capacity, and there are three oscillators per atom. If the molecule contains vibrationally active atoms the equipartition theorem [3] predicts a heat capacity of C v = 3kN . Since we are dealing with large ions we ignore the fact that there are three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, which would effectively reduce by a count of six. After some substitutions and algebra we have:\n∆E = √ 3N kT(2)\nConsider an averagine molecule with chemical formula C 9877 H 15517 N 2715 O 2955 S 83 . In counting atoms to generate a value for N we exclude hydrogen atoms, because they are associated with high frequency modes which, generally speaking, are not thermally activated at ambient temperatures. We therefore calculate by counting the number of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms in the molecule, giving a value of N = 15, 630.\n\nSubstituting this into the Eq. (2) and assuming T = 300 we estimate the thermal energy uncertainty for a single ion to be ∆E = 8.97 × 10 −19 J. Using the relationship between mass and energy from special relativity E = mc 2 we calculate the energy uncertainty to be equivalent to a mass uncertainty of ∆m = 9.98 × 10 −36 kg or ∆m = 6.00 × 10 −9 Da.",

Extrapolating the graph one might assume up to 10 ms are spent in the range 1800-2000 K. Since uncatalyzed NO production at 4000 K is 1000 times faster than catalyzed production at 2000 K, one might assume that ice crystals actually serve to reduce the amount of NO produced.However, both uncatalyzed production at 4000 K and catalyzed production at 2000 K are converting all the available nitrogen atoms in the cylinder to nitric oxide, which would imply equal NO production from the catalyzed and uncatalyzed processes.This is true within the range of ice parameters (concentration, mass, capacitance) that converts all available nitrogen atoms to nitric oxide.This is where the long residence time at 2000 K becomes important.Bhetanabhotla et al.

First, the utility of a mass spectrometer is based on its ability to distinguish molecules based on the mass and the charge of the ions they generate in an ion source. The principle that makes HRMS compared to conventional \"unit\" resolution mass spectrometry really useful is rooted in atomic physics with regards to the distinct nuclear binding energy of each isotope of every element, the mass defect 5 : the difference between the exact mass and nominal mass. With carbon-12 set at 12.00000 Da (where Da = Daltons, units designated one twelfth the mass of carbon-12), the exact mass of nitrogen-14 is 14.00307 Da. The mass defect for nitrogen-14 can then be calculated as 14.00307-14.00000= 0.00307. The exact masses, mass defects, and relative abundance for the most pertinent isotopes of common organic elements are in Table 1. It is important to note that in mass spectrometry when referring to elemental isotopes that they are typically stable isotopes-hence when a method is developed that utilizes an isotopically-labeled analogue of an analyte the heavy are C-13, not C-14; hydrogen atoms are typically replaced with deuterium, not trititum. However, as is listed in Table 1 there is a natural abundance of heavy stable isotopes for a given element and that abundance will determine the isotopic distribution. Mass spectra can be difficult to interpret. Their interpretation is best facilitated when considering both the calculated mass defect of a peak as well as the presence of other peaks nearby. Interferences observed in method development may be part of the isotopic cluster of a compound with a different monoisotopic mass-the mass of a molecule that consists of the most abundant isotopic species of each element (e.g. C-12, H-1, N-14, etc.). The analytical consequence of each elemental isotope having a slightly different mass defect is that if the m/z of an analyte can be accurately measured, then the exact molecular formula can be determined computationally, provided the measurement was done with sufficiently high resolution. This is a distinct mechanism for analytical specificity from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), whereby",

In the case of 1,3,5-triazine the scaled peak in the ratio is shifted to 50 eV but has approximately the same height and width as in benzene. The Hubbard theory provides a simple interpretation of the triazine results. The symmetry is captured in a six-site two-sublattice model with periodic boundary conditions (Ui = UN, i = 1, 3, 5; Ui = UC, i = 2, 4, 6).

When adding nitrogen atoms to graphene molecules, the bandgap of graphene can be manipulated so that nitrogen-doping graphene changes its optical and chemical properties. [6][7][8] For example, nitrogen-containing graphene has been reported to emit blue luminescence. 6 Furthermore, since nitrogen atoms can have a partial charge, they are likely to react to other chemicals. Nitrogen-doped graphene has been reported to have high electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction. 7,8 More specically, Kim and coworkers have recently discovered that nitrogen-containing benzene (aza-benzene) molecules make carbon dioxide molecules react with nitrogen atoms of aza-benzene in the anionic state through excess electron delocalization. 9,10 Using photoelectron spectroscopy as well as theoretical calculations, they noted a much higher value of vertical detachment energy (VDE) than adiabatic electron affinity (AEA), which indicates that the structure had a signicant difference between the neutral state and anionic state. In addition, M. A. Johnson and coworkers proved this chemical reaction using IR vibrational spectroscopy. 11 Both Johnson and Kim concluded that a covalent bond was created between the carbon of carbon dioxide and the nitrogen of aza-benzene. Since the excess electron migrates to the anti-bonding orbital of a CO 2 molecule, the bond order of the C-O bond decreased and so this chemical reaction is a reducing reaction of CO 2 molecules. This indicates that a reduced CO 2 molecule is more likely to react with other chemicals than a neutral CO 2 molecule. Thus, this is the rst step in converting carbon dioxide molecules to other useful chemicals. 12 Similarly, Weber and coworkers found that carbon dioxide molecules reductively interacted with anionic metals and oxygen molecules. 13,14 This means that even though the electron affinity of carbon dioxide is slightly negative, it",

One may conceive the idea of mobile functions as in \"fly\" basis set design and this is particularly useful strategy when applying ab initio non-BO calculations to species with non-standard masses. However, even for real but less familiar quantum particles like the positive muon and associated muonic molecules, employing such strategy facilitates \"from scratch\" basis set design. Since this strategy may be used for both nuclear/PCP and electronic basis sets, the resulting basis functions are not biased, carrying the \"fingerprint\" of their \"environment\", which is a major advantage in contrast to the usual \"pre-designed\" basis sets with fixed variables.

On the other hand, local descriptors from conceptual DFT, such as f´and P´, are representative of the soft reactivity, which have a greater orbital influence [59].

Such particles that have arisen during ion bombardment of a target are called recoil atoms.

It can be represented in a body-fixed reference frame (x , z ), illustrated in Fig. 1 using Jacobi coordinates, where the z -axis lies on the vector R pointing from the center of mass of the cyanide towards the lithium atom. Here, the relative distance between the nitrogen and the carbon atom is labeled r CN and the angle between R and r CN is referred to as ϑ = (R, r CN ). Consequently, the regions near ϑ = 0 and ϑ = π correspond to the LiCN and LiNC isomers, respectively. When described in a body-fixed reference frame the angle α = (ê z , R) yields the overall orientation of the molecule relative to a space-fixed coordinate system (x, z) as also indicated in Fig. 1. Here,\nLi C N θ R r CN x z α z '\nx '\n\nFIG. 1. Coordinate description of the LiCN LiNC isomerization reaction. The vector R connects the center of mass of cyanide (CN) with the lithium atom (Li) and the relative distance between the carbon (C) and the nitrogen atom (N) is denoted as rCN. The angle between R and rCN is labeled ϑ. A body-fixed coordinate system (x , z ) is attached to the center of mass of the cyanide with the z -axis along the direction of R. An additional angle α is introduced between the z-axis of a space-fixed coordinate system (x, z) and the vector R (and therefore the z -direction of the body-fixed reference frame). It describes the possible rotation of the LiCN molecule within the (x, z) plane. e z is the unit vector in the z-direction of the space-fixed coordinate system.",

Figure 7 presents the radial distribution of nitrogen atoms in coatings with different lengths and surface densities of ligands. The number of nitrogen atoms located in spherical bins of 0.1 nm thickness was calculated and divided by the number of ligand molecules in a particular coating. The total probability of finding a nitrogen atom integrated over distance from CoM is thus equal to unity. As stated above the results presented were averaged over 40 independent simulation frames. At ligand surface densities below 3 molecules per nm 2 (which correspond to up to 24 molecules attached) the coating layer represents a mixture of different conformation states. Nitrogen atoms in the low-density coatings are scattered over a wide range of distances from the CoM of the core; this effect is especially seen for thiol-PEG 2amine coatings. The plot for the low-density coatings containing PEG 5 molecules also indicates a bimodal distribution for the position of nitrogen atoms, whereas this effect becomes less prominent for the coatings made of PEG 8 and PEG 11 molecules. As shown in Figure 7 nitrogen atoms are preferentially distributed at larger distances from CoM, whereas small islands corresponding to a higher probability of finding a nitrogen atom are also clearly seen at about 1 nm distance from CoM. The positions of nitrogen atoms are close to the calculated average position of sulphur atoms, 0.85 nm from CoM. This indicates that low-density coatings made of shorter ligands have several distinct conformation states, namely molecules curled tightly around the core as well as elongated \"brush\"-like structures. As both the surface density and the length of ligands increase the molecules ac-quire predominantly the \"brush\"-like shape. This behaviour is due to the fact that the characteristic distance from the CoM to nitrogen atoms increases gradually with increasing the density of ligands.",

These three molecules have similar structures, but acridine and phenazine have one or two carbon atoms replaced with nitrogen atoms.

An ICG molecule has two nitrogen atoms, one positive, the other partially positive. As a result, the ICG molecule can anchor itself to the negatively charged LAP disk. Thus, a reasonable way to explain results of Table 1 is that association and binding equilibria take place in solution.

This implies that equilibrium (4) removes monomer from the dimerization process and, by virtue of Le Chatelier's principle, part of the dimer breaks down to form monomer. In other words, the total amount of dimer is reduced. The empirical formula of the LAP-RD is known to be Na + 0.7 [Si 8 Mg 5.5 O 20 (OH) 4 ] -0.7 [1].

Moreover, equilibrium establishes that, in the presence of large LAP excess, the amount of complex produced depends only on ICG concentration. Hence, if ICG concentration is kept fixed in the experiment, the absorption spectra acquired at 1, 2 and 3% of LAP overlap.\n\nThe positive charge on the nitrogen atoms makes the LAP-ICG interaction stable enough to hold the molecules close together.

The enhanced activity of the nitrogen-doped materials is usually correlated with the incorporation of the more electronegative N (3.04) atoms, relative to C (2.55) atoms within the sp 2 carbon lattice, thus a different charge density among the adjacent carbon atoms, and facilitating the oxygen chemisorption [114,115]. For example, it has been demonstrated that N-doped reduced graphene oxide provides suitable support for anchoring Pt nanoparticles of 2.8 nm diameters [116]. The resulting hybrid reducedgraphene-oxide-supported low-Pt-content (5.31 wt%) catalyst has exhibited high ORR electrocatalytic activity and very good stability which have been attributed to the existence of the synergistic effect between N-doped carbon matrix and Pt, as well as to the presence of the stable Pt-N-C chemical bonds. The doping nitrogens have been reported to provide pathways for the distribution of electrons at the electrocatalytic interface as well as to act as bridges between the support and Pt nanoparticles, thus preventing the Pt-metal active sites from detachment, dissolution, migration, and aggregation. In particular, the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of Pt deposited onto N-doped graphene nanosheets has been attributed to interfacial changes of the platinum electronic structure in the presence of nitrogen functionalities and to better utilization of Pt catalytic sites during ORR [117]. The effect of electronic interactions between Pt and N-doped carbon on the ORR performance has been studied and analyzed using XPS and DFT approaches [118]. Here, the formation of Pt-N chemical bonds has been postulated, which facilitates electronic transfers from Pt sites to the carbon support and induces changes in the oxygen adsorption energy at the platinum surface. This strong interaction led to ca. about 2.1-fold increase (relative to the performance of Vulcan XC-72 support) in the ORR mass activity at 0.9 V vs. RHE. The weaker adsorption of molecular and atomic oxygens has also been demonstrated in the case of the N-doped substrates and correlated with the elongated O-O distance and lower energetic barrier for the O 2 dissociation. In addition, the performed calculations have implied strong interactions between Pt clusters and N-doped graphene, thus leading to lower resistance for electron transfers facilitating electrochemical reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst.

The average overall distribution of charges among all atoms in the studied molecules are shown in Fig 6a-h. However, the most revealing data is the Hirshfield point charges on the nitrogen and the oxygen atoms. As can be seen from Fig 6e- This strongly suggests that these sites are relatively reactive. However, as it was shown in section 3.2.1 the nitrogen is strongly bonded to the surrounding carbon atoms and therefore cannot participate in any reactions. On the other hand, the oxygen atoms have more negative charge which can cause interaction with neighborhood molecules. Also one can see a slight effect when including the van der Waals corrections. Our calculated point charges can be compared to those found in the General AMBER force field (GAFF) data base. For example, the sp-hybridized carbon atom is parameterized with the charge 0,360, the sp 3 -hybridized carbon atom -0,878, the nitrogen atom -0,530, and the oxygen atom -0,465. In our calculations all of molecules, both with and without van der Waals corrections, we see that two sp-hybridized carbon atoms (triple bonded atoms) inside one molecule have different charge values while in the standard force field they are equivalent. The difference in the charge can be explained by the influence of the cyclohexane/piperidine ring: carbon atoms located closer to the ring have more negative charge. On the other hand, the cyclohexane/piperidine ring also feels the influence of acetylene, hydroxy-and ether substitutes: charge values of sp 3 -hybridized carbon atoms inside ring differs depending on position of the atom and distance between the atom and the substitutes. Also one can see the common trend for all studied structures that sp 3 -hybridized carbon atoms closer to the triple bond have more negative charge while the same type of carbon atoms located closer to the ethers radicals contain less negative charges. However, the sp 3 -hybridized carbon atom (atom 1 in Fig.5) connected both to the OH-group and acetylene-containing radical has strong positive charge which is approximately twice more than the GAFF value.

A great improvement in the performance of the instrum ent was obtained by cementing a small lens (1 cm. in diameter and 3 cm. focus) in a hole in the disc near the rim. This lens formed a real image of the source of light, which was viewed with a short focus lens or eyepiece, the image, of course, moving with the velocity of the lens. The lens is inserted in such a position on the disc as to ensure its moving in a nearly horizontal direction at the moment the spark occurs, i.e.,the lens should be at the top of the in the sparking position.

A frame overlap mirror between the second pulse shaping and the wavelength band chopper hinders parasitic cross talk between pulses at wavelengths longer than 16 Å. Two slits define the beam collimation and hence the angular resolution. The first slit about 4 m upstream the sample position is located behind the frame overlap mirror, while the second slit, defining the footprint of the beam on the sample, is located directly in front of the sample position (distances of a few cm can be set). A third slit behind the sample limits the neutron entrance window of the shielding mounted on the secondary reflectometer arm towards the area detector of 30 cm x 30 cm. The spatial resolution is approximately 2 mm and the maximum distance between sample and detector is 2 m. A very first slit right upstream of chopper 1 is used to limit the beam width to enable high wavelength resolution and to reduce background. The sample position as well as sample holders and substrates (Si-crystals) and a specific sample environment are being designed such that neutron reflectivity measurements can be combined with insitu IR spectroscopy in its surface sensitive ATR-mode (Fig. 1).

It was enclosed in a dark house with a window covered with a Wratten No. 62 green filter in order to match the light of the bacteria, which is decidedly greenish. Observation of the bacterial light with a small spectroscope and rather wide slit showed a broad band with red and blue at the ends. As the slit was narrowed the band becomes smaller and its center is at about X = .51~. The lamp was run at 5.5 volts and a measurement 1 of the transmission of the No. 62 green filter at this color temperature gave .05 transmission. To calibrate the lamp, a careful measurement of the illumination (without the No. 62 green filter) on the opal glass comparison screen was made with a Macbeth illuminometer with the lamp at a given distance, and the inverse square law applied for other distances. The Macbeth illuminometer read directly in foot candles. To convert to lamberts Kindly made by Dr. Forsythe.\n\nwe use the formula: foot candles X 1.076 X .82 (reflection factor of test plate of illuminometer) = millilamberts.

Given the limited spectral resolution inherent in our detection  technique and only fair spatial resolution these trends are at best an indication of the size distribution of the BL emitters. We defer a more complete analysis of the spectral variation of the BL spectrum until after completion of an ongoing program in collaboration with D.G. York which maps the complete RR nebula with dense spatial coverage using the 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. Figure 4a shows the distribution of the ratio of bandintegrated BL to the total scattered light in the same band at various positions along the two slits. Figure 4b illustrates the spatial distribution of the BL and the scattered light intensities on a normalized scale. Due to the anisotropy of the phase function, scattered light is strongly forward directed and falls off steeply as we probe regions where our line of sight penetrates regions of the nebula where larger scattering angles predominate. The BL, on the other hand is due to fluorescence and is an isotropic emission and thus falls off less steeply. Thus, the spatial variation of the BL and scattered light along the two slits reveals the isotropic nature of the BL. Therefore, the ratio I BL /I Scat increases away from the star, whereas the actual intensities fall away from the star as the density of emitters and the exciting radiation both decrease. It is equally illuminating to note that the BL intensities have similar profiles along the two slits, whereas the distribution of the scattered light it quite different; along the slit closer to the star, the scattered light falls off more steeply than along the second slit as the relative change in the distance from the central star varies more slowly in the latter case. Figure 5 displays the spatial distribution of the bandintegrated intensities of ERE and the BL along the two slits and the 3.3 µm UIR-band emission along a 5 ′′ south (PA=-85 • ) slit ( Fig. 1 and 2 show the apertures).

The flash of light from the spark passing through a small hole gives an instantaneous excitation to a small mass of mercury vapour which is moving upward with a high velocity. By the time it bursts into luminosity it has already moved up a short distance, and as it continues to ascend, the moving lens carries its image to the right. The tangent of the angle which the oblique image thus formed makes with a horizontal line is the ratio of the velocity of the vapour to that of the lens, and this angle was found to be about 23°. This gave 17 metres per second as the velocity of the vapour. Observations of the fluorescent flame showed that the luminosity commenced about 1-5 mm. above the excited region. This gives us for the time interval 1/11,400 second, a value somewhat\" smaller than the one obtained by the first method. The former is probably more nearly exact. A small bulb was now substituted for the inverted U-tube, heated by a column of hot air rising from an asbestos chimney. The spark was placed close to the bulb, and the fluorescence occurs chiefly on the inner surface on the side facing the spark (superficial fluorescence) owing to the density of the vapour.The whole slit was simultaneously illuminated by the fluorescent light under these conditions, and it was expected that the image seen with the moving lens would appear as in Plate 5,fig. 6. I t was found, however, that the band of green fluorescent light was joined to the image of the slit formed by the light (white) of the spark scattered by the walls of the bulb. This explained at once the difficulty found in getting results by the first method, in which the bulb was viewed through a narrow slit in the disc. The greater density of the vapour in this case evidently reduces the time interval between absorption and emission to something less than 1/40,000 of a second, as this would give a displacement of a millimetre, which could be observed without difficulty. A vertical tube of quartz about 2 cm. in diameter and 10 cm. long, was now substituted for the bulb, and the pool of mercury at the bottom heated by a small flame.

Laser light was focused into the specifically designed quartz sample cell (external dimensions 10×10×40 mm, internal dimensions 2×2×35 mm) filled with viroid solution (10-20 μL) by an infinity-corrected long working distance objective (Olympus MA10, M = 10X, NA = 0.25). Excitation power was attenuated to~300 mW in the sample cell. The same objective was used to collect the Raman signal in a backscattering geometry and to deliver it onto the spectrograph (Acton SpectraPro 2500i) coupled with deepdepletion back-illuminated NIR CCD (Princeton Instruments SPEC-10 400BR/LN). The Raman light was focused on the spectrograph entrance (slit width 30 μm) by an achromatic lens with f = 75 mm. The Raman signal was separated from the laser light by two Semrock RazorEdge long pass filters (grade U). One filter, with λ laser = 780 nm, was placed perpendicularly to the optical beam just before the focusing lens; another one, with λ laser = 830 nm, was used as a dichroic beamsplitter at an angle of incidence of 45°: it reflected laser light at 780 nm and transmitted all the wavelengths longer than 785 nm. Raman spectra were acquired with the WinSpec software; further data treatment was performed using Igor Pro for Windows software. To obtain the viroid Raman spectrum, the contributions from the PBS and quartz cell were subtracted from the recorded spectrum, normalized on the water bending band around 1640 cm -1 . Spectral resolution of Raman experiments was~5 cm -1 ; frequency calibration was performed using Raman lines of toluene with absolute accuracy ±2 cm -1 and relative frequency position accuracy better than ±1 cm -1 . The total accumulation time for one Raman spectrum was 10 to 30 min depending on the sample studied.",

This allows detection of single molecules with high contrast, which is required to visualize even weak signals. 33 Furthermore, PcH 2 is non-polar and therefore essentially unperturbed by residual charges in the mechanical masks. 34 We use a thermal beam, containing a wide range of molecular velocities and thus de Broglie wavelenghts. If all these velocities were to overlap at the detection screen, it would obscure many of the details present in the diffraction pattern. To prevent this, we restrict different velocities to different regions of the quartz plate. For that purpose, we use a horizontal delimiter S y (see Fig. 3). In combination with the source, it defines the free-flight parabolas of the molecules in the presence of gravitational acceleration g. As the free-fall distance H = g(L 1 + L 2 ) 2 /(2v 2 ) depends on the molecular velocity v, slow molecules fall further than fast ones and thus they are separated at the position of the detector.

We verified that the attenuation of the laser was independent of its power at the source by measuring the laser power at the objective lens for several different intensity settings. The laser power at the objective lens is always about 10% of the source power due to optical loss in the optical system in the equipment.\n\nTo detect the Raman spectra, it is necessary to focus the laser on a microparticle through a high-magnification objective lens. However, the focal lengths of such lenses are generally small. In the cryostat, the ice sample has to be kept at a stable temperature so that microparticles and the ice section itself do not move during the measurement. Therefore, managing the heat flux from the objective lens to the ice sample is a significant problem.

Because the feeble Stokes scattering is collected by an f/1.2 photo camera lens and dispersed in a 1 m monochromator equipped with a LN 2 -cooled CCD camera (Princeton, PyLoN 400B), the slit nozzle can be much shorter (4 mm). To minimize readout noise, the expansion is run continuously over 7-9 min and the photon signals along the center section of the slit nozzle are collected in and binned from 400 pixel rows of the CCD chip during this time, whereas the 1340 pixel columns contain the spectral information at a resolution of about 1 cm À1 . Cosmic ray removal is achieved by comparing several such data blocks and calibration of the 532 nm laser and Stokes signal is pushed to about 1 cm À1 by neighboring Ne and Kr discharge lines with known vacuum wavelength. The signal-to-noise ratio is maximized by using as much laser intensity as possible for the scattering, in the present case 20-25 W supplied by a Millenia eV solid state laser from Spectra-Physics and focussed parallel to the slit exit at variable distance with a 50 mm focal length lens.

A major part of this background comes from chlorophyll autofluorescence that is emitted at wavelengths much longer than the dominant emission bands of the pigment (685 nm, 695 nm, and ca. 730 nm) due to the excitation with a 785 nm beam. [29]. The fluorescence emission contributes by a spectral signal monotonously falling with increasing wavenumber and varying from location to location in a single cell. Besides the pigment autofluorescence, glass coverslip contributes a broad peak (width ~500 cm −1 ) centered at ~1,400 cm −1 whose intensity depends on the distance from the coverslip surface. The overall nonspecific background of varying intensity and shape hampers the quantitative analysis of the heights of selected Raman spectral peaks.",

It has already been stated, that certain carbohydrogen flames afford spectra exhibiting bright lines separated by dark spaces. I n no spectrum are these lines more easily observed than in that of the Bunsen gas lamp. In order to distinguish the phenomena of the spectrum which are due to different portions of the flame, it is sufficient to place the lamp before a narrow vertical slit not exceeding O2 inch in height, through which its light passes to the prism.* If t h e lamp be gradually raised before the slit, t h e spectrum first seen will be derived exclusively from the envelope of the flame, which reaches high above the top of the interior cone. This spectrum is tolerably bright, extending without the least interruption, from the line C, nearly to the line H of FRAUNHOFER, and exhibiting no bright line whatever except the yellow line R. That line, however, is extremely flickering, so as often to disappear completely; and it seems due entirely to the yellow scintillations which abound in the exterior envelope. When the flame is raised still higher, so as to bring the top of the green cone into view, four other bright lines begin to appear; and as we continue to raise the flame so as to derive light from lower and lower portions of t h e flame, the bright lines become more and more clearly defined, owing to the intervening spaces becoming darker; and some fainter lines become visible. At length, when light passes through the slit only from the lowest portions of the flame where t h e exterior envelope nearly disappears, t h e ::* bright lines become so sharply defined as to admit of their places being ascertained by actual measurement, with almost the same accuracy which is attainable in observations of the dark lines of the solar spectrum. From the facility with which t h e lines of the carbohydrogen spectrum are i obtained, I conceived they might be of use in optical researches; and I soon e found them of great service in the prosecution of my experiments. I was, therefore, anxious to ascertain whether they belonged really to the gas flame, or were caused",

The polarised parallel beam passes through another nicol and falls on the slit of a wave-length spectrometer. When the nicols are not crossed, a continuous spectrum extending over the entire visible region is seen in the field of vision. When the nicols are crossed and an anisotropic plate introduced between them in a favourable position, there is restoration of light and the slit is once again illuminated. The two com pounds into which the polarised beam is split up by the passage through the crystal are in a position to interfere if the crystal plate is really plane parallel and the entire field is covered with alternating bright and dark bands. The wave-length X corresponding to the position of the dark band is connected with the thickness of the crystal plate by the equation nX = t(y.1 -~ g.2), where [a! -\\x2 is the retardation produced by the crystal plate, if it were of unit thickness, between the two components.

The laser diode is connected to the input end of the fiber optic cable for the first steps of the optics alignment. A custom slit mask, manufactured by the Universität Konstanz Workshop, covers the output end of the fiber optic cable, inside the chamber, shown in Figure 4c (Figure 4c #26). The slit mask was constructed from two half disks welded onto a 3.2 mm circular plate with a 1 mm center hole. A~50 µm spacer is held between the two half disks while they are welded to the circular plate. The diameter of the plate is slightly smaller than the diameter of the barrel of an SMA fiber connector tip. A small amount of epoxy at the edge of the slit mask fixes it to the SMA connector tip. Fiber optic cables utilized in this design include adjustable SMA adapters (Figure 4a #27), where the length of the barrel extending from the tip of the connector may be varied. Adjustment of the barrel length is important for collimating the light reflected from the illumination collimating off-axis parabolic mirror (OAPM) (Figure 4a #28). The slit mask covered SMA adapter is inserted into the OAPM, and the SMA barrel length adjusted until good collimation is observed. The laser diode provides a strong beam that may be projected onto a surface 20 to 30 cm away while the room is dark. Good collimation will occur when the tip of the fiber is located precisely at the focal point of the OAPM (Figure 5a #29); 15 mm in this case. It is important to ensure the orientation of the slit mask remains orthogonal to the radial dimension of the mirror in the optical assembly while adjusting for collimation. The beam is slightly distorted due to the slit geometry of the fiber tip opening, this allows for orientation, while still approximating good collimation.

As mentioned in Supplementary Note 1.2, successful application of MBD depends on the difference between one channel and the other. From this point of view, we conduct slit-modulation of the spectrograph to form different detecting channel. More specifically, four home-made slits with different shape, including single slit, double slit, cross-shaped slit and triangular slit, are applied in our research. What's more, the width of single slit is also modulated and therein results in three levels: narrow (~15 μm), moderate (~30 μm) and broad (~50 μm). It is worth noting that reducing the slit width will significantly deteriorates the quality of the spectra as well as the SNR. Therefore, we use only a relatively narrow slit (~15 μm) to make a difference between the channels to show the potential of the proposed method.

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range.

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

Another important aspect to consider is that 225 Ac requires a much lower activity to produce cytotoxic effects at the cellular level with regard to beta emitters, because its energy is deposited in an extremely localized manner.

It is suggested that solubility of DU compounds affects its absorption and also toxicity. Soluble chemical forms have more quick absorption than insoluble forms which their absorption generally takes months to years. So, chemical toxicity probably has main role in health effects of soluble forms of uranium while radiotoxicity is more likely is involved in the chronic health effects of insoluble forms which usually can deposit in the lung and local lymph nodes and retained for long time (28).\n\nRadioactivity of DU mainly relates to 238 U which has very low specific activity and particles of 238 U release radiation very infrequently. 238 U decays primarily by alpha emission. Alpha particles have little penetrating power and quickly lose their kinetic energy. If just the alpha emissions take into accounts for radioactivity of DU, only 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium retained in DU. But, during the decay process of DU, beta and gamma emissions produced by DU daughter isotopes or decay products such as thorium 234 and protactinium -234. It has been shown that beta and gamma particles are more penetrating than alpha emission. But alpha radiation can be dangerous when absorb into body. Deposition of alpha particles in various organs results in emission of its energy in a concentrated area that could leads to greater damage than beta or gamma radiation. In overall, if radioactivity of beta and gamma emissions were considered, the radioactivity of DU calculated as 75% of the natural uranium (7,29).",

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

In the 'CASCADE' code, the neutron, proton and alpha particles were the main particle emission channels and the lithium or boron or carbon particle was used as a fourth particle channel one at a time. The 'CASCADE' code executed typically 35 sequential decay steps until the crosssection of the evaporation residues fell below 1 mb. The final summed evaporation spectra of the alpha, lithium, beryllium, boron and carbon particles obtained from the calculations were fitted with eq(1) to obtain the corresponding slope temperatures which should indicate the average temperatures of the corresponding ensembles of the residual nuclei. The 'GEMINI' code [1] calculations were done to compare with the 'CASCADE code calculations. In the 'GEMINI' code, neutron, proton, alpha and lithium particle emissions were calculated using Hauser-Feshback transition state formalism. The emission of heavier fragments such as beryllium, boron and carbon were treated as evaporation emissions simultaneously. The emission of the fragments from the sequential decay of the pre-fragments (those are produced in the initial binary decay of the compound nucleus) is included in the 'GEMINI' code. The 'GEMINI' code gave relative cross-sections for the emission of different ions and the spectra were normalized with respect to the corresponding calculated spectra from the 'CASCADE' code to compare the corresponding spectral shapes calculated from the two codes. The calculated spectral shapes of alpha, lithium, beryllium, boron and carbon obtained from the 'CASCADE' agree very well with the corresponding spectral shapes calculated by the 'GEMINI' code.

The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section.

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

Calculations based upon parameters given in Figs 2 and 3, and ICRP PUBLICATION 23 (1975) for organ weights, mucous layer thickness and flow rate, airway diameters and lengths, etc. (HARLEY and PASTERNACK, 1979) show that most of the doses to the pulmonary region are about 30 times those to the bronchial epithelium for people exposed to long-lived actinide elements in the environment (i.e. submicron particle sizes), depending on the alpha energies and the assumed depth of the sensitive epithelial cells. For alpha-emitting radionuclides with radioactive half-times less than about 15 days, the bronchial epithelial dose exceeds that to the P region. This is also true for larger particles, radioactive vapours and gases, and for oral breathing, which results in large depositions of inhaled particles in the T-B region. For particles greater than 10 fim AM AD, deposition in the T-B region may be nearly complete.\n\nIt would appear that treatment of the T-B, P and PLN regions of the lung as one composite organ of mass 1 kg and calculating a smear dose for this organ is highly undesirable, as it masks what may be the biologically significant doses delivered to the different regions of the lung. STOBER et al. (1969) have stated that the most powerful parameter for describing the dynamic behaviour of a particle in the airborne state is the aerodynamic diameter. This is defined as the diameter of a sphere of unit density which, in a mechanical force field, assumes the same steady-state velocity as the actual particle under consideration. Mathematically, or, since the density p ae is unity C p where the subscripts refer to aerodynamic equivalent (ae) or the actual particle (p), d is diameter, p is density and C the slip correction factor.\n\n\nSmall particle deposition estimates and use of probit scales",

Three alpha particles form an equilateral triangle in its ground state [6] and form a linear chain for the 0 + excited state. Alpha structures of the low-lying states of 12 C and 16 O, including their 0 + excited states, have been studied within a framework of nonrelativistic macroscopic and microscopic methods [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. These studies treat alpha particles as inert clusters, and thus miss any detailed structure of nuclei and any change of the internal structure of alpha particles in a nucleus. For the study of detailed nuclear structure in these highly excited super-deformed nuclei, we need to use a mean field approach.\n\nIn nuclear mean field theory, a nuclear system is composed of nucleons interacting strongly through a mean field potential. While the nonrelativistic mean field approach uses a phenomenological mean field potential as a function of nucleon density, the mean field potential in relativistic mean field theory is determined as a resultant of meson exchange. After Walecka proposed a relativistic mean field (RMF) approach for a nuclear system in which Dirac nucleons interact by exchanging classical meson fields [15], it has been extended to include various quantum effects and successfully applied in describing nuclear matter and finite nuclei [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27]. However the usage of the mean field approach is limited to spherical or moderately deformed nuclei due to the limitation of the size of the functional basis space. To describe highly deformed alpha chain structure, we construct, in this paper, a functional basis space for the axially symmetric RMF calculation by appropriately locating single particle levels of 4 He.",

We introduced a similar parameterization to allow for the effect of the tensor force on the wave function. Unlike for the SMSO, for the tensor case we used a real number for the geometrical shift of one spin-up proton and one spin-down neutron in opposite directions. This shift enhances the S = 1, T = 0 component, in other words, a deuteron-like component. We call this parameterization SMT (simple method to include the tensor force). By combining SMSO and SMT, we calculated the energy of some N α systems, 4 He, 8 Be, and 12 C. Since the tensor interaction in this calculation is not the bare interaction, the energy gain from the tensor part is not as large as that which can be obtained from the tensor force in an ab initio calculation with a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. A comparison of the results of SMSO-SMT calculations for 8 Be and 12 C reveals a competition between the spin-orbit and tensor forces. For 8 Be, the optimum alpha-alpha distance is large and the dissolution is small. The energy gain from the tensor force is larger than that obtained in the 4 He case. On the other hand, for 12 C, the optimum value of the alpha-alpha distance is not so large as in 8 Be, and the dissolution parameter becomes large so as to allow the spin-orbit interaction to have a larger effect. The energy gained from the tensor interaction becomes small in this case.\n\nThe cause of such a difference between 8 Be and 12 C can be attributed to the following mechanism. A small alpha-alpha distance like that in 12 C hinders the particle-hole-like excitations, which would be involved in the dissolution of the alpha particle, due to the Pauli principle. A large alpha-alpha distance, in contrast, does not suppress the particle-hole excitations. Hence, in the 8 Be case, the energy gain of the tensor interaction becomes large.\n\n\nApplication to the carbon isotopes",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs.

The paradox during alpha-decay can thus be resolved similarly to that of the thermonuclear reactions: quantum tunnelling [74,75]. This means that during alpha-decay He 2+ particles tunnel through the nuclear force barrier out of a heavy nucleus. By comparing the mass of a parent nucleus with the sum of the masses of its daughter nucleus and the separated He 2+ we see a mass deficit of the decay products.

For example, a linear relationship between the number of cH2AX-foci and cell viability for both isotopes is evident (Fig. 4). Furthermore, cH2AX phosphorylation in the tumor tissue correlated well with the inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 7). In line with the in vitro experiments unexpected significant differences were not detected between the Ac-225-DOTATOC and the Lu-177-DOTATOC treated groups. However, the efficacy for both treatments over controls was demonstrated. Although reliable subcutaneous growth with small variance is an inherent property of the used animal model and repeated measurement analysis further reduce variance, small differences between both radioactive isotopes cannot be excluded and remain likely. With an in vivo tumor doubling time of approximately 2 days, a growth delay of 15 to 20 days equals a tumor control fraction of 90-95% of tumor cells achieved by single treatment with either 44 kBq 225 Ac-DOTA-TOC or 34 MBq 177 Lu-DOTATOC. We can speculate, that differences in DNA repair and apoptosis pathways in some tumor tissues possibly increase the therapeutic effect of alpha emitters over beta emitters (for example in hypoxic/radioresistant cells). In vivo dosimetry cannot be calculated reliably since time activity information on the tumors was not obtained. On assumption that half of the number of decays measured at the single time point (48h after treatment) add to the tumor dose, a rough dose estimation could be made from a tumor tissue activity concentration of 45 kBq * 0.075 ID/g = 3.4 kBq/g for 225 Ac-DOTATOC and 35 000 kBq/g * 0.075 ID/g = 2625 kBq/g for 117 Lu-DOTA-TAOC. These activity concentrations are thus multiplied by 0.5 (some of the tumor bound activity will be released and some will decay at time points where an effect on tumor is no longer expected) and energy is calculated from numbers of decays and particle energy/decay [27,28]. After conversion of the respective units (electronvolts to joules with 1.6E-13 J/MeV, and g to kg,) such an estimate would deliver approximately 10 Gray of alpha particle dose and 25",

In DT fueled reactors in particular the α-particles produced will deposit, during slowing down, most of their energy to the plasma electrons. The highly energetic alpha particles are expected to destabilize MHD modes known are Alfven eigenmodes. The strong nonlinear coupling among the energy deposition profile of the alpha particles, the new MHD instabilities, the bootstrap current and the plasma boundary, will make transport properties significatively different from those observed in current tokamak experiments. [1] Hence, active control of particle densities and plasma temperature will be essential in order to regulate the power density and to suppress fluctuations in plasma parameters due to turbulence and/or changes in confinement modes.\n\nHere we report the results of a burn control study of an ITER FEAT-like tokamak by means of radial basis artificial neural networks with Gaussian nodes in the hidden layer and sigmoidals in the output layer using a two-temperature volume-averaged 0-D § E-mail address: vitela@nuclecu.unam.mx model, [2] assuming the particle density is homogeneous throughout the plasma core, with electrons and ions having the same radial profile but different peak temperatures.

It is assumed that the energy confinement time of the reactor follow the IPB98(y,2) scaling and that the helium ash particles confinement time τ α , is independently estimated \"on-line\". Their current estimated value contains noise due to turbulence and/or intrinsic measurement uncertainties, and is fed, together with the electron and ions temperatures, the electron density and the helium ash fraction, into the RBNN controller. The control actions are implemented through the concurrent modulation of the refueling rate S f , the neutral He-4 injection rate S α , and the auxiliary heating power density deposited to the ions and the electrons, P aux,i and P aux,e , respectively, which can take values only within appropiate minima and maxima.\n\n\nModel",

The method is very simple and it is based on measurement of the energy loss of ions (charged particles) through the matter. This method is widely used to measure energy degrader, backing and target thicknesses for nuclear reaction experiments [1,2,[6][7][8]. The energy loss of a charged particle after it traverses a material of thickness t can be calculated by\n∆E = ∫ t 0 dE dx dx (1)\nHere, it is assumed that the particle range is greater than the material thickness (R>t) and dE/dx is the total stopping power. If t≪R, one may take the stopping power as a constant, and equation (1) is turned into, where (dE/dx) E 0 is the total stopping power for the initial energy of the particle. According to equation (2), if the energy loss ∆E measured and the total stopping power is well known, thickness of material can be easily calculated [5,9]. But, if the thickness of material is a considerable fraction of the range, stopping power cannot be considered to be a constant because the ions continuously loose their energy as they move through the matter, and also the stopping power changes with the energy (see Figure 1). In this case, in order to calculate an accurate thickness, one must take into account this effect, especially for a thick material. ThiMeT code [10] takes into account energy dependency of the stopping power, and it calculates the accurate thickness by using SRIM stopping power values [11][12][13].\n∆E = ( dE dx ) E 0 t(2)\n\nThiMeT Code",

Ehn et al. (2014) obtained their calibration factor from a permeation source using a perfluorinated acid and also showed through calculations that there were theoretical limitations for having a much larger or a much smaller value for C. This approach obviously brings large uncertainties to the HOM concentrations, which we estimate to be at least −50 % ± 100 % according to previous calibration results (Jokinen et al., , 2015Riva et al., 2019). More detailed information about the instrument can be found in Jokinen et al. (2012), noting that compared with the CI-APi-ToF used before, the long time-of-flight mass spectrometer used here has a doubled mass-resolving power enabling a more accurate assignment of molecular formulas. Simultaneously, we also used a high-resolution long time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-L-ToF-AMS) to measure bulk aerosol chemical properties (Decarlo et al., 2006). As no seed aerosol particles were added to the chamber, the VOC oxidation products lead to new particle formation and growth to large enough sizes to be measured by the AMS. We also periodically used a filter in front of the AMS inlet to see the influence of the background signal on measured aerosol mass concentration. There were 10 min of filter measurements per hour during our experiments. A PTR-ToF-MS (TOF-8000, Ionicon) was used to measure the concentration of alpha-pinene in the chamber. The instrument background was determined every day for 20 min by guiding the chamber air through a catalytic converter, which removes the VOCs. Then, the background-corrected signals were used to obtain alpha-pinene mixing ratios by using the calibration coefficient determined before the experiments. A description of the used set-up employed for the calibration and zero-air measurements has been introduced earlier (Schallhart et al., 2018). A custom-built DMPS system was used to measure the particle number size distribution from 10 to 400 nm in the chamber.

[19][20][21][22][23][24][25] The PHAZER chamber is one of few setups 19,26,27 that can operate at cryogenic temperature to simulate Titan's cold atmosphere environment. The other low temperature setup that can simulate Titan's low temperature atmospheric chemistry is the COSmIC/THS chamber at NASA Ames. 27 The cooling mechanism of these two chambers is different for running low temperature experiments. The gas is cooled by flowing through a cooling coil in liquid nitrogen with the PHAZER chamber; 19 while the gas is cooled through free-jet supersonic expansion with the COSmIC/THS chamber. 27 Temperature is a crucial factor for atmospheric chemistry simulations because it not only determines the species available for reactions by impacting the stability and condensation of gas molecules, but also affects reaction rate constants and heterogeneous adsorption of gases onto particle surfaces. 4 In this study, we conduct a series of Titan atmosphere simulation experiments by exposing a range of N2-CH4 gas mixtures to plasma discharge at low temperature with the PHAZER chamber. Plasma discharges and UV photons are the two main energy sources used for initiating the chemistry in Titan simulation experiments. 3,4 Solar UV flux is the main driver for Titan's atmospheric chemistry, but charged particles (i.e., cosmic rays, magnetospheric protons, and electrons) also contribute to the energy inputs greatly, especially when Titan moves across the Saturnian magnetopause and is fully exposed to solar wind. 4 Plasma discharges may be able to simulate the chemistry induced by the charged particles. Moreover, the energy distribution of the plasma discharges provides a closer simulation of the solar spectrum energy distribution than that offered by UV photon sources. 4,27 Laboratory experiments with UV photons usually employ a typical Lyman alpha emission lamp 4,7,16 or EUV photons at selective wavelengths (60/82.5 nm 28 , 73.6 nm 29 , 85.6 nm 30 , and 89.2 nm 31 ).

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10. Higher value for L n is needed due to the Coulomb force present within the A + p pair which is included via the screening and renormalization method [19][20][21].\n|p α q α (l α {[L α (s i β s i γ )S i α ]j i α s i α }S i α )JM\n\nPotentials",

It was then pre-equilibrated by contact with a uranium-free 5 m hydrochloric acid solution during 2 h of shaking and separated.\n\nFor uranium extraction, 2 mL of the aqueous solution was contacted with an equal volume of the preequilibrated organic solution. The mixture was shaken in a thermomixer at 20 • C during 1 h, and about 2 mL of the organic phase was sampled after 2 h of decantation for the spectroscopic measurements.\n\n\nB. Time-Resolved Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy\n\nThe sample was put in a 1 cm-long quartz cuvette that was placed in a TRLFS set-up as described afterwards. The excitation wavelength was provided by a tunable OPO system (PantherEx OPO, Excel Technology) pumped by a Nd/YAG laser at 355 nm (Surelite-I, Excel Technology). The excitation was tuned to λ ex = 427 nm which corresponds to a maximum of absorption by uranium(VI) in our samples. The 5 ns laser pulses were generated at 10 Hz for an energy of about 3.15 mJ. The detection set-up has already been described elsewhere [13]. The luminescence signal was collected during a gate width of 200 µs, at a gate delay of 100 ns after the excitation by the laser pulse. The luminescence spectrum of the sample was recorded at room temperature ((22 ± 1) • C). The luminescence spectrum presented in this work was obtained after 1000 accumulations. The background noise was subtracted from recorded spectrum.\n\n\nC. Computational details",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

We compared the influence of the initial random material configurations and photon distributions on the roughness, finding that the LER of resists exposed to an identical photon distribution differed by 0.8-1.36 nm due to the randomness in the distribution of photoacid generators and chain conformations. There was a more significant difference of 1.06-3.22 nm among identical resist conformations when the photon distribution was varied. This difference was caused by the photons being unevenly located in the interface and unexposed region, which resulted in the uneven distribution of highly deprotection chains over the resist and eventually the formation of rough patterns. We found that an increase in the ratio of deprotected sites in the exposed region can reduce the roughness through studies on the effect of acid diffusion, quantum yield, and exposure dose on the final resists. At a low exposure dose, slowing acid diffusivity from 0.2 nm 2 /s to 0.1 nm 2 /s resulted in an insufficient deprotection reaction during the PEB step and a failure of 16 nm patterning. However, when the number of acids was increased through enhanced quantum yield, the deprotection reaction in the exposed region was improved and the final roughness was reduced. Applying a higher-dose EUV light to resists resulted in lower LER values and prevented the photon shot noise effect from Figure 6.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

From these computed differences of the R U−Cl , we may expect different ratios of relative intensities in the vibronic progressions of the uranyl chloride and uranyl bromide complexes. The calculated frequencies have been compared with data from experimental Raman and IR measurements of different crystals or liquid samples of [R 4 N] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] [54-56]. The computed symmetrical stretching frequency ν s ([Bu 4 N] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ]) matches the value measured for the [Et 4 N] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] crystal [55].

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract ν s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane. The resulting ν s value amounts to (836 ± 18) cm −1 . It is in good agreement with the values, (823 ± 14) cm −1 , 825 cm −1 , and (850 ± 25) cm −1 observed in acetone [7], [C 4 mim][Tf 2 N] [8], and in [Bu 3 MeN][Tf 2 N] [9], respectively. This vibration corresponds to a Raman active vibration of the uranyl unit and can be correlated to the yl-U -O bond length. Using the empiric relation of Bartlett and Cooney [47]:\nR U−O /(Å) = 106.5 × ν −2/3 s + 0.575(1)\nwe calculated the U -O bond length to be equal to (1.77 ± 0.01) Å (using ν s = (836 ± 18) cm −1 ) for our uranyl sample. This value is in a good agreement with all experimental data listed in Table I, and can therefore serve as reference data to assess the accuracy of the ab initio calculations we will now discuss.",

Some of the ground-state vibrational frequencies are responsible for the band spacing in the experimental luminescence spectrum, while the atomic displacement between the ground and excited-state geometries is responsible for the intensities ratio. The uranium -halide (ν U−X ), uranium -oxygen(ν s ) symmetrical stretching modes and uranium -oxygen bending mode (ν b ) contribute to the luminescence spectra shape to a large extent, and their values for the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2complexes are listed in Table II. The uranium -oxygen asymmetrical stretching mode (ν a ), which is vibronically silent, is also shown to discuss trends. Using the vibrational perturbation theory [52,53] as implemented in Gaussian 16 [25], we have computed the anharmonic corrections, which turned out to be small, of the order of 5 and 3 cm −1 for the ground and excited states respectively (See Table S2 in the ESI).\n\nFor the gas-phase [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2model, the computed ν U−Cl , ν b , ν s and ν a frequencies are smaller in the excited state than in the ground state by 4, 4, 80 and 115 cm −1 , respectively. The PBE0 calculations reproduce with an impressive accuracy the measured red shift of the stretching mode, ν s , 82 cm −1 , in Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 , and underestimates that for the bending mode, 20 cm −1 . The latter discrepancy has negligible impact as the symmetric stretching ν s dominates the vibronic progressions in the luminescence spectra.",

Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O.

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

The counter-ions in the secondcoordination sphere only sligthly affect the calculated frequencies with respect to the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2bare ion; the uranium-chloride stretching mode is 29 cm −1 higher, the uranyl bending mode has increased by 13 cm −1 , while the uranyl symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching modes were found to be lower by 18 and 14 cm −1 , respectively. This is a result of the loss of symmetry together with the interplay of some motions of hydrogen and carbon atoms in alkyl chain in the vibrational motions. Based on the Franck-Condon principle, one can note that it should improve the band spacing between the vibronic progressions of theoretical luminescence spectrum that will be discussed further.\n\nThe shifts of theoretical frequencies between the ground and excited state of [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] are found to be similar to what was experimentally obtained for Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 . The computed uranyl symmetrical stretching mode shifted by 74 cm −1 , very close to the experimental value of 82 cm −1 . However, the ν U−Cl and ν b do not vary during the excitation. We will later discuss the impact of this on the computed vibronic spectra.\n\n\nC. Theoretical absorption and emission energies\n\nAs the luminescence spectrum of uranium (VI) complexes arises from the electronic transition from the lowest excited state to the ground state, coupled to progression of vibronic bands, the examination of the whole electronic spectrum is useless. In this step, we aim at foreseeing the sensitivity of the quantum chemical method on the first triplet excited state absorption and emission energies of the uranyl tetrachloride complex, and on the spectral features of uranium (VI) complexes.",

Model systems The interactions of uranyl with the first and second coordination spheres affect the electronic structure of uranium. As the influence of the chloride ligands in UO 2 Cl 4 2complex was excellently reviewed by variety of experimental [7,8,[15][16][17] and theoretical methods [18][19][20][21][22], this system was selected as a benchmark to quantify the effect of ligands in the first coordination sphere by substituting chlorides by bromides, and the effect of the counter-ions in the second coordination sphere, i.e. the quaternary ammonium cations. Furthermore, to discuss the importance of long-range solvent effects, the model systems were computed in gas phase and with inclusion of solvent effect (n-dodecane and acetone). The structures are represented in Fig. 4 b. Structures of the ground and excited states, and harmonic frequencies In the sake of keeping the computational costs within week scale and of simplifying the data analysis, the structures of the uranyl tetrahalides complexes were enforced to D 4h symmetry, whereas no symmetry constrains were applied to the complexes with a second coordination sphere. All the ground-state molecular geometries were optimized including the relativistic effects at the spin-free level in the gas phase and with solvent effect using Density functional Theory (DFT). The Kohn-Sham equation was solved using the hybrid PBE0 functional [23]. The structure of the first low-lying excited state was optimized using the time-  [25] codes. The vibrational harmonic frequencies were computed using either an analytic Hessian matrix or numerical finite differences of the gradient. All geometries considered for the vibronic spectra calculations represent true minima as they have no imaginary frequencies. The optimized structures are available in ESI.",

With increasing of polarity the ν U−Cl stretching frequencies insignificantly increase (4 and 7 cm −1 ) for the ground and excited states, respectively, while the uranyl ν b , ν s and ν a decrease by 5 up to 25 cm −1 in both states. This shift of the ground-state frequencies should be observable in the computed luminescence spectra, namely in the spacing between the vi- brationally resolved peaks, while the minor change of the excited state frequencies should only affect the vibronic intensities. The substitution of chlorides by bromides in the uranyl equatorial plane lead to the following changes in the vibrational spectra. Compared to uranyl tetrachloride, the ν b value decreased by less than 10 cm −1 in both ground and excited states. The ν s increased by 13 and 62 cm −1 in the ground and excited states, respectively. Similarly, the ν a increased by 14 cm −1 for the ground and 76 cm −1 for the first excited state. The U -Br stretching mode is 83 cm −1 lower in both ground and excited states than the U -Cl symmetric stretching vibration. This is in line with the ground-state experimental trends measured for\nCs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 with [C 7 H 16 NO 2 ][UO 2\nBr 4 ] (91, 2, 6 and 9 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively). These changes indicate that the bromide ligand has a smaller effect on the electronic structure of uranium than chloride, since the U-Br bond strength is essentially ionic and has less impact on the U-O bonding. Consistently, the uranium -oxygen symmetrical stretching frequency is higher than in the chloride complex and close to the bare uranyl value. For [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2we estimate a shift of frequencies between the ground and excited state equal to 6, 2, 31 and 53 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq.

Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq.

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

Organic cation -uranyl tetrachloride:\n[A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] The [UO 2\nCl 4 ] 2dianion in interaction with the organic ligand has been prepared in the conditions described in the experimental section. The sample was prepared based on the general ion-exchange mechanism [58,59], where in our scheme the extracting substance was Aliquate ® 336. Then the final compound is predicted to be the uranyl tetrachloride associated with two extractant cations of methyltrioctylammonium [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] as a result of an ion-exchange mechanism [10] Interestingly, Görller-Warland et al. [7] stabilized the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2dianion in solution with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu 4 NCl), a ligand belonging to the group of tetraalkylammonium salts as the Aliquate ® 336. For our purpose, the geometries of ground and luminescent states of complexes were optimized with the two tetraalkylammonium cations placed in the second sphere in a trans position. The bond distances are shown in Table III, while the  vibrational frequencies are shown in Table II. If one compares the computed geometrical parameters to that of the models without an explicit secondcoordination sphere (Table I), the counter-cations induce a weakening of uranyl bond and the loss of the D 4h symmetry. These changes are due to the presence of a weak hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atoms of the alkyl chains of cation with the oxygen and chloride atoms of uranyl tetrachloride unit [9] (see ESI Figure S1, Table  S3 [54]. This observation makes us conclude that the chain length of a tetraalkilammonium cation has merely no influence on the R U−O and R U−Cl values and that both organic counter-cations (R 4 N) interact with the uranyl tetrachloride dianion in a similar way. Since the influence of longrange solvent effects on the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2bare complexes is negligible, we rely in the following on the gas-phase structures for the [",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

Ground and excited state structures of the uranyl tetrahalide complexes a. Uranyl tetrahalide dianions The structure of uranyl tetrachloride dianion has been well-studied by the variety of theoretical and experimental techniques [6,15,20,35,[48][49][50][51]. Insofar as the inclusion of all effects like in experimental conditions is challenging for ab initio calculations because of the difficulties in building chemically relevant models and the fast growing of the computational costs as the model expands, the present quantum chemical study was performed on models with increasing chemical complexity, to approach the solution sample.\n\nThe spin-free optimized ground and the first excited state distances between uranium and the coordinated atoms of the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2together with experimental data are shown in Table I.\n\nIn the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2gas-phase PBE0 calculations, the ground state R U−O =1.758 Å value is in a good agreement with 1.766 Å obtained with the CCSD(T) wave-function method, while R U−Cl =2.714 Å comes out shorter than 2.735 Å. Moreover, the PBE0 geometries are in good accordance with the all-electron CAM-B3LYP results reported by Tecmer et al. [35]. This gives us confidence in the ability of PBE0 to provide fairly accurate geometries of the uranium containing complexes. The inclusion of solvent effects on [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2does not significantly change the R U−O distance as compared to the gas-phase calculations, but it shortens R U−Cl as the solvent polarity increases. Keeping in mind that we do not have strictly the same conditions as in the experiment, it is worth examining trends in both theoretical and experimental data. The comparison of the experimental crystal structure of Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 [6] with the structure of uranyl tetrachloride dianion in acetonitrile [49] shows that the R U−O bond length is almost the same in both conditions, while R U−Cl values are found to be longer in solution by about 0.01 Å.",

However, [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2luminescence spectrum displays some more intense contributions and longer vibronic pro-  9). This results from a larger geometrical displacements between the ground and excited state structures (see Table S10 in ESI), which leads to the appearance of several U-Br vibrational modes in a spectrum. The computed luminescence spectrum of [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in gas phase is overlaid with the experimental one on Figure 10. This figure highlights the fact that both the energy positions and the band spacing of the computed vibronic transitions match nicely the experimental envelope, though with the reserve that the band spacing is somewhat red shifted as the ground state symmetrical stretching is slightly overestimated by the R-ECP DFT/PBE0 level of theory. The added value of the theoretical simulation lies in the assignment of the vibronic levels, as detailed in Table S9 of the ESI. In agreement with Görller-Walrand et al. [7] results, our theoretical approach reproduced a contribution from symmetrical stretching and rocking vibrational modes. On the contrary, the doubled U-Cl symmetrical vibrational mode contribution was observed rather than out-of-plane bending of equatorial ligands contribution.\n\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS",

The corresponding photon-ionization threshold for the transient KRb * 2 complexes at the incident collision energy is ∼402 nm. Because of this, the 354.85 nm ionization wavelength utilized here has a sufficient photon energy to ionize both transient and deeply bound states of the complex. To confirm that the KRb + 2 ion signal observed in the main text arises from transient collision complexes (KRb * 2 ), and not from more deeply bound complexes, we have also performed measurements analogous to those shown in Fig. 4(a) of the main text using a pulsed UV ionization laser operating at 394.81 nm. At this ionization wavelength, the KRb + 2 ion signal demonstrates the same behavior as that shown in Fig. 4(a), and we observe no measurable difference between the corresponding KRb * 2 complex lifetimes. However, the overall strength of the KRb + 2 ion signal at this wavelength is relatively reduced due to limitations in the available 394.81 nm laser power. We therefore find it sufficient for the purposes of this work to operate the pulsed ionization laser at 354.85 nm, which provides a higher time-averaged laser power.\n\n\nODT INTENSITY MODULATION SCHEME\n\nFor the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 of the main text, we apply a 1.5 kHz square-wave intensity modulation with a 25% duty cycle to the H and V ODTs using acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). Both beams are always modulated synchronously, so that they follow the same timing. We do this in order to probe the KRb * 2 population at lower, controllable 1064 nm intensity levels without noticeably altering the thermodynamic properties of the atom-molecule mixture. That is, because the trapping frequencies, f trap , of both the molecular and atomic gases satisfy f trap < 0.4 kHz along all three principal axes of the trap, the chosen modulation frequency for the time-averaged potential does not notably affect the temperature or density of the atoms and molecules in the sample.",

However, this de novo phasing technique presents its own problems arising from the long 5.02 Å wavelength at which the sulfur K-edge lies at 2.47 keV photon energy. To resolve structural features at near-atomic resolution (2 Å or higher) using diffraction at scattering angles less than 90 , a diffraction experiment must be carried out at a photon energy higher than about 6 keV. At this wavelength, the Bijvoet differences upon which the S-SAD phasing relies are very weak: for a typical protein containing a single sulfur atom for every 30 residues, the average difference is about 2% at 6 keV. Low anomalous signal requires the collection of very accurate data, which often means longer acquisition times (exacerbated by strong air absorption) and consequently a higher risk of radiation damage effects. The difficulty of the technique is also demonstrated by the very low number of deposited structures solved with S-SAD, compared to other X-ray methods (124 vs. 94 474: Results from queries dated 09/02/15 using the Protein Data Bank website (www.pdb.org). For S-SAD, the advanced search \"Structure Determination Method\" was used, in combination with \"Text search.\" Due to the absence of well-defined S-SAD search criteria, this number could be an underestimate). Son et al. (2011a;2011b) postulated that at high-intensity, X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) radiation can ionize a significant population of the atoms of the sample during the X-ray pulse, and that heavy atoms are more strongly affected due to their higher photoabsorption cross sections. Furthermore, it was predicted that standard anomalous phasing methods would be frustrated under these conditions, because the absorption edges of the ions created during the XFEL pulse shift towards higher energies. These effects have been observed in recent experiments (Nass et al., 2015 and Galli et al. unpublished). In particular, Nass et al. (2015) observed indications of electronic damage localized on the iron-sulfur clusters of ferredoxin protein crystals. Similarly, Galli et al.

Because of the negligible labframe translational energy and transient nature of the KRb * 2 complexes, they reside within the same region of the ODT as the trapped sample. We therefore shape the UV ionization laser into a Gaussian beam that overlaps with the atomic and molecular clouds, and which has 1/e 2 waist diameters of 280 µm and 175 µm along the two orthogonal beam axes. Since the UV photon energy at 354.85 nm is below the ionization thresholds of both KRb and Rb, the overlap of the ionization laser with the trapped sample does not result in a measurable depletion of either the atoms or the molecules in the mixture.

For a fair comparison, we have corrected the values referring to H 2 [S1-S3] to refer to H by utilizing the experimental energy difference between H 2 and 2H extracted below. We have also compared the ab initio obtained values with the experimental ones to check the consistency.The ab initio calculations of H and H 2 were performed in a 20 Å × 20 Å × 20 Å simulation cell, and only the Γ point was used to sample the Brillouin zone. The atomic distance of H 2 was optimized so that the forces on atoms are less than 5 × 10 −3 eV/Å. For H, spin-polarization was considered. Other relevant computational conditions were the same as those described in Section 2.2 in the main text. The zero-point energy (ZPE) of H 2 was evaluated within the harmonic approximation based on the finite displacement method with the displacement of 0.01 Å.Table S1summarizes the such computed ab initio bond lengths, ZPEs, and atomization energies, as well as experimental values extracted from literature[S4-S6]. For all the investigated exchange-correlation functionals, the computed values are found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment. It is therefore safe to use the experimental value of the atomization energy to correct the values for a qualitative comparison inTable 1in the main text. Since the ab initio studies referred to inTable 1in the main text did not account for the contribution of lattice vibrations, it is fair to correct the values inTable 1in the main text with the value without ZPE. We therefore took the experimental atomization energy of H 2 without ZPE, 4.748 eV/(H atom), and corrected the values in Refs.[S1-S3]inTable 1in the main text, which reference to H 2 (eq 2 in the main text),",

We firstly constructed symmetric models by putting the O atom over the ridge or underneath the ridge. After the optimization, they become asymmetric as shown in theFigure 4 in the main text. The cohesive energy of the oxidized model is calculated 14 from the relationship: E coh = E ADM + E O − E oxi , where E ADM , E O , and E oxi represent the energies of the ADM model surface, the free O atom, and the oxidized surface, respectively. A value of 3.03 eV is obtained. We note that in our oxidized model the number of atoms in a unit cell is the same as the previously proposed add-row model (Ref. 7 in the main text). However, the energy of our oxidized surface per unit cell is lower than the add-row model by 2.10 eV. In the add-row model, the O atom is located below the ridge and that structure is known to be not stable (Ref. 20 in main text). In the current oxidized model, there are 4 equivalent positions for the ad-oxygen atom, as shown by structural models in Supplementary Figure S8a and b. The energy barrier between the two positions parallel to the ridge is about 0.35 eV, while the barrier cross the ridge is as small as 0.04 eV. Because of the relative small barriers, the hopping of the O atom among these different positions should be easy, especially when the STM image is acquired by the tip over the O atom under applying bias voltage of 1.5 eV. Hence, the calculated final image is the average of several simulated images for the structures with the O atom at different possible positions.\n\nFigure\nS8c-e.

In this global BioEn reweighting step, the chains were given near-uniform weights w c with S KL bias ≪ 1 ( Figure S1B). By comparison, the BioEn weights of the HCG ensemble created without bias are less uniform.

For the PPLN OPA, the use of the NL-1050-PM-NEG fiber (NKT Photonics) was necessary to reach sufficient seed bandwidth. It has a mode-field diameter of only 2.7 mm and a dispersion that is all-normal across the continuum region with a minimum group velocity dispersion of only about 2 fs 2 /mm at 1050 nm. Therefore, the spectral parts resulting from optical wave breaking could be amplified. The polarizationmaintaining version of the fiber was selected to maintain the coherence of the continuum despite the large broadening factors (see section S1) (38). For the long-wavelength OPA, sufficient bandwidth was provided by an 8-cm ESM12 fiber (NKT Photonics) with a 10.3-mm mode-field diameter. For this fiber length, self-phase modulation was saturated, whereas optical wave breaking beyond the zero-dispersion wavelength was avoided.\n\n\nPower measurements\n\nPower measurements were performed with thermal detectors. For the PPLN measurements, the Fresnel reflection of the rear surface of the uncoated crystal and the transmission of the single-sided coated beam splitter and of the silver mirrors were taken into account to calculate the values shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Moreover, a germanium plate was put in front of the power meter to block residual NIR. The transmission of this plate was assumed to be 46%, corresponding to an infinite number of Fresnel reflections.\n\nThe beam splitting after the LGS OPA was rather complicated because of the large energy difference between MIR and pump photons and the high average power. Using only a germanium plate led to a saturation of measured MIR power for pump powers higher than 10 W because of free carrier generation in the highly nonlinear semiconductor. Therefore, the total power incident on the germanium plate was reduced by directing only the front reflection of an uncoated ZnSe wedge onto it.\n\n\nS C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E",

While theoretical speculations and calculations place these materials at the centre of the third-generation solar cells, recent research output tends to demonstrate that many unpredictable issues arise from the implementation of such structures inside devices. The considerable work targeting material synthesis and device engineering, however, is gradually circumventing these hindrances, opening the door to a potential solar cell technology which could be entirely fabricated through chemical processes and thus, at lower costs. For example, recent attempts have been aiming to hybridize PbS quantum dots with methylammonium lead halide perovskite, and achieved an unprecedented efficiency of 10.6% [155][156][157]. Nowadays, extensive research aims at nanostructuring a wide range of materials [158][159][160], including the promising lead halide perovskite [161][162][163][164], to further improve the efficiencies and versatility of nanocrystal-based optoelectronic devices.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2geometric representations of the various solar spectrum standards aM 0, aM 1.0, aM1.5 and aM 2.0.\n\nFigure 3 .\n3aM 1.5 (blue) solar power and proportion which is actually absorbed by a standard crystalline silicon solar cell (purple).

The small overlap region of the low-energy tail of the monomer absorption spectrum and the laser excitation spectrum at around 550 nm ( Figure 1b in the main text) could lead to weak excitation of C8S3 monomers. For the calculation of the monomer exciton density, we use an (average) monomer concentration of = 9.06 × 10 −5 M after flash-dilution as estimated in the preceding section and find an exciton density of one excitation per ~3300 C8S3 monomers under the highest excitation fluence in the experiment. Simultaneously, the exciton density for the inner tubes in the same experiment is about one exciton per ~20 molecules, which is a factor of ~165 higher than for the monomers. Therefore, we conclude that excitation of monomers via absorption of one photon in the low-energy tail of the monomer absorption is negligible given the small spectral overlap with the excitation spectrum. The fact that the two-photon absorption cross section of C8S3 monomers is not known prevents such an estimate for two-photon absorption. However, as the two-photon excitation proceeds via a non-resonant state, its cross-section is expected to be even lower. These estimates support the absence of the monomer signals in the absorptive and EEI2D spectra.\n\n\nS8\n\n\nSupplementary Note 3: Integration of the Absorptive and EEI Signals",

There was no indication of saturation of the AQo2 responses at the highest light intensities available, even though these were just sufficient to saturate the electrical responses of the photoreceptor cells (see below). A similar discrepancy (1) at different wavelengths . The lines have the same slope and were drawn by eye through the data points. The slopes of the (total OQo,)/(log 1) lines varied from one slice to another, but in any one experiment were constant over the wavelength and intensity ranges tested . Note the tail-off of AQo, at low light intensities (see text). 798 was previously described for stimulation by white-light flashes (Tsacopoulos and Poitry, 1982). The above findings, that the AQ02 responses of different wavelengths may be matched in shape and have a similar dependence on light intensity, show that the principle of univariance holds (Naka and Rushton, 1966) and make it likely that the initial stimulus for the responses is absorption by a single photopigment . The action spectrum for AQo, was obtained from a series of experiments in which at least one complete response/light intensity line was measured for each slice. Using the slope of this line, extrapolation from the responses of other wavelengths was used to calculate the light intensity for a criterion response of a total AQos of 1 Al g-'', about the midpoint of the range over which measured responses were linear with log light intensity. At the peak sensitivity, the light intensity for the criterion response was^\" 10'4 photons cm-2 s' . The relative sensitivities at different wavelengths were calculated as the inverse of the light intensity for the criterion response and normalized to the maximum value (Naka and Rushton, 1966 ;Tomita et al ., 1967;Baylor and Hodgkin, 1973). This procedure was adopted since the preparations were not stable for a time sufficient to obtain a complete series of response/light intensity curves at all wavelengths. Fig. 4 shows the results of the individual experiments designed to measure the action spectrum of AQo, The points are the relative sensitivities calculated from the total OQO, after monochromatic light flashes as described above.

CIS calculations for the monomer were performed and are summarized briefly in the Supporting Information. In brief, the lowest lying excited state corresponds to a transition of B u symmetry, consistent with the presence of a transition moment polarized within the xz-plane using the coordinate system indicated in Figure 2. The next highest excited state is one-photon-forbidden, suggesting either A g or B g symmetry. The symmetry is tentatively assigned as B g based on trends in the dimer detailed in following text.\n\nThe butadiene structure considered computationally was one in which just one pair of carbon atoms were coparallel and πstacked, as shown in Figure 2.

The muon mass of m µ = 105.6583668 MeV is taken from Ref. [11]. The nucleon field ψ interacts with the σ, ω, ρ meson fields σ, ω ν , ρ ν and with the photon field A ν . The muonic field ψ µ interacts with the photon field A ′ ν and A ′ ν excludes the photon field produced by the muon itself. The field tensors for the vector meson are given as Ω νλ = ∂ ν ω λ −∂ λ ω ν and by similar expression for ρ meson and the photon. The self-coupling terms with coupling constants g 2 and g 3 for the σ meson are introduced which turned out to be crucial [12]. Since the muon couples only electromagnetically to nucleons, no additional parameters need to be introduced, and no readjustment of the present parameters is needed. Varying the effective Lagrangian, one can obtain the Dirac equation for nucleons and muons, and the Klein-Gordon equations for mesons. The calculations are performed in coordinate space using a mesh size of 0.01 fm and different box sizes for different muonic states, and the paring correlations are accounted in the BCS formalism with an energy gap ∆ obtained from the observed odd even mass differences for an open shell and ∆ = 0 for a closed shell. The NL3 and NLSH parameter sets are employed here. The NL3 parameter set has been used with enormous success in the description of a variety of ground-state properties of spherical, deformed and exotic nuclei [13,14], and NLSH is also a successful parameter set [15]. The nucleons and muon are treated in the unified framework without any adjustable parameter and the finite size effect of the nucleus is automatically included so that both the muonic atom structure and nuclear structure can be investigated simultaneously. In contrast to earlier works about the muonic atoms based on Migdal theory [16,17], the present method is relativistic. Also, our approach is more microscopic compared with the method that directly solves the Dirac equation using the two or three-parameter Fermi-type distribution of the nuclear charge",

Except for using the simplest approximation of a single Gaussian orbital per particle, the problem is exactly solved variationally and, by varying the masses to simulate molecular di-hydrogen, mono-muonated di-hydrogen and di-muonated di-hydrogen, employed to illustrate the celebrated Born-Oppenheimer approximation on the occasion of its 90th anniversary. It is suggested that it is valid only for di-hydrogen.\n\nGreat interest in µ-mesonic molecules arose in connection with cold fusion processes.\n\nMuons are leptons, like electrons, but are about 200 times heavier. If an electron is replaced by a muon in a hydrogen molecule, the nuclei become about 200 times closer [3], and when the nuclei are so near to each other, the probability of nuclear fusion increases enormously.\n\nOur aim is to understand the stability of the µ-mesonic molecules on the basis of simple models satisfying the important requirement of consistently describing atoms and molecules of hydrogen. By consistent description we mean that the schematic model wave function of the µ-mesonic molecule should contain as factors the schematic model wave functions of the atoms, at least for some particular value of parameters specifying correlations between electrons and protons, or between muons and protons, belonging to distinct atoms.\n\nIt should be noted at this point that the idea of allocating wave-functions to nuclei as well as electrons is not new, with the reader being addressed to the literature [8,9,10] for details.",

Because of the very large mass of a muon compared with a electron and the correspondingly small Bohr radius, the muonic wave function has a large overlap with the nucleus. X-ray transition energies in muonic atoms are strongly affected by the size of the nuclei, and can be used efficiently to determine the nuclear charge distribution [1,2]. A detailed introduction about muonic atoms can be found in Ref. [3]. Moreover, the muonic atom tends to play an important role in investigation on other subjects. A recent study demonstrated that muonic atoms in strong laser fields can be used to dynamically gain structure information on nuclear ground states [4]. Masafumi Koike et al. proposed a new process of µ − e − −→ e − e − in a muonic atom for a quest of charged lepton flavor violation (This violation is known to be one of the important rare processes to search for new physics beyond the standard model) in consideration of the fact that this process in a muonic atom has various significant advantages [5]. An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of proton root-mean square radius is provided by muonic hydrogen [6]. In addition, some potential synergies of combining muons with radioactive nuclei may become a new tool to be used at future RIB facilities, as suggested in Ref. [7]. Therefore, investigation on muonic atom is meaningful and not limited to atomic physics.",

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] Practically, detection of the ejecting positrons, arising from decaying spin-polarized muons, forms the basis of the muon spin resonance spectroscopy to deduce the sticking site of the muon or muonium atom. 16,17 In most cases there are various atoms or bonds in a molecule that may act as potential binding sites making the interpretation of the spectrum nontrivial. [18][19][20][21][22][23] Thus, it is vital to have a clear picture of the conceivable attachment sites in order to deduce the local electronic information by the spectrum analysis. Without having any other complementary experimental sources on the molecular structure of the muonic species, the only available means to discern the addition sites is theoretical and computational modeling. Various approaches have been proposed to explore the potential attachment sites of the muon or the muonium atom to molecular species. 24-42 One possible route is trying to solve time-independent Schrödinger equation for the muonic molecules, i.e. a molecule plus the muon (μ) or muonium atom (Mu), using the well-established ab initio procedures developed for conventional molecules. 43,44 Nevertheless, the usual adiabatic framework that decomposes molecule into fast and slow moving particles, i.e. assuming nuclei as clamped point charges and electrons as quantum particles at first step, is not a safe framework to be used for the muonic species. This stems from the fact that muon's mass is only 207 times of the electron's mass, not large enough to justify the adiabatic view. In order to circumvent this problem, it seems reasonable to include the muon as a quantum particle from the outset, i.e. to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation including the kinetic energy operator of the muon. This approach is theoretically straightforward since in the last twenty years various ab initio theories have been developed to extend the quantitative molecular orbital method to the multi-component quantum systems treating both electrons and nuclei as quantum particles.",

The difference of binding energies ∆E b = E orig − E form (with account of the real isotope ratios) calculated from mass-spectrometric measurements in different tests, falls within the range ∆E b < 0.1 MeV/atom, which is clearly due to mass-spectrometric measurements errors. 4.

All nuclei of chemical elements resulted from the transformation are in the ground (non-excited) state, i.e. no appreciable radioactivity has been found.\n\nTo explain the element transformation, we have put forward the working hypothesis of magnetonucleon catalysis (MNC). We introduced this term to designate the process which supposedly occurs in the plasma channel. The essence of MNC is that the magnetic monopole with a large magnetic charge and an even small kinetic energy can overcome Coulomb barrier and become bound with atomic nucleus. The MNC must have many common features with muon catalysis [21], in which the Coulomb barrier is substantially decreased due to the large mass of mu-meson.

To stand a chance of been captured into an atomic orbit, muons must be slowed down to energies ≤ 2 keV so that their velocity becomes lower than the velocity of the valence electrons. The initial distribution of states is not well known, however, a muon orbit of the same size as the electron K-orbit (n e = 1) will have a principal quantum number\nn µ ∼ m µ m e 1/2 ∼ 14 ,(8)\nAs all muonic states are unoccupied, the muon will cascade down from n µ = 14 towards lower energies, until reaching the most deeply bound states: 1s (K-shell) and 2p (L-shell). The close proximity of these states (muon K-shell is ∼ 207 times closer to the nucleus than an electron Kshell) allow muons to probe the nuclear volume sensitively. The interaction strength of the muon with the electric quadrupole moment of the nucleus varies proportional to r −3 , and therefore gets enhanced for low energy states. The influence of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment in a muonic atom is manifested as an energy splitting of its muonic X-ray lines. To extract the nuclear quadrupole moment from this energy difference one needs to use a model for both, the Hamiltonian that describes the muonic-atom and the nuclear charge distribution [3].\n\n\nReoritentation in Coulomb excitation\n\nCoulomb excitation occurs when a nucleus undergoes transitions to its excited states due exclusively to the time dependent electromagnetic interaction acting between target and projectile as they approach to each other in a collision. This mechanism is extremely useful because its cross section can be accurately related to the electromagnetic properties of the nucleus, such as its reduced electromagnetic transition probabilities and moments [23,24].",

High-energy energetic gamma and X-rays cause permanent damage to the material. They constitute defects in chemical structure. These disorders are often referred to as paramagnetic centers or radiation damage centers. Radiation damage centers are seen as free radicals in the form of breaking bonds in the structure and as anion or cation radicals in the form of electron exchange. The EPR method is used to investigate such impairments or paramagnetic centers occurring in structures of organic or inorganic materials. In this chapter, the effects of ionizing radiation on the substance will be analyzed using the EPR method.\n\nCharged particles are a directly ionizing radiation group. These particles include energetic electrons (negatrons), positrons, protons, alpha particles, charged mesons, muons, and heavy ions (ionizing atoms). This type of ionizing radiation interacts primarily with matter via the Coulomb force. Particles push or attract electrons from atoms and molecules due to their charge.\n\nUncharged particles form an indirectly ionizing radiation group. Best examples for indirectly ionizing radiation type are photons above 10 keV (X-rays and gamma rays) and all neutrons.\n\nInteraction of X-ray and gamma ray photons with matter causes ionization. This process is mainly in three different ways: a. Low-energy photons give all their energy to an electron, which causes the electrons to break apart from atoms or molecules. This type of interaction is called photoelectric interaction. The photon then disappears from the medium.\n\nb. Intermediate-energy photons interact with electrons as a result of the Compton event.\n\nPhotons and electrons are scattered in different directions.",

Baryons like protons and neutrons become dominant during the final stages of freezing. The finite volume size effects become evident at low density values, which corresponds to the last stages of fireball evolution. Although there is some uncertainty about the fireball's existence during The result of our calculations using formula 5 for the meson and nucleon stages of the evolution of the hadron fireball these late stages, a generalization of the vdW model to the nucleon fireball was proposed in [14] to describe nucleus-nucleus interactions during the last stage of freeze-out when new particles are not produced (T < 135 MeV). To simplify the model, the average energies of internucleon collisions are restricted to not exceed the production threshold of other hadrons, and only two varieties (protons and neutrons) are considered. The density of protons and neutrons is assumed to follow from the conservation of baryon number, and the nucleon composition of colliding nuclei is assumed to be known. The effective potential of the interactions between protons and neutrons, protons and protons, and neutrons and neutrons can be represented using the same model as in Fig. 4. The hard-core radius of the proton is assumed to be known, while the radius of the neutron is much smaller than that of the proton. Thanks to the known relationship between the number of protons and neutrons in heavy nuclei, n p = kn n , where k < 1, the two-component nucleon model essentially reduces to a one-component model. Similarly, since the lifetime of neutral pion mesons is much shorter than that of charged mesons, the same can be said for the two-component meson model. Interestingly, despite the crudeness of such a one-component approximation for the real multi-component vdW gas of the hadron fireball, as shown in Fig. 5, a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of calculations by other authors is obtained for the chemical potential (see, for example, Fig. 2 and Fig. 6).",

For the long range attractive and short range repulsive characteristics of nucleon-nucleon interaction, we at least include in RMF an isoscalar scalar meson field (σ meson) and a massive isoscalar vector meson field (ω meson). An isovector vector meson field (ρ meson) is included to handle the charge exchange and the electromagnetic field for the electromagnetic interaction among protons. We also include the nonlinear self-interaction terms of the scalar meson field to improve the compressibility of nuclear matter and the deformation of finite nuclei. By choosing carefully the coupling constants and the meson masses as the parameters, we can get quantitative agreement with experiments for spherical and deformed nuclei [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Lee et al. studied deformed nuclei within the RMF with various parameter sets [17].

On the other hand, for the ground states of 12 C and 16 O, NL1 gives much stronger binding (136.1 MeV and 206.5 MeV respectively) while L1 gives 94.1 MeV and 128.9 MeV compared to the empirical values of 92.2 MeV and 127.6 MeV [28]. These results indicate that we need to search for a better parameter set which is good for both 4 He and 12 C to study the alpha structure of 12 C.

This would allow studies of unstable nuclei by means of the muonic X-ray method at facilities where both µ − and radioactive isotope beams would be available. The electron scattering is not going to be easy to be applied for exotic nuclei with very low beam intensities when one measures the scattering cross sections to obtain the knowledge about the nuclear structure. But for muonic atoms, one measures the X-ray energies, which is much easier and X-ray energy can be measured with a high accuracy. For the other approach to probe the nuclear shell structure, the first excited 2 + state, can be carried out using Coulomb excitation [21] for these exotic nuclei. Therefore, as two independent methods, the approaches of Coulomb excitation and muonic atom spectroscopy can complement each other. Apart from obtaining information on the muonic spectrum, the influence of the muon on nuclear structure can also be investigated. It is found that the nuclear structure of the Pb isotope remains basically unchanged in the presence of the muon in 1s 1/2 orbit. The single particle level spacing of neutrons and protons is altered by only several or some dozen keV. The nucleon densities are reduced by about 0.1% at the edge of the nucleus (∼7 fm) but enhanced in the interior of nucleus by about 0.1%. In other words, the protons and neutrons move quite slightly towards the core as a result of the bound muon, and the nuclear rms radii are reduced only by about 0.02%. For the calculation of these changes in value, the systematic computational errors here could be canceled to a large extent, so that the results are reliable. The bound muon in other orbits affect the nuclear structure much more weakly than that in the 1s 1/2 orbit. The muon thus can be taken as a clean and reliable probe to extract information on nuclear structure since this probe can hardly change the nuclear structure. It is reliable to yield information on nuclear charge distributions and rms radii through muonic X-ray in experiments. That is to say, the previous experiments on the nuclear charge distributions and charge rms radii within the muonic atoms were theoretically confirmed to be reasonable and reliable. Moreover, the fact that the nuclear structure is only slightly changed by the muon implies that the linear response theory used in Ref. [16,17] is",

One of the most prominent examples of such a development owing to the site-specific method sensitivity is the muon spin resonance (μSR) [1]. The supremacy of μSR over volume-sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is best manifested in the spin spectroscopy of the solid-state where the interpretation of μSR spectra is greatly simplified by the absence of spectral line broadening due to the lack of the long-range spin-spin couplings (otherwise present in the NMR spectra) thanks to the local detection character of the muon, acting as a local magnetic moment probe [2]. Namely, instead of a static NMR coil wound around a macroscopic volume of a sample, one has a fast-moving 'coil-projectile', the muon particle, picking up signals from local magnetic environments. During the muon's 2.2 μs lifetime, muonium can enter into compounds such as muonium chloride (MuCl) or sodium muonide (NaMu) [3]. Due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the electron, muonium (μ+e−, hereinafter Mu) is more similar to atomic hydrogen (p+e−) than positronium (e+e−) [3]. Its Bohr radius and ionization energy are within 0.5% of hydrogen, deuteron, and tritium, and thus it can usefully be considered as an exotic light isotope of hydrogen with a mass of l/9 of H [3].",

[1][2][3][4] However, there have been various evidence that the positively charged muon ( + µ ), one of heavier congeners of electron ( − e ) in the group of leptons, 5 may also serve as a lighter isotope of hydrogen whereas the negatively charged muon ( − µ ), the antiparticle of + µ , may replace electron in an atom, orbiting around positively charged nucleus tightly. 6 Although both types of muons as elementary particles have found vast applications beyond the traditional muon catalyzed nuclear fusion reactions, 7,8 deserved to be called \"muon science\", 9 because of their short life time, ~2.2×10 -6 s, less was known about \"muonic chemistry\" and most of knowledge was limited to Muonium ( Mu ) (an exotic atom composed of + µ and − e ). 6 This is not an exceptional situation since tau/position, as other members of the lepton family, 5 are also unstable prone to decaying to/annihilation with electrons, leaving \"leptonic chemistry\" as a curiosity with less direct relevance with real life chemistry, 10,11 but a sub-branch of studying \"exotic\" species.

This model is relatively primitive model of a hydrogen atom compared to quantum wave mechanics models of atoms. Based on experimental measurements, Bohr atom model suggests that mechanical energy related with energy of atomic electrons should be quantized. According to Bohr's model, electron orbiting around nucleus of atom can be certain particular states of motion, which is called \"stationary states\" [1]. In other words, the model implies that an electron orbits only at certain distances to nucleus depending on energy state of an atom. Such consideration of an atom allows fundamental definition of an atom radius with respect to distances of electron orbits to nucleus in space. For single electron atoms such as hydrogen, the smallest possible orbit with lowest energy state has an orbital radius, which was called Bohr radius. Then, the Bohr radius became an important physical constant associated with atomic scales and it is approximately equal to the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. Value of Bohr radius is approximately ! = \" ! #$% ! = 0.0529 ≅ 0.53 & . An important point for Bohr radius is the fact that it is the radial distance to nucleus that has the peak of probability density of an electron [2].\n\nThe atomic radius is commonly used in chemistry and physics to assign a size for atoms in spatial domain, and it is generally considered as distance between the nucleus and the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons [3]. Experimental value of atomic radius came out in works of X-ray crystallography with a question whether the same radii is valid for atoms of the same element [4]. More experimental data on crystal structures showed that the same atom in different crystal structures could not have the same experimental radii [5].",

One could anticipate that for muonium-substituted molecules, the isotope effect is so large that the BOA is invalid. However, non-adiabatic and non-BOA effects are extremely small as observed by the muon-spin resonance and predicted by theoretical calculations for Mu-substituted molecular species and solid-state defect centres, at least in their ground electronic states [61]. For example, for isotopomers of the hydrogen molecule Webster and McKenna showed, by a series of non-adiabatic calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, that the key isotope effect arises through the mass dependence of the zero-point vibrational energy but essentially the same single potential-energy curve underlies the nuclear dynamics of all nuclear isotopic species [62]. On the whole, this result indicates the so-called trivial isotope effect, which, in order to be accounted for, in essence does not require resorting to non-adiabatic calculations. The reason for this is that the electronic structure for the protonic and muonic species is identical within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, mass effects being manifest only through differences in zero-point vibrational motion and the alteration of the vibrational modes. A further theoretical study of the muonium-substituted species MuCO · and MuCO + also points out on the trivial isotope effect being the mere consequence of the mass ratio of the isotopic species. It was namely indicated that the vibrational frequencies of the C-Mu bond in the radical MuCO · increase by a factor close to a value of three, as expected for harmonic vibrations where the frequency varies inversely with the square root of the reduced mass for a Mu-C bond [63]. Furthermore, another study of vibrational behaviour of the carbon-muonium bond in the muoniated ethyl radical points out that, despite the great disparity in mass of the hydrogen and muonium isotopomers, the mere effect of the isotopic substitution is that the zero-point vibrational level lies significantly higher on the potential surface for Mu and the C-Mu bond executes large amplitude vibrations compared with a C-H bond, with the mean-square displacement for the C-Mu bond being three-time larger than the",

In Section 2 we will determine the differences of FSI phases of tree amplitudes which describe B → ρρ and B → ππ decays into the states with isospins zero and two from the data presented in Table 1. As a next step we will suggest a mechanism which produces such phases. Once this mechanism is defined it becomes possible to calculate FSI phases of decay amplitudes into states with a definite isospin (not only their differences). A central question is: what intermediate states produce FSI phases in B-meson decays into two light mesons. In the weak decay b → uū(dd)d in the rest frame of a heavy quark (which is B-meson rest frame as well) three fast light quarks are produced. Their energies are of the order of M B /3 and momenta are more or less isotropically oriented. The energy of the fourth (spectator) quark is of the order of Λ QCD . This four quark state transforms mainly into multi pi-meson final state with the average pion multiplicity about 9 (this number follows from the experimentally known charged particles multiplicity in e + e − annihilation at E cm = 3GeV multiplied by 1.5 * 1.5 in order to take neutral pions and third quark jet into account). The total branching ratio of such decays is about 10 −2 . However such meson state does not transform into the state composed from two light mesons moving into opposite directions with momenta M B /2. What meson state does transform into two light mesons can be understood from the inverse reaction of two light meson scattering at the center of mass energy equal to the mass of B-meson. The produced hadronic state consists of two jets of particles moving in opposite directions. Each jet should originate from a quark-antiquark pair produced in the weak decay of b-quark. The square of invariant mass of a jet which contains spectator quark does not exceed M B Λ QCD and is much smaller than M 2 B . The energy of this jet is determined by that of a companion quark and is about M B /2. That is why the square of invariant",

An interplay between the atomic internal and external degrees of freedom is essential for a good description of the atomic cascade. The perspective of ab initio cascade calculations is outlined.1 In the literature, it has also been called the standard cascade model (SCM).\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen heavy negative particles (µ − , π − ,p, etc.) stop in matter, they usually form exotic atoms in highly excited states with principal quantum number n ∼ m/m e where m is the reduced mass of the exotic atom and m e is the electron mass. The exotic-atom formation is followed by an atomic cascade consisting of multistep transitions to lower atomic states. For hadronic atoms, the atomic cascade is a complete life history because the hadrons get absorbed by the nuclei with high probability before reaching the ground state. Muonic atoms (where the absorption is weak) de-excite to the ground state and engage in various reactions (muon catalyzed fusion, muon transfer, molecular formation) with initial conditions determined by the atomic cascade. In both cases, the atomic cascade can reveal important information about the properties of exotic atoms and reactions with atoms in excited states. This paper, supplementing the earlier reviews [1][2][3][4], focuses on the recent progress in theoretical studies of the atomic cascade in light muonic and pionic atoms.\n\n\nMechanism Example\n\nE-dependence Refs.",

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range. Having no more experimental data, we simply take additional energy value larger by a factor of 3, i.e., E d = 63\n\nMeV. As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data.

At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are close but, at least below the first minimum, differ by a roughly constant factor, i.e., the core excitation effect is slightly, by about 6%, stronger than predicted by the factorization conjecture.",

However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn.

Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

A frame overlap mirror between the second pulse shaping and the wavelength band chopper hinders parasitic cross talk between pulses at wavelengths longer than 16 Å. Two slits define the beam collimation and hence the angular resolution. The first slit about 4 m upstream the sample position is located behind the frame overlap mirror, while the second slit, defining the footprint of the beam on the sample, is located directly in front of the sample position (distances of a few cm can be set). A third slit behind the sample limits the neutron entrance window of the shielding mounted on the secondary reflectometer arm towards the area detector of 30 cm x 30 cm. The spatial resolution is approximately 2 mm and the maximum distance between sample and detector is 2 m. A very first slit right upstream of chopper 1 is used to limit the beam width to enable high wavelength resolution and to reduce background. The sample position as well as sample holders and substrates (Si-crystals) and a specific sample environment are being designed such that neutron reflectivity measurements can be combined with insitu IR spectroscopy in its surface sensitive ATR-mode (Fig. 1). The last section of the neutron guide, mounted between chopper 3 and sample, is supermirror coated (m3) only on top and bottom faces like all the guide parts after the first collimation slit and is removable in order to allow for future installation of various neutron optics, polarizers or else. The whole set-up is compatible with the future upgrade of the guide system at BER-2, which includes m3 supermirror coatings at NL3b and will be discussed elsewhere.\n\n\nExpected performance",

The already known requirement that the distance between slits should be an integer number of the particle wavelength, λ; to observe an interference pattern, just satisfy an internal structure requirement, which is that the quantum object has to be in a maximum state just at the interference slits. Since upon intersection with the space, flat fermion and flat photon produces construction and destruction electric field vector states and that just depends on its internal structures, they will be able to produce a maximum or a minimum upon arrival to the detector screen. This will only depends on the optical path for both branches of the toroid intersection. Therefore, the maximums and minimums of a single quantum particle will follow the same equations for maximums and minimums already known respectively [9],\nd sin α = pλ (2) d sin α = (p + 1 2 )λ (3)\nWhere d is the separation between slits, α is the angle of the maximums or minimums measured from the slits, λ is the wavelength of the flat photon and/or flat fermion (De Broglie wavelength) and p is an integral number. Different angles from the slits will produce different optical paths = different phase interference, thus producing the complete sinusoidal interference pattern observed [5,6,7]. On Figs. 5-6, the self-interference graphics to produce a minimum and maximum for flat fermions and flat photon respectively are shown. When one of the slit holes is blocked, there is no possibility for the flat fermion and flat photon to be in both slits (two places at the same time) and therefore, there will not be an interference pattern.\n\n\nNumber of Rounds before being Identical",

The first term in Eq.

When a wave traverses a slit, its position is confined to the width s. This induces a transverse momentum uncertainty with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of\n∆p = 0.89 h/s,(2)\nwhich evolves into a position uncertainty further downstream (see Appendix C). By measuring the beam's width, that is, its position uncertainty at the detector, we can thus extract ∆p. 4,10 Within this envelope a multi-path interference pattern is formed when the wave is diffracted at two or more slits. Increasing the number N of illuminated slits sharpens the principal interference fringes and causes the occurrence of N −2 secondary maxima.

Results\n\nIn Fig. 4 we show the results of molecular matter-wave diffraction at a single, a double, and a triple slit. The electron micrographs of the respective masks are shown in the upper trace, and the molecular diffraction patterns are shown in the middle trace. They span molecular velocities v between 140 and 430 m/s, corresponding to de Broglie wavelengths λ dB between 5.5 and 1.8 pm. Each bright dot corresponds to a single molecule that scatters thousands of fluorescence photons during detection. At first glance we observe a qualitative difference between the singleslit pattern and the other two: Diffraction at a single slit leads to a structureless, broad signal while the doubleand triple-slit pattern exhibit a sub-structure. This is what we expect based on Eq. (1) and Fig. 2.\n\nTo illustrate the level of detail in the patterns, we vertically sum over the velocity band between 140 and 150 m/s as shown in the lower trace of Fig. 4. Here all patterns share the same envelope resulting from single-slit diffraction. The triple slit pattern also reveals the expected secondary maximum in between the principal diffraction orders. Furthermore, the width of the zeroth diffraction order decreases with increasing N from 15.6 ± 0.1 µm for the double slit to 12.0 ± 0.1 µm for the triple slit.\n\nIt is often stated in textbooks that the wavelength has to be comparable to the grating period to observe interference. However, in the current experiments λ dB is five orders of magnitude smaller than d, and still we observe high-contrast interference. To achieve this, we have to fulfill three conditions: First, the transverse coherence has to be large enough to engulf all slits that shall contribute to multi-slit interference.

Velocity selection: The de Broglie wave spectrum can be narrowed by reducing the velocity spread. a) For atoms this can be very efficiently done using a combination of laser cooling techniques. 61 These led to the realization of Bose-Einstein condensed atomic ensembles where almost all atoms occupy the same quantum state. 57,62 b) For general atomic or molecular beams velocity selection can be realized by gravitational free-fall, or by combining a pulsed source with some time-offlight (ToF) measurement. ToF measurements can be realized by mechanically moving slits (rotating disk velocity selectors or random choppers 63 ) or by exploiting the high",

The slit dimensions of the scanning light beam should cover the band dimensions on the scanned track completely without the occurrence of any interference from adjacent ones. Different slit dimensions were tested and it was found that (3.00 3 0.45 mm) was the optimum slit dimensions which provided the best selectivity and the highest sensitivity.\n\nSaturation time. For obtaining more reproducible results with good R f values, the same degree of vapor saturation is recommended [40]. So, numerous saturation times ranging from 10 to 40 minutes were tried to select the most suitable time for saturation. It was commemorated that good results were attained beginning from 25 minutes; as a result, 30 minutes was used as an optimum saturation time.\n\nMigration distance and development time. Since solvent gradient up the plate could be resulted from solvent demixing and as a consequence, separation and R f values could be affected [40]. Therefore, we should standardize the mobile phase migration distance. A migration distance of 80 mm from the start was selected, as it achieved the optimum resolution; this distance of migration was achieved within 10 minutes.\n\n\nMethod validation",

The light collected from the second slit encompassed the interference patterns of the propagating plasmons on the sensing and the reference paths. By spectrally analysing the fringe patterns, real-time protein detection was demonstrated. Similarly, on-chip phase interrogation was also implemented using groove-slit-groove structures [99,100].

The laser beam passes a narrow 785 nm maxline laser-line clean-up filter (Semrock, LL01-785) to ensure monochromatic excitation and an achromatic cylindrical lens (Thorlabs, f = 100 mm) that focuses the Gaussian beam into a line profile.

Two residual effects remain: (i) The finite transverse temperature of the molecular beam leads to a broadening of the transition, (ii) A possible imperfect perpendicular alignment of the laser beam leads to a shift of the center frequency.\n\nTo limit the Doppler width, we have placed a variable slit in front of the EMT, which limits the divergence of the beam hitting the detector. In Fig. 9 recordings of the Q 2 (1) transition of 12 C 16 O using a slit width of 10 mm and 3 mm are shown. When the slit width is reduced below 3 mm the width of the transition remains the same while the signal decreases further. The minimum full width at half maximum (FWHM) observed is 23 MHz, which is attributed to the line width of the UV-radiation. In our measurements, we have used a slit width of 6 mm, as a compromise between signal intensity and line width.\n\nIn order to eliminate the Doppler shift in the measurement, the UV laser beam is aligned in the geometry of a Sagnac interferometer. The angle between the two counterpropagating laser beams may be estimated to be smaller than λ/d, with λ being the wavelength of the light in nm and d being the diameter of the laser beam in mm [20]. In our case this results in a maximum Doppler shift of 200 kHz. We have verified this by comparing measurements of the R 2 (0) transition of 12 C 16 O in a pure beam of CO (velocity of 800 m/s) and a beam of 5% CO seeded in He (longitudinal velocity of 1500 m/s).

The beamline excitation monochromator is used in grating first order for the wavelength calibration of the detection spectrograph (supplementary material, Fig. 3). With the zero order, we get on the sample a pulsed white beam containing all the wavelengths between 120 nm to 600 nm; this pulsed broadband source is used for the tr-SRCD measurement, limited by the CMOS spectral response. The beam is spatially defined by a spatial filter (labelled S1 in the figure) and then centered by the two-plane mirrors (M'1 and M'2) before being refocused on the sample. In order to avoid damage from beam irradiation, this optical system is designed to allow variation of the illuminated area on the sample. The spherical mirror M'3 and the cylindrical mirror M'4 refocused the beam 2975 mm after the monochromator slits; the calculated beam diameter at the focal plane is about 300 lm (FWHM). By moving the sample cell by 200 mm along the optical axis, we get a controllable probe beam diameter from 300 lm up to 3 mm. Adjustment of the beam diameter to the exposure time helps to minimize the sample irradiation dose. Beyond the sample, the cylindrical mirror M'5 and the spherical mirror M'6 horizontally focused the beam on a secondary slit (S2). This secondary slit at 3900 mm is used to define the final spectral resolution of the setup. The flat M'7 mirror reflected the beam on a spherical flat field grating with 580 grooves per mm (Horiba Jobin-Yvon) that diffract and focus the incident UV/vis light horizontally onto the 2D detector.\n\nThe tr-SRCD setup acquisition frequency is defined by the camera frame rate, which can be set from 0.033 Hz to 100 Hz in full resolution mode and can be increased further by reducing the pixel array size.

It has a maximum flash rate of 530 Hz, allowing for a more than fivefold increase of the repetition rate, resulting in a possible scan repetition speed of < 2 ms provided the spectrometer is fast enough. This is the case in software triggering mode for the USB2000 and with hardware triggering mode for the new USB4000 spectrometer (both Ocean Optics).

The disadvantage of this setup was that the light had to pass two narrow slits, which significantly limited the light intensity available at the detector. We have improved the design in the secondgeneration detector in a way that the UV/Vis spectrometer entrance slit (Ocean Optics, USB 2000) is now mounted on top of the detector arm at the focal position of the colliminating lens where the light was coupled into the fiber again in the first-generation design.

To illustrate the proposed method, we study the prototypical neurotransmitter 2-phenylethylamine (PEA). In jet experiments, it exhibits four conformers, which are spectroscopically well separated [45,46]. They differ in the conformation of the C-N bond and the lone pair of the NH 2 group, as shown in Fig. 1.

Here, the transverse coherence of the molecular beam is prepared to illuminate several antinodes of the standing light wave (2). Matter-wave interference at the optical grating is determined by the coherent and incoherent interaction between the molecular optical polarizability and the spatially periodic laser field. The resulting interference pattern (3) is spatially filtered by two movable slits to isolate the first order diffraction peaks. This results in a pure beam of the desired conformer in the science region (4).

These phenomena constitute an ideal framework to study decoherence because of their simplicity as well as their fundamental implications in quantum mechanics. In particular, we will focus our discussion on the double-slit experiment, which can be regarded as the paradigm of quantum interference. In this experiment, in the absence of \"which-way\" information, the measured intensity displays the well-known interference pattern with maximum fringe visibility. On the other hand, the knowledge of the particle pathway destroys such a pattern and the intensity thus acquires classical features, i.e., it is simply given by the sum of the intensities corresponding to each pathway 1 . These two possible outcomes 2 , related to which aspect of the particle we are interested in (wave or corpuscle, respectively), are equivalent to consider two different experimental contexts: both slits simultaneously open or each one independently open. The choice of a quantum context determines the intensity pattern, in sharp contrast to what happens in classical mechanics in the analogous situation, where both contexts give the same result. However, if the action of an external environment (air molecules, thermal photons, etc.) over the system is taken into account between the slits and the detector, a partial (or even total) suppression of the quantum interference will be observed in the intensity pattern. This means that a certain amount of \"which-way\" information is being gradually revealed, and the process can be thought as a smooth transition from the context where both slits are simultaneously open to the other one where they are independently open.\n\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the formal grounds of the reduced quantum trajectory formalism as well as its theoretical application to the double-slit problem. In Section 3 we present an application of this formalism to the double-slit experiment with cold neutrons performed by Zeilinger et 1 Except otherwise stated, throughout this work \"classical\" refers to the lack of quantum interference, though in general this does not mean necessarily lack of other quantum effects (e.g., single-slit diffraction [14]). 2 Though in SQM textbooks these two situations are mutually exclusive, it has been shown both theoretically [18] and experimentally [19] that it is still possible to determine certain amount of \"which-way\" information without a full erasure of the interference pattern.",

The CCD chip was cooled down to −60 • C. The spectrograph was wavelength-calibrated daily using the reference spectral lines of Hg pen-ray light source (L.O.T.-Oriel, Darmstadt, Germany). Typical detection settings used in CE-wrFlu experiments were: slit width, 500 μm; exposure time, 3 s; vertical shift speed, 16.25 μs; horizontal read-out rate, 33 kHz. Acquired spectra were collected using the Full Vertical Binning mode and were background corrected. A combination of the 240-400 nm band-pass filter, 300 nm cut-off short-pass and 325 nm cut-off short-pass filters was used to select excitation light. Data acquisition analysis was performed using the software program Andor Solis (Andor Technologies). The emission spectra of FLEC-AAs recorded with wrFlu showed a maximum emission wavelength of about 332 nm, which is higher than observed with a conventional spectrofluorometer [45]. As described by de Kort et al. [53], this difference is caused by a somewhat reduced transmittance of UV wavelengths below 315 nm of the detector optics (optical cone and emission fiber).\n\n\nSample preparation and derivatization of amino acids with (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate",

The ellipsoidal mirror required for WALS measurements can be described as a slice cut out of a spheroid with 32 mm height. The body of the mirror is made out of aluminum, while the reflective surface has an amorphous nickel plating. The distance between the two focal points of the mirror is ∆f = 600 mm and the diameter of the respective plane is 250 mm. Two slits of 10 mm width are placed oppositely to each other in order to allow the beam to pass through. The mirror is positioned above the burner, while the flame generated from the burner is located in the first focal point of the ellipsoidal mirror. The scattered light from the first focal point of the mirror is imaged onto the CCD-camera (AV PIKE F-100B, 1000 × 1000 pixels, 16 bit) by the mirror and a camera lens. An aperture in the second focal point of the mirror defines the size of the measurement volume in the first focal point, which is about 0.3 mm under 90 • scattering angle. The exposure time of the camera for the measurements was set to 43 µs. A bandpass filter (535 nm wavelength to compensate the blueshift of the tilted illumination under 12.5 • ) placed before the lens blocked the ambient light and light from soot luminescence. The camera-mirror system is installed in a rotatable construction and tilted by an angle of 15 • , with respect to the vertical axis of the burner, as it can be observed in Figure 4, in order to avoid the signal being completely blocked by the burner. In this manner, the scattered light is collected by one half of the mirror, which contains all the information, while the redundant signal from the other half is discarded. A cw-laser (Qioptiq Nano-250) at 532 nm wavelength, 200 mW, (35 mW used for measurements), is used as the light source. The beam is focused into the measurement volume by a f = 300 mm lens to obtain a small measurement volume with constant flame conditions. The beam polarization is cleaned by a Glan-Taylor prism and adjusted to vertical relative to the mirror plane. The optical set-up had to be calibrated to account for the 1/sin(θ)",

The calculation of groove periodicity (P) is described briefly as follows 36 :  Figure 2e shows the functionality of groove's number. The peaks were located in the range of 710~730 nm. The increase in the number of grooves reduced the transmission spectra, based on resonant Bragg scattering, that generates SPPs for specific wavelengths 37 . As shown in Fig. 2e, the transmission through a one-groove structure could be much greater than predicted by two-groove or three-groove structures. Therefore, only one-groove was applied for all the samples.  By normal illumination of the broadband light source on the interferometer, the produced SPPs traveled via the surface, and propagate to the slit, where SPPs and the direct light interfere together and modulate the far-field transmission. The SPP beam (E SPP ) interfered with the incident beam (E Light ) at the slit position. The calculated normalized intensity in L = 850 nm is presented in Fig. 3a. Red-shifted interference spectrum was the result of increasing refractive indices. Note that our proposed interferometric sensor operates over a broad spectral range, allowing to detect chemical analytes as a function of wavelength.

In such a double-slit scattering experiment, however, there is no experimental way to identify from the detected photon or electron, either predictively or retrodictively, the path of the projectile, i.e. there is no experimental way to determine through which slit each projectile passed because the slit distance is smaller than the de Broglie wave length of the projectile. The photon or electron carries no measurable fingerprint in which slit it was scattered. Therefore, the detected scattering distribution as a function of the transverse momenta must be calculated from a super-position of the wave packets of the two non-distinguishable pathways, yielding the well-known interference pattern. In his famous discussions with Bohr, Einstein argued if one could measure the tiny transverse momentum given to the slit system after single projectile scattering one could measure through which slit it passed and the interference would disappear (Bohr, 1949).\n\nIn the SGE, on the other hand, one can clearly identify, in the retrodictive case, the spin orientation of each atom. The process of momentum exchange of each single atom with the apparatus proceeds in a very different manner in the SGE than in the case of photon or electron scattering in a double slit system. When the atoms enter the first \"very thin layer\" of the magnetic field (at the entrance) the directional quantization of the two spin states must occur extremely sudden, but without any measurable amount of momentum exchange similar to the photon or electron case. When the spin oriented atoms are then passing through the SG magnetic field each atom is continuously accelerated in z-direction due to the acting force µ ∂B ∂z(t) . The final transverse momentum in z direction ±p z0 of each spin state after leaving the magnet is ±p z = µ ∂B ∂z(t) dt, where the limits of the integral are t = 0 and t = T F . This maximum value (which has always been found in all the numerous SGE experiments performed so far) can only be reached if the atomic magnetic moment µ always points in the + or −z-direction during the entire passage through the magnetic field. The final transverse momentum in zdirection, measured by the detector, is a direct measure of the time-integral over the acting force. The SG apparatus measures only this transverse momentum and never spin orientations.",

A white light lamp, filtered in the 400 nm -700 nm range, was focused on the sample by means of a low numerical-aperture infinity-corrected microscope objective (5x, NA = 0.10). The reflected light is collected by an aspherical fiber lens collimator and sent to an optical spectrometer (HR4000 from Ocean Optics) through a multimode optical fiber. The HR4000 has a 3648element CCD-array detector that enables optical resolution as precise as about 1 nm (Full Width Half Maximum, FWHM) in the range of interest and provides an integration time up to 65 seconds. The experimental result at normal incidence is compared with the simulated spectrum in Figure 6. The reflected light on the bare Si surface was used as the reference signal for the normalization of the reflection spectra of the metallic patches. The measured spectrum has a dip located around 634 nm (blue line in Figure 6), while the expected resonance obtained by the numerical analysis is equal to 635 nm (red line in Figure 6). This extremely small shift and the broadening of the measured spectra are compatible with the measured roughness and rounded corners of the sample. In fact the broadening effect was verified by means of a FEM simulation where a random roughness having an average value of 6 nm was introduced on the surface of the grating and on the walls of the slits between the gold nano-patches (green line in Figure 6). The enlargement of the measured spectrum may come about also as a result of the Airy pattern due to diffraction or scattering of the light as it passes through the circular back aperture of the objective. For monochromatic light this phenomenon leads to the formation of concentric light and dark circles where the central one is usually defined by an Airy disk and contains about 84 % of the total power. In our case the same considerations can be applied to the superposition of the different wavelengths composing the white light. Moreover, the resonance of the metallic 2D patches is highly sensitive to the variation of the incident angle of the source (see Figure 2 (a)). Therefore the overall resonance can also be interpreted as a weighted superposition of the resonances in the angle range -sin (NA), + sin (NA).

To overcome these physical and cost limitations, we utilize a compact, low-power, air-cooled NeCu transverse excited hollow cathode gas laser with an excitation wavelength of λ = 248.6 nm in the deep UV range from Photon Systems Inc. With this excitation wavelength, the Raman signals can be observed without fluorescence obscuration or interference of Raman spectrum [28][29][30]. An independent combination of both types of emission can improve the structural elucidation of unknown substances and show their substance-specific spectra without interference or obscuration [30,31]. All Raman measurements were performed using a commercially available Photon Systems' Deep UV Raman and Photoluminescence 200 (RPL 200; https://photonsystems.com/products/lab-spectrometer-systems/raman-pl200/, accessed on 28 May 2021) instrument ( Figure 1). The RPL 200 employs a 248.6 nm NeCu laser, a 200 mm focal length Czerny-Turner spectrometer with computer-controlled 3600 and 300 g/mm holographic grating, and a 2048 × 128 pixel, three-stage thermo-electrically cooled, back-thinned, back-illuminated CCD array detector. This fully self-contained portable instrument weighs about 12 kg. The detector provides highly sensitive data (16 Bit CCD sensor resolution) with a very good spectral resolution of close to 25 1/cm to enable the detection of even small changes in the composition and or concentration of the dissolved substances. The resolution and LOD (limit of detection) are coupled via the slit size used: a larger slit leads to a better LOD but a lower resolution and vice versa. Since we were mostly interested in an improved LOD, we used a larger slit of 150 µm, which leads to a resolution of 25 1/cm. The resolution can be increased to 8 1/cm by using a 50 µm slit or even smaller to further enhance the resolution. The laser is fired in pulses with 40 µs duration and average laser energy of 3.5 µJ.

We now present the original spinning disc confocal data with histamine more comprehensively (Supplementary Fig. S16c,d). In addition, we have performed similar experiments with caged-IP 3 , which confirm that almost all Ca 2+ puffs occur near the PM (Supplementary Fig. S16a,b). The fuller presentation allows us to show that even when Ca 2+ puffs do occur in the middle of the cell, they are invariably at the periphery, close to the PM. The new observations are discussed in the text (p9, middle), which we have re-organised to segregate the evidence that puffs occur near the PM from the evidence that even within the near-PM IP 3 Rs, only the immobile puncta respond (p9-10). Our conclusion that puffs occur predominantly near the basal PM concurs with a previous report, which is now cited 8 (p9, middle). We hope that the revised text (including Discussion, p14, middle) now more clearly makes the point that to be 'licensed' to respond, IP 3 Rs must be both near the PM and immobile. It is, therefore, a remarkably small subset of all IP 3 Rs that are 'licensed'.\n\nb.

A description of the uncertainties which arise from the fitting procedure are described in Section S4 of the Supplementary Information. Here we show that fitting simulated data with noise levels that are comparable to those in the experimental data returns the S-matrix amplitudes that were used to simulate the data within 10% ( Figure S7). As the probabilities presented in Table 1 are the square of these values, this leads to an approximate uncertainty of 20% in these values. We have made minor changes to the text to further emphasise that this information is given in the SI by rephrasing the following text on page 7.\n\nFurther details of the fitting procedure, the tests that were done to ensure the results correspond to a unique, converged S-matrix and the uncertainties related to this procedure can be found in the SI.\n\nIn addition, the calculated populations of different mJ states seem highly oscillating in Fig.  2c. This suggests that the measured S-matrix should be very sensitive to the length and field strength of B1. Could this be part of error?\n\nThe Reviewer is correct that any errors in the magnetic field profiles can introduce errors into the S-matrix elements that are obtained through the fitting procedure. However, as detailed in Section S4 of the Supplementary Information, fits have also been done where the length of the magnetic field profile and field strength of B1 have been changed to determine what effect this has on the S-matrix we obtain from the experimental data. We find that the Smatrix elements change by a few percent, but by less than our stated 10% uncertainty in the values.",

At moderate negative substrate bias voltage (of V S = -0.61 V, cf. schematic drawing in Figure S5a and STM image in Figure 3e, Main Text), all molecule parts (i.e. the MSW backbone, the pillar unit carrying the perylene monoimide (PMI) unit, as well as the alkoxy side chains interdigitating intermolecularly on the HOPG substrate) are clearly visible. From this we conclude that the HOMOs of both MSW backbone and PMI/pillar units should be energetically located in the conduction region, contribute to the image contrast, and therefore might be visible by STM. The scenario should change at larger negative sample bias voltage V S , here defined as a voltage closer to zero (of V S = -0.50 V, cf. schematic drawing in Figure S5b and STM image in Figure 3f, Main Text): In this case, the HOMO of the 3D unit (i.e. PMI/pillar) may be energetically located outside (or, below) the conduction region. Consequently, the HOMO of the MSW backbone is the only orbital energetically located within the conduction region, so that only this molecule part renders visible (as seen in Figure 3e, Main Text). At small positive bias voltage (of V S = +0.50 V, cf. schematic drawing in Figure S5c and STM image in Figure 3g, Main Text), the 3D unit dominates the image contrast, as its HOMO is energetically located in the conduction region, while the HOMO of the MSW backbone is not, and is consequently invisible (or barely visible) in the STM image.

We used the line tool to draw a segmented line, three pixels wide, over the length of the microtubule. We used the macro \"measure stacks\" to measure the mean intensity of the line for each frame of the movie. The same line was moved to a location without microtubules to measure the mean background intensity near the microtubules. The intensity was normalized by dividing the intensity by the background (I measured /I BG ) to give the signal to noise ratio. In order to remove the background, we subtracted one (1 = I BG /I BG ).\n\nThis caused all the initial intensities to be one. The individual, normalized microtubule intensity data were then averaged together and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean over multiple measurements of different filaments. There is some variability in the measured fluorescence, as described in the main text. This is most likely due to the laser power fluctuating over time from experiment to experiment. As well as the fact that the normalization described above is performed for each microtubule separately, introducing some stochastic noise into the final average. The intensity fluctuations have the largest effect on the measurement of the final microtubule polymer fraction remaining found by fitting to Equation 1. Because of this, we have quoted the uncertainty of the fits from the data in the text but plotted the uncertainty in the measurement as 7% in Figure 1c.\n\nThe number of microtubules analyzed for each experimental parameter are given in the figure captions. The data were fit to exponential (Equation 1) or linear (Equation 2) rate equations using least squares fitting routine in KaleidaGraph. The fit parameters with uncertainty of each fit, and goodness-of-fit parameters are given in Tables S1-S4.\n\n\n| Depolymerization speed analysis",

I would question that at L120 \"While the model… invalidating…\", if you look at the C2 fits, the errors are large (typically >50 %) and thus there is perhaps a more reasonable view that there is significant uncertainty in this area within the EXAFS due to the complexity of the fits and really whether it is C2 or U-U is unclear although the C2 looks perhaps slightly better fitting. I am not sure you can be as strong as saying U-U is invalidated. I wonder what happens if you exclude the C2 and introduce the U -U as the main fit -does this give realistic values?\n\nRESPONSE: We agree with the reviewer that the uncertainties are large and we do not hide this. But the fact that the uncertainty in the U-U coordination number (CN) is larger than the CN number indicates that the model can describe the data just as well without the U-U signal. The uncertainty in C2 is smaller than the CN number and thus indicates that this signal is required to have a model of this quality. So the data are clear. U-U is not required, but could persist at a low level, while C2 is required. 8 CHANGE: We added two more sentences to the discussion in Lines 132-139 the text to address this difference. Figure S3 (formerly S4) shows the data for all depths with the k-weight analysis.\n\nREVIEWER COMMENT: \"While the model invokes contributions from U-U pair correlations indicative of U (IV) minerals such as uraninite, the uncertainty in the U-U coordination number (CN) is as large or larger than the CN at all depths, invalidating significant contributions from uraninite( Tab. 1b and Fig. 2C).\n\nRESPONSE: The U-U signal is not required to have the same quality of fit between model and data. The uncertainty in C2 while large is smaller than the CN, indicating that the model requires this signal to maintain the quality of fit.\" CHANGE: The text has been edited to clarify the statement in Lines 126-132.\n\n\nRESPONSE TO REVIEWER 2:",

We can find no \"extreme\" HB cases that give a more self consistent Fe I solution across all of the diagnostics than the one obtained with an intermediate age.

The maximum intensity of the resonant state occurs at the same PE (within experimental uncertainty) as for the surface in UHV conditions. 3. The position of the resonantly enhanced above VBM feature shifts to higher BE values compared to its position in UHV. Together, these findings suggest that the resonant state arises from the same set of V 3d (localized) orbitals irrespective of whether the surface is pristine or exposed to water. A detailed analysis of the resonant state for the surface in 0.05 Torr H 2 O allows the disentangling of its two spectral components, separated by 0.4 eV (Figure 4b). The low BE component (BE = 1.5 eV) represents the resonant contribution from the reduced V 4+ generated by the localization of the excess charge from the Mo 6+ dopants or more generally non-hydroxylated VO 4 moieties, as previously assigned; 8 the higher BE component (BE = 1.9 eV) is related to the conversion of surface V 5+ to V 4+ upon the adsorption of water and likely the hydroxylation of the VO 4 moieties. With this additional insight, we now turn to DFT    Figure 4 and text for further details).

The absolute levels of editing in our study are consistent with recent reports that characterize efficiency within the entire cell population after Cas9 RNP delivery: two recent reports with human iPSCs reported ~1-10% of alleles being edited (A. M. Tidball et. al. Stem Cell Reports, 2017 andH. Ma et. al. Nature, 548, 413-419, 2017). New deep sequencing experiments with our S1mplexes at the BFP locus and a third locus, GAA, with <5 bp changes confirm our consistent 1-10% levels of absolute editing (please see Figure 4). Also, we now explicitly state the absolute levels of editing on page 6 in the main text (noted in red). Many studies to date perform selection (subcloning, drug selection or flow cytometry) which is typically not accounted for in the efficiency calculations reported in literature. Our S1mplex strategy should be complementary to those enrichment and selection approaches.\n\n2) Another issue is that no optimization, or even testing, of important variables is presented. Because of constraints imposed on the ssODN by physical tethering to the RNP complex, one would expect some exploration of the length, polarity, and mutation location.\n\nWe have now explored these issues over the last three months with significant new experimentation. New data in Figures 3a and 4 explore the effects of various ssODN lengths, ssODN polarities, ssODN tethering locations, and S1m aptamer locations. A detailed discussion of these results is on pages 9-10 of the main text (additions are noted in red).\n\n3) The gel shift data do not include reports of stoichiometries.

Though an absolute determination of this energy was not the goal in our experiment one may wonder what is the source for this mismatch. The scatter in the recommended values across measurements is of the order of 100 meV, i.e., much smaller than the shift. The uncertainties in our measurements originate from the calibration of the measured photon energy via indirect measurements [mostly angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)]estimated to be 50-150 meV, the energy calibration of the electrons of about 50 meV (at around 20 eV), while the two ions contribute about 200 meV due to calibration using previous N 2 data [5]. Therefore, the absolute energy shift used in Fig. 4 is within the combined uncertainty of our measurement and the scatter in the recommended data.\n\nIn principle, though with significant effort, the uncertainties in our measurements can be reduced to enable accurate determination of the absolute energy. However, to identify the final states of the fragmentation process it is sufficient to use the relative energies (i.e., energy spacings between the peaks), and one would expect them to always be more precise, as they are independent of some of the systematic errors, like the accuracy of the beamline monochromator calibration or uncertainties in the dissociation energies.\n\n\nSupplementary References\n\nFig. 1\n1Pathway separation method.

To test our method we used two systems that were previously presented: the dictionary-based method Whatizit [18] and a machine-learning approach that uses CRF models based on a manually annotated patent document corpus to locate the chemical terms [19] and a lexical similarity method to perform resolution of those terms to ChEBI [20].

This score corresponds to a measure of similarity between the target entity and those found nearby.

Why not just take the mineral sample after the injection and analyze the mineral composition and chemical compositions? Clarified to say that it is difficult to determine the extent and the flux of mineral precipitation using only dissolved elemental concentrations. Using solids to calculate fluxes is not possible: firstly because changes are tiny (which is why the more greatly changing dissolved concentrations are used), and secondly, because determining fluxes via solids is also not possible. We'd be looking for a few hundred tonnes of carbonate spread over millions of m 3 , all several hundred metres below the surface. Clarified in L64-66.\n\n6.

This is now mentioned in the text. This is smaller than the estimate based on Ca isotopes, because it is based on only 2 measurements (because C is being injected), while the Ca isotope estimate is based on 19 measurements (see below), which means that the error is larger, but that time-resolution is possible.",

In both calibration methods, the temperature probe was placed halfway between the two electrodes and heating elements, respectively. Meanwhile, the Joule heat is generated at different locations in the two calibration methods. In the heating elements experiment, Joule heat is generated in a resistive wire positioned at the exact same location as the electrodes in the porous carbon experiment; hence, the location of reversible heat production. Meanwhile, the weak saltconcentration dependence of the total resistance of the electrochemical cell (that was mentioned in the main text) indicates that in the porous carbon experiment, Joule heat is probably produced at the electrical contacts [see Fig. 1(a)], which is further away from the temperature probe than in the heating elements experiment. In line with our experimental findings, we note that a unit amount of Joule heat, generated at increasingly large separations from the temperature probe, leads to ever smaller ∆T -signals, resulting thereby into ever higher Kvalues. Clearly, employing the K c.e. -calibrated with Joule heat generated at the electrical contacts-in a calculation determining the reversible heat generated at a location closer to temperature probe, will overestimate its value. For the main text, we therefore chose to prioritize K h.e. .\n\nThe above calibration uncertainty would not have been present if the cell had had a uniform internal temperature at each instance. To accomplish that, instead of a sudden step, one should slowly apply the external potential, such that the cell can equilibrate internally while being heated. Such experiments with the current cell were unsuccessful because heat flowed out of the cell too quickly; the measured temperature differences were too small compared to the equilibrium temperature fluctuations to separate signal from noise. Hence, resolving the calibration uncertainty poses an experimental challenge, which will require the development of a better insulated and an even more sensitive calorimetric setup.\n\nAll above-mentioned reservations aside, the obtained heat transfer coefficients K c.e. and K h.e. still only differ by approximately 30%.\n\nAppendix C: Time scales of current and temperature-difference decay Figure 3(b) and (c) exhibit a decaying current and temperature difference that we now discuss in more detail.",

Our primary reason to move the L2/3 model to the supplementary material was to simplify the narrative of the paper. However, we believe that the case of the L2/3 cells is sufficiently different from the CA1 cell so that it is well worth to present the related data and emphasize the consequences. The L2/3 neuron has a different morphology and receives input with a completely different input statistics from that of a CA1 pyramidal cell. In particular, both the baseline input firing rate and the correlations between the inputs are very different in the visual cortex and in the hippocampus, raising the possibility that the minimal cluster-size to trigger nonlinear responses could also be different. Moreover, a substantial part of the experimental data about synapse clustering has been collected in the visual cortex -therefore we thought that it is essential to perform the same analysis on visual cortical neurons. Our finding that the minimal cluster size is similar in the visual cortex and the hippocampus suggests that this might be a general principle and thereby we believe widens the impact of our study.\n\n-It is not clear why it is necessary to begin the paper with a simple simulation of global plasticity. In fact, given the brevity of text and the fact that the associated figure is in supplemental, it seems like an afterthought.

As described in the main text, the binding site encompassing residues His50−Lys58 and Thr72−Val77 on PDB 6CU7 4 was selected due to its propensity to form a pocket according to Fpocket 5 software and its simultaneous mid to low solubility according to CamSol 6 ( Figure S3). Additionally, a key histidine residue in this site was predicted to protonate below the pH value where αS more readily aggregates (pH 5.8).\n\nA binding box was selected that had size 12 Å by 12 Å by 9 Å centred at 10.00 Å, 9.89 Å, 11.52 Å on the 6CU7 PDB, encompassing the site of interest. The target protein was left rigid, while the ligand was flexible, able to translate and rotate (including rotation of internal bonds). We prepared (added hydrogens) the target protein using and this is what is shown in Figure S5 (though improvement is not drastic as further data is added, possibly due to the relative ease with which strong dockers are selected).\n\nDifferent uncertainty penalties were tested during this process. We found that a low uncertainty penalty produced better results by removing the most overconfident predictions without placing too many limitations on the model. At the early stages most predictions with low uncertainty were those with predicted binding scores close to the mean of the training set. An excessive uncertainty penalty during these stages would cause the model to only predict molecules that it was confident in, which were also likely to be mild.\n\nThe same process was utilised using different parts of the molecular feature set (the latent vector consists of a tree vector representation of clusters within a molecule, plus a graph representation of the molecule), and it was found that GPR performance metrics were better when using the molecular graph alone compared with using the entire representation. In general, it is to be expected that fitting fewer features to a predicted value is easier for a regressor to achieve and so higher scores are obtained.",

Namely, \"how does one now explain the reality that system's here on Earth radiate blackbody radiation whose thermal signature cannot be approximated as some linear function of temperature?\"\n\nTemperature is a comparative based upon the Zeroth law.

WHAT IS THERMAL ENERGY?\n\nThermal energy resides within condensed matter, as both intermolecular vibrations that are between molecules, and intramolecular vibrations that are between the various atoms within a molecule. A better definition may be that thermal energy consists of a spectrum of thermal photons (thermal radiation) whose wavelengths are sufficiently long that they are readily absorbed by condensed matter plus any phonons that are associated with molecular vibrations (both inter and intra). Of course, a most rudimentary definition being that thermal energy is heat.\n\nHere on Earth, thermal energy primarily involves frequencies at, and/or close to the infrared spectrum with the emphasis on the \"thermal infrared\" [aka mid infrared: (3μm < λ < 8μm)] and into the far infrared [aka long infrared (8μm < λ < 15μm)].\n\nShorter wavelength photons, such as those in the near infrared (740nm < λ < 3μm) and those considered as visible light (380nm < λ < 740nm) can also contribute as thermal energy, e.g., when they are absorbed by matter. This absorbed energy becomes part of that matter's various vibrational energies. And this energy is generally, then reradiated as thermal photons, i.e., at a lower frequency (infrared) than the absorbed frequencies.\n\n\nVI. WHAT ABOUT BLACKBODY RADIATION?\n\nBlackbody radiation is theoretically limited to cavities within crystalline matter.

Yet when considering their heat capacities, all condensed matter fundamentally adheres to the same principles, e.g., the law of Dulong and Petit. It strikes this author as odd that crystalline solids thermally behave the same as amorphous solids, yet theoretically they are not theoretically considered the same it comes to their radiation.",

It roughly approximates a \"decreasing linear\" function of increasing wavelength. However, the requirement for the Rayleigh-Jean's approximation as ascribed by ℎ ≪ is not valid for most of the near infrared. It can be shown that ℎ ≈ when, λ ≈2,500 nm =2.5μm. I.e., the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation when applied to our Sun's insolation only becomes valid when λ>2.5μm.\n\nAccepting that λ > 3μm = 3,000 nm constitutes the majority of thermal energy that is witnessed here on Earth, may help explain why system's thermal energies here on Earth tend to be directly proportional to temperature.

INTRODUCTION\n\nTraditionally in thermodynamics the notion of thermal energy lacks the precision of clarity. One considers temperature (T) as the parameter that relates to the kinematic motions at the molecular level in most matter. This actually forms the basis of statistical thermodynamics, as can be found in most contemporary books [1,2]. Statistical arguments are based upon the kinematics of matter, hence the bizarre notion that all vacuums have no temperature, has become accepted. When measuring a system's temperature, a thermometer is placed into thermal contact with that system. Thermal equilibrium occurs once the influx of thermal energy equals the efflux between both the thermometer, and the system. This actually forms the basis of the transitive property known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics which states that \"If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other\" [1, pg 282]. Intuitively, the third system may be considered a thermometer.",

Importantly, the thermal radiation existing in freespace is relevant to a proper understanding of thermodynamics. It is probably the case that the thermal energy from our Sun's insolation can be approximated by some linear function of temperature. Hence, our Sun's radiance may help us understand temperature's linear functionality, as witness here on Earth, with our atmosphere being the massive heat sink/bath to which most other systems are compared.\n\nClarity as to the exact meaning concerning thermal energy remains awkward. Accepting that it is the energy that results in molecular vibrations, then it is primarily in the thermal infrared and extends into the far infrared spectrum. Depending upon the matter in question, and it may also include certain frequencies in both the visible, and near infrared, as well as the microwave.\n\nHere on Earth's surface, we may reside in a unique position where a system's thermal energy density is linearly proportional to its temperature. Moreover, this linear functionality has a temperature range, i.e., it does not apply to either high temperature systems, e.g. blast furnaces, nor to low temperature systems, e.g. systems approaching absolute zero. The exactness of such limitations, have yet to be properly determined.\n\nThe implication of the new understandings presented herein will be fundamental in any new understanding of thermodynamics. It also means that there exists a need to create new realistic models for climate change, models that recognize that global warming is due to man's activities and have little to do with the so-called greenhouse gases.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT I would like to thank Gail, and Lloyd Mayhew for their assistance in putting this paper together.\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Sketch for our Sun's spectral irradiance for visible light through to the far infrared X.

[9] for strongly radiating jet flames, and by Suo-Anttila et al. [10] for ethanol, ethanol/toluene, JP8, and heptane pool fires.The maximum emission observed in Figure 4 is between the blackbody emission curves at 1400 and 1600 K and corresponds to the emission of a blackbody at a temperature of 1522 K.This temperature may be interpreted as the gas temperature.\n\nA similar experimental study was carried out using KO as fuel.Figure 5 shows the maximum emission spectra obtained from the burning of KO fuel beds with a length ranging from 0.5 to 3 m.Data for fresh and dry KO are reported for the same load and same flame length.The comparison between Figures 4 and 5 indicates that the change in fuel type significantly affects flame emission.As previously observed for WS fuel beds, the trend of an increasing emission with fuel bed length is also seen, but with lower emission levels.The emission from soot is also undoubtedly observed.The emission at around 2300 cm −1 is still very high, close to that of a blackbody at 1600 K. Emission spectra obtained using fresh KO as fuel gave lower intensities from both inflame soot particles and gas species, as a consequence of different thermal degradation processes.\n\n\nSpectral Radiative Properties",

The dispersion exponent a is an empirical constant, ranging from 0.7 to 2.2, depending on the chemical composition and the porosity of soot particles. The identification of these properties is beyond the scope of the present study, but a 1/λ wavelength dependence is often considered as a good approximation [8]. This means that the greatest absorption coefficients are at the smallest wavelengths (or at the greatest wavenumbers, approximately in the range of [5600-6000 cm −1 ]), giving some justification to the assumption of blackbody emission in this range and some confidence in the reference value of 1400 K for the flame temperature. Therefore, considering the emission above, the 1400 K blackbody spectrum in the range attributed to CO-CO 2 , this suggests the presence of large quantities of relatively cold soot within the flame. This was already observed by Sivathanu et al. [9] for strongly radiating jet flames, and by Suo-Anttila et al. [10] for ethanol, ethanol/toluene, JP8, and heptane pool fires. The maximum emission observed in Figure 4 is between the blackbody emission curves at 1400 and 1600 K and corresponds to the emission of a blackbody at a temperature of 1522 K. This temperature may be interpreted as the gas temperature.\n\nA similar experimental study was carried out using KO as fuel. Figure 5 shows the maximum emission spectra obtained from the burning of KO fuel beds with a length ranging from 0.5 to 3 m. Data for fresh and dry KO are reported for the same load and same flame length. The comparison between Figures 4 and 5 indicates that the change in fuel type significantly affects flame emission. As previously observed for WS fuel beds, the trend of an increasing emission with fuel bed length is also seen, but with lower emission levels. The emission from soot is also undoubtedly observed. The emission at around 2300 cm −1 is still very high, close to that of a blackbody at 1600 K. Emission spectra obtained using fresh KO as fuel gave lower intensities from both inflame soot particles and gas species, as a consequence of different thermal degradation processes.",

Moreover, at such high temperatures the energy density associated with the blast furnace will be significantly greater than that of the surrounding atmosphere, hence the blast furnaces thermal energy will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a blast furnace is a system whose interaction with other system's cannot be expressed in terms of a linear function of temperature. This explains the white-hot blackbody radiation witnessed from hot molten metal, even though the visible part of the spectrum remains rather small for blackbody spectrum for T=1,800 K.",

(2003), and Rugheimer et al. (2015) in computing Biologically Effective Dose rates (BEDs). Specifically, we compute\nD = ( λ 1 λ 0 dλA(λ)I surf (λ)),\nwhere A(λ) is an action spectrum, λ 0 and λ 1 are the limits over which A(λ) is defined, and I surf (λ) is the UV surface radiance. An action spectrum parametrizes the relative impact of radiation on a given photoprocess as a function of wavelength, with a higher value of A meaning that a higher fraction of the incident photons are being used in the photoprocess. Hence, D is proportional to the reaction rate rate of a given photoprocess for a single molecule at the surface of a planet.\n\nAs D is a relative measure of reaction rate, a normalization is required to assign a physical interpretation to its value. In this paper, we report\nD = D/D ⊕ ,\nwhere D ⊕ is the dose rate on 3.9 Ga Earth. The atmospheric model for 3.9 Ga Earth is taken from Rugheimer et al. (2015), who use a 1D coupled climate-photochemistry model to compute the atmospheric profile (T, P, composition) for the Earth at 3.9 Ga, assuming modern abiotic outgassing rates and a background atmosphere of 0.9 bar N 2 , 0.1 bar CO 2 , with SZA=60 • and A = 0.2. Consequently, D > 1 means that the photoprocess is proceeding faster on the Martian surface under the specified atmosphere than it would on the surface of the Rugheimer et al. (2015) fiducial Earth. Note this normalization is different from what we chose in Ranjan and Sasselov (2017), because here we are trying to assess how Mars compares to the Earth as a venue for prebiotic chemistry.",

Therefore, more often than not, ignoring a system's thermal radiation, enables one to still accurately calculate a system's total thermal energy.

It can be described by the electromagnetic wave equation derived from Maxwell's equations [55]. Depending on the wavelength in ascending order, it can be classified into radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. In a vacuum, electromagnetic radiation, regardless of what kind, propagates at the same constant velocity c, the speed of light [55]. According to the wave-particle duality electromagnetic radiation carries quantized energy in the form of photons [56]. The energy E carried by a photon is proportional to the radiation's frequency and is given by E = hν where h is Planck's constant and ν the frequency of the radiation [57].\n\nLight from the Sun in the visible spectrum is the main natural source of electromagnetic radiation on Earth and absorbing photons from the Sun's radiation is the major primary resource of free energy for biological processes on Earth today. Since Earth's atmosphere is not transparent for gamma rays and ultraviolet rays [58], visible light is the window of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum with the highest frequency and thus the highest energy of individual photons that can reach the Earth's surface. Even on primitive Earth visible light at wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm provided 70 mW·cm -2 which was by far more energy than electromagnetic radiation of all other wavelengths could deliver [59], and light energy was presumably also the most abundant source of energy on the prebiotic Earth [60]. An organism's ability to transform the energy of photons from the Sun into biochemical energy in form of ATP is called phototrophy. If concomitantly CO 2 is reduced to form biomass this kind of phototrophy is termed photosynthesis [61]. The importance of photosynthesis to biology in general is impressively demonstrated by the notion \"big bang of evolution\" when its origin is mentioned [62]. The most abundant electron donor for photosynthesis is water and during this so called oxygenic photosynthesis the majority of atmospheric oxygen is produced [63]. In general, phototrophic organisms absorb photons of visible light from the Sun at many different wavelengths [64].",

It can be observed how the solar spectrum does not strictly follow the blackbody law in atmospheric composition with location, elevation and season are limited. More significant seasonal and location-dependent fluctuation are observed in the precipitable water, i.e., the water contained in a column of unit cross-section extending from the Earth's surface to the \"top\" of the atmosphere.

The absorption by the ozone layer is responsible for a significant shielding in the UV-portion, shifting the begin of the window for solar photochemistry from 250 to 300 nm [17]. The lack of UVC photons in the solar radiation at ground has a significant impact on the photochemical transformation that can be powered by solar light.

On the one hand, the use of visible light simplifies the photoreactor design: for example, UV-transparent glass (e.g., quartz of Vycor) can be replaced by less expensive glass or polymeric materials. On the other hand, the wide availability of inexpensive, efficient and narrowband lamps emitting in the visible, such as LEDs, reduces the attractiveness of sunlight as a free photon source. It should be noted, though, that the intensity of the solar spectrum in the visible is significantly higher than in the UV range (see Fig. 2).

Previous studies showed a prebiotically plausible synthesis of b-d-ribocytidine-2¢,3¢cyclic phosphate and subsequent UV-driven conversion to bd-ribouridine-2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphate. The UV light (254 nm narrowband emission) also acted to destroy other synthetic co-products, enriching the relative concentration of the canonical ribonucleotides used by life today. To assess the prebiotic plausibility of the conversion of the C > p to U>p, we first studied the wavelength dependence of the reaction rate, as monitored by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. This analysis showed that the photochemical step proceeded best at an irradiation wavelength of 265 nm. In the context of the spectral flux available on the surface of the early Earth, generally, longer wavelengths are more accessible, meaning the reaction is more efficient under more realistic conditions. To quantify the effect of varying amounts of surface radiation at different wavelengths, we computed the weighted surface intensity, which accounts for the rate of the reaction as a function of wavelength and the intensity of the radiation available on the surface of the early Earth at each wavelength. Two hundred sixty-five nanometers are still the most efficient wavelength, with the window of usable radiation for this reaction occurring around 255-285 nm. Outside this window, either the reaction rate or the radiation intensity drops low enough that the weighted surface intensity suffers significantly. It is fortuitous that the most efficient wavelengths for this reaction are those that are not significantly screened out by plausible prebiotic atmospheric constituents and are available at sufficient intensity from the early Sun to drive the reaction. Our study demonstrates that the wavelengths that are necessary to drive this reaction would likely be available on the surface of the early Earth.",

As was previously mentioned in the analysis of sources with discrete spectrum, the attenuation observed for the red part of the visible spectrum is due to the effect of camera filters.

Previously, spectroscopy came from the study of visible light that is dispersed with relation to its wavelength through a prism. As time progressed, the concept of spectroscopy was explored further and eventually included any interaction with energy derived from radiation that could be quantified and organized from its wavelength [1]. Max Planck's definition of blackbody radiation, Albert Einstein's view of the photoelectric effect, and Niels Bohr's understanding of atomic structure and spectra collectively come together to define spectroscopic studies and develop what is known as quantum. Spectroscopy is utilized constantly in both analytical and physical chemistry because unique spectra are found in atoms and molecules. Therefore, spectroscopy is utilized often to discover, define, and quantify information about the molecules and atoms. There are other fields that utilize spectroscopy as well such as astronomy, for remote sensing on Earth [2]. Spectroscopy is a sufficiently broad field that many subdisciplines exist, each with numerous implementations of specific spectroscopic techniques. The various implementations and techniques can be classified in several ways. Spectroscopy is a very wide field that has multiple subcategories, each with its own application of techniques unique to spectroscopy. The various implementations and techniques can be classified in several ways. A few examples of the multitude of spectroscopy categories are scanning tunneling microscopy spectroscopy (with Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, 1981), electron paramagnetic resonance (with Yevgeny Zavoisky, 1944), nuclear magnetic resonance (with Edward Mills Purcell and Felix Bloch, 1940s), microwave spectroscopy (with James Clerk Maxwell, 1864), and infrared spectroscopy (with Sir Frederick William Herschel, 1800).

One can now consider that it is not the notion of heat capacity that falters, rather it is our concept of temperature that collapses.

A cryogenic cell can easily have surface area of >100 cm 2 , and would therefore have to experience a heat load of several watts. This would overwhelm most cryogenic refrigerators, so it is necessary to surround the cell with cold surfaces. Surrounding the cell by a blackbody shield cooled by a liquid nitrogen cryostat (77 K), or the first stage of a pulse tube cooler (∼ 30−50 K) will reduce the blackbody heat load on the cell to < 1% of the 300 K blackbody heat load. This heat load will instead be deposited into the blackbody shield; however, a typical liquid nitrogen cryostat or pulse tube cooler can easily handle these heat loads at these temperatures. The blackbody heat load can also be further reduced by covering the blackbody shield with several layers of thin aluminum-coated mylar \"superinsulation\".\n\nThe cell is also sometimes additionally enclosed in an inner radiation shield, typically around 4-5 K. This can help reduce the heat load further, since it could be eas-ier to superinsulate a radiation shield instead of the cell itself. Additionally, the 4 K shield could help to protect cryopumps, as discussed below.\n\n\nCryopumps\n\nEnclosing the cell in radiation shields means that the gas conductance to the external vacuum chamber is very low. If no pumping occurred inside the radiation shields, the buffer gas would build up to the point where the residual pressure was too high to allow for a beam. In the case of neon buffer gas, this can be solved by surrounding the cell with a radiation shield kept at a temperature where the vapor pressure of neon is acceptably low, which is simple to achieve with standard cryogenic refrigerators or liquid helium (for example, the vapor pressure of neon is < 10 −9 torr at 7 K). A neon cooled buffer gas beam inside a 4 K radiation shield can operate for extended periods of time; Hutzler et al. [7] operated such a beam continuously for over 24 hours without beam or vacuum degradation.",

In this mid-infrared spectral region the sapphire window material is highly opaque, and in contrast to the gas sample we expect the window material to emit blackbody radiation characteristic for its temperature. Due to thermal transport in the sapphire material, a cooling of the dense gas will cause a temperature variation also at the outer surface of the cell window. For this measurement, the temperature change of the sapphire window following a 30 s long optical cooling period was determined. In subsequent experiments, we have probed temperature information directly from inside the gas cell by means of thermal deflection spectroscopy [25][26][27] . A (non-resonant) helium-neon laser probe beam is sent collinearly and slightly displaced from the cooling beam through the high pressure cell, as indicated in To acquire the spatial temperature profile induced by the cooling beam, the lateral offset between cooling and probe beam was scanned. The obtained deflection data is shown by the red dots in Fig. 4 (13) K. This value is much larger than the above given result for the temperature drop detected at the outside of the cell window, which is easily understood by the thermal conductivity of the argon gas being much below that of the sapphire window material, so that the cooling within the gas volume near the beam focal region can proceed further. Our model used to simulate heat transfer in the gas cell volume assumes that the cooling rate is proportional to the optical intensity of the Gaussian laser beam, i.e. we neglect the influence of radiation transport, which assumes that ω<<l abs , where ω denotes is the cooling beam radius and l abs =1/α the absorption length. In general, we expect the influence of radiation transport to be less severe than in the area of ultracold atomic gases 14 \n\nFor the refractive index of the dense gas at the 632 nm probe beam wavelength (which is far detuned from the rubidium D-lines), a value n≅1.057 (6) for argon is used, 28 were the quoted uncertainty is predominantly determined by the accuracy of our cell pressure measurement.",

Photochemical responses.Models and Scenarios\n\n\nModels\n\nThe model details for the atmospheric coupled climate-chemistry column model and the theoretical spectral model have been described in Paper 1. Recent model updates include, for example, a new offline binning routine for calculating the input stellar spectra and a variable vertical atmospheric height in the model; more details were given by Rauer et al. (2011). The radiative-convective module is based on the work of Toon et al. (1989) for the shortwave region and RRTM (Rapid Radiative Transfer Module) for the thermal radiation. Since a main focus in this work is on photochemical effects, we will now provide a detailed description of the photochemical module. The model simulates 1D globalaverage, cloud-free conditions, although the effects of clouds were considered in a straightforward way by adjusting the surface albedo until the mean surface temperature of Earth (288 K) was attained for the Earth control run, as in earlier studies (Paper 1, Segura et al., 2003). The scheme solved the central chemical continuity equations by applying an implicit Euler solver that used the LU (Lower Upper) triangular matrix decomposition method with variable iterative stepping such that the stepsize was halved whenever the abundance of a long-lived species changed by more than 30% over a single step.\n\nThe version used here employs chemical kinetic data from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Evaluation 14 (2003) report. The scheme includes the key inorganic gas-phase and photolytic chemical reactions commonly applied in Earth's atmosphere, that is, with hydrogen-, nitrogen, and chlorine-oxide reactions and their reservoirs. The scheme was considered to be converged when the relative change in concentration for any species in any layer changes by less than 10 -4 over a chemical iteration that exceeded 10 5 s.\n\nFrom a total of 55 chemical species, 34 were \"long-lived,\" that is, the transport timescales are long compared with those of the photochemistry. Their concentrations were calculated by solving the full Jacobian matrix; 3 species, namely, CO 2 , N 2 , and O 2 were set to constant isoprofile values based on modern Earth, and the remainder of the species were \"short-lived,\" that is, assumed to be in steadystate, and therefore calculated from the long-lived species.

Accordingly, the concept of blackbody radiation became associated with above absolute zero enclosures.\n\nThe acceptance of traditional blackbody assertions is not universal, e.g., Robitaille [3] has claimed that the sciences wrongly chosen to adhere to Kirchoff's theory over that of Balfour Stewart.\n\nIt should also be noted that the classic idea of a blackbody in equilibrium emitting radiation at all frequencies did lead to what is commonly referred to as the UV catastrophe. This was avoided by Planck's realization that electromagnetic radiation is quantized, i.e., that being the photon. Leaving the details to others, this has also led to the concept that blackbody radiation can only be mathematically related to crystalline condense matter [3].\n\n\nIII. INTRODUCTION: EMISSIVITY VS ABSORPTIVITY\n\nAn object with no internal heat source is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, when that object emits as much radiation energy as it absorbs. Consider a thermometer placed in a vacuum filled with blackbody radiation. When in thermal equilibrium, based upon (2) the measured temperature is:\n= ( / ) 1/4(3)\nAgain, ask did the vacuum have a temperature prior to the placement of the thermometer into it? Based upon (3), I would argue that it had a temperature. Of course, this assumes that the vacuum is sufficiently immense that its total thermal radiation is significantly greater than the total thermal energy that was contained within the thermometer, prior to its placement. As previously stated, the above contravenes traditional assertions?\n\n\nIV. INTRODUCTION: TEMPERATURE VS THERMAL ENERGY",

In addition, due to the effect of electrons and electron-holes in the electrical conductivity, lower values of band gap energy, due to the iron presence, could improve the electronic conductivity of the photo-electrodes, thus leading to a better electrical conductivity and ion transfer [23], which are desirable properties for photo-electrodes aiming water splitting. Table 1 summarizes the computed band gap values (Eg) and equivalent wavelengths (λeq) that are capable of providing enough energy for the activation of the photo-electrodes. The radiation emitted by the sun is like that of a black body of 5,800 K. As it passes through the atmosphere, parts of sunlight are dispersed and/or absorbed. Chemical substances interact with sunlight and absorb certain wavelengths, altering the amount of light of those frequencies that reach the surface of the earth [25]. ASTM G-173 [24] formulates tables with values of energy quantity per wavelength (W m -² nm -1 ) that reaches the surface in normal plane (AM1.5 Direct), inclined plane (AM1.5 Global) and the irradiation before the atmospheric filter (AM0). Figure 4 shows the spectrum of solar radiation and equivalent wavelength (λeq) calculated from the optical band gap of the films. The lines corresponding to the equivalent wavelength (λeq) are represented for each film. It is important to emphasize that this is the maximum wavelength that still has enough energy to promote electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Thus, the percentage of photons that have enough energy to activate the material can be obtained by the charge of the energy of all wavelengths smaller than the λeq. As shown in table 1, the films produced in this work can potentially be photoexcited by up to 82% of the solar spectrum that reaches the surface of the Earth, thus being a promising candidate for use as a photo-electrode for the hydrogen production by photo-electrolysis. \n\n\nSEM studies",

That is as follows. All polyatomic gas molecules absorb and, then reradiate thermal radiation, as part of their vibrational energy. So, the next question becomes, \"is this thermal radiation, actually blackbody radiation?\"\n\nAnswering yes, then one begins to fully understand why there are such strong discrepancies between their heat capacities, and the traditionally accepted infrared spectrums of so many polyatomic gases. For example, it is traditionally thought that homonuclear gases have no absorption spectra in the infrared [10], even though they all clearly absorb thermal energy, as indicated by their heat capacities [11,12].\n\nOne must conclude that all polyatomic gases adsorb, and then re-radiate infrared thermal radiation, when in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, even when inside of a spectrometer. This is part of any polyatomic gas' vibrational energy, and that this is infrared thermal radiation, as defined by the Stephen-Boltzmann law, i.e., blackbody radiation! In other words, the above 2) is correct, while traditionally accepted 1) has to be wrong.\n\nThe above further means that in traditional infrared spectrometry, what one traditionally has witnessed, are the parts of a gas' infrared spectrum that are not necessarily directly attributable to the molecule's normal thermal signature, e.g., its dipole moments.\n\nCan we now conclude that \"all thermal energy is blackbody radiation?\" No, such a conclusion cannot be had, at this point.\n\n\nVIII.

For example, there are several indications of even richer diversity of UV-absorbing pigments in cyanobacteria than those hitherto characterized and classified into the two groups, mycosporines and scytonemins. The chemical structure and other elemental properties of one of these poorly investigated pigments, named gloeocapsin, have yet to be determined, but initial results suggest that it is chemically unrelated to both MAAs and scytonemins (Storme et al., 2015). Still other chemically distinct UV-absorbing cyanobacterial pigments, with a unique pterin structure, have been reported elsewhere (Matsunaga et al., 1993;Lifshits et al., 2016). The wavelengths of maximum absorption of these two ill-defined groups of cyanobacterial pigments are listed in Table 1 and are plotted in Fig. 5. As with the mycosporines and the scytonemins, their absorption properties are consistent with the optimization of dissipation of the prevailing photon spectrum at Earth's surface.\n\nTaken as a whole, these data seem to indicate that, rather than photosynthesis being optimized under a Darwinian \"survival of the fittest\" paradigm, that the origin and evolution of life is driven by photon dissipation with the net effect of covering Earth's entire surface with pigments and water, reducing the albedo and the black-body temperature at which Earth radiates into space.

It is often implicitly assumed in publications pertaining to point #2 that putative photopigments on other worlds would be identical to Chls. It is important to recognise that this assumption is not automatically guaranteed, to wit, other worlds might host photopigments that diverge from Chls in some notable respects.\n\nThe majority of publications centred on exploring extraterrestrial (oxygenic) photosynthesis have tended to adopt Chls as the basis of their experimental or theoretical analyses [35]- [46]. On the other hand, there is growing dissemination of the notion that extraterrestrial photosynthesis, in general, and photopigments, in particular, may differ substantially from Earth [47]- [57]. To offer a specific example, some publications have theorised that the number of functional units of photosynthesis (photosystems) coupled together could be higher on planets orbiting cooler stars than the Sun, thereby allowing for longer wavelengths to be efficiently harvested [35], [38], [47], [48], [50]- [52].\n\nIn addition to such modifications, the absorption characteristics of the photopigments may themselves be modulated by planetary and stellar factors (e.g., star temperature). It was proposed in Ref.\n\n[48] that the absorption maxima of photopigments analogous to the Q-bands in Chls might be fairly proximal to the peak spectral photon flux of the host star; the corresponding wavelength (!opt) associated with the latter is given by !opt ≅ 635 nm (T ★ /5780 K), where T ★ is the blackbody temperature of the star [8]. Other papers have, likewise, sought to use criteria such as energy input maximisation or noise minimisation to predict absorption maxima of putative photopigments on exoplanets [38], [54], [56], [57].",

A single blackbody curve cannot properly reproduce the overall shape of the dust continuum, suggesting that there is some stratification in the dust layers. From our point of view, we can see through the outer (and colder) dust layers up the point where the dust becomes optically thick; at that point, the dust temperature is T max d . We thus approximated the dust emission by a weighted sum of blackbody spectra at temperatures between T max d and an arbitrarily chosen minimum temperature T min d of 25 K in steps of 25 K. Assuming optically thin dust in radiative equilibrium with the hottest (optically thick) dust, we then determined the appropriate weights for each temperature bin consistent with a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate (i.e. we determined the mass in each layer). We find that the best model is one with a maximum dust temperature of about 425 K (see Fig. 1). However, even in such a case, we overestimate the dust emission at the longer wavelengths; this suggests that there is less cold dust than expected for a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate. Nonetheless, the cold dust does not matter much for the analysis of the molecular bands; for the modeling presented in this paper, we assume that the molecules are absorbing 425 K blackbody radiation.\n\nWe also note that our dust temperature estimate is higher than that in Paper I, but our estimate should be more reliable than their greybody fit.\n\n\nMolecular bands\n\n\nMolecular Inventory\n\nSuperposed on the dust emission are many absorption features due to various molecular species (see Fig. 2).

Depending on the wavelength, physical properties and biological activities, UV radiation is arbitrarily divided into three main categories: UV-C radiation (100-280 nm), UV-B (280-320 nm) and UV-A (320-400 nm). UV-A radiation is further divided into two sub-categories, longwave UV-A1 (340-400 nm) and shortwave UV-A2 (320-340 nm). Prior to their reduction by the Earth's atmosphere, UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C represent 6.3%, 1.5% and 0.5-1.0% of total solar irradiance, corresponding to an intensity of 85.7, 21.7 and 6.4 Wm −2 , respectively [1,2]. Among these, highly energetic UV-C radiation and almost 90-95% of UV-B radiation does not reach the ground due to absorption by the stratospheric ozone layer and losses through atmospheric scattering. Solar UV-B radiation reaching the Earth surface represents about 1-10% of total radiation, whereas almost all UV-A radiation (~95%) reaches the ground [1,3,4]. A declining ozone column leads to an increase in the intensity of UV-B reaching the Earth's surface, and the wavelength composition is also proportionally shifted towards shorter wavelengths, which are more dangerous [1,5].

By replacing the terahertz mixer and local oscillator of conventional heterodyne spectrometers with a plasmonic photomixer and a heterodyning optical pump beam, respectively, we demonstrated a heterodyne terahertz detector 2 with quantum-level sensitivities at room temperature and operation bandwidths exceeding 5 THz [21]. In this work, we use this plasmonic photomixer to resolve the spectral signatures of ammonia. Ammonia gas sensing is of interest for agriculture, combustion exhaust treatment, clinical breath analysis, and industrial process monitoring [22][23][24][25][26]. We chose ammonia for our first spectrometry measurements because its rotational spectra in the terahertz band provide comparable intensity to the strongest infrared vibrational bands. In addition, ammonia has relatively well-isolated lines in the 1-5 THz domain, allowing us to demonstrate the very broad operation bandwidth of the plasmonic heterodyne spectrometer, which cannot be offered by conventional heterodyne spectrometers.

Although not shown, these data are in qualitative agreement with the multispectral camera measurements. Figure 4 represents the maximum emission spectra obtained from the burning of WS fuel beds with a length varying from 0.50 to 4 m (e.g., Acq 2 in Figure 2 is the maximum emission spectra for the 1 m long flame in Figure 4). In this figure, spectral intensities are plotted as a function of wavenumber and wavelength. It is easy to observe that the emission level increases with the fuel bed length. A discriminant analysis shows that the emitted intensity around 2300 cm −1 (CO 2 products) seems to saturate, indicating that the opaque limit has been reached in this spectral range. This is not the case for the rest of the spectrum where the emitted intensities are still rising between 3 m and 4 m. In any case, the role of soot in radiation emission is evident. The near-zero emission level aside from the gas peaks for the 0.5 m long fuel bed is characteristic of an optically-thin flame. This is consistent with the conclusion drawn from   a previous study [4]. For flame lengths greater than 0.5 m, radiation emission becomes relevant in the whole infrared range, as may be easily deduced from the comparison with blackbody emission curves for temperatures of 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 K. From the spectral shape of flame emissions (Figure 4), it may be stated that the flame emissivity is stronger for large wavenumbers (in this range, emission spectra are closer to blackbody spectra) and that the emission level decreases for small wavenumbers. This is in agreement with the expectation that the absorption coefficient of soot strongly rises with wavenumber, as it will be discussed below. If the assumption of opaque flame holds for large wavenumbers, one can observe that the 4 m long flame emission starts from that of a blackbody at 1400 K, defining an effective flame temperature.

As for the case of CNDAS (lower panel), two obvious peaks and one kink-like shoulder can be observed in the emission spectrum. It is well known that the SL spectrum comes mainly from mechanisms such as plasma-like emission and emission from excited species like OH • [36]. In Fig. 4, the SL spectrum from water  and the main parts of that from CNDAS can be fitted by blackbody radiation formula [6], which implies it comes plasma-like emission. In SL spectrum from CNDAS, the kink-like shoulders and the peaks can be decomposed by Gaussian fittings [37] due to emission from excited species. Thus, the SL spectra can be fitted by a combination of blackbody radiation and Gaussian like characteristic emission via:\nP(λ) = a λ 5 [ exp ( hc λkBTb ) − 1 ] + ∑ n=1 a n exp [ − (λ − λ n ) 2 2b n 2 ] ,(2)\nwhere P(λ) is the spectral irradiance at a wavelength λ, a is the fitting coefficient for irradiance from blackbody radiation, T b is the blackbody temperature, and h, c and k B are the Planck's constant, the speed of light and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Furthermore, a n , b n and λ n are fitting parameters for the n th characteristic emission center. For SL from pure water, there is no obvious characteristic emission. Thus, we take only the first term in Equation (2) to achieve a good fitting. From Fig. 4, we see that the SL from water is stronger than that from CNDAS in the measured wavelength regime. Through fitting, we obtain the blackbody temperature for SL from pure water to be at about 15600 K and from CNDAS at about 11300 K. In our experiment, we find that there is a kink-like shoulder and two peaks in the emission spectrum of CNDAS. They are probably associated with characteristic light emission from excited species (e.g. OH\n\n\n•\n\n). Through Gaussian fitting, the kink-like shoulder and the peaks associate with characteristic emission in the spectrum from CNDAS are analyzed.",

[2] estimated the global solar radiation at various places.Their method was not capable of predicting the direct and diffuse components of radiation.Paltridge and Proctor [3] employed cloud data and latitude in a model which could predict the direct and diffuse daily solar radiation at the Earth's surface.Using the above model, Daneshyar [4] suggested a modified version of Paltridge and Proctor model for Tehran (Iran).Jafarpur and Yaghoubi [5] estimated monthly and annual radiation for Shiraz (Iran).In another work, Samimi [6] developed a height-dependent model by the use of A. B. Meinel and M. P. Meinel [7] work.To predict the daily radiation for different places in Iran, he applied Sun-Earth correction factor, cloud factor, sunshine hours, and altitude of the location.Following his work, Yaghoubi and Sabazevari [8] used sunshine hours in order to calculate monthly clearness index (CI) for Shiraz (Iran).\n\nRehman [9] compared estimated daily radiation from 16 different radiation models for 41 cities in Saudi Arabia.He used latitude, altitude, sunshine hours, and albedo in his work.Other studies such as those of Al-Mohammad [10], Almorox et al. [11], and Zhou et al. [12] employed mainly sunshine hours for predicting surface global solar radiation for different places in the world.\n\nBecause of the differences in climate conditions of South and North Iran (see Table 1), it is necessary to test various radiation models in order to achieve the best radiation model applicable to either coastal region.",

Our planet orbits in the Habitable Zone of our star, but at least some of the water on Earth must have been delivered by primordial icy planetesimal and/or water rich chondritic meteorites.\n\nDid the early Earth capture these objects when they wandered into the inner solar system, or did our planet itself form further out and migrate inward? The answer is not clear at this point. What is clear is that habitability cannot just be reduced to a question of present-day location. The origin and fate of the water reservoir within the proto-planetary nebula is equally important.\n\nBy necessity, we have until now addressed this question using the very restricted sample of terrestrial planets in our own solar system: Venus, Earth and Mars. What have we learned?\n\nThe in situ exploration of Mars and Venus taught us that all three planets probably evolved from relatively similar initial atmospheric conditions, most probably including a primordial liquid water reservoir. In all three cases, a thick CO 2 atmosphere and its associated greenhouse effect raised the surface temperature above the classical radiative equilibrium level associated with their distance to the Sun. This atmospheric greenhouse effect was critical for habitability on Earth at a time when the young Sun was approximately 30% fainter than it is today (Newman and Rood, 1977;Gough, 1981) At some point in the past, the evolutionary paths of Venus, Earth, and Mars began to diverge.\n\nFor Venus, the combination of the greenhouse effect and a progressively hotter Sun led to the vaporization of all liquid water into the atmosphere, assuming a similar water reservoir as Earth. After upward diffusion, H 2 O was dissociated by UV radiation, causing the loss of hydrogen to space. Venus is today a hot, dry, and uninhabitable planet.\n\nIn contrast, Mars apparently experienced a 500 million year episode with a warmer, wetter climate, before atmospheric loss and a steady decrease in surface temperature trapped the remaining water reservoir in the polar ice caps and subsurface permafrost. Thus, Mars retained a fraction of its water reservoir.",

One can be surprised by the rather low number of photon emitted per second and per NP: one erbium center emits in average one photon every four seconds. This can be understood as lanthanides' excited states are long lived and also because the production of one green photon requires three energy transfer  [34] and recruiting the flavin-containing coenzymes as 1 O 2 sensitizers. In the skin, typical number of dyes per femtoliter is expected to be 750. This would correspond to an absorbance of 0.0014 in 1 cm of pure water according to a molar extinction coefficient of ca. 11300 L mol −1 cm −1 . To mimic such a situation, we have designed an experiment with larger nanoparticles (35 nm) and dilute 1-c dye: an absorbance at 540 nm of 0.11 ([1-c] = 1.14 × 10 5 mol L −1 ) corresponds to number of dyes of 6800 molecules per femtoliter. The photoswitching of the actinometer 1-c was clearly observed (Supporting Information File 1) and an initial \"bleaching activity\" of 20 dyes per NP and per second could be calculated by dividing the bleaching rate by the number of particles within the laser beam. However, is it very difficult to derive the emitted flux J 0 for this reactor geometry: with a characteristic length L of 9 cm, most of the light escapes the cuvette and no simplification can be done. Thus, privileging the spectral information (clear UV-vis spectra are indeed monitored) lead to a loss of information; another photoreactor design would then be necessary.\n\n\nConclusion",

It was then pre-equilibrated by contact with a uranium-free 5 m hydrochloric acid solution during 2 h of shaking and separated.\n\nFor uranium extraction, 2 mL of the aqueous solution was contacted with an equal volume of the preequilibrated organic solution. The mixture was shaken in a thermomixer at 20 • C during 1 h, and about 2 mL of the organic phase was sampled after 2 h of decantation for the spectroscopic measurements.\n\n\nB. Time-Resolved Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy\n\nThe sample was put in a 1 cm-long quartz cuvette that was placed in a TRLFS set-up as described afterwards. The excitation wavelength was provided by a tunable OPO system (PantherEx OPO, Excel Technology) pumped by a Nd/YAG laser at 355 nm (Surelite-I, Excel Technology). The excitation was tuned to λ ex = 427 nm which corresponds to a maximum of absorption by uranium(VI) in our samples. The 5 ns laser pulses were generated at 10 Hz for an energy of about 3.15 mJ. The detection set-up has already been described elsewhere [13]. The luminescence signal was collected during a gate width of 200 µs, at a gate delay of 100 ns after the excitation by the laser pulse. The luminescence spectrum of the sample was recorded at room temperature ((22 ± 1) • C). The luminescence spectrum presented in this work was obtained after 1000 accumulations. The background noise was subtracted from recorded spectrum.\n\n\nC. Computational details",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

Since the nitrogen atom is located at the centre of the cage, 9 we set this distance equal to the fullerene radius. The constant k parameterises the strength of the interaction between the two charge clouds. Performing an ab initio calculation of the value of k is beyond the scope of this work; instead, we treat it as an experimentally determined parameter.  29 The bracketed number gives the one standard deviation error calculated by taking the sample standard deviation of six measurements. We test this model by using Eq. (2) to predict the pressure shift given the bulk modulus B. By treating the cage as a sphere with volume V and bulk modulus B = −V ∂P/∂V , we obtain the expression\n∂∆A ∂P = 2∆A B .(3)",

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract ν s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane. The resulting ν s value amounts to (836 ± 18) cm −1 . It is in good agreement with the values, (823 ± 14) cm −1 , 825 cm −1 , and (850 ± 25) cm −1 observed in acetone [7], [C 4 mim][Tf 2 N] [8], and in [Bu 3 MeN][Tf 2 N] [9], respectively. This vibration corresponds to a Raman active vibration of the uranyl unit and can be correlated to the yl-U -O bond length. Using the empiric relation of Bartlett and Cooney [47]:\nR U−O /(Å) = 106.5 × ν −2/3 s + 0.575(1)\nwe calculated the U -O bond length to be equal to (1.77 ± 0.01) Å (using ν s = (836 ± 18) cm −1 ) for our uranyl sample. This value is in a good agreement with all experimental data listed in Table I, and can therefore serve as reference data to assess the accuracy of the ab initio calculations we will now discuss.",

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10.

The experimental spectrum was assigned by vibronic Franck-Condon calculations on quantum chemical models based on relativistic density functional approaches. The shape of the luminescence spectrum of the uranyl tetrachloride complex is determined by symmetrical vibrations and geometrical change upon emission. The possible change of the luminescence properties depending on the first and second uranyl coordination sphere was predicted theoretically for [UO2Br4] 2and [R4N]2[UO2Cl4] ([R4N] = [Bu4N], [A336]) model systems.The computations reveal that for U(VI), the second coordination sphere has little influence on the spectrum shape, making speciation of uranyl complexes with identical first coordination-sphere ligands tedious to discriminate. The computed structural changes agreed well with experimental trends; theoretical spectra and peaks attribution are in a good accordance with TRLFS and MCD data respectively.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe knowledge of the stoichiometries and stabilities of the chemical species of uranium is of key importance for the understanding of the chemical reactivity of uranium in environmental or industrial situations. The speciation of uranium in solution has then been a major topic of investigations by both experimental and theoretical methods. Among the powerful spectroscopic techniques, time-resolved laser-induced luminescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) has been widely used for the characterization of uranyl species in solutions and in solid phases, because of its high sensitivity to changes of the inner-sphere coordination of UO 2 2+ . The luminescence spectra of uranyl complexes in solution show in general a narrow energetic range about 6000 cm −1 . In this region just a single electronic transition between the initial and final states can be identified and it is vibrationally resolved with bands to different vibrational quantum numbers [1]. In the case of mixtures of uranyl species, the interpretation of TRLFS data can be difficult because of low resolution and overlapping of the emission spectra in similar time frame. Then spectroscopic considerations are often insufficient to unambiguously determine the nature of the complexes. This is why a theoretical support based on quantum chemical modeling appears as a way to better validate TRLFS data interpretations by decomposing the different effects that might induce changes in the emission spectra of uranyl complexes.",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The VCSEL array also exhibited stable wavelength shifts for changes in both the temperature and dissipated power, and a high-quality output beam.

A single blackbody curve cannot properly reproduce the overall shape of the dust continuum, suggesting that there is some stratification in the dust layers. From our point of view, we can see through the outer (and colder) dust layers up the point where the dust becomes optically thick; at that point, the dust temperature is T max d . We thus approximated the dust emission by a weighted sum of blackbody spectra at temperatures between T max d and an arbitrarily chosen minimum temperature T min d of 25 K in steps of 25 K. Assuming optically thin dust in radiative equilibrium with the hottest (optically thick) dust, we then determined the appropriate weights for each temperature bin consistent with a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate (i.e. we determined the mass in each layer). We find that the best model is one with a maximum dust temperature of about 425 K (see Fig. 1). However, even in such a case, we overestimate the dust emission at the longer wavelengths; this suggests that there is less cold dust than expected for a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate. Nonetheless, the cold dust does not matter much for the analysis of the molecular bands; for the modeling presented in this paper, we assume that the molecules are absorbing 425 K blackbody radiation.\n\nWe also note that our dust temperature estimate is higher than that in Paper I, but our estimate should be more reliable than their greybody fit.\n\n\nMolecular bands\n\n\nMolecular Inventory\n\nSuperposed on the dust emission are many absorption features due to various molecular species (see Fig. 2).

As noted in §4.2, the abundance reached with such a rate constant is not enough to explain the observed 556.936 GHz line. Since the rate constant for this reaction is not known and water abundance approximately scales with this rate, we have fitted R45 rate to get a 556.936 GHz line intensity in agreement with the observations. We find that it is necessary to increase the rate constant up to ∼10 −15 cm 3 s −1 . The peak abundance obtained then is ∼10 −7 as shown in Fig. 7 . With such an abundance profile, we have performed Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations. We show in Fig. 7 the lines predicted for ODIN in different scenarios in which the fluxes at λ=3 and 6 µm vary. On the left side the central star has been considered as a blackbody at T =T * with and without dust throughout the CSE. We consider carbonaceous grains with sizes between 0.01 and 1 µm and a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 500 (Knapp 1985). It is seen that the presence of dust enhances the 557 GHZ line intensity since grains absorb the photons from the star (its maximum is at λ=2 µm) and reemits at longer wavelengths, thus enhancing the flux at λ=6µm and exciting the bending mode of H 2 O. In fact, the IR spectrum of IRC+10216 as observed by ISO (Cernicharo et al. 1999) peaks at 10 µm due to the presence of dust and approximately corresponds to a blackbody of radius 20 R * with a temperature of ∼500 K. We can therefore simulate the IR flux that water in the outer envelope would receive by putting such a blackbody instead of the star. In Fig. 7 we see how the 556.936 GHz line intensity increases when the flux at λ 6 µm is enhanced by considering a blackbody with increasing temperature. These radiative transfer models show the importance of the IR pumping of the excited vibrational levels of H 2 O for the intensities of pure rotational lines in the ground vibrational state.

We have already demonstrated how Mass-Former can be used to identify a spectrum given a list of candidate structures. SIRIUS [45] is a popular tool for identification that does not rely on spectrum prediction. It may be possible to combine MassFormer with SIRIUS (or another existing tool) to improve structure identifications. For example, SIRIUS uses information in the query spectrum to predict chemical features (such as precursor formulae and fingerprints) that help with identification. These features could be used refine a set of candidate compounds that would subsequently be ranked by predicted spectrum similarity with the query. Alternatively, forgoing a candidate database entirely, MassFormer could instead be combined with a generative model for small molecules to help search the chemical space for high-scoring spectrum matches, as seen in other works [52,53]. Finally, MassFormer has potential for use in decoy generation [54,55], which plays an important role in false discovery rate (FDR) calibration for untargeted metabolomics experiments. Target-decoy methods work by introducing a number of pseudo-random data points (realistic but synthetic spectra) that are ground truth negatives, allowing for empirical estimation and tuning of confidence thresholds to meet an FDR criterion. Applying MassFormer to predict noisy spectra for compounds that are unlikely to exist already in the sample (such as pesticide molecules in human blood) is a potentially powerful strategy for generating realistic decoys, which would improve FDR estimates and reduce the chance of incorrect compound identifications.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nProblem Formulation",

Namely, \"how does one now explain the reality that system's here on Earth radiate blackbody radiation whose thermal signature cannot be approximated as some linear function of temperature?\"\n\nTemperature is a comparative based upon the Zeroth law. Here on Earth, all comparisons are made to our atmosphere, whose temperature is strongly influenced by our Sun's insolation. Arguably, our atmosphere's temperature adheres to the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation.\n\nFurthermore, thermal equilibrium does not mean that two systems in thermal contact exchange precisely the same radiation spectrum. Rather that they exchange the same quantity of thermal energy. And here on Earth, as the biggest of all heat sinks/baths, our atmosphere will govern the relationships that define any exchanges of thermal energy.\n\nSo perhaps, the best explanation for thermal energy witnessed here on Earth generally being a linear function of temperature is as follows. \"Our atmosphere has its thermal energy density (ET/V) directly proportional to temperature (T).

Specifically, in paper by Bengtson and Chester [10] there were presented the shifts of these SL observed in the spectra from Sirius and in the spectra from a radiofrequency discharge plasma in the laboratory: both types of the observations yielded red shifts that exceeded the corresponding theoretical shifts by orders of magnitude. In the same year Barcza [11] presented observations of hydrogen SL of n=19-23 in the spectrum from Sirius, i.e., higher-n SL than observed in the spectra from Sirius by Bengtson and Chester [10]. In a later paper Barcza [12] wrote \"measurements in the spectrum of Sirius Barcza [11] did not show any shift of Balmer lines lower than H21\" and questioned the shifts observed in the spectra from Sirius by Bengtson and Chester [10]. However, first Barcza [11] did not observe the same SL as Bengtson and Chester [10]. Rather, Barcza [11] observed higher SL (n=19- 23) than SL of n=13-17 observed in the spectra from Sirius by Bengtson and Chester [10]. As the principal quantum number n increases, the SL become much weaker in their absolute intensity, and also become much broader and thus subjected to blending/merging with adjacent SL. (In paper by Barcza [11] the author himself noted that the observed lines H20 and H21 were subjected to blending.) For these reasons it is much more difficult to reliably measure shifts of such higher-n SL observed by Barcza [11]. In distinction, Bengtson and Chester [10] emphasized that in their observations \"no measurements of the profile center were taken where there was strong blending in the wings\".

Furthermore, prior probabilities are chosen conservatively, so that \"unlikely\" molecular formulas are penalized only slightly: if there is sufficient MS/ MS data, SIRIUS 3 will \"overrule\" these priors, returning a molecular formula that violates one or even several prior assumptions.

First, a preliminary version of SIRIUS 3 was used in the CASMI contest 2013 to determine the molecular formula of 12 unknown compounds. Using only the fragmentation tree analysis described here and ignoring the isotope pattern data, we correctly identified eight molecular formulas, and placed an additional three in the top 2 [30]. In conjunction with isotope pattern analysis, we identified 10 out of 12 molecular formulas, and SIRIUS was selected \"best automated tool\" of the molecular formula challenge [50].\n\nSecond, we evaluate SIRIUS 3 on independent data by Stravs et al.

We use reference compounds from GNPS [22]; each reference compound is one instance, corresponding to several graphs (for the different molecular formula candidates of the precursor mass) we have to search in. We then filter instances: For example, we assume a mass accuracy of 10 ppm (parts per million), and discard compounds where the precursor mass is missing or outside outside this mass window. All details can be found in [3]. This leaves us with 4 050 compounds, each of which is then transferred to usually many instances of the Maximum Colorful Subtree problem. One reference compound resulted in between 1 and 21 748 candidate molecular formulas, with median 53 and average 263.8 candidates. To avoid proliferating running times, we consider only the 60 most intense peaks in a MS/MS spectrum that can be decomposed, which is again SIRIUS 3.6 default behavior.

However, in giant star-forming regions (e.g., Monreal-Ibero et al. 2011), stars are spreaded out through the gas. In this sense, in most cases, a central ionization source usage would not constitute a genuine representation of the situation. Ercolano et al. (2009) and Jamet & Morisset (2008) showed that the distribution of the O-B stars in relation to the gas alters the ionisation structure and the electron temperature. Hence, the ionization parameter partially depends on the distance of the ionizing source to the gas. However, in our case, we are considering an integrated spectrum of the UGC 4805 nucleus; thus, the stellar distribution may have a minimum effect on the emergent spectrum. In the case of giant H regions ionized by stellar clusters (e.g. Mayya & Prabhu 1996;Bosch et al. 2001), the hottest stars dominate the gas ionization (Dors et al. 2017a). Therefore, the assumption of a single star with a representative effective temperature as the main ionizing source, as assumed in our p-AGB models, is a good approximation (see e.g., Zinchenko et al. 2019).\n\nTo estimate the O/H and values for the UGC 4805 nucleus, we compare some observational emission line intensity ratios with photoionization model results using diagnostic diagrams and perform a linear interpolation between models.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nO/H calibrations",

As a result, it is unlikely that any ice exists on grains that receive substantial UV radiation. Therefore, protostellar UV radiation will likely not contribute to the energetic processing of grains in hot cores/hot corinos at 100-300 K. The ices will have sublimated at these temperatures into the gas phase, where high abundances of terrestrial-like organic molecules are observed. In contrast, in protoplanetary disks, stellar blackbody radiation from young stars, f including UV photons as well as intense bursts of stellar X-rays, lead to photochemistry as well as radiation chemistry. Similarly, blackbody radiation from the outer layers of the Sun, along with the solar wind of high-energy (up to10 keV) particles, is responsible for the photochemistry and radiation chemistry of solar system planetary objects.\n\n\nSecondary UV radiation\n\nThe source of UV light that initiates chemical reactions within cold starless cores and their environs, known as dark clouds, is thought to be local because these clouds are opaque to external UV light from the interstellar radiation field. The UV photons are formed interior to these molecular clouds where cosmic rays, mainly comprised of protons with energies between 10 and 100 MeV, ionize molecular hydrogen to generate secondary electrons, with mean energies around 30 eV. 13 These low-energy secondary electrons and primary cosmic rays excite the Lyman and Werner band systems of molecular hydrogen. The subsequent relaxation of the generated excited states leads to UV emission, whose spectrum is shown in Figure 2. The UV spectrum within dark clouds is, therefore, very similar to that of microwave-discharge hydrogen-flow lamps (MDHLs) used in typical \"photochemistry\" experiments. 14 However, the flux of secondary UV photons is estimated to be 10 3 photons cm −2 sec −1 , which is significantly smaller than that of MDHLs used in the laboratory to simulate UV radiation in dark, dense molecular clouds.\n\nf Young stars are categorized as T Tauri stars, Herbig Ae/Be stars, or massive young stellar objects.\n\n\nFigure 2",

For the purpose of evaluating SIRIUS 3, we split each datasets into two disjoint batches: the batch \"CHNOPS\" contains all compounds that use solely elements CHNOPS. The second batch, named \"contains FClBrI\", contains all compounds with at least one atom from FClBrI.\n\nThe first independent dataset was provided by Stravs et al. [49]. MS/MS data from this dataset is used without further processing or filtering. The second independent dataset consists of MS/MS spectra from MassBank [4] (http://massbank.jp). We use spectra of 1333 compounds. 958 compounds are measured on a QTOF instrument and provided by the Washington State University (266) (62). We remove compounds for which we find no parent peak within 10 ppm or 2 mDa of the theoretical ion mass (252 compounds), and compounds for which the merged spectra contain <5 peaks with relative intensity over 2 % (207 compounds).\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have presented a Maximum A Posteriori estimator for the problem of computing fragmentation trees, that performs significantly better than previous approaches for the problem, roughly doubling the number of correctly identified molecular formulas. Beyond estimating the hyperparameters of the method, our method SIRIUS 3 does not rely on any (spectral or structure) database. With recent methodical advances in the field [9][10][11][12][13][14][15], MS/MS data is increasingly searched in molecular structure databases. We argue that not depending on any databases for determining the molecular formula of an unknown compound, is an important advantage of SIRIUS 3 and any other method that does so: Restricting the search space to known molecular formulas makes the problem much easier and, hence, leads to favorable evaluation results for all available test data. But this approach must fail to detect compounds where not even the molecular formula is contained in any structure database.",

In order to evaluate the influence of the adopted stellar spectrum we have considered, appart from the Phoenix synthetic spectrum described in Section 2, a Kurucz synthetic spectrum for a star with an effective temperature of 3500 K, a surface gravity of 10 5.0 cm s −2 , solar metallicity, and a microturbulence velocity of 2 km s −1 (Castelli & Kurucz 2004) 7 , whose flux has been scaled down to get the same bolometric flux of a star with an effective temperature of 3400 K. The choice of the microturbulence velocity of 2 km s −1 in the Kurucz spectrum is adequate for a star such as GJ 436 (F. Castelli, private communication).

However, the UV spectrum of GJ 1214 has not been measured. Generally, M-stars such as GJ 1214 tend to be relatively more active than early-type stars, with stellar activity decreasing as a function of stellar age. In theory, we can place GJ 1214 on a stellar type vs. age diagram (such as from Selsis et al. 2007) to determine its expected level of UV flux. However, given the large uncertainty in the star's age (6 ± 4 3 Gyr; Charbonneau et al. 2009), the constraints that we can place on its UV flux are essentially meaningless. For this reason, we choose to include UV flux as an additional parameter in our grid of photochemical models. We choose stellar spectra that represent two bounding cases of a low and high UV flux as shown in Figure 1. It is our assumption that the actual UV spectrum for GJ 1214 falls somewhere in between these two extremes. For our low UV case, we employ a stellar model with the same T ef f and g surf as GJ 1214, which we calculate by interpolating between bracketing models by Hauschildt et al. (1999). The stellar model does not include sources of UV emission due to stellar activity, so it produces a spectrum that drops off precipitously in the UV following the stellar blackbody, which is almost certainly an underestimate for the actual UV flux from GJ 1214. For our high UV case, we take the observed time-averaged spectrum of the active M4.5V flare star AD Leo from Segura et al. (2005) (T ef f = 3400 K), which is one of the most active known M-stars. The incident stellar spectrum is then calculated at the orbital distance of GJ 1214b, from 100 to 1000 nm, and this flux is used for calculating photodissociation rates for the 33 photolysis reactions included in the photochemical kinetics code.\n\n\nTransmission Spectrum Modeling",

Our Maximum A Posteriori estimate roughly follows the scorings from [34,41,42]. In contrast to theirs, our approach does not rely on an expert-curated list of common losses; instead, common losses and their frequencies are learned from the data. To calculate the posterior probability of a FT, we propose models to estimate its prior probability and its likelihood. The prior probability is independent of the experimental MS/MS data, whereas the likelihood is the probability of the data, given the model. We estimate hyperparameters for determining the prior probability using experimental data; these hyperparameters are part of the released software and do not have to be retrained for applying the method. In contrast, parameters for mass accuracy and peak intensities used for estimating the likelihood of a FT can be set individually for every analysis. Finally, our method SIRIUS 3 uses hypothesisdriven recalibration from [47].\n\nWe evaluate FTs using two derived measures: both for the identification of molecular formulas of unknown compounds, and for searching a database for chemically similar compounds, the new FTs perform significantly better than state-of-the-art methods. In particular, SIR-IUS 3 performs significantly better than its predecessors for molecular formula identification. We argue that this is due to an increase in quality of the FTs computed by SIRIUS 3.

Note that in application, SIRIUS 3 can process such spectra without restrictions, as the mass of the parent peak is known from the MS1 measurement. From the remaining 3392 compounds, we use 2005 where fragmentation spectra contain at least five peaks with more than 2 % relative intensity, and the mass deviation of the parent peak is below the maximum of 10 ppm and 2 mDa, and the ion mass is below 1000 Da.

The review provides the necessary astronomical background for chemical physicists to understand and appreciate the unique molecular environments found in astronomy. The calculation of molecular opacities needed to simulate the observed spectral energy distributions is discussed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMolecules are associated with the 'cold' Universe. Historically astronomers first studied the spectra of hot, bright stars full of atomic emission and absorption lines. Except for the nearby Sun, cooler stars with molecular lines are fainter and more difficult to observe. As the surface temperature drops, the star reddens and the peak of the emission curve shifts to the infrared. (The Wien displacement law for a blackbody, T ¼ 2898 mm K, gives a maximum at 1 mm for 2898 K [1].) The total radiated power also varies approximately as the fourth power of temperature (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law [1]), in so far as stellar emission is approximated by a blackbody. The spectroscopic study of 'cool' sources with surface temperatures in the range of about 500-4000 K is therefore best carried out with large modern 10 m class telescopes to gather as many photons as possible in the near infrared and infrared spectral domains.",

It is seen that AB Aurigae outshines by 2-3 orders of magnitude the FUV flux of TW Hya because of the much higher effective temperature. However, T Tauri stars usually have an important FUV excess and may become very bright in lines such as Lyα (at 1215.67 Å). It is worth noting that TW Hya is brighter than AB Aurigae in the Lyα line and that in TW Hya the fraction of flux emitted in Lyα is about 30 % of the total flux emitted in the 910-2400 Å wavelength range. We also note that while the FUV spectra of AB Aurigae is similar to that of a 10,000 K blackbody, a 4000 K blackbody is a bad approximation for a T Tauri star as it completely misses the FUV excess. As will be discussed in Sec. 4, this has important consequences for the chemistry of the disk.\n\n\nDust and gas temperature",

This classification may be based on the exceptional isotope pattern of compounds containing chlorine and bromine, or the presence of certain losses in the fragmentation spectra for iodine. We argue that doing so is possible for ClBrI with high precision and recall; in fact, SIRIUS 3.0 offers an option to auto-detect chlorine and bromine by simple rules. But fluorine may pose a problem, as it has only a single stable isotope, and may be undetectable using characteristic losses (mass differences) in the MS/ MS spectrum. To this end, simulation results may be too optimistic for the 344 compounds containing fluorine.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of SIRIUS 3 against existing methods for determining the molecular formula using MS/MS data. As a baseline method to evaluate against, we use the naïve method that returns the molecular formula with the smallest mass difference to the measured parent mass. This method completely ignores all fragmentation data, but will nevertheless in some cases find the correct answer, in particular if there are only few possible explanations of the parent mass. This strategy identifies the correct molecular formula for 14.6 % of the instances, and in 31.3 % the correct formula can be found in the top 5. Both of our datasets have no systematic mass error, see Fig. 11 for the GNPS dataset; for datasets that show a systematic mass error, we expect worse identification rates for the naïve method.\n\nAnother common approach is to search the neutral parent mass in a compound database. If we restrict our search to molecular formulas that are contained in PubChem, and again rank molecular formula candidates by mass difference to the measured parent mass, we find the correct molecular formula for 17.1 % of the instances in top rank, and 59.8 % in the top 5. This approach is, by design, restricted to molecular formulas that are already known, and must naturally miss cases where no molecular formula is contained in a structure database. The improved performance is, hence, solely based on the reduced number of candidate molecular formulas, in particular for larger masses. We stress again that SIRIUS 3 is not restricted to molecular formulas from any database.",

We accessed this tool and provided information with processed peak lists, exact mass, and precursor adduct of each of the challenge (peak list) in the CASMI 2016 dataset. The 208 peak lists were entered into SIRIUS 4 as a benchmark data set for three parts computation, SIRIUS, ZODIAC, and CSI:FingerID. SIRIUS identifies the molecular formula for the measured precursor ions and annotates the spectrum by providing the molecular formula for each fragment peak. ZODIAC improves the ranking of the formula candidates provided by SIRIUS. CSI:FingerID identifies the structure of a compound by searching a molecular structure database. After computing, we obtained a formula-based top-k rank which included candidate's InChIKey for each peak list. Then, we compared the candidate's InChIKey and the compound true InChIKey to perform top-k ranking of the candidates. When we used the candidate list from the CASMI 2016 data, CSI:FingerID was able to rank the true candidate at the top consistently for all 208 peak lists. We assumed this is because the CASMI 2016 spectra may have been included in the training of the SVM model used by CSI:FingerID. To evaluate the performance of the CNN model with previously unseen MS/MS data, we ensured that all training spectra are structurally disjointed compared to the compounds corresponding to the CASMI 2016 dataset. When we used the candidates of CSI:FingerID, 21 compounds were not annotated in the ranked result or not considered as true candidates. Table 3 presents the ranking results calculated in two ways: (1) excluding the CASMI 2016 spectra for which the true compound is missing in the candidate list; and (2) considering all CASMI 2016 spectra in the testing set regardless of the presence of the true compound in the candidate list.

This is known as an orbital. The further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the more they gain potential energy associated to a determined orbital. Quantum Mechanics explains that orbitals have quantized energy levels and for moving an electron to another level, it has to receive or emit the exact amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the two electronic levels (ΔE = E 1 -E 0 ). The amount of energy required to move and electron from energy level E 0 to energy level E 1 can be provided by heat due to a collision with other particles or absorb the energy of a photon. In this case, the energy of a Photon (E = h = hc/ ) should be equal to the difference between the orbitals (ΔE), this is, only a Photon of a particular wavelength is absorbed and can promote that transition. This phenomenon is known as atomic absorption. A more stable electron configuration of an atom is the one with less energy, also known as ground state configuration. The difference of energy between the last full orbital and the next empty orbital of the atom in a ground state is of the same order of magnitude of photons with wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm, this means, photons in ultraviolet regions and visible light of electromagnetic spectrum. Sodium atom in ground state, e.g., has an electronic configuration of 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 1 . The 3s electron can receive a photon with energy of 589.0 nm (E=2.2 eV) and passes to 3p orbital, which is an unstable state known as excited state.

One way to lose excitation energy is by emitting a photon of 589.0 nm, a phenomenon known as atomic emission. A photon of 330.3 nm can also be absorbed by sodium. This is the difference of energy between 3s and a 4p orbital (3.6eV), but one photon of 400 nm cannot be absorbed because there are not two orbitals in a sodium atom with the same difference of energy. The return of electron from 4p orbital to ground state can also occur in two steps: first to 4s and then to 3s by emitting two photons with energies correspondent to the two transitions in a phenomenon known as atomic fluorescence. The sodium atom can also receive enough energy to remove an electron, turning into sodium ion (Na + ), known as ionization. In this case, a change occurs in orbitals of different energy levels, so that the ion has a new set of transition being able to absorb or emit photons of wavelengths differently from metallic sodium. Each chemical element has a unique electronic structure that differentiates from others. This implies in a possible and unique set of transitions, a set of characteristic absorption/emission lines that can be used for identification. Although the set of transitions is unique for each element, there may be a coincidence of spectrum in some lines of two or more elements, which means that different atoms can absorb or emit photons of same wavelength.

Knowledge of the spatio-temporal evolution of atomic hydrogen provides an important insight into the ongoing chemical processes. The electric field distribution of coplanar DBD allows discharge microfilaments to propagate only in the thin (a few tenths of a mm) layer along the dielectric surface, which results in a strong spatial gradient of created species. Owing to this, the experimental technique of choice must offer a high degree of spatial resolution. In this respect, a suitable method is twophoton absorption laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF), which has become a powerful tool for the detection of reactive species in plasma [9][10][11][12][13][14]. When TALIF is used for the detection of free hydrogen atoms, these atoms are usually excited by the simultaneous absorption of two laser photons with wavelength of 205.08 nm from the ground state to the state n = 3 [15,16]. This leads to the generation of fluorescent Hα radiation with an intensity proportional to the atomic hydrogen concentration. The necessity of absorbing two-photons makes the emission of the Hα line highly localized only to areas in the laser beam center, which allows the acquisition of detailed H atom concentration maps.",

Although there are several procedures to excite ground state 3 O 2 to the excited state 1 O 2 , (see Section 2.2 above), direct photonic excitation is simpler: it only requires the adequate light source. In this section, I will introduce the physical mechanism behind the photonic excitation of 1 O 2 , and the different wavelengths at which such a transition is possible. Advantages and drawbacks of each wavelength range will be discussed to offer the reader arguments to choose the best suited wavelength, depending on his or her study subject.\n\n\nOptical excitation of 1 O 2\n\nFrom the beginning it must be stressed that 3 O 2 does not strongly absorb light. At least, not in the wavelength range useful for research in redox biology. This might sound as a rotund spoiler of whatever will come next. However, the fact that oxygen does not absorb strongly does not mean that it does not absorb at all. It does, and its low absorption can be compensated by other means (light intensity, exposure time, \"friendly-environment\", etc.). Then, why does 3 O 2 absorb light so weakly, and what wavelengths can we expect it to absorb?\n\nFirst, molecular oxygen is a highly symmetric molecule. It is composed of two oxygen atoms which have the same electronegativity. In consequence, the molecule has no permanent dipole and for this reason 3 O 2 does not absorb in the infrared (IR) [98]. Second, due to its exotic outer electrons arrangement (see Section 2.1), several quantum mechanical rules forbid electronic transitions between the ground state ( 3 O 2 ) and the two first excited states ( 1 O 2 and 1 O 2 (b)) (see ref [8][9][10]. for theoretical arguments supporting these statements). Fortunately, this forbiddenness must be understood as a very low probability of such an event happening. Even more fortunate, oxygen interactions with other atoms or molecules partly relieve the molecular symmetry and change the electronic molecular orbitals, lifting to some extent the forbiddenness of these transitions. Experimental results show that 3 O 2 can be excited efficiently enough as to observe many different responses in biological systems.",

Vacuum ultraviolet laser radiation requires great experimental effort to exclude the absorbing atmosphere. An easier solution to measuring ground state densities of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, for example, is TALIF-spectroscopy. As TALIF spectr oscopy is a two-photon process, the fluorescence signal has a quadratic dependence on the laser energy. This makes highly space-resolved measurements possible, since the twophoton processes only occur in the laser focus points. A simple calibration of the wavelength-dependent properties of the exper imental system, by Rayleigh scattering, for example, which is linear to the laser energy, is not possible. The most commonly used method to perform calibration of TALIF measurements is by comparing the TALIF signal S of the species of unknown density (X) to a TALIF signal of a reference species R of known density:\nn x = η R η x T R T x σ R σ x a ul R a ul x S x S R n R (4)\nwhere a ul is the branching ratio of the fluorescence transition, T and η describe the wavelength-dependent properties of the experimental setup, and σ is the two-photon absorption cross section. If the wavelengths of the two-photon excitation and the fluorescence are close enough, the wavelength-dependent properties cancel each other out. As reference species, typically, noble gas species are used [144]. This has been successfully applied for the first time to a cold plasma jet for the measurement of atomic oxygen in a closed environment [145]. In [146], an in situ calibration was developed, using a microwave plasma jet with xenon feed gas admixture.\n\nSeveral two-photon LIF measurements have been performed on the kINPen. With separate xenon calibration measurements, atomic oxygen was determined by TALIF spectroscopy [127,147]. Detailed results are shown in section 3.7 as well as in section 4.1, where the atomic oxygen concentration profile determined by TALIF spectroscopy is correlated to polymer etching by the kINPen [147].\n\n\nNon-spectroscopic methods\n\nThe kINPen has not only been studied by spectroscopic methods, but also by various non-spectroscopic methods, as described in the following.",

It is useful to compare the above discussed H-atom thermodynamics from a H 2 photo-ionisation point of view. The most efficient generation of H + and H (atomic) from H 2 at low pressure takes place via a rovibrational excitation of the H 2 (E,F) state, which has one of the strongest known anisotropies of polarisability (5 × 10 3 times larger than that of H 2 ground state) [30]. There is a large difference of H-H internuclear distance in the ionic inner (E) and covalent outer F-states. By applying an additional strong external laser field of ∼ (2-160) TW cm −2 intensity at 532 nm wavelength, photo-ionisation and photo-dissociation follows via H + 2 → H + H + path as revealed by a velocity mapped imaging [30]. Theoretical predictions and experimental verification are closely following each other. An energy cost of this process is formidable considering that H 2 (E,F) state is prepared by two-photon absorption at λ = 201.796 nm wavelengths (photon energȳ hω = 1.24/λ[µm] = 6.144 eV) and an additional two-photon process at λ = 532 nm (2.33 eV) takes place for transition into the H + 2 ionised state before photo-dissociation. This is the least energy, hence, a high efficiency pathway of H and H + production from H 2 . The portion of that energy required for H and H + production from H + 2 is equal to the one photon absorption at green 2.33 eV (similar to E 0 Figure 1).

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (light) with matter, in our case proteins. Several closely related events can occur depending on the amount of energy that the radiation carries. In the first example of absorption, electromagnetic radiation is captured by a protein sample, which converts the energy of the photon into internal energy. Atoms within proteins are composed of a nucleus containing neutrons, protons and dispersed electrons. Electrons, however, are not merely floating within the atom but are instead fixed within electron orbitals. There are multiple electron orbitals within an atom, and each has its an energy level associated with it. Since the energy levels of matter are quantised, only light of energy that can cause transitions from one existing energy level to another will be absorbed. The amount of energy carried by a light photon depends on wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy carried by a photon; hence, ultraviolet (UV) light carries more energy than visible light. When a molecule absorbs a photon of the correct energy, an electron is promoted from its ground state to an excited state. This occurs if the energy of the photon, corresponding to the energy gap between the ground state and an empty higher energy level (the excited state). After absorption, the energy is then lost to the solvent as heat (thermal energy) when the electron drops back to the ground state. An absorption spectrum measures the amount of light that passes through a sample at a variety of wavelengths. The spectrum depends on the type and arrangement of atoms in the sample and can make absorption spectra useful for identifying different molecules. In this way, absorption spectroscopy can be used to reveal some very basic information about the structure and conformational states of a protein.\n\n\nBox 2 Properties of Light Box",

Taken together, a single junction device would require photons with energies of ~ 2.3 eV or higher (< 540 nm) [23]. This precludes the yellow to red portion of the visible spectrum, and though green to blue photons contain sufficient energy, kinetic challenges in the systems studied require additional electrical bias to sustain forward electron transfer and sustain the formation of O 2 and H 2 products. Under ideal circumstances and assuming parallel physical behavior to a semiconductor absorber, a DSPEC that used the energy of one photon per each the four electrons transferred in Eq. 1 constructed with a dye absorbing 2.6 eV photons (477 nm) would give the maximum possible solar-tohydrogen (STH) efficiency of 4.5% for a single junction system [23]. Splitting the energy burden for driving overall water splitting between two light absorbing junctions, however, can achieve a theoretical max STH efficiency of 27% [24]. This assessment gives optimum absorption thresholds of 720 nm for the short wavelength and 1120 nm for the long wavelength junctions and allows for overall loss of 0.8 eV per photon. Several unavoidable loss mechanisms govern the maximum possible STH efficiency of a single, tandem, or other multi-junction type photochemical cell: (1) photons with lower energy than the band gap or HOMO-LUMO gap (U g ) of the light absorber cannot be converted (incomplete absorption); (2) the excess energy of photons with energy greater than U g is lost as heat during relaxation to the first excited state (thermalization); (3) some fraction of the excited state energy is lost upon conversion to electric or chemical potential energy (overpotential); and (4) some degree, usually minimal, of excited states formed will undergo emission (radiative recombination) [25][26][27]. Optimum conversion efficiency occurs when these losses sum to ~ 0.3-0.4 eV per photon absorbed,",

Since the energy difference between the ground state and the upper energy state (S 1(n) -S 0 ) is greater than the energy difference between the upper state and the intermediate state (S 1(n) -S 0(n) ), it is evident from these equations that the energy of the exciting photon is greater than that of the fluorescing photon, and thus, the wavelength of the exciting photon must be shorter than that of the fluorescing photon.\n\n\nMultiphoton Interactions\n\nAlthough the interaction probability is greatest for single-photon absorption, if two or more lower energy (longer wavelength) photons arrive simultaneously, there is some probability that they can excite the molecule as long as (E 1 -E 0 ) = hc (1/λ 1 + 1/λ 2 . . . + 1/λ n )\n\nwhere λ 1 . . . λ n are the wavelengths of individual photons.

Several approaches to carry this functionality to long-wavelength region are known. However, this problem has no simple solution because typical organic bond dissociation energy is about 350-400 kJ/mol, which corresponds to a 340 nm UV light. Unfortunately, the energy of infrared photon is at least twice less. Therefore, one needs to either use the energy of multiple photons or somehow weaken the bond.

In particular, a wise choice of intermediate molecular excited state would require only modest laser powers for the two-photon STIRAP transfer beams. The main challenge of this step lies in the technical aspect of maintaining coherence of two vastly different wavelength lasers. Based on prior spectroscopy 24 , we expect to use laser wavelengths around 905 nm and 635 nm to drive a coherent STIRAP transition from the initial to the final state. To maintain their coherence, both lasers can be simultaneously locked to a single stable high-finesse reference cavity 48 . Thus, single molecule production after stochastic loading of individual atoms into optical tweezers is expected with a fidelity of > 65%. To verify that a single molecule has been produced, we plan to reverse the coherent production steps to convert the molecule back to atoms. The dissociated atoms will then be separated into individual tweezers and imaged using fluorescence with 98% fidelity.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nWe present a scheme to produce a novel source of single ultracold polar molecules. Our scheme relies on high fidelity quantum state manipulation of atoms and molecules. We have demonstrated the crucial first steps toward single molecule production, which includes trapping the constituent atoms (Cs and Na) side-by-side in optical tweezers and motional ground-state cooling of Cs to its 3D ground state (84%). We numerically explore a two-photon Raman scheme to convert atom pairs to a weakly-bound molecule by utilizing both an enhanced FCF due to the trapping confinement and far-detuned Raman beams to minimize spontaneous emission. We further highlight the spectroscopy and technical requirements to transfer the weakly-bound molecule to its rovibronic ground-state.",

Intense absorption in the wavelength less than 600 nm by in vivo pigments (mainly hemoglobin) and less efficiency of singlet oxygen production in the wavelength more than 900 nm sometimes eliminate the clinical applications to the region of 600-900 nm [78].\n\n\nMechanism of competitive reactions in photodynamic therapy\n\nFollowing the absorption of a photon with appropriate energy, the photosensitizer molecule is transferred from the ground state (S 0 ) to excited state (S 1 ) which may return to its primitive ground state along with fluorescence radiation or be transferred to triplet excited state as an inter-system crossing. The triplet state of photosensitizer molecule in the tissue has a relatively long lifespan which can cause changes in surrounding molecules and initiate two competitive reactions called reaction types I and II (Fig. 1) [10,24].\n\nReaction type I includes the transfer of electron or proton to oxygen and surrounding molecules to form anionic or cationic radicals. These radicals can react with oxygen molecule to form the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reaction type I often leads to the formation of superoxide ions by the transfer of one electron to an oxygen molecule. These ions do not act as active ions in biological systems, but they can produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), which is easily absorbed from cell membranes. In high concentrations, H 2 O 2 can react with super oxide molecules caused by the production of hydroxyl as an active radical which has the ability to ionize any molecules with low activation energy.\n\nIn reaction type II, the photosensitizer molecule, by transitioning from the triplet state to ground state and transfer of energy to oxygen molecule, converts it to excited singlet oxygen. The singlet oxygen as a chargeless molecule can spread to the cytoplasm and biological membranes. Approximately all of photosensitizers have high quantum yield in this reaction.",

These fundamental absorptions are about 100 times less energetic in the NIR region and less energetic means longer wavelength. When n is greater than 1, the transition is known as an overtone. By looking at Equation 2, it is evident that as n increases, the energy to be absorbed also increases. This in turn indicates that shorter wavelengths will need to be absorbed. These absorptions generally occur in the NIR region. Equation 2 predicts fairly well the absorptions of two atoms bonded together (called diatomic molecules), but does not take into account all of the surrounding effects for polyatomic (many atom) molecules, such as overlapping absorption bands or hydrogen bonding. Organic molecules exist in energy states that absorb NIR wavelengths (energies). Metals, such as silver, lead, and most inorganics, cannot absorb NIR light because they have electrons incapable of absorbing NIR wavelengths, therefore there is no interaction to measure. Generally, only organic molecules can absorb wavelengths in the NIR region. It is actually the energy state of a molecule which allows us to perform a measurement with NIR. Now imagine a sample made up of many, many electrons, protons and neutrons. These particles are arranged into atoms, and further into molecules. The sample can be made of different types of molecules, meaning there can be water molecules, protein molecules and so on. When they take on these arrangements, they also take on different properties such as the ability to absorb different wavelengths of light, therefore, quite a few different energies might be absorbed. When a measurement is performed on this sample, what the instrument is measuring is the number of photons which undergo the absorption process for a particular wavelength. The number of photons absorbed is proportional to the amount of particular type of molecule present in the sample.

Even with this short evolution time, however, it became evident that the ground-to-excited-state energy difference is often equal to that of the energy of an infrared photon, typically with wavelength of 1064 nm.

However, some important molecules exhibit a spectrum of narrow lines even at wavelengths as short as 100 nm.

Our result agrees with previous observations that the ionization yield increases rapidly across this range of energies, 31,32 presumably with a corresponding decrease in the dissociation yield. 33 At the lower excitation energy, where the dissociation channel dominates, we monitor the geminate recombination kinetics of the dissociation products and determine that the average initial separation of H and OH fragments is about 0.7 nm, similar to the value from recent molecular dynamics simulations of dissociating H 2 O in ice. 34,35 The relatively large separation of the dissociation products suggests that H atoms are formed with enough kinetic energy to escape the solvent cage and one or two additional solvent shells.\n\n\nII. EXPERIMENT\n\nTime-resolved transient absorption measurements monitor the evolution of the ionization and dissociation products following two-photon excitation of liquid water. We probe the transient products at two wavelengths, 650 and 267 nm. The solvated electron is the only species that absorbs visible light, and therefore the transient signal that we measure at 650 nm reflects purely the geminate recombination kinetics following ionization. In contrast, the signal at 267 nm potentially includes contributions from the kinetics following dissociation as well as ionization, because both electrons and OH radicals absorb at that wavelength. Hydrogen atoms and hydronium ions do not absorb light at either wavelength.",

By taking the silver ion as an example, Ag + could be excited by both 405 nm CW laser and 800 nm pulsed laser, followed by electron capture from the surrounding medium, resulting in the formation of a silver atom Ag 0 . The subsequent agglomeration process of Ag 0 precipitates silver nanoparticles from solution containing silver ions, namely mass sedimentation. As is well known, from the aspect of TPA definition, it is equivalent for a molecule to be excited from ground state to a higher energy state by simultaneous absorption of two photons with low energy and by absorption of one photon with high energy. Therefore, in our experiment, if the concentration of silver ions in two identical solutions changes by the same amount under conditions of SPA and TPA, the number of photons absorbed in TPA (N TPA ) will be twice that in SPA (N SPA ). That is, N TPA should be proportional to N SPA , which can be expressed as follows: where Δ c(Ag + ) TPA and Δ c(Ag + ) SPA represent the variation in silver ion concentration under TPA and SPA respectively. Therefore, through a comparison between TPA and SPA, the absorbed photon numbers could be derived, enabling the calculation of the TPACS of silver ion. In this process, we make the assumption that single-photon excitation and two-photon excitation have the same sedimentation efficiency 23 . Here 400 nm CW laser and 800 nm pulsed femtosecond laser are adopted for single-photon absorption (SPA) and two-photon absorption (TPA) respectively, resulting in mass sedimentation of neutral silver atoms.

The radicals then react with oxygen to form oxygenated products. 2 When the energy is transferred the PS is regenerated and acts as a catalyst, meaning that many 1 O 2 molecules can be produced as long as a supply of light and molecular oxygen is maintained. 4 A limited number of investigations have reported the optimization of wavelength for excitation of specific photosensitizers using indirect determinants of 1 O 2 production, such as bacterial kill rates, 5 or tumor size reduction, 6 and none have reported how the fluence (the rate at which photons irradiate the sensitizer) affects the efficiency of 1 O 2 production.

Inspection of the solar spectrum in Figure 2 shows that photons of greater energy (λ ≤ 1008 nm) constitute only one half of the total incident solar flux.  Furthermore, not all the energy in these photons is available for chemical energy storage after absorption due to intraband thermalization, i.e., ultra-fast relaxation from excited vibrational states of the first electronic excited state (or conduction band in a semiconductor). To compensate for this energy loss the wave-length threshold must shift to 775 nm in this so-called S2 process, as shown in Figure 3.

In AAS, when the UV light with the right wavelength irradiates on a ground-state free atom, the atom may absorb the light to enter an excited state in a process known as atomic absorption. The wavelength of the light is somehow specific for an element. By measuring the amount of light absorbed, a quantitative determination of the amount of analyte element present can be made. A careful selection of wavelengths allows the specific quantitative determination of individual elements in the presence of others. By supplying enough thermal energy (such as in a flame), analyte compounds dissociate into free atoms. The ease and speed, at which precise and accurate determinations can be achieved, have made AAS one of the most popular methods for the analysis of metals.\n\nAtomic emission spectroscopy (AES), also called optical emission spectroscopy (OES), is another elemental analysis technique in atomic spectroscopy. In this process, analytes are first atomized using either ICP or microwave irradiation (high temperatures), where the atoms are raised to electronically excited states. As they return to lower electronic energy levels, photons are emitted at wavelengths that are characteristic of the particular element. Both the wavelength and intensity of the emitted photons will be recorded. This data may be used to identify the elements present and quantify them after a calibration. GC-AES determines the elemental composition for each GC peak.",

Figure 2 shows the main components of an atomic absorption spectrometer. The radiation source may be continuous, emitting from visible to infrared wavelengths or from lines that emit discreet lines, specifically from each chemical element. The modulator helps to differentiate radiation emitted by radiation lamp coming from the environment and, mainly, from the atomization system. The atomization system removes analyte atoms in solution and generates atomic vapor composed of atoms in ground state, putting them between the source and the detector to absorb the radiation emitted. The monochromator is responsible for the selection of photons due to the wavelength that will reach the detector. The detector transforms the energy of photons into a proportional electronic signal and amplifies it. The signal intensity obtained is treated by systems for data acquisition and processing. At this point, it is important to stand out that the element cannot be directly determined by the atomic absorption spectrometer; even though the system provides that response. A spectrometer measures the amount of electromagnetic energy coming from the source before and after passing through a sample; this is, an indirect measurement of the absorption of energy by atoms present in the sample. To obtain a final result, a series of physical and chemical phenomenon should occur under controlled conditions and the measurement performed should be treated by an appropriate mathematical model. As each component of the equipment plays a part on this work, a more detailed study is essential to understand the performance of this analytical technique as well as its power and limitations.\n\n\nRadiation source\n\nAround 1952, when the development of the technique was starting, sources of continuous emissions were used. This means that it was used light in the visible and adjacent ultraviolet ranges. First experiments showed the necessity of a spectrometer with 0.002 nm resolution for using this source, which was impossible with the equipment available by that time. A solution was found changing the emission sources of discrete lines. Then, the first sealed hollow cathode lamp (HCL) was manufactured (Welz et al., 2010), a high intensity atomic emission light source essential for developing the technique and widely used today.\n\n\nHollow cathode lamp (HCL)",

For those series of compounds, we investigated the influence of the ground-state dipole moment on the geometry of assemblies of cofacially overlapping chromophores and, in turn, the bathochromic shift of emission spectra. The CT character of the emission transition was also examined as a key factor for NIR emission in the solid state. Strikingly, significant solid-state emission was observed with dyes adopting the H-aggregation mode, thereby exhibiting excimer-or exciplex-like fluorescence emission features. Although this type of intermolecular arrangement is commonly associated with low fluorescence emission ability, the solid-state fluorescence quantum yields remain significant and emissions at 690 nm and 751 nm with 13% and 6.5% efficiencies, respectively, were obtained. Moreover, dye 3 was found to present an emission maximum wavelength at 804 nm and a fluorescence quantum yield value of 2%, which is one of the best NIR solid-state organic emitters to date (scheme 3). Using H-aggregation as a crystal engineering strategy towards solid-state organic emitters combining NIR wavelength and high quantum yield represents a counterintuitive yet interesting approach.\n\nIn addition, we could show that the diboronfluoride complexes of curcuminoids are emissive in the solid-state as well, affording emitted light in the visible and NIR [21]. Remarkably, the molecules with a meso-hydrogen atom presented an emission that is red-shifted compared to those containing a phenyl ring. We believe that the steric hindrance induced by the latter group induces a less extended stacking of the curcuminoid backbones. Moreover, these dyes are chemically very stable on the opposite of boron difluoride complexes of chalcones and allow the versatile generation of organic nanoparticles in water. The optical and photophysical properties of these fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) were studied extensively (vide infra) [33].\n\n\nTwo-photon excited fluorescence: toward NIR-to-NIR probes",

Selective tissue damage can only be achieved when light and the PS are present in sufficient quantities at the desired location. Substantial efforts by several groups to enhance light delivery to deeper tissues are in progress; however, an upper limit exists on how far into the infrared region a PS can absorb light and still produce cytotoxic species. In photochemistry, the PS is typically electronically excited to the singlet excited state upon absorption of a photon. From this excited state, the PS molecule undergoes intersystem crossing to a longer lived triplet state, which can initiate photochemical reactions directly, giving rise to reactive free radicals, or transfer its energy to the ground-state triplet oxygen molecules ( 3 O2) to generate reactive singlet oxygen ( 1 O2) molecules. Specifically, the energy required to excite an oxygen molecule from its ground state to its singlet state is ~0.96 eV, creating an upper limit on the excitation wavelength to be around 850-900 nm depending on the energy level of the PSs' triplet state. Because most of the currently used PS's have absorption peaks in the 600 -750 nm range (Fig.  1), the light irradiation window for PDT has been restricted to this range within the past few decades. Overall, the limitations stemming from the PS excitation wavelength and light delivery, coupled with the variability in clinical outcomes caused by inconsistencies due to inter-or intramicroenvironmental heterogeneity and the failure to customize the PDT dose in a patient-specific manner, historically has prevented PDT from gaining widespread acceptance as a first-line therapeutic modality.",

However, long-term light excitation always leads to photobleaching of fluorescent probes, unavoidable autofluorescence as well as photodamage of cells. To overcome these limitations, we synthesized a type of photostable luminogen named TPE-TPP with an aggregation induced emission (AIE) characteristic, and achieved its three-photon imaging with femtosecond laser excitation of 1020 nm. By using TPE-TPP as fluorescent probes, three-photon microscopy under 1020 nm excitation showed little photo-damage, as well as low autofluorescence to HeLa cells. Due to the AIE effect, the TPE-TPP nanoaggregates uptaken by cells were resistant to photobleaching under three-photon excitation for an extended period of time. Furthermore, we demonstrated that for the present TPE-TPP AIE the three-photon microscopy (with 1020 nm excitation) had a better signal to noise ratio than the two-photon microscopy (with 810 nm excitation) in tissue imaging.Fluorescent probes, with the advantages of high sensitivity, selectivity, and biocompatibility, have become powerful tools for bioimaging and biosensing 1-4 .

Since long-wavelength (e.g. red and near infrared) photons have lower energy than short-wavelength (e.g. ultra-violet, blue and green) photons, multiphoton luminescence microscopy with red/near-infrared excitation produces less photo-damage to cells compared to (one-photon) confocal microscopy with ultra-violet/blue/green excitation.

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range. Having no more experimental data, we simply take additional energy value larger by a factor of 3, i.e., E d = 63\n\nMeV. As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data.

[16] relying on the factorization conjecture. Thus, the dynamical core excitation model well explains a stronger reduction of the cross section observed in Ref. [16] as compared to the factorization conjecture. The deviation between the two curves in Fig. 4 increases with increasing energy, and their ratio becomes angle-dependent, thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies. The reduction of the cross section at forward angles is significantly stronger than SF, e.g., R x = 0.59 at E d = 63 MeV and Θ c.m. = 0 • . Such a behavior is indeed qualitatively consistent with findings of Refs. [12][13][14] Fig. 5. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are again close, especially at forward angles. Thus, despite that SF = 0.34 significantly deviates from unity, the differential cross section including the core excitation scales well with SF, and at this energy the factorization conjecture is valid. However, the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the two curves deviate  In Figs. 4 and 5 we also isolate the E3BF core-excitation effect, given as the difference between the solid and dashdotted curves. Quite surprisingly, even at E d = 21 MeV it turns out to be significant. Consequently, the coreexcitation effect of the two-body nature must be significant as well to cancel the E3BF to a large extent, especially at E d = 21 MeV, such that their sum reproduces the full core-excitation effect. We note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two-and three-body effects due to the ∆-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon-deuteron scattering [18].",

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10.

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref. [16].",

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10. Higher value for L n is needed due to the Coulomb force present within the A + p pair which is included via the screening and renormalization method [19][20][21].\n|p α q α (l α {[L α (s i β s i γ )S i α ]j i α s i α }S i α )JM\n\nPotentials",

[12][13][14] but further developments are needed to get insight into separate core-excitation contributions of the two-and three-body nature. The method is based on the integral formulation of rigorous Faddeevtype three-body scattering theory for transition operators as proposed by Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas [11], but extended for the Hilbert space H g ⊕ H x whose sectors correspond to the core being in its ground (g) or excited (x) state. These sectors are coupled by the nucleon-core twobody potentials v ji α where the superscripts j and i, being either g or x, label the internal states of the core, and the subscript α, being A, p, or n, labels the spectator particle in the odd-man-out notation.

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range. Having no more experimental data, we simply take additional energy value larger by a factor of 3, i.e., E d = 63\n\nMeV. As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data.

We start with the excited state 1 2 + analysis in Fig. 4 where we expect some similarities with the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) case [12][13][14]. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are close but, at least below the first minimum, differ by a roughly constant factor, i.e., the core excitation effect is slightly, by about 6%, stronger than predicted by the factorization conjecture.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

This is then inversely weighted by the error of the experimental measurement also scaled with the excitation percentage (∆x j /f ). This sum then gives a representative number for how well the two transient absorption spectra match at a given excitation percentage. Since the simulated transient is a function of the energy shift between the ground and excited-state spectra, the reduced χ 2 is a function of the structural modifications (∆R i ), the excitation percentage (f ) and the energy shift (∆E 0 ). Before using this procedure generally it is important to establish its accuracy on a test case. As we know reasonably accurately the excitation percentage for the ps EXAFS [Fe II (bpy) 3 ] 2+ measurement from optical measurements (f = 22% ± 2%) and we have a reasonable value for the energy shift in the excited state from both MXAN simulation (-2.5 eV) and the transient EXAFS measurement (-2.8 eV±0.5 eV) [10] this is an ideal place to start. The results of the calculation for several examples are shown in Figure 5. Each point is a χ 2 value calculated for a specific excited state structural change, with a specific excitation population and a specific energy shift. The curves link together groups with the same excitation population. For example the red curves in Figure 5 (a), (b), (c) correspond to f = 22%. Each of of the 4 plots shown correspond to a different value for ∆E 0 . The structural modifications chosen were to vary the Fe-N bond distance while maintaining the structural integrity of the bipyridine ligands. By simply applying a blind change in Fe-N coordination sphere distance the result would have been a distorted bipyridine molecule, an unlikely occurrence due to the rigidity of the ligand structure. The result of this analysis procedure is an excitation population of f = 17% ± 1% with an energy shift of ∆E 0 = −1.2eV ± 0.6eV, resulting in a change in Fe-N bond distance of 0.203 ± 0.008Å within 95%",

In the gradientonly optimization algorithm the three-point bisection method is used instead of the golden-section S8 search to find an extremum. Detailed procedures for the gradient-only geometry optimization are as follows. (1) Calculate the gradient at the initial geometry.

Figure S2 indicates that the smaller r value gave the larger errors of the dE/dR values. Especially, if r = 0.0001 Å is adopted the dE/dR values exhibit large standard deviations. This is because we used the same threshold value for the convergence check in the Bayesian optimization (EThre = 0.0005 Hartree) for all simulations, but this value is too small to predict the energy difference accurately when a small r value is used. We have to adopt tighter threshold values to calculate the gradient accurately for the smaller r values. Figure   S2 indicates that r = 0.0025 or 0.0050 Å are suitable from both the viewpoints of mean values and standard deviations. We expect that r = 0.0050 Å may suffer from inaccuracy of the gradient values when strong anharmonicity is present on the potential energy surface.

The calculated weighted average TG curves for all the blends were close to the experimentally determined results, with a maximum average deviation of less than 3% and a maximum deviation percentage of less than 12% observed for the 80% SWC + 20% coal blend at approximately 360°C. The maximum deviation percentages for the higher biomass-tocoal ratio blends occurred at approximately 360°C under the experimental conditions and were pronounced only for HWC and SWC. The decomposition of cellulose occurs at approximately 360°C (Yang et al., 2007;Oudia et al., 2007;Demirbas, 2000).\n\nThese small average differences between the calculated TG curves and the experimental TG curves indicate that the influence of the biomass samples on the coal reactivity is small, and vice versa. These results are similar to those obtained by Moghtaderi et al. (2004), Sonobe et al. (2008), and Sadhukhan et al. (2008) using blended samples of coal and Radiata pine wood, corncob, and waste wood biomass samples.",

(1987).This hypothesis is verified by other research carried out on essential oils of T. satureioides (EO / TS) from different regions of Morocco.This is the case of EO / TS, from Ifrane Region, whose major component is \"P-cymene\" (Elouali et al., 2013) or the case of EO / TS from Taroudant Region that is rich in \"borneol\" (Ramzi et al., 2017).For the EO / TS essential oil extraction, it has a total yield of about 2.22%, with more than 1.1% obtained by Elouali et al.

No comparison between structures incorporating different ratios of ligands can be made, as the variation of ionisation and detection between species could be large.

From the literature review, no one has used iron, Fe (Z=26) as a physical filter until recent. Thus, Fe was selected in this study. For the calculation purposes, a range of thicknesses were considered, between 0.05 mm to 0.50 mm. Percentage absorption of gamma photons of various energies was calculated by the equation:\nPercentage Absorption = (1-e -µx ) x 100%\n(1) The linear attenuation coefficient, µ describes the fraction of a beam of x-rays or gamma rays that is absorbed or scattered per unit thickness of the absorber. The µ value was calculated from mass attenuation coefficient taken from Hubbell and Berger [4]. All percentage absorption values for material were tabulated in Table 1. From Table 1, the thicknesses were selected by the absorption percentage in terms of energy of gamma photons. 0.05 mm was the most appropriate thickness which absorbed 8.34% of 140 keV compared to 9.23% of 126-139 keV. The percentage difference between 140 keV and 126-139 keV is 8.9%. Unfortunately, the thickness (0.05 mm) was not available. Therefore, this study was done by applying 0.35 mm and 0.40 mm because of the availability of these thicknesses. The physical filter was designed sized 55 cm length and 44 cm width matching the size of gamma camera head. The surface of the physical filter was flat and due to the material fragility, it was laminated/coated with a thin laminating film.\n\n\nMaterials\n\nGamma camera system has been used is Philip ADAC Forte dual head attached with LEHR collimator and Pegasys software installed.

In CZ, CD, HD, HS, XT and ZJK, ozone concentration and X/E ratio showed a significant negative correlation.

In this study, the characteristics and sources of 61 VOCs in the BTH area of China were investigated from 2018 till 2019, and the key reactive species in ozone and SOA formation were analyzed. The severest pollution was observed in LF, followed by BD, HD and SJZ, and the mildest, in CD and ZJK. The most abundant VOCs, in descending order, were alkanes, alkenes, aromatics and alkynes. The mixing ratio for alkanes exceeded 50% in every city, and only HD and TS displayed a higher proportion of aromatics than alkenes. Alkynes accounted for the smallest fraction (≤ 6.9%) of the VOCs.

Due to the electron beam energy deposition in the target material, the surface is heated very rapidly. The calculated target surface temperature for various values of the accelerating voltage is depicted for the entire pulse width (~100 ns) in Fig. 1. As anticipated, the maximum temperature is located at the target surface. It can be seen that the surface temperature and heating rate increase rapidly for the accelerating voltage in the range of 10 to 15 kV. This finding is likely due to the polyenergetic nature of the electron beam [5]. The majority of electrons produced by the beam for the voltage in the range of 10 to 15 kV have lower energies. As a result, the maximum energy of the electrons is deposited near the target surface. The highest temperature is observed for an accelerating voltage of 15 kV at about 7500 K between 60 and 70 ns. At higher voltages, the heating rate falls due to an increase in the penetration depth of the electrons, which offsets the intensity of the beam. As the acceleration voltage increases the energy of the electrons in the beam increases while, at the same time, the highly energetic electrons will penetrate deeper in the target. This results in greater losses of the beam energy, which becomes predominate at higher voltages (above 15 kV), and eventually cancels out the effect of the acceleration voltage on the beam energy. For 17 kV, it can be seen that initially the heating rate is about the same as 15 kV, but it slightly decreases after 40 ns yielding a maximum temperature of 7300 K. The evolution of the target surface temperature with time and dependence on voltage seem to have a similar trend for all voltages except for 18 kV. At 18 kV, the temperature profile goes through a short plateau at ~20 ns corresponding to a target surface temperature of 4000 K. This is the result of phase change due to sublimation, which starts to occur around 4000 K. Afterwards, there is a sudden climb in the temperature whereby the surface temperature reaches 6700 K. For lower voltages than 18 kV, sublimation seems to occur much faster so that not plateauing of the temperature can be observed. The vaporization front velocity from the target surface is illustrated in Fig. 2. As can be seen, at 15",

Low voltage power, typically three-phase, 440 V AC, is converted to high-frequency (100 kHz) radio frequency (RF) power by an oscillator. A number of rectifiers in series along with an RF resonant transformer convert the RF power into ultra high voltage (2e5 MM V) direct current (DC) power. The DC voltage is sent to the acceleration tube. This tube is a hollow vacuum cylinder made from glass and metal. Glass rings are positioned as insulation rings in between metal rings, called dynodes. An electron gun is positioned at the entry point of the tube. A tungsten filament is the source of electrons that are emitted by heating the filament. The continuous electron stream is accelerated through a vacuum tube, supplying a high-energy beam with a diameter of 2e3 cm. The accelerated beam is transmitted through an oscillating magnetic field with a frequency of 200 Hz that converts the tight beam cone into a wide curtain of electrons with a width of 1e2.5 m. A thin titanium window acts as a window or a filter before the beam reaches the food to be irradiated. A control system monitors all the functions of the various systems of accelerator to insure proper and consistent operation. An accelerator operates based on a number of factors including voltage (electron energy), beam current, and beam power. Because electrons have mass, they can only penetrate about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) into a typical food product or about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) if the food product is irradiated on both sides. Electrons also have an electric charge. This charge allows the stream of accelerated electrons to be scanned by magnets to track across the product. A commercial food electron beam irradiator accelerates the electrons to an energy of up to 10,000,000 electron volts [10 million electron volts (MeV)]. Electron beam irradiators typically use massive concrete, steel, or lead shielding. Electron beam accelerators can be turned on and off. Safety interlocks ensure that a person cannot enter the radiation chamber where the food is being irradiated when the accelerator is \"on.\" Product is usually passed through the scanned \"beam\" on roller-type conveyors as shown in Fig. 1.12.

The electron heating appears during the sheath collapse on the bulk side of the sheath edge while there is cooling (electrons loose energy) on the electrode side (the lower left hand corner and upper center on the right hand side). At 50 mTorr the electron heating rate in the sheath region has increased and there is almost no electron heating in the plasma bulk as seen in Figure 1 (b). We note that there are high frequency oscillations in the electron heating rate at both pressures adjacent to the expanding sheath edge similar to those reported by Vender and Boswell [40]. These are due the generation of an energetic electron beam during sheath expansion that in turn can trigger a beam-plasma instability at the electron plasma frequency. Remainants of excess negative charges from the sheath collapse leads to a build up of an electric field that is large enough to accelerate bulk electrons toward the powered electrode. As the rf sheath expands again, the electrons are accelerated back into the bulk plasma with high kinetic energy. This leads to an electron-electron two-stream instability between the bulk electrons and the electrons accelerated by the moving sheath that is the cause of the oscillations [41]. These oscillations were first predicted computationally [40,42] but have been more recently been confirmed experimentally using phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES) [41,43]. The origins of the electric fields and the kinetics of multiple electron beams and the interactions of cold and hot electrons have been explored further more recently by Wilczek et al. [8]. Figure 2 shows the time averaged electron heating rate profile J e · E at 10 and 50 mTorr. We see in Figure 2 (a) that when the discharge is operated at 10 mTorr electron heating in the electronegative core dominates. This is in agreement with our earlier findings that at low pressures electron heating within the electronegative core dominates and the presence of the metastable molecules has only a minor influence on the heating mechanism [20,22]. We see in Figure 2 (a) that the time averaged heating rate in the electronegative core increases with increased voltage amplitude. There is both electron heating and electron cooling apparent in the sheath regions. At V 0 = 100 V the cooling cancels out the heating in the sheath region.

The relativistic electron beam is injected into a long, periodic arrangement of dipole magnets Figure 5. Operating principle of a free electron laser. An ultraviolet optical laser pulse impinges a photocathode to generate a pulsed electron beam that is accelerated to the GeV kinetic energy range. The relativistic electron beam is injected into an undulator that is composed of dipole magnets with alternating polarity causing the electron beam to oscillate, leading to the spontaneous emission of radiation. The initially incoherent electron beam is microbunched into coherent electron bunches as it travels across the undulator. The microbunching occurs by the interaction with its own emitted radiation, with the electron bunches separated by a distance determined by the wavelength of the emitted radiation. Figure adapted from [144]. with alternating polarity, called an undulator, that causes the electron trajectories to oscillate and produce spontaneous emission of radiation. At the beginning of the undulator, the electrons enter with random phase and thus the emitted radiation is incoherent, like synchrotron radiation. As the electron beam traverses through the undulator, it interacts with its own emitted radiation which leads to a so-called microbunching of the electron bunch. This has the effect of grouping electrons together with a separation approximately equal to the wavelength of the emitted radiation. After propagation in the undulator, the electron beam is separated into individual bunches that are separated by a distance equivalent to the wavelength of the emitted radiation. The large increase of the density of electrons in the individual bunches over a narrow time window defined by the wavelength of the emitted light leads to the amplification of the emitted synchrotron radiation. FELs are tunable in photon energy over a large spectral range, from the terahertz to the hard X-ray domain. However, since FELS rely on the amplification of synchrotron radiation, which is an incoherent process, significant shot-to-shot variations in the pulse energy, arrival time, -and -pointing directions and mean photon energy of the FEL pulse exist. This is somewhat improved using beam monitoring and correction systems [81] as well as seeding FELs with",

Figure 4 is a schematic plot of the bottom of the conduction band when a dc voltage V 0 is applied across the QPC.

Measurements of the differential conductance g = ∂I/∂V of the QPC were made by adding a small ac voltage 0.2 mV to V 0 . To produce an image, the SPM tip voltage must be sufficient to backscatter electrons with excess kinetic energy V 0 .

If electrons at E F coming from the left lose some of their energy before hitting the tip and returning to the QPC, they will not pass through the QPC and will not reduce the differential conductance. paths that electrons take. A measure of electron scattering is given by the relative strength of flow in the images. Near the QPC the two images are quite similar. As the distance from the QPC increases, the intensity of coherent electron flow decreases more quickly with distance in Fig. 5B, indicating that electrons lose energy via scattering with other particles as they move away from the QPC.

A stagnant target gas is crossed by a wellcharacterized magnetically confined electron beam with a FWHM energy spread of about 0.5 eV. Ions produced by electron impact are extracted from the ion source either by a weak penetrating electric field (typically 50 V/m) or by a strong homogeneous electric field (3 kV/m) generated by a number of electrodes that are part of the front and back side of the ion source interaction region. Ions are then accelerated to 3 kV before entering the analyzing part of the mass spectrometer through a narrow entrance slit, the ions pass two pairs of perpendicular deflection plates that allow the ion beam to be steered in the y-and z-direction. These deflection plates are used in cross section measurements to sweep the extracted ion beam across the entrance slit [32] and to integrate the detected ion signal. After passing through a magnetic sector field followed by an electric sector field, the ions are detected by a secondary electron multiplier operated in the pulse counting mode. The combined action of the two sector fields in a double focusing mass spectrometer results in a focusing of the ions within the plane of the instrument which corrects for the angular and spatial spreads of the starting points of the ions and for small variations in the kinetic energy. However, the only way to compensate a velocity component outside of the plane of the instrument (z-direction, see Fig. 1) is a corrective action with the so called z-deflector plates right after the ion source. The ion yield, measured as a function of the z-deflection voltage, allows the determination of the kinetic energy distribution for a given fragment ion [11,33]. However, the weak penetrating field that is normally applied cannot extract fragment ions that have initial kinetic energies in the z-direction larger than 100 meV [34]. With the repeller (located in the back of the ion source) and the first lenses that form the front of the interaction region (of the electrons and the neutral molecules), it is possible to generate a strong homogeneous electric field that is able to extract ions with initial kinetic energies up to several eV into the z-direction.

The 112 Sn 35+ ions were produced in an superconducting electron cyclotron resonance ion source, then accelerated to 3.7 MeV/u in a cyclotron, and finally injected into the ring CSRm with a typical ion current of 20 µA and beam half-lifetime of 10 sec.

The cooling voltage and density of electron beam are -2.0990 kV and 9.95 × 10 6 cm −3 , respectively. After about 5 sec cooling, the momentum spread of ion beam is reduced to about 5 × 10 −4 . The detuning voltages U d were applied to the cathode of the electron cooler to change the electron energy with a minimum step of 1 V. During a measurement cycle, the electron energy was stepped with 10 ms for detuning, and 90 ms or 200 ms for electron cooling.

The supersonic free jet formed by the nozzle expansion flow contains both particles and gas molecules. The flow conditions are such that the gas temperature decreases very rapidly, freezing any physical and chemical reactions inside the expanding sample almost completely.

The molecular beam is directed through a aerosol ,------!generator 1 ------, deflection capacitor c, where charged particles are deflected from the beam axis and analysed due to their kinetic energy, as described above. The particles deliver their charge to a Faraday-Cup e, which is connected to an ultra-sensitive amplifier f. In order to improve the sensitivity of the PMS, a third vacuum chamber d is added to the PMS. The pressure in this chamber was maintained at about 10-s mbar by a turbomolecular pump in order to obtain a further signal amplification compared with the Faraday-Cup. It consists of a conversion dynode h and a secondary electron multiplier i. The dynode is supplied with a high positive voltage of 15 to 20 kV. This high electric field accelerates negatively charged particles from an initial kinetic energy of some hundred e V to some ke V. The energy of the particles is then high enough to produce secondary electrons or ions when impacting on the surface of the dynode. The 116 secondary charge carriers are further accelerated towards the cathode of the secondary electron multiplier which consists of 17 dynodes, causing an exponential electron increase by a factor of about 10 6 to 10 8 .

The gas jet and the electron beam are oriented in a mutually perpendicular arrangement and both are perpendicular to the principal axis of the TOF-MS. The electron pulses are 30 ns long and have a frequency of 50 kHz. The energy calibration and spread of the electron beam is determined via calibration to the Ar double ionisation threshold, giving an observed kinetic energy spread of ~0.5 eV. An effusive flow of PF 3 is introduced into the experiment via a hypodermic needle, giving a typical pressure of 10 -6 Torr in the vacuum chamber as recorded via an ion gauge. Following the passage of the electron pulse across the source region, a pulser applies a voltage to the repeller plate of the TOF-MS accelerating cations into the second (acceleration) field of the MS and then on into the drift tube. Ions with a kinetic energy up to 11.5 eV perpendicular to the TOF axis will hit, and are detected by, a microchannel plate stack at the end of the drift tube.

The ions are compressed into two bunches of about 10 m length each by applying an RF voltage to one of the radio-frequency cavities installed in the ring. One bunch, referred to as signal bunch, is brought into overlap with the pulsed excitation laser inside the cooler straight section, while the other bunch is not illuminated by the laser and is used as reference for background correction (see figure 1). Fluorescence photons emitted by the HFS resonance in H-like bismuth are reflected by a mirror system installed in the vacuum pipe towards two view-ports and detected by two solar blind photomultiplier. This mirror system, which has also been used in earlier studies of HFS states in highly charged ions at the ESR [10], collects mainly photons emitted at angles between 15 • and 60 • relative to the beam direction. For the detection of the resonance in Li-like bismuth it is mandatory to collect the most forward emitted photons, as only these are Doppler shifted to a wavelength regime where the applied photomultiplier has the largest quantum efficiency. For this purpose a dedicated detection system was developed by the University of Münster [7]. It contains a movable parabolic mirror made of Oxygen-free high thermal conductivity (OFHC) copper with a central 3 cm slit for the ions to pass through. Fluorescence photons emitted at angles 20 • relative to the ion beam are reflected by the mirror towards a highly selected low-noise photomultiplier tube model R1017 from Hamamatsu with a maximum quantum efficiency of 16% for the most forward emitted photons (see figure 2, left).

One promising means of obtaining high SR with FEG-EPMA is to use thin samples together with high V acc values. This mini-review covers the basic principles of thin-sample FEG-EPMA and describes an application of this technique to the analysis of optical fibres. Outstanding issues related to this technique that must be addressed are also discussed, which include the potential for electron beam damage during analysis of insulating materials and the development of methods to use thin samples for quantitative analysis.area with a diameter of 100 nm is observed in the centre of the core (figure 1e), which indicates the fine distribution of the dopants. Analysis of the Al and Ge levels in these cores requires a minimum detection limit (MDL) of less than 5,000 ppm in conjunction with an SR below 50 nm. In addition to the aforementioned insufficient SR, another challenge associated with FEG-EPMA is the low V acc values that are often employed, which can adversely affect the accuracy of quantitative analyses[9]. When operating FEG-EPMA instrumentation at a low V acc , it is typical to use low-energy X-ray lines such as the L-and M-lines. However, these lines are often affected by spectroscopic effects such as peak shifts and overlaps[9]. The fluorescence yields for the L-and M-lines are also lower than that for conventional K-lines[9].",

Therefore, it is difficult to fit a power function to TOF tube voltage-μ curve with the limited number of data points. As expected, μ value remains unaffected by voltage settings \"RF DC offset of first hexapole\" and \"ion energy,\" because both these voltages contribute to the total energy of the ion beam only through the axial velocity component, which is parallel to the detection plane.\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, a higher MCP bias voltage increases the number of secondary electrons generated in each amplification step within the MCP and thus raises μ ( Figure 5B). V TPX-MCP back , the potential gradient between MCP back plate and TPX detector, is one of the parameters that has an influence on the overall detector performance. Figure 5C shows the dependence of μ on the V TPX-MCP back . At a lower V TPX-MCP back , the potential gradient is not strong enough to accelerate and focus the electron clouds from the MCP to the TPX at the low voltage. Most importantly, the charge deposited into a single pixel by the electron clouds is not adequate for the activation of TPX pixels. A higher amount of charge is deposited with an increase in TPX voltage, which leads to an increase in μ. However, after attaining a maximum value, μ tends to decrease due to the space charge effect. At a higher V TPX-MCP back , electrons are accelerated much faster towards the TPX detector, providing less time for the electron cloud to expand, which leads to the activation of less number of TPX pixels.

This simple model neglects some obvious aspects of the plasma evolution dynamics. For example, as mentioned above it considers neither the reduction in T e that occurs as a consequence of early electron escape, nor increase in T e by electron-impact deactivation of NO Rydberg states. However, we know that the plasma loses comparatively few hot electrons to form its trapping potential, and we can assume that collisional deactivation of Rydberg NO accelerates predissociation, which rapidly depletes the plasma of molecules in quantum states below the bottleneck for collisional ionization [14,15].\n\nRegardless of its simplifying assumptions, this crude energy balance does serve to show that a feasible route exists for the molecular plasma of NO + ions and electrons formed in a molecular beam to reach a low electron temperature.

Serial focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) imaging was performed with a Zeiss Crossbeam 540 station (Carl Zeiss, Konstanz, Germany). Carbon-coated specimens were oriented inside the FIB-SEM chamber so that the viewing direction was aligned with the tendon longitudinal direction. A coarse cross-section was first milled with a 30 nA gallium beam at 30 kV acceleration voltage to provide a viewing channel for SEM observation. The exposed surface of this cross-section was fine-polished by lowering the ion beam current to 1.5 nA. Subsequently, the fine-polished block was serially milled by scanning the ion beam parallel to the surface of the cutting plane using an ion beam of 100 pA, 700 pA or 1.5 nA at 30 kV. After removal of each tissue slice, the freshly exposed surface was imaged at 1.5-3 kV acceleration voltage and 700 pA or 1 nA using both secondary electron (SE) and energy selective backscattered (EsB) detectors. The slice thickness was roughly equivalent to the lateral resolution of 2D images, ranging from 6-24 nm. In a fully automated procedure, the milling was combined with SEM imaging in sequence (imaging, then sectioning and reimaging) to collect thousands of serial images. Serial EsB images were aligned (image registration) with in-house python script in Anaconda (Austin, TX, USA). The same transformation matrix applied to each image of the EsB stack was then applied to the corresponding SE image stack. Following alignment, the images were digitally processed to increase contrast and reduce curtaining effects and noise levels. The resulting stacks of images were then segmented based on their structural features and reconstructed using Amira 3D (v 6.5; Thermo Fisher and Zuse Institute). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed using an Ultim Extreme silicon drift detector (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK).",

The ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer was utilized for the test. The test results were plotted and analyzed using Origin 8.5 software.\n\n\nFluorescence Emission Spectra\n\nAt room temperature, the excitation wavelengths of four solutions were scanned with a LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Inc., Boston, MA, USA). The test conditions were set a slit width of 5 nm and scanning rate of 100 nm/min. We started scanning at a fixed excitation wavelength of 320 nm and calculated the Stokes displacement. Then, we gradually changed the excitation wavelength from 280 nm and obtained the corresponding emission wavelength.\n\n\nHigh-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) Measurement\n\nThe aqueous solution of PEGOA hydrogel degradation products containing MoS 2 QDs was diluted slightly. A small amount of the solution was dropped onto the copper mesh loaded with ultra-thin carbon film with a pipette gun. The samples were allowed to air-dry overnight at room temperature. The samples were observed with a JEM-3030F high-transmission electron microscope at different magnifications. The acceleration voltage was 200 kV.

Operating conditions for x-ray mapping were 15 kV accelerating voltage and 30 nA beam current. An initial set of quantitative analyses, including carbon, were carried out on gold-coated samples at 15 kV accelerating voltage, 10 nA beam current, and beam diameter of 5-10 μm. Natural mineral standards were used for calibration; kaersutite and hematite from the Harvard Mineralogical Museum [39] were used for O, Na, Al, K, Ca, and Fe; dolomite and olivine mineral standards from the Smithsonian Institution [40] were used for C, Mg, and Si; SRM 663 Cr-V steel for V; and a natural sample of uraninite for U. Counting times were 60 s on peak for C and O, 40 s for V, and 20 s for all other elements; total background counting times were the same as on-peak times. Interference corrections were applied to V for interference by Ti, to C for interference by U, and O for interference by V [41] and a blank correction was utilized for Au N5-N6 overlap with C [42]. Area peak factors [43] were utilized to correct x-ray intensities of C for wavelength peak shift and shape changes. The resulting detection limit for C was 0.016 wt %.\n\nA second set of EPMA analyses were conducted on a Blue Gap/Tachee carnotite sample, but without carbon in the suite of analyzed elements. This suite of analyses was conducted on a newly polished, fresh surface of the sample to avoid any vacuum drying that may have occurred with the sample from previous periods in the electron microbeam instruments. This sample utilized a carbon coating rather than gold to provide a conductive coating for quantitative analysis.",
