White arrows in Fig. 4 indicate the projection of the ion beams into the x − y plane (thus they enclose ∆φ), and we have chosen the geometry such that the x-axis always is the bisector of this angle. For balanced beams and 0 ≤ ∆φ < 90 • , we observe ripples with a wave vector parallel to the x-axis, for 90 • < ∆φ < 180 • , the ripple wave vector is parallel to the y-axis, but the ripple pattern shows more defects. Exactly at ∆φ = 90 • , square patterns replace the ripples. For unbalanced beams, we observe ripples in oblique directions, which we will discuss below. The erosion rates parallel and perpendicular to the beam projection onto the x − y plane, ν and ν ⊥ , are given in Table I.

The shape of the profile can be calculated with dynamical theory. plane and on adjacent planes. For a given incident angle in the specular condition but not at the Bragg condition, e.g. on the crystal truncation rod, all points along a single plane are scattering in-phase but they are not in perfect phase with the planes below. If the detector is moved to a new position where 2 6 ¼ 2 s , then the points along each plane no longer scatter in perfect phase towards this new 2 position. This new ampli-tude from each plane is A . The path length difference of scattering from points on adjacent planes is also altered by changing 2. For example, an incident wave below the Bragg angle will give a weakened intensity at the specular angle (e.g. on the crystal truncation rod) and the path length difference is always < ; if the detector angle 2 is increased the path length can be increased up to . At this position all the planes scatter in-phase to give an amplitude of NA . Similarly, an incident angle greater than the Bragg angle will have a path length difference > at the specular angle and by reducing the detector angle 2 the planes can be brought back into phase to give an amplitude of NA .

The interference fringes appear again centered on the angle of the connecting line between the atoms. The frequency of the fringes is given by the distance between the two atoms, and the energy-dependent wavelength of the photoelectron. In the plot (note the logarithmic gray scale) it is obvious that the diffraction features typically correspond to a small variation of intensity on a strong but slowly varying background. Theoretically, this is due to the angular dependence of the photoemission cross section and the scattering factors. In the experiment, additional factors such as photon flux, sample orientation and detection efficiency may contribute, and are often difficult to separate from the diffraction signal. The relevant diffraction features are extracted by calculating the modulation function\n¼ I À I 0 I 0 ;ð1Þ\nwhere I 0 is a smooth function from a non-parametric fit of the data, such as a cubic spline or locally weighted linear regression (Woodruff, 2007).

At 10 °, however, the lines were slightly less dense; at 15 °, decidedly less dense; at 20 ° they were scarcely visible and at 25 ° there was no trace of them, for the short exposures given in taking this series of photographs.

It concerns the glancing angle of the various planes. It is evident from the preceding paragraphs that the block of fibers could not act as a single large crystal, and that at any given angle between the 0 ° and the 20 ° positions there must occur a group of fibers in which planes, for example the 6.10, would be oriented properly for reflection of their line.

The intensity ratio between the hexagon centers and the valleys is greater than three. A clear difference between the contributions of concave and convex parts is established for this part of the spectrum. This behavior might be explained by the axicon shape of the outer layers of the exocuticle, as proposed in Ref. 18. Between 750 nm and 900 nm (zone III), the spatial reflectivity gains uniformity, and the contributions of concave and convex parts are balanced. Finally, reflectivity in the infrared spectrum, above 900 nm, reveals another spatial pattern underneath the concave part ascribed to the hexagons. This pattern may be attributed to constructive and destructive interferences. Indeed, as known from the previously established dependence of the reflected wavelengths on the depth (Fig. 4), reflectivity above 900 nm corresponds to a depth of ∼12 μm (beginning of zone III). At this cuticle depth, as shown in Fig. 4, the geometric curvature is greatly reduced, and the pitches are in similar ranges in the endocuticle regardless of whether the measurements are made at the vertical location of convex or concave regions that belong to the upper part of the exocuticle. Thus, the same wavelength can be reflected in the same direction by some pseudolayers presenting a small position offset (Δz). A simple calculation shows that the phase shift (φ = 2π λ nΔz) accumulated in the structure at a wavelength of 950 nm is π (phase mismatch) for Δz = 300 μm and 2π (phasematch) for Δz = 600 μm.

Heinz et al. [34] carried out a least-square fit of the calculated val- ues of Eqs.

The angular pattern of the SH response reflects the shapes of wave functions involved in the relevant optical transitions. Physically, it reflects the angular dependence of nonlinear mobility of surface electrons by the incident electric field. Since calculated results based on DFT often show energy shifts, the experimental data of Fig. 5(a) at ω = 1.17 eV was compared with the calculated ones in a sufficiently broad energy range including 1.17 eV. In the energy range from 0.15 to 4.0 eV the calculated patterns agreed well with the measured ones only at ω = 1.01 eV according to Fig. 5(c). At this energy, the ratio of the calculated susceptibility components is | χ (2) xxx |:| χ (2) xyy |:| χ (2) yxy |= 1 : 0.66 : 0.87, and this is also in reasonable agreement with the measured ratio.",

The input optics (first stage)\n\nfocuses the analyzed area of the sample surface on a diaphragm that acts as a source for the CMA (second stage). The acceptance solid angle is limited by two coaxial cones whose common axis coincides with the spectrometer revolution axis that is set perpendicular to the sample surface. In the following, we assume their half opening angles α min and α max equal to 24° and 38° respectively, in agreement with the description in [4]. Notice that this is at variance with the traditional design of Plamberg [10] in which α = 42.3°(±6°) and one consequence is that the transmitted electrons are focused on an off-axis annular slit. The acceptance solid angle in Staib and Dinklage design equals 0.79 sr, i.e. 12.55% of 2π.\n\nThough, for the MAC2 the figure is 6% of 2π (and this is the only technical data available from the manufacturer) and most likely corresponds to a narrower α range: Δα = ±3,3°\n\ninstead of ±7°. That discrepancy has been ignored in the following for it would have no influence on the conclusions. As shown in Appendix-B, the average value of the term cos 2 ! to be used with Eq.\n\n[A7] equals 0.3019 (using Staib's α angle values) and the variation of that quantity with Δα are excessively small.\n\n\nThe energy scale calibration was carried out using ion etched Cu and Ag samples with\n\nAl-Kα and Mg-Kα X-ray lines. The peak positions of the Cu-2p 3/2 and Auger Cu-L 3 VV lines, Ag3d 5/2 and Auger Ag-M 5 VV and Ag-M 4 VV lines were adjusted to the reference values recommended in [11].

The diffraction experiments were carried out using a white X-ray beam in the energy range 20À100 keV with beam dimensions of 500 Â 500 mm in reflection geometry (Fig. 1). For the data acquisition, an N 2 -cooled LEGe detector system from Canberry with a resolution of 160 eV at 10 keV and 420 eV at 100 keV was used. The acquisition was performed in a symmetric =2 configuration at a constant Bragg angle of 2 = 12 using a counting time of 60 s per recorded spectrum. The measurements were used to evaluate the lattice spacing dðhkl; ; Þ by measuring the positions of TiN 200 reflections at an energy of about 28 keV as a function of the sample tilt angle ( Fig. 1) (Genzel et al., 2004). The dependence of the X-ray elastic strains were characterized using the sin 2 method by measuring lattice spacing dðhklÞ at different sample tilt angles along the direction of the diffraction vector Q. The angle represents the angle between the sample normal n and Q. By varying the angle , the X-ray penetration depth was tuned (Hauk, 1997;Birkholz, 2006).\n\n\nFigure 2",

This relation which is commonly used in x-ray diffraction studies holds only for equidistant planes but does not hold for oneor two-dimensional arrays of scattering points (29). The diffraction phenomena exhibited by uniform size particles such as bacteria or red ceils randomly arranged on a surface or in solution likewise do not obey Bragg's law (19,30). The wave length, X t, is the wave length of the fight in the medium; i.e., the wave lengths given in Table II divided by the index of refraction of the medium, 1.33. For x-rays the index of refraction is very close to unity so that this correction is generally not made in x-ray crystaIJography. From Equation 4 the distance between reflecting planes is calculated to be about 340 m#. The significance of this result will be considered later. Under crossed polaroids the bottom layer of a two-phase system shows colored regions. This is an interference phenomenon characteristic of optically anisotropic bodies. In the case of the bottom layer of an aggregated sample the colored regions on dilution increases in size and become whitish before the permanent birefringence disappears below 0.5 per cent. Fresh iridescent gels exhibit smaller regions of birefringence than do other samples. These regions appear in the polarizing microscope to be about 5 to 20 microns in diameter. The smallness of the crystallite regions is manifested in the lack of sharpness of the Bragg reflection lines. As one goes from blue to red light, the reflection line becomes broader. From the work of Scherrer, yon Laue, and others (for review, see reference 31, chapter 3), it is shown that the x-ray reflection lines from crystals are broader the smaller the number of cooperating reflecting planes. This should also be the case for Bragg  The half-width of the reflection peak is about 5 ° (after subtracting out the angular divergence inherent in the apl~ratus--about 2 °) or 0.1 radon, so from Equation 5 and the data for blue light of Table I, the average thickness of the crystallites is calculated to be 5 microns.

All the images were computed using the original equation (20), not by equation (39). Visual Basic .NET, version 2003, was used to write the computation. In all the computations the Si 220 reflection with Mo K radiation (0.070926 nm) was assumed; B = 10.64 ; the symmetric Laue geometry ( ¼ 0, o ¼ g ) was assumed. To avoid complications when interpreting the computed images, the fringe pattern was assumed to be of rotation moiré with (Ád/d) = 0, except for the case in Fig. 13. The relative rotation of the diffracting plane for the rotation moiré was assumed to be Á = d /0.045 (rad), to make the fringe spacing Ã = 0.45 mm (d = 0.19202 nm).

Θ is the scattering angle and 2Θ is the angle between the beam direction and a given detector point [42]. Ab initio calculations (GAMESS-US MP2/6-311 G** [43]) predict a value of 700 pm for the iodine-iodine distance. Figure 4 shows the experimentally obtained intensity profiles IðsÞ, averaged over −70°≤ α ≤ −50°, together with simulated IðsÞ profiles. Each curve is normalized to be independent of the exact molecular beam density M of DIBN molecules, which merely changes the contrast, i.e., the depth of the minimum. Because of the relatively long wavelength (620 pm) compared to the known iodine-iodine distance (700 pm), the scattering extends to large angles and the first scattering maximum from the iodine-iodine interference is not covered by the detector in our setup. The experimentally obtained IðsÞ is best fitted for an iodine-iodine distance of 800 pm. Figure 4 shows the simulated IðsÞ for iodine-iodine distances of 500, 700, 800, and 1000 pm. The inset of Fig. 4 depicts the calculated χ 2 values [44] in dependence of the iodine-iodine distance. Because of the experimental parameters, as mentioned above, the scattering features are large and vary only slightly within the recorded range of s values. We note that the structural features of small molecules, like DIBN, could be determined much more accurately with data recorded at a shorter wavelength where the available s range extends to cover several maxima and minima. This would be possible at wavelengths of 200-100 pm, which became available at LCLS recently and will be available at upcoming facilities, e.g., the European XFEL, in the near future.",

At the initial stage of supercritical drying, mole fraction of the solvent inside the pores is accepted as 1 since there is only solvent in the pores. Then, CO2 diffuses into pores whereas the solvent diffuses in the reverse direction, resulting in an increase of the mole fraction of CO2 in the solvent. Consequently, density of the solvent-CO2 mixture in the pores varies during drying. Figures 12 and 13 show how density varies with composition for ethanol-CO2 and acetone-CO2 systems for temperatures and pressures commonly employed in supercritical drying. Maximum percent density changes of the systems between the start of the drying until the point where mole fraction of CO2 is 0.95 can be calculated from the plots as 9% and 4% for ethanol and acetone mixtures, respectively from the data given in Figures 12 and 13. Since the percent density change is small, the main parameter determining the relative volume expansion would be the mole fraction of CO2. Therefore, the amount of volume expansion would most likely be Figure 11. Relative volume expansion of ethanol vs. liquid mole fraction of carbon dioxide (a) and pressure (b) at 298.15 K.

The hydrogen yield ranged from 1.2 to 3.2 mol(H 2 )/mol(C 2 H 5 OH) and increased with increasing water/ethanol molar ratio.

The excess of water favors these desired reactions, which was confirmed by the increase in the selectivity of ethanol-to-CO 2 conversion ( Figure 4) and the increase in the hydrogen yield ( Figure 3). Additionally, a large amount of steam in the substrates inhibited the ethanol dehydration reaction (eq 8) and reduced the selectivity of ethanol conversion to ethylene, acetylene, and coke ( Figure 4). The excess of water did not affect the selectivity of ethanol-to-methane conversion (eq 11) because, in this reaction, water is absent. A reduction of  ethanol-to-methane conversion selectivity (eq 11) at a low water/ethanol molar ratio resulted from the acceleration of the dehydration reaction (eq 8). Increasing the importance of ethanol dehydration (eq 8) increased the selectivity of ethanol conversion to ethylene, acetylene, and coke. This is an expected effect since an increase in ethylene concentration promotes the formation of acetylene (eq 9), and, consequently, an increase in acetylene concentration promotes the formation of coke (eq 10). The selectivity of ethanol conversion to these three products (C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 2 , and coke) reached a total value of ∼30%. A high coke production (360 mg/h) is particularly disadvantageous since a filter should be frequently replaced. The water/ethanol molar ratio of 2 resulted in high coke production and was the minimum value at which the reactor operated stably.",

[5] found changes in the slope of the excess activation free energy, enthalpy and entropy around 50 mol % ethanol concentration. They suggested that some structural changes occur in this region. Nishikawa et al. [1] suggested that concentration fluctuations reach their maximum at ~40 mol % ethanol, based on small angle X-ray scattering experiments. Ben-Naim [6] found that at ~47 mol % ethanol concentration the average affinity between water molecules reaches its maximum, while between ethanol and water molecules, reaches its minimum. All of these findings can be connected to the fact that, according to our simulation data, the percolation threshold for water can be found somewhere between 40 and 60 mol % ethanol concentration in ethanol-water mixtures.\n\nFurthermore, Oleinikova et al. [25] reported the 2D percolation threshold for water in tetrahydrofuran-water mixtures at 53 mol % water concentration, and the 3D threshold at 63 mol % water, which are not far from our results.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n(1) Pure ethanol has different cluster forming properties from the rest of the systems: many smaller sized clusters can be found up to 100 to 370 molecules, depending on the HB condition applied. In this liquid, no percolation occurs.\n\n(2) On the other hand, all the studied ethanol-water mixtures have a 3D percolating infinite main cluster, and therefore they form a network. The size of the percolating main cluster is increasing with increasing water concentration. Smaller clusters, <50 molecules, can be found beside the main cluster in these systems; their size and number is decreasing with increasing water concentration. For pure water (almost) all the molecules are in the main cluster.\n\n(3) Ethanol is more likely to be found in smaller binary or pure clusters, or to remain as solitary molecules (without hydrogen bonding).\n\n(4) Fractal dimensions of the infinite percolating clusters are increasing from d f =2.6 to 2.9 for the ethanol-water mixtures and d f =2.99 for water, regardless of the choice of the water force field or HB condition.",

At the initial stage of supercritical drying, mole fraction of the solvent inside the pores is accepted as 1 since there is only solvent in the pores. Then, CO 2 diffuses into pores whereas the solvent diffuses in the reverse direction, resulting in an increase of the mole fraction of CO 2 in the solvent. Consequently, density of the solvent-CO 2 mixture in the pores varies during drying. Figures 12 and 13 show how density varies with composition for ethanol-CO 2 and acetone-CO 2 systems for temperatures and pressures commonly employed in supercritical drying. Maximum percent density changes of the systems between the start of the drying until the point where mole fraction of CO 2 is 0.95 can be calculated from the plots as 9% and 4% for ethanol and acetone mixtures, respectively from the data given in Figures 12 and 13. Since the percent density change is small, the main parameter determining the relative volume expansion would be the mole fraction of CO 2 . Therefore, the amount of volume expansion would most likely be determined by the mole fraction of CO 2 in the pores which depends on how fast CO 2 diffuses into the pores. Since volume of the pores can be considered as constant during drying, volume expansion would eventually lead to spillage of the pore filling liquid to CO 2 stream. During volume expansion and consequent pressure increase of liquid in the pores, resistances due to surface tension and friction by pore walls are overcome so that there would be a flow and spillage of the expanded liquid. Therefore, both operating conditions and textural properties of gel would affect this transport mechanism.",

In fact, the same ionic conductivity measured in neat methanol is also recorded in the 75:25 and 50:50 methanol-water mixtures (i.e., 0.2 S·cm −1 ). However, when the amount of water exceeds the amount of methanol, an abrupt change of the conductivity properties is recorded. Although the ionic Ohmic behavior is preserved, the 25:75 methanol-water mixture exhibits a far larger conductivity with respect to the remainder samples with different molar ratios, as shown in Figure 4. In particular, a proton conductivity σ p (X075) = 0.4 S·cm −1 is recorded. This sudden increase of the conductivity is likely due to a structural change of the H-bond network, the latter representing the locus where correlated proton transfers take place. There exist experimental evidences that, at this specific concentration (i.e., 25:75), segregation of the water and methanol phases occurs [6], in that a bi-perculating H-bond network is established for such a molar ratio both in methanol-water mixtures [6] and in ethanol-water mixtures [7]. Hence, because of the more percolated H-bond network in water, exhibiting two donor and two acceptor sites of protons per molecule, a twice ionic conductivity is established with respect to the neat methanol case and the 75:25 and 50:50 methanol-water mixtures. The same rationale, corroborated by the fact that water molecules hold a larger number of protons a priori available for conduction, is capable to account for the noticeably larger proton conductivity measured in neat water. From the respective current-voltage diagram shown in Figure 4 (magenta diamonds), an ionic conductivity σ p (water) = 1.3 S·cm −1 is inferred. This value is about six times lower than that determined by means of pioneering Car-Parrinello MD simulations [29]. This implies, once again, that a richer statistics and dispersion-corrected GGA functionals are crucially important in describing water and the behavior of its ions [66][67][68].

All gelation experiments were performed at a neutral pH (approximately 7.2), allowing an overall mild environment. This comes at the cost of mechanical stability and binding capacity compared to the other methods, putting more chemical or thermal stress on the protein solutions [6]. Figure 1 illustrates the property (ethanol mole fraction versus BSA mole fraction) space of samples prepared at 37 • C after an incubation time of 16 h. The mole fractions were used to remove the effect of volume dilution that would have to be taken into account for the concentrations. As mentioned above, there also seems to be a minimum amount of BSA needed for the gelation. Below this concentration (1.07 mM), the proteins cannot form enough cross-links to build a gel, potentially because of low probabilities for intermolecular secondary structure (β-sheet) formation. The absolute values (without ethanol) for gel formation have been extensively studied in a previous publication [6] to find the absolute minimum with ethanol; more experiments are needed and are beyond the scope of this study. Another interesting phenomenon can be observed by the addition of high amounts of ethanol. At molar fractions between 0.3 and 0.35 of ethanol, the obtained gels show a high turbidity. After adding more ethanol, only a turbid liquid is obtained. Nevertheless, above a molar fraction of 0.49, turbid gels can be observed again. The turbidity reflects the inhomogeneity of the gel structure.\n\n\nGeneral Gelation Properties",

The samples obtained had a rod morphology. When the ratios of water to ethanol increased to 20 mL:60 mL and 20 mL:80 mL, relatively large polyhedral granules sized about 300 and 500 nm were obtained. The XRD analysis shown in Figure 1 shows the phase-pure synthesis of the MOF-801 crystals [4,14]. Subsequently, the ratio of ethanol to water was decreased below 1. When the proportion of water in the reaction increased, the white precipitate formed much faster, indicating a higher rate of nucleation. When the volume of water was 40 mL, polyhedron granules sized approximately 40 nm were obtained. These granules began to show partial interconnection, with a small minority of the crystals accreting. Then, when the volume of water was increased to 60 and 80 mL, small nanosized polyhedrons of lengths less than 10 nm that were intergrown and could not be separated by ultrasound were observed, as shown in Figure 2. It should be noted in the XRD diagrams in both Figures 1 and 2 that, as the ratio between ethanol and water decreased, the peaks became lower and wider, indicating smaller crystal sizes of the MOF-801 crystals. This is coherent with our observations from the SEM that decreasing the ratio led to a fall in crystal size. Furthermore, we used the Debye-Scherrer equation to calculate the sizes of all these crystallites [15]. When the ratios of ethanol to water were 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 3, and 4, the corresponding crystal sizes were 9, 13, 39, 121, 294, and 536 nm, respectively, derived from the Debye-Scherrer equation. This supports our observation from the SEM. The exception of the shape of the MOF-801 should be noted when the solvent ratio was 2.

Hence a calculation which assumes that this difference in entropy is zero, as is in a simple Ising model in which the entropy difference vanishes by symmetry 14 , cannot capture this temperature shift in a dilute solution. I now address the question as to whether the contribution to the shift in transition temperature due to the partitioning of the solute, the last term in Eq. (24), is the dominant one. The first term in Eq. (24) can certainly be ignored compared to the last for the case of a biological membrane. The change in area per lipid 12,13 between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases is about ∆a = 0.2nm 2 . Further, the surface tension decreases on the addition of solute, and this decrease cannot be larger than the surface tension itself. In cells 15 , this is on the order of 5 × 10 −3 k B T /nm 2 . Thus in order for the first term in Eq. (24) to be greater than the last, the difference in mol fractions of the solute in the two phases would have to be less than 1 × 10 −3 . There remains to discuss only the terms in Eq. (24) proportional to changes in chemical potential differences ∆(µ i − µ p ), i = 1, ...p − 1. It would appear that these quantities are not controlled in the experiment, and to this extent, the change in transition temperature upon addition of alcohol is not a well-defined quantity; i.e. by varying these chemical potentials upon addition of the alcohol, one could vary the shift in transition temperature at will. Nevertheless it is reasonable to assume that, except for the addition of the short-chain alcohol, the composition of the giant plasma membrane vesicles utilized by Gray et al. 4 are essentially the same as vesicles without alcohol. Therefore with the exception of the change in chemical potential of all solvent components brought about by the entropy of the solute, Eq.

As illustrated in Figure 5 (numerical data are provided in Table S11), ΔG ads for ethanol is most favorable at low ethanol concentrations with a value of −6.2 kJ mol −1 at C EtOH = 5 g L −1 ; that is, the SPP environment (particularly, the hydrophobic micropores) is preferred by ethanol over the aqueous solution phase presumably through a combination of the hydrophobic solvation penalty for the ethyl tail group and the strong dispersion interactions in the narrow micropores. As the solution-phase ethanol concentration increases, ΔG ads for ethanol becomes less favorable. Again, two factors contribute to this change: aggregation of ethyl tails makes the solution phase more hospitable, and, once the micropores are filled by ethanol, additional adsorption in the mesopore leads to an unfavorable environment for the ethyl group. For C EtOH > 500 g L −1 , ΔG ads for ethanol reaches a plateau at +1.1 kJ mol −1 .\n\nWhile ΔG ads for ethanol shows a strong concentration dependence, the changes for water are relatively minor and ΔG ads is always positive (i.e., adsorption is unfavorable) throughout the entire concentration range.

D is 1.1 × 10 −4 m, given that a single droplet of water is around 0.05 mL. The difference in surface tension between ethanol (22 mN/m) and water (72 mN/m) is 50 nM/m. Accordingly, the value of λ is around 0.764 μm. Thus, when the ratio is 2, the temperature change should be 4.6 °C. This is different from the value observed in Figure 3, which was over 1 μm. What is the reason for this difference? Maillard et al. reported that this formula should only be used for quantitative estimations [11]. The difference in surface tension could be less than 50 mN/m due to impurities. There is also thermal energy transfer to the surroundings, which may increase the value of temperature change measured. In this way, the characteristic wavelength of the Marangoni flow could be more than 0.764 μm.\n\nHowever, what about Marangoni flow for other solvent ratios? It still exists, but it no longer dominates. When the ratio of ethanol to water reaches 3, the temperature change drops to 0.8 °C. This causes the characteristic wavelength to become larger. The MOF-801 single crystals formed in this way are much larger due to larger distances between each stream of the Marangoni convection. On the other hand, when the ratio becomes 1, the temperature change rises to 7.6 °C. Thus, λ is much smaller, resulting in relatively smaller sizes of the MOF-801 crystals. These nanosized MOF-801 crystals also easily interconnect because of the smaller distances between each stream of convection. In both of these cases, the role that the Marangoni flow plays no longer dominates.\n\nAt this point, we want this work to help further research gain insight into the role that ethanol plays in the synthesis of MOFs. Future research may further investigate the mechanism of how ethanol modulates the reticulation of all sorts of MOFs or focus on new synthesis strategies of MOFs using ethanol.\n\n\nConclusions",

Guo 15 reported that in a microwave discharge with a power of 700 W, the energy yield of hydrogen production from a mixture of air and ethanol was 38.5 mol(H 2 )/kW h. However, due to the greater possible productivity, hydrogen production from a mixture of water and ethanol is the most interesting. Because ethanol needs to be produced and its quantity is limited, efforts should be made to obtain as much hydrogen as possible from the ethanol used. Water is readily available and cheap. Therefore, currently, in commercial-scale steam reforming of natural gas, excess water is used to improve the use of natural gas. This paper presents the effect of water content in the mixture introduced into the reactor on the efficiency of hydrogen production. The water content is an important parameter affecting steam reforming of various substrates. A novelty is a study of ethanol steam reforming in the spark discharge in a wide range of water/ethanol molar ratios. So far, the influence of this parameter on the ethanol steam reforming process in the spark discharge has not been studied. The studies were carried out in a stoichiometric mixture, i.e., a water/ethanol molar ratio equal to 3, with excess water (water/ ethanol molar ratio equal to 4, 5, and 6) and water deficiency (water/ethanol molar ratio equal to 2). The aim was to confirm that an increase in the water/ethanol molar ratio reduces coke production. In contrast, a decrease in this ratio increases the energy efficiency of hydrogen respectively.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS",

The two estimates are −2.30 ± 0.14 kcal/mol and −2.16 ± 0.16 kcal/mol for the linear and integrated logistic potentials, respectively, are in statistical agreement. Given the very different nature of the alchemical paths in the two simulations, it must be concluded that equilibration and convergence of the hydration free energy has been achieved in this case. This positive outcome is consistent with the high rate of hydration and dehydration events observed for ethanol ( Figure 5 and Table I). It also confirms the validity of the alchemical protocol and the correctness of the simulation algorithms in producing a canonical ensemble of conformations.\n\nThe reverse cumulative equilibration profiles paint a different picture for the bulkier 1-naphtol ( Figure 6). With the linear perturbation potential the hydration free energy of 1naphtol appears to equilibrate after approximately 0.75 ns at a value of −3.23 ± 0.25 kcal/mol. With the integrated logistic potential instead, the hydration free energy appears to equilibrate immediately after the start of the simulation at a value of −3.86 ± 0.22 kcal/mol. The two values are most certainly statistical inconsistent (the p-value of being equivalent is 8×10 −5 based on a simple t-test) and, based on the very few occurrences of hydration/dehydration events (Table I) and the slow equilibration (Figure 6), it can be concluded that the estimate with the linear alchemical potential is the least reliable.\n\n\nIV.

The values increase from d f =2.60 to 2.99 with increasing water concentration, and all of them are above d f =2.53, which is the 3D percolation threshold predicted by random site percolation theory [27]. If the fractal dimensions are plotted against the ethanol concentration (given in molar %), a nearly linear behavior can be found; only the value for the Et80S simulation with the S150 HB condition falls somewhat lower, see Fig. 3. Considering the number of water and ethanol molecules in the clusters (Fig. 2 (c) and (d) and Table 2) the following observations can be made:\n\n1) There is not much variation in terms of the number of water molecules in the clusters across the individual particle configurations, whereas the number of ethanol molecules shows almost the same standard deviation as the total number of molecules. That is, water molecules are more stably 'glued' to the main cluster than ethanol molecules.\n\n2) The participation of ethanol molecules in the main cluster is between 84.0 and 99.7%\n\n(if we omit the lowest value, which occurs in the Et80S system using the S150 condition, they change between 94.4 and 99.7%), while for the water molecules it is 94.8 to ~100%. Again, water molecules appear to like being in the main cluster to a somewhat larger extent than ethanol moleules.\n\nThe occurrence of purely ethanol and purely water clusters among the small isolated clusters was also determined; results are shown in Fig. 4, as the ratio (in %) of the number of isolated clusters. While for ethanol the ratio increases from ~7% to ~76% with increasing ethanol concentration, it declines quickly for pure water clusters from 14% to 0% with decreasing water concentration. The ratio of molecules in pure clusters, as compared to the total number of molecules of their own type, is small: the largest value is ~7% and quickly decreases to 0.02% for ethanol with decreasing ethanol concentration.",

These include uncertainty in the density of mercury, about 20 ppm; in the gravitational constant, about 10 ppm, and in the end standards, about 2 ppm.\n\nThe original plan for the NBS gas thermometer was to measure the ratio of the pressures generated in the gas thermometer at two temperatures, one of which would approximate the ice point (later refined to the more precise triple point of water). By fixing the number of moles of gas involved and using the ratio technique, Stimson and his colleagues planned to employ a more advanced form of eq (3) to evaluate the unknown temperature in thermodynamic terms, relative to the first. Initial NBS discussions probed the possibility of using a gas-bulb material made of an alloy whose thermal expansion might be nearly zero over a limited range of temperature. They also considered the relative advantages of utilizing a working gas of known non-ideality, versus the technique of making measurements over such an extended range of filling pressures that an extrapolation to zero pressure might be valid.

We considered that following that step, as the magma ocean cools down, it equilibrates with the Ca-Mg-rich sulfides at a slightly lower temperature than during core formation (2000 K instead of 2230 K). Since S solubility in silicate melt decreases at lower temperature (Namur et al. 2016a \n= ( * ( + ) + * * )/( + + ) (8) = * (1 − ) + * * (9)\nIn this case, we consider that the magma ocean becomes sulfide-saturated as soon as it cools down right before its crystallization. If sulfide saturation happens at a later stage, only a fraction of the BSM would equilibrate with sulfides, and resulting bulk Cr/Al would be closer to the one calculated in the sulfide-free models (Fig. 9a). We considered a log fO2 range from IW-6 to IW-4. The lower limit was based on the super-chondritic bulk sulfur (similarly to scenario 2, Boujibar et al. 2019) and the upper limit was fixed at IW-4 because of the low fO2 required to permit the presence of stable Mg-Ca-rich sulfides (Namur et al., 2016a). We fixed the temperature at 2000 K (Boukaré et al., 2019) and we assumed that the sulfide phase contained 20 wt% Mg and 45 wt% S, i.e., the average composition of Mg-Ca-rich sulfides in Namur et al. (2016a). For all three scenarios, since there are significant uncertainties related to partition coefficients ( / , / , and / ), surface Cr surface measurements ( ), and crustal thickness, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to account for these errors. Random numbers were generated from normal distributions, which yielded 10 7 models for Mercury differentiation for each of the considered combinations of fO2 and sulfide mass fraction.

Mercury's surface lavas are unlike any others observed in the solar system. They are very low in Fe (and essentially FeO-free), sulfurrich, and highly enriched in alkalis (Table 2.1). From crater size-frequency distributions it has been estimated that these volcanic deposits formed between 4.2 and 3.5 Ga (Marchi et al., 2013;Byrne et al., 2016; Chapter 6 and 9). The oldest volcanic rocks are found in the intercrater plains and heavily cratered terrain (IcP-HCT), and the youngest are found in smooth plains deposits, including the large expanse at high northern latitudes (Head et al., 2011;Chapter 6). A number of researchers have used petrologic modeling and experiments to infer candidate mineralogies and infer the melting conditions and mantle source compositions for the surface lavas Charlier et al., 2013;Namur et al., 2016a;Vander Kaaden et al., 2017). One approach to this methodology, discussed in detail in Chapter 7, relates various geochemical terranes to the overall geological history of Mercury. In this section, The low multiple saturation point pressures indicate shallow depths of melt segregation (~ 60 km) within Mercury. The most straightforward mechanism for producing these high extents of melting would be batch adiabatic decompression melting. By this mechanism, a parcel of mantle ascends in a mantle plume or as a mobile blob (Figure 2.5), it cools slightly as its temperature follows the adiabatic gradient (0.3 o /km), and it begins to melt at the depth where the adiabat intersects the solidus. The primary control on melt production is the temperature of the upwelling mantle; this effect on melting is illustrated in Fig. 2.5 for two different adiabatic paths. Magma is produced by the conversion of internal heat to heat of fusion. As a parcel of mantle continues to rise, melting continues and melt is extracted and transported upwards until a depth is reached at which the temperature of the parcel of mantle is lower than the solidus temperature for the residuum, i.e., the material",

The drop in pressure is apparently due to the oxidation of mercury vapour in the bulb. The oxide then distils out and condenses in the colder part of the apparatus, more mercury vapour diffuses in and the process goes on continuously. By keeping the tap between the bulb and the mercury surface closed between readings, the difficulty was overcome and no further drop in pressure was noticed.\n\n(3) A further difficulty was met with in connection with the use of tap grease on the tap mentioned above. Blank experiments showed a slow but appreci able absorption of oxygen by the ordinary type of grease, consisting of rubber, paraffin, and vaseline. A mixture of paraffin and vaseline did not absorb oxygen and gave satisfactory results.\n\n\nSample Calculation.\n\nIn order to illustrate how the calculations were carried out, the complete data of one experiment are given below.

For the first model where sulfides are absent (Fig. 8a), these calculations were applied for a range of log fO2 from IW-7 to IW-2. In the context of Mercury's core-mantle differentiation, sulfides are known to form as immiscible phases when the metal phase is enriched in Si (Morard & Katsura, 2010) or C Dasgupta et al., 2009). Indeed, the immiscibility field shrinks at higher pressure (> 15 GPa) while pressure at Mercury's core-mantle boundary (5.5 GPa) is low enough to allow for a large range of compositions where FeS-and FeSior FeC-rich liquids are immiscible. In addition, Mercury's bulk S reaches the upper estimates of S abundances in chondrites at IW-7, because of increased S solubility in magmas at low fO2 (Namur et al. 2016a). The addition of sulfides at IW-7 would yield a sulfur abundance higher than in chondrites. Therefore, here we considered the possible presence of sulfides for models where the log fO2 is between IW-6 and IW-2 (Fig. 8b).",

According to [1][2][3] our topological analysis of the stability of gas hydrates in the systems H2O -CO2 and H2O -H2S, the temperatures of the inevitable complete decomposition of solid solutions are close to 121 K (-150°C) and 126 (-147°C), respectively, and are controlled by the approach of saturated pressures steam over the \"guests\" molecules (CO2, H2S and Hg2O2) and ice water as the \"host\". A reliable estimate of the lower temperature stability of Hg•5.75 H2O (H) without experimental data is difficult, but as a first approximation is possible. If, following [5], it is assumed that global accumulation (and preservation) of mercury (4 ppt) occurs in permafrost, but in the form of this gas hydrate, that is, it is entirely due to its stability with known thermodynamic fugacity Hg (0), corresponding to the content in the \"standard air\", 2.2 ng/m 3 , that is, with a partial pressure of Hg = 2.46•10 -13 in the air, and comparing this value with the content of mercury (4 ppt ~ X = 3.6•10 -13 in permafrost ice, it is easy to calculate the typical composition of the gas hydrate Hg•6.05 H2O (H), but different from the theoretical, which corresponds to the complete filling of the structural cavities: Hg2O2•5.75 H2O.\n\nNext step. The difference between the theoretical composition and the actually observed in the permafrost is due to the choice of the wrong stoichiometry. The real composition of gas hydrate Hg2O2•5.75 H2O and not Hg•6.05 H2O. After this transition operation, there is complete agreement between the stoichiometric and observed content (4 ppt) in permafrost.",

The apparatus used was of the same type as that described in the above papers, with certain modifications to render it suitable for working at different temperatures. Unfortunately, the method is only practicable for a somewhat limited range of temperature. On the one hand, the temperature must be lower than that at which the vapour pressure of mercury becomes appreciable, on account of the very high viscosity of the la tte r; on the other hand, it must not approach the solidifying point of mercury. At 100° C. the vapour-pressure of mercury is about 1/5 mm. This was judged to be as much as could be safely neglected, and observations were therefore taken at two temperatures only, viz., atmospheric temperature and the temperature of steam. However, although these limitations render observations over a large range impossible, they still allow interesting comparisons to be made of the temperature variations of the different gases. Incidentally, redeterminations of the ratios of the viscosities of the gases to that of air have also been obtained with an entirely new apparatus.\n\nApparatus.

Their gas-to-ice CH 3 OH ratio does not show any trend with H 2 column density. In addition, they estimated the column densities of methanol in the gas-phase at LTE, with a mean temperature of 15 K and using a high energy transition of methanol.

First, elemental mercury itself, by its own chemical properties, should be close to other noble metals, whose solubility is 2 orders of magnitude lower, demonstrates duality of behaviour and causes a relatively high the ability to oxidize. Secondly, as we see (Fig. 1), it is in the high-temperature region, when Hg(0) begins to absolutely prevail over the oxidized forms and the lg m -1/T dependence becomes an extremely simple linear function. and the solubility of mercury near room temperature does not give this dependence, that is, the concentration is too high compared with a linear law, which is associated with the appearance of already analytically significant quantities of oxidized forms of mercury, compared to Hg(0).

Therefore, an empirical p ter was added into the Gibbs-Thomson equation as follows. Parameters a and b were fitted to the data presented in Figure 11. The fitted parameters and associated physical properties are summarized in Table 3: Table 3. Parameters and physical properties used in the modified Gibbs-Thomson Equations (3)  The empirical parameters were calculated with respect to the interfacial energy at a reference pressure of 5 MPa and assuming constant density and enthalpy of fusion. These thermophysical properties are difficult to measure in porous media. In the bulk phase, the density of hydrates could be estimated with the thermal expansion coefficient and compressibility with an assumption of 94% cage occupancy [35]. The enthalpy of fusion is known to vary with pressures. However, the enthalpy data from this study and density data from Helgerud, et al. [35] suggest that the pressure variation in bulk density and bulk enthalpy for solid hydrate is not strong. In the light of the difficulties in obtaining properties in porous media, the bulk density, the melting enthalpy in bulk, and measured interfacial energy at 5 MPa were applied to the modified G-T Equation (3). The empirical parameter, β, was used to compensate for any pressure effects, most likely associated with interfacial tension. The modified G-T equation provides a semi-empirical equation to calculate the confined melting points under elevated pressures within the range 5-50 MPa and 274.1-298.5 K. The expanded uncertainty of the correlation was estimated to be 0.20 K with a confidence interval of 95%.\n\n\nEmpirical Correlation\n\nThe Gibbs-Thomson equation predicts the melting temperature shifts from the bulk melting points. It requires a knowledge of methane hydrates' bulk melting points to predict the melting points in porous media.

Here, a computer experiment is performed where the liquid system expands (increasing temperature and decreasing the corresponding density), within this process the thermodynamic state (ρ, T) = (9.25 g/cm 3 , 1673 K) of the NM transition is modeled. The certain thermodynamic state is not pictured in earlier studies and a range of densities have been estimated for predicting NM transition. For instance, in the study by Delhommelle et al. [42], the nonmetallic state is modeled over a range of low densities, while the metallic state is modeled over a range of high densities only for one temperature point only (1473 K) by use of the empirical potential (C) via the Wang-Landau scheme.\n\nIn the reference [28], the depth of the minimum pair part of the EMA (B) is changed as analytically in the range 1273 K < T < 1803 K (10.98-6.8 g/cm 3 ) that could be related to the M-NM transition.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nMetallic to the insulating transition of liquid mercury is investigated in a canonical ensemble by Monte Carlo simulation in the context of pair, empirical, and many-body interaction potentials.\n\nThe temperature dependencies of static properties are utilized to acquire the metal to nonmetallic transformation. The simulation results indicate that the first coordination number and configurational internal energy, differ markedly in their trend and features, at the temperature of 1673 K (the density of 9.25 g/cm 3 ). Therefore, in this thermodynamic state, a phase transition from metallic state to insulating occurs, which is consistent with experimental studies. Especially, the simulated neighboring distribution estimates more fraction of atoms' tendency to form a dimer-like species in a nonmetallic state.",

Anderson [36] demonstrated a mathematical approach based on the Clapeyron equation to calculate the heat of dissociation with fewer assumptions. Enthalpy of fusion is known to vary with temperature. Regarding methane hydrates, we have seen that elevated pressures lead to a higher melting point which may affect the enthalpy of the methane hydrates' decomposition. A few experimental values have been reported previously at low pressures, but there are no data Figure 12.

[19].\n\nTo determine the enthalpy of fusion accurately, a stable baseline and an accurate initial water content are crucial. It is known that the unreacted ice can form methane hydrate before hydrates start to decompose, which causes an exothermic shift of the heat flux. The shifted baseline led to difficulties in determining accurately the boundary conditions when the peaks were deconvoluted and integrated. The oscillating temperature procedure was therefore used to convert all ice/water into hydrates, which generated a stable baseline during the subsequent heating step. Another important aspect was the mass of the initial water sample. Since the sample weight for the DSC Evo 7 is typically around 5 mg to 20 mg, the sample mass determined gravimetrically led to a significant error in the enthalpy measurements. In this study, the sample weight was determined calorimetrically from the area under the DSC ice melting peak by using the ice enthalpy of fusion at ambient pressure. The experimental values determined from the heat flux area of the hydrate melting curves are summarized in Table 5. In the investigated pressure range, the enthalpy of fusion increased slightly on increasing the pressure.\n\n\nConclusions",

Conant has applied a correction to his earlier calculations (23) and the Hg vapor activities now agree very closely with prediction from Duhem integration from the emf values for these structured solutions.\n\nIn spite of excellent agreement with theory shown by the Sn-Hg sys tem, however, one must be very careful in his Duhem integrations of alloy data. For solids the CeCd^.s microphases indicate the sorts of problems one can meet: In this case what appears to be a single phase region was demonstrated by vapor pressure (24) and X-ray crystallography to contain at least 70 interrelated superlattices, each of which thermo dynamically constitutes a separate phase. These phases can rapidly reach equilibrium of the Cd component with the nucleated structure, but nucleation of more stable structures can be difficult, and one cannot accurately establish the path of integration which would correspond to equilibrium through the microphases.\n\nFor this CeCd^A.s region, Ncd/Nce is not huge, and errors in the integration path used for calculation are not too critical. For similar behavior in the end regions of composition where the ratio would be very large, however, large integration errors could be introduced if one tried to extrapolate to infinite dilution.",

Combined, our results imply that the stability field of the zero-temperature quantum liquid phase, if it exists at all, would only occur at higher pressures than previously thought. The characterization of the physico-chemical properties of hydrogen at high pressures and temperatures is of fundamental interest in physics, astrophysics, chemistry and planetary science. Previous theoretical studies [1,2] have predicted that at sufficiently high pressures solid hydrogen would transform into a quantum liquid phase that would constitute a new state of matter, due to the fact that hydrogen has a very large zero-point energy at ultra-high pressures. Results from first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have indicated that liquid hydrogen undergoes a molecular to atomic transformation [3], which is predicted to occur at a pressure of 125±10 GPa along the 1500 K isotherm. Another study, employing similar techniques, has reported the finding of reentrant behavior [4] in the melting of hydrogen, i.e. the existence of a maximum along the melting line, predicted to occur at ∼80 GPa and ∼900 K, followed by a decrease of the melting temperature at higher pressures. This prediction has been subsequently confirmed by experiments [5][6][7], which place the maximum at ∼106 GPa and 1050±60 K. The occurrence of reentrant melting behavior is understood to be a necessary, though by itself not sufficient, condition for the existence of the high pressure quantum liquid phase predicted by Ashcroft [2], and thus it was taken as a strong indication of its existence by Bonev and coworkers [4]. With the assumption that the negative slope of the melting line persists to high enough pressures, it was estimated [4] that the quantum fluid state would occur at pressures close to 400 GPa. Recent * Electronic address: mym@jlu.edu.cn first-principles MD and quantum Monte Carlo [8] simulations have confirmed once more the reentrant behavior of the melting line, and determined a coexistence point at which both the molecular and atomic fluids coexist with the solid (phase I); this coexistence point could either be a triple point or, if the insulator-metal transition occurring in the liquid actually extends into the solid, a quadruple point.",

Compositions were chosen to correspond to the high-Mg portion of the ICP-HcT (Figure 2.2) and the low-Mg northern smooth plains (NSP). These compositions thus correspond to the \"high Mg\" and \"northern terrane\" compositions discussed in Chapter 7 and represent approximate end-members of Mercury's surface compositional range (Figure 2.4a). Namur et al. (2016a) mapped out a phase diagram for the selected compositions and identified multiple saturation points (points in pressure-temperature space at which two or more minerals are in equilibrium with the melt along the liquidus) involving forsterite + enstatite + liquid at 0.75 GPa and 1480 °C for the high-Mg IcP-HCT composition and at 0.75 GPa and 1380 °C for the low-Mg NSP composition.

As shown in my first paper*on this method, the unsymmetrical shape assumed by the mercury pellet in descending produces an effective reduction of driving pressure. For tubes of the size used in these experiments this reduction amounts to about 3 per cent, of the whole pressure difference, when the length of the mercury pellet is, asin this case, between 4 and 5 cm. The question is whether this capillary diminution will vary so much with temperature as to make appreciable the effect of its variation on the total driving pressure. The data with regard to the temperature variation of the surface tension of mercury are apparently not very reliable, but for the purpose of applying a small correction the decrease of surface tension for the rise of temperature from 15° to 100° C. may be taken as amounting to about 6 per cent, in the case where air is the superposed fluid. Upon this basis the effective increase of total driving pressure for the said range would be equal to 3 per cent, x 6 per cent. = 0-18 per cent. This correction is of the same order as that of errors liable to occur in the measurements; but it has not been applied, owing to the uncertainty of its applicability to cases where gases other than air are in contact with the mercury. I t is true that corrections of the same order are applied, as, for instance, that due to the expansion of the glass; but these are perfectly definite and accurately known. I t should be pointed out, however, that the values obtained for the temperature coefficients are probably slightly lower than the correct ones owing to this cause. This will be referred to later.",

For that very reason (besides practical ones, including experimental accessibility) we choose to work at T ∼ 400 K, a temperature that compromises between three constraints: 1) it is well above the temperature where the quantum effects of ZA flexural phonons (the dominant thermophoresis agent) become irrelevant [29]; 2) it is ∼ 1/5 of the LA (and TA) Debye temperatures [30], so that their specific quantum effect, although not irrelevant, are at least not dominant. LA and TA modes will anyway turn out not to contribute to thermophoresis; 3) it is still below the higher temperature regimes where some phonon mean free paths get anharmonically shorter than the system size [31].\n\nThe finite-size acoustical phonon gaps at k = 0 on the other hand would be a problem if their magnitude came close to our working temperature T = 400 K. Even for the smallest size considered, L = 30 nm, however, the LA phonon gap ∼ v LA /2L is only 1.4 meV, or 16 K (for v LA ∼ 22 km/s); the ZA gap ∼ C/4L 2 is for graphene ∼ 5 × 10 − 3 meV or 60 mK.

Nevertheless, it is convenient to tag a structure with an average thermal conductivityk (the average is performed by analytically integrating Eq. 12 over the system width or length):k is a well-defined quantity, but it should not be used in a diffusion equation (such as Fourier's law) in an attempt to reconstruct a temperature profile.\n\nIn Fig. 4, we plotk as a function of the crystal size at room temperature and contrast our results with the commonly used Surf-RTA modeling of surface effects. Our approach preserves the qualitative behavior of the Surf-RTA:k goes to zero in the small crystal limit and reaches bulk values for large sizes with a smooth transition in between the two cases. Such intermediate region, which is the most relevant to estimate the impact of nanostructuring on  Another comparison with the Surf-RTA is shown in Fig. 5, where we plot the average thermal conductivity as a function of temperature, together with the bulk conductivity.\n\nIn agreement with conventional expectations, the impact of surfaces is the largest at low temperatures: here our theory has the largest departure from Surf-RTA estimates. In fact, at smaller temperatures more Umklapp processes are frozen out [6], impeding heat flux dissipation by phonon scattering events and thus giving rise to more pronounced collective effects, which can only be captured by the exact solutions of the LBTE [30]. As temperature is increased, the conductivity slowly reduces the deviation from the bulk limit, although even at 1000K our estimate ofk still differs from the bulk value or from the Surf-RTA estimate, even more so considering that a log-log scale is used. Although not shown in detail, we stress that the difference between our approach and the Surf-RTA also depends on the crystal size chosen; Fig. 4 is specific to a system of size 4 µm. We also stress that all the concepts exposed in this model of surface scattering don't rely on the dimensionality: although we compared with the Surf-RTA in a 2D system, we expect similar trends to hold in 3D materials as well.",

(37) can be either justified on physical grounds, or derived formally as high-order expansion of the many-particle stress tensor [25]. We also stress once more that in deriving this equation we have assumed that the flow of the electron liquid is laminar, i.e., we are far from the onset of a turbulent regime [14,15]. Obviously, in writing Eq. (37) we have assumed that some thermodynamic quantities like temperature and entropy for an electron liquid flowing in a nanostructure can be defined. This is a much debated point, and obviously we do not have a general solution for it. However, here we argue that the electron temperature may be defined as the one ideally measured by a probe weakly coupled to the system and in local equilibrium with the latter [2]. While this operational definition may not be simple to realize in practice, we know from experiments that local heat generation due to current has a large effect on the stability of nanostructures [9]. From the form of Eq. (37) we can deduce a general relation between the applied bias and the electron temperature. To do this, we realize [7] that the electron fluid velocity, v, (which is generally smaller than the Fermi velocity [22]) responsible for the transport of current and heat is, in linear response, proportional to the bias V . 4 This simple proportionality, and the usual result that k ∝ c V , bring us to the general result\nT e = γ ee V,(38)\nwhere γ ee is a constant whose expression in terms of microscopic parameters of the electron liquid has been recently derived for a quasi-adiabatic connection between the leads and the nanojunction [7] \nγ ee = 1.16 × G nA c d − 1 3d η γ (39)\nwhere G is the conductance of the system in the limit of zero bias, A c its cross section, d is the dimensionality (d > 1).

Here S ≡ V th /∆T , where V th is the thermovoltage developed in response to a temperature difference ∆T . For this, they detected, similarly as in Ref. [8] and, more recently, Ref. [9], the thermovoltage generated across a pair of quantum point contacts (QPCs) with a heated electron gas between them. Then ∆T was estimated as V th /S, where S was obtained using the Mott relation [10]: \nS = π 2 k 2 B T 3e 2 d ln σ dE E=µ .(1)\nHere k B is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electronic charge, ≡ h/2π with h being Planck's constant, σ is the electrical conductivity, E is the total energy and µ is the chemical potential. This technique has been used to measure κ in quantum wires [5,11] and energy-loss rates in 2DEGs [12]. Chickering et al. [13] showed Eq. 1 to be broadly valid in gated regions of a 2DEG between 0.8 K and 2 K and therein suggested the possibility of using a symmetric pair of bar-gates as a thermometer for the local T e . This method was recently employed to measure S in mesoscopic 2DEGs [14][15][16]. Usefully, the relatively large size of the bar-gates eliminates the need for electron beam lithography which simplifies the fabrication process. However, it was noted in Ref. [13] that the data systematically deviated from the Mott prediction. Rojek et al. [1] attributed these deviations to the spatial extent of the BGTs being comparable to the energy relaxation length in the 2DEG and developed a model to account for this.

Taking the metallic-like ρ(T )-dependence into account enhances out-diffusion at low temperatures and thus shifts T * towards even higher values. Also, taking into account possible external noise would further increase the value of T h . The lowest bath temperature in Ref. [ 15] is T b = 35 mK. Using Eq.

They analyzed the data in terms of our recent theory of Anderson localization by temperaturedependent disorder [ 5] and came to the conclusion that within this theory a nearly constant ρ(T ) would imply a \"remarkable coincidence\".\n\nWe begin our discussion of this issue with summarizing briefly the argument of KK.

The CO 2 gas is heated using a cylindrical cell made of solid Cu, which incorporates a 4 mm long nozzle of 0.6 mm diameter. The cell itself has an internal diameter of 10 mm and a length of 12 mm, with a quartz fibre. The cell is heated by wrapping a resistive coaxial sheath wire around it, and can reach temperatures up to about 850 K. A magnetic shield, placed around the cell, prevents the field generated by the heater, around which there is wrapped a pipe with flowing water that provides an outer cooling jacket, from penetrating into the interaction region. A thermocouple was set in to a small hole on the cell, and can serve to monitor the cell temperature. From an earlier experiment [12] that produced a gas phase C 60 beam, it has been confirmed that the gas temperature of the cell can be estimated approximately to be the same as that for the CO 2 beam at the collision centre (~1.5-2 mm from the cell nozzle exit). While sweeping the electron impact energies over the range 1-9 eV, the excitation function experiments were carried out at the respective energy loss values of 0.083 eV and -0.083 eV and at the scattering angles of 30°, 60°, 90° and 120°. Furthermore they were measured at the temperatures of 300, 550 and 750 K.

This reflects the fact that at very low temperatures, ∆ * → ∞, very few collisions occur with enough energy to be inelastic while at very high temperature, ∆ * → 0, the loss of energy during inelastic collisions is of no physical importance since it represents a vanishing fraction of the total energy of each atom. Both of these limits can therefore be viewed, in some sense, as \"elastic\" limits although in neither case can one say that only elastic collisions occur and it is to be expected that in both of these \"elastic\" limits, all thermodynamic and transport properties will be those of an elastic gas since the energy dissipation plays no role.

We have also assumed that the electron density that enters the local heating is the one of the chemical bonds between the D and Pt atoms. This density is estimated to be close to the Pt bulk density, n = 6.6 × 10 28 m −3 which gives the electron constant r s ≃ 3.

The ionic heating constant is found to be γ ep = 405 K/ √ V . 6 This value can be compared with the corresponding γ ep for a Au point contact at small biases which is about γ Au ep = 170 K/ √ V [43]. This means that the Pt-D 2 -Pt system heats up more than the Au QPC. For instance, at 0.1 V the ions of the Pt-D 2 -Pt junction have an average temperature of about 130 K while at the same bias the gold atoms heat up locally to about 54 K. This larger temperature is reasonable since, while the conductance is similar for a Au point contact and Pt-D 2 -Pt, the D 2 molecule is lighter than Au with a consequent increase of the electron-phonon coupling. In addition, the modes of the D 2 molecule have lower probability to elastically scatter into the bulk modes of Pt -thus reducing lattice heat dissipation into the bulk electrodes -than the modes of a single Au atom into the bulk modes of Au.

Application to argon atom adsorption on a platinum (111) surfaceIn figure 8 we analyze the convergence behavior of the distribution of the parallel kinetic energy component at low lattice temperature (T s = 80 K) and two incident angles (30 • , 60 • ). In contrast to the higher temperatures (cf. figure 7), the convergence is not achieved at n b = 15. There are significant deviations from the DF at n b = 40. They can be better followed if the DF is compared with the Boltzmann prediction for the lattice temperature of 80 K, see Eq. (2) below. Indeed, both distributions seem to converge to the  thermodynamic prediction, when the adsorbate fully equilibrates with the thermal bath presented by the lattice atoms. There are still some discrepancies present at low and high energies. We can conclude that at such low temperatures the bounce number n b = 40 is not sufficient to reach a quasi-stationary distribution close to the Boltzmann prediction, even though the trapped states dominate the DF for both angles already at t > 4.5t 0 (30 ps) according to the analysis presented in paper I [30]. When comparing the results shown in figure 8 with the cases at higher temperatures displayed in figure 7, we actually observe that the latter DFs have converged to the Boltzmann curve specified by some effective temperature T for all three angles and n b = 40. In the case of a lattice temperature T s = 190 K (left panel of figure 7), we obtain the value T ∼ 150 K. At T s = 300 K the effect of the subthermal distribution becomes larger, and we find T ∼ 200 K. Compared to the equilibrium Boltzmann prediction of T = T s , the measured DF shows an increased population of low-energy states. All this indicates that while the full convergence to an equilibrium function has been reached, the effective adsorbate temperature remains different from the lattice temperature with T < T s . We note that a similar \"lag\" between T and T s has been measured for Ar on 2H-W(100) in [39] and for Ar on Pt(111) in [40].

Clearly, numerical simulations are needed to exhaustively find all MECs for this or other related potentials.\n\nAnother point that was not touched upon in this paper is the problem of stability at finite temperatures. For the hard-core plus linear-ramp potential in two dimensions a detailed discussion has been given elsewhere. 5 I will only mention here the interesting fact that in some cases the melting of the crystalline structures is anomalous (in the sense that it occurs with an increasing in density) due to the sudden availability of configuration space at higher energies upon melting (which may be assimilated to an effective reduction of particle size at melting).\n\nOther interesting issue concerns the dynamics of these structures. For instance, for the hard-core plus linearramp potential (at zero temperature), if we increase the external pressure smoothly, there is a value at which the TS would have a lattice parameter lower than r 1 , and the structure destabilizes against displacement of single particles. Since particles in different positions will move in rather independent directions, we expect to obtain a disordered (metastable) structure at high pressures. For potentials such as the sharply cut off 1/r, the instability is against deformations involving a large number of particles, and thus the metastable structures obtained by increasing pressure are expected to consist of large patches of particles, deformed along different directions. This is in fact what is obtained in numerical simulations. This phenomenon, as well as the appearance of metastable structures when decreasing the temperature from a finite value to zero 5 are important in connection with the transition to the glass state.\n\nAlthough the kind of potentials needed to obtain the behaviors discussed in this work are difficult to find in atomic systems, it is reasonable to expect that they have physical realizations in colloidal dispersions, 11 where the interaction potential between particles can be changed a great extent through the applications of different techniques.\n\n\nVI.

Such a conclusion is important in what regards two-temperature (T, T v ) models [14], which propose simplified alternatives to state-to-state models, with the aim of reproducing nonequilibrium phenomena in gases and plasmas without the often prohibitive computational overheads associated to state-resolved models.

As discussed in the introduction, it is not realistically possible to strive for a validation of the dataset for such an extended temperature range. It is however possible to check if the dataset is at least physically consistent. As we will see more ahead, this is far from true if one simply considers the dataset of Table 2, regardless of the temperature range.\n\nWhen on speaks about the physical consistency of the dataset under examination, one is specifically considering whether the chemical reaction rates do not exceed the physical limit which is represented by the gas-kinetic collision rate (in other terms, one is checking if the rates do not correspond to transition probabilities larger than unity during the collision between two species, at a given energy.\n\n\nLimiting Gas-Kinetic Rates",

The estimated θ K as a function of U for simulations at θ = 20 K is plotted in Fig. 15 on a logarithmic scale. The results obtained by using the two alternative definitions in Eqs. (100) and (103) are in good agreement, showing that both methods are largely equivalent for the evaluation of θ K . Note that the numerical and stochastic precision of the computed Z, and consequently of θ K through Eq. 100, degrade for U larger than 2 eV as Z becomes small, although its error bar stays of the order of 0.1. In this case the system is approaching the transition point between the Kondo and the local moment regime, where Z is not a well-defined quantity anymore. A precise evaluation of the Kondo temperature via Eq. 100 for U > 2 would require much lower simulation temperatures than θ = 20 K, where the system would be deep in the Kondo regime, but these simulations turned out too computationally demanding.",

Within the accuracy of the calculation, a cusp in f at T D = 350.74 K is distinctly seen. It is associated with a sharp jump of the entropy at the transition. A jump in the specific heat is also observed. Evaluating numerically the first and second left-and right-derivatives of the free energy, one obtains the jump in entropy ∆s = 4.40 k B , or 8.75 cal/K/mol, and the jump in specific heat ∆c v = 0.64 k B . The specific heat drops from 2.14 k B below T D to c v = 1.5 k B for T > T D as expected from equipartition because after denaturation only the harmonic contributions of the hamiltonian stay significant. Fig. 3b shows that, within numerical accuracy, r exhibits a discontinuous transition from a finite constant value (very close to the equilibrium value R 0 ) to a value of the order of the system size; in other words, the eigenfunction φ 0 appears to become suddenly delocalized. The picture of a sharp transition persists down to a temperature sampling of 0.01 K.",

This equation is the main result of this work and shows that thermal conductivity in a crystalline nanostructure is determined by two contributions: a bulk conductivity k ∞ that is decreased by a position-dependent surface term ∆k surf (y). The latter depends on the distance from the surface through a series of exponentially decaying factors, whose decay length is determined by the eigenvalues λ i , which we call friction lengths for the reasons that will be explained below. To help the reader, nanostructuring is effective, that is, the largest friction length. We show for comparison also the mean free paths of relaxons (the heat carriers) and their (positive) contribution to bulk conductivity.\n\nWe note how the relaxon mean free paths are typically shorter than the friction lengths; thus, surface scattering doesn't simply impose an upper bound to the mean free path of carriers.\n\nwe include in the supplementary material table 1 summarizing the variables used in the derivation of this result.",

It is very obvious that the linear relations between (1/T À 1/T hm ) and ln c are obtained and the value of linear correlation coefficient (r 2 ) for the solution process was higher than 0.99, which indicates that the van't Hoff equation is useful to gure out the enthalpies of solution. 32 The values of K can be calculated from the intercept of the line as shown in Table 1.\n\nThe standard apparent entropy change (DS ) could be calculated according to the following equation:\nDS ¼ (DH À DG )/T hm(4)\nThe solution process apparently is not spontaneous and endothermic could be inferred from the value of DG .

It is calculated at different temperatures as it is a function of temperature. As the fuel travels from the fuel tank to the intake manifold, the temperature of the fluid rises and becomes nearly equal to 100 0 C near the intake manifold [15][16] and thus these temperature ranges were chosen. The calculations were carried out using a method postulated by Sastri [14] which is given by,\n= ln (1) = 1 − 1 − (2) = (3) = (4)\nwhere, is the viscosity in mPa.s is the viscosity at T B in mPa.s is 0.1175 for alcohols, 0.248 for Gasoline is reduced temperature in Kelvin is the reduced boiling temperature in Kelvin Here C is the no of carbon atoms in ethanol which is 2 and Table 2 shows the values for number of molecules for gasoline and ethanol [14]. The value of = 3 + 2 + and here N represents the number of molecules.The value obtained by this calculation is 0.00133 Pa-s for ethanol whereas the actual value is 0.0012 Pa-s which has a percentage deviation of 10.83%. Similarly all the values are calculated for different temperatures and plotted in the form of a graph.\n\n\nDensity:-\n\nThe density of the substance is defined as the mass present in its unit volume. Whenever heat is extracted from a fluid, the fluid will become compact as the particles slow down and come closer to each other. This will decrease the volume as it is compacted. As the volume decreases, the density of the substance starts to increase. So the fluid has a higher density at colder temperature and the opposite effect is observed at higher temperatures. It is evident that ethanol has greater density than gasoline and so there will be fewer problems associated with vapour lock and more problems associated with cold-start in ethanol. The values of density are calculated using Equation 5   The value calculated at 300.48K is found to be 0.7815 g/cm 3 and the actual value was found to be 0.7687 g/cm 3 . The percentage deviation between the calculated and actual value was found to be 1.66%.",

In Fig. 10a, the positive dependence of k(T,p) to pressure increase is seen. As mentioned above, this can illustrate more clearly by the ratio k ∞ /k 0 (see Fig. 10c). This ratio for the H abstraction from the Cα center of ethanol by NH, at 600, 1500, and 3000 K is 3.49E + 05, 1.11E + 08, and 7.24E + 09, respectively. Also, the reduced rate constants for this channel demonstrate directly this statement (see Fig. 10b). The reduced rate constant for this reaction at 600 K, k(600 K,p)/k(600 K,1 bar), when p is 10 -2 , 10 -1 , 10, and 10 2 bar is 6.28E−02, 2.90E−01, 2.21, and 3.01, respectively.

As a rule, if the band gap depends on the dopant content in the TiO 2 matrix, it may be attributed to the dopant introduction in substitutional positions. Here, this is not the case (Table S2, Fig. S5 †) and a gradual increment in Niconcentration shied the absorption edge to higher wavelengths non-linearly, again proving that the metals were not incorporated into the titania framework.",

Obviously, this redshi originates from TiO 2 band gap narrowing due to the addition of dopant materials. In doped TiO 2 products, addition of Ag ions produces signicant change in TiO 2 absorbance spectrum resulting in absorption edge spectra from 332 nm to visible area. [53][54][55] This visible region absorption of doped titania depicts possibility of lower energy transitions since, metal clusters enhance localized energy levels of TiO 2 band gap into which titania valence band electrons are excited longer than 332 nm wavelength.

This parameter characterizes the electronic structure of semiconductors and the efficiency of photon absorption is related to its value [86]. E g can be defined in different ways as the fundamental gap, optical gap, electronic gap, and HOMO-LUMO gap. The fundamental gap is defined as the difference in energy between the first electron affinity (EA) and the first ionization potential (IP), according to the equation [87]:\nE g (fund) = EA − IP(49)\nThe optical gap is the energy of transition between the ground state and the first excited state. Its value is close to the value of E g (fund) and it can be described by the equation [87]:\nE g (opt) = EA − IP − E b (50)\nwhere E b is the exciton formation energy significantly lower in comparison with E g (fund). The band gap can be also defined as a difference between the top of valence band (E VB ) and the bottom of the conduction band (E CB ), which can be denoted as the HOMO-LUMO band gap or the mono electronic band gap [87]:\nE g (mono) = E CB − E VB(51)\nIn the case of solids, it can be assumed that E g (fund) is almost equal to E g (mono). The band gap position is another important parameter that characterizes semiconductors applied as photoelectrocatalytic material. In the case of a photoanode or photocathode, the positions of the quasi-Fermi levels of the holes (E Fh ) and electrons (E Fe ) defines the ability of the semiconductor to oxidation or reduction reactions by presenting the chemical potentials of these charge carriers [87][88][89]. The quasi-Fermi levels can be calculated according to the following equations:\nE Fe = E C − k B × T × ln N eff,C n e(52)E Fh = E V − k B × T × ln N eff,V n h(53)",

The positions of the curve were adjusted by aligning the Ti 4+ 2p core level. This allows us to quantitatively compare the change in band gap reported by others to the change in valence band, presuming the conduction band is unaffected by N doping [11]. Due to its formal Ti 4+ oxidation state, pure TiO 2 primarily has a filled O 2p derived valence band separated from an empty Ti 3d, 4s, and 4p derived conduction band by a bulk bandgap of 3.2 eV [20]. The valence-band spectra show the emission from the O 2p band, and visual examination reveals two features in the N doped sample: a tailing of the valence-band maximum to higher kinetic energy, and an impurity state just above this maximum compared to undoped TiO 2 . The tail like state is attributed to the N 2p level since the binding energy of N 2p is less than O 2p thus extending the valence-band maximum to lower binding energy. However, the shift observed in the valence band (of about 0.3 eV) is not enough to explain the observed red shift observed in optical absorption spectra reported (of about 0.5-0.8 eV) by several groups [10,13,14].",

To do this, we considered the difference of absorption spectra in the visible region between the studied nanoheterostructures and pure nanocrystalline TiO 2 . The heterostructures used in this study were produced on the basis of N-doped TiO 2 . The difference absorption spectrum for N-doped TiO 2 is represented at Figure 7a. Such doping creates an additional wide, structureless absorption band for titanium dioxide nanocrystals, from about 420 to 720 nm. This may correspond to a fairly uniform spectrum of electronic states in the band gap of TiO 2 . Therefore, the adsorbed molecules of the rhodamine dye (when illuminated at 500 nm) can efficiently transfer the photoexcitation energy on the order of 2.16 eV (≈575 nm, see Figure 4) to the semiconductor via the induction-resonance symmetric dipole-dipole mechanism. Using this energy, the electrons are effectively ejected from the local states in the band gap to the conduction band of TiO 2 . This can lead to the accelerated photodegradation of the dye on the surface of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide when illuminated at a 500-nm wavelength. In addition, the doped material of the photocatalyst itself absorbs radiation at the wavelength of 500 nm (used for the measurement), which can also lead to the observed effect. Samples of TiO 2 -WO 3 , TiO 2 -MoO 3 and TiO 2 -MoO 3 -WO 3 more effectively absorb light in the visible region than N-doped TiO 2 . The difference between the absorption spectra of these nanoheterostructures and pure titanium dioxide in the visible region is shown at Figure 7b, but there is a clear dip in their absorption spectra in the range of 420 to 540 nm. Therefore, the illumination of such samples at a 500-nm wavelength should not lead to a significant photocatalytic effect. Although all three of these structures can effectively absorb radiation with the wavelength of~575 nm, this means that in their electronic spectrum there are states that could be acceptors for non-radiative energy transfer from the dye molecules.",

Ab initio DFT calculations of the electronic gap for a-TiO2 give results in the range 2.2-2.85 eV The various models proposed [45,48] agree that in a crystalline to amorphous transition (called an Anderson transition [54]), some of the extended levels of energy (which are valid for the whole crystal, with a finite contribution for conductivity, described by Bloch wave functions) must be replaced by localized electron states, which can be described by wave functions that are confined to a few atoms.

Therefore, these electrons cannot contribute significantly to conductivity [48]. These localized electron levels seem to be concentrated near the top E V of the valence band and in the bottom E C of the conduction band (see Figure 3), creating tails that extend the valence and conduction bands, reducing effectively the electronic band gap [55,56]. According to some experimental evidence, smaller gaps have been measured for successively more disordered systems [46].\n\nAb-initio calculations for a-TiO 2 , showing the similarity of shape of the electronic density of states in the conduction band of amorphous and crystalline TiO 2 phases, have also been reported [50,[57][58][59][60]. Ab initio DFT calculations of the electronic gap for a-TiO 2 give results in the range 2.2-2.85 eV [50,60], which compare with the experimental values of 3.03 eV for rutile and 3.20 eV for anatase TiO 2 [50], which are slightly larger than expected.",

For solid solutions with up to around 20% of Mn in CVO we observe a pronounced narrowing of the band gap (see Fig. 3a and ESI † Fig. S4). Then the band gap remains almost constant before rising sharply towards the CVO composition. These theoretical predictions are supported by experimental UV-vis spectroscopy (see Fig.  FIG 3b) that points to a band gap reduction slightly larger then 0.1 eV going from MVO to MCVO 0.1 followed by a significantly larger band gap of over 2 eV for CVO. These results suggest that MVO could benefit from a ≈ 10% Cu substitution to absorb a larger fraction of solar light, while CVO will have to be substituted with > 20% Mn to significantly lower the band gap. Under all considered substitution levels, the band edge positions and in particular the valence band edge remain in a suitable position to provide a sufficiently high overpotential for the OER that is catalyzed on these photoanode materials (see Fig. 3a).

Between these two monoclinic forms and the already deposited in the Protein Data Bank P2 1(β) (PDB code: 1EV6; [28]), an unusual crystal packing for the P2 1(γ) polymorph is noteworthy. While P2 1(β) , consists of six molecules per asymmetric unit, and 48% solvent content, according to Matthews Coefficient calculation [75,76], the novel P2 1(γ) polymorph contains twelve molecules per asymmetric unit and 39% solvent content (Matthews coefficient = 2.03 Å 3 ·Da −1 ). This difference between the cell contents among the two polymorphs, reveals a denser crystal packing in the case of P2 1(γ) which could be of great pharmacological importance.",

As illustrated by Fig. 4, STEM is a powerful method to directly correlate the measured molecular weight of a particle to its shape. The main peak at 2.2 (±0.5) MDa in the mass-distribution clearly corresponds to relatively uniform spherical particles, while the smaller less welldefined peaks at higher molecular weights frequently arise from multiple nanoparticles sticking together (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the mass values of peaks 3 and 4 are also close multiples of 2.23 MDa. SAPNs with a particle mass of 2.23 MDa must be formed by approximately 180 peptide chains, implying that they have a T = 3 icosahedron-like structure with a predicted diameter of 25 nm (Fig 1D, bottom). This is in good agreement with the 27 or 28 nm average diameter indicated by TEM and DLS for SAPNS under close to physiological conditions. The second peak in the massdistribution, 3.8 (±0.5) MDa, implies the presence of particles with approximately 300 peptide chains, which may explain the somewhat elongated structure of some SAPNs. This might be an infrequent unique structure or, as evident for some of the projections, arise from the association of two lower mass SAPNs. It should be noted that the various species documented by STEM were necessarily measured together in the bulk DLS experiment, which will have broadened the single peak obtained and increased the estimated average hydrodynamic size.",

Each sitting drop (0.4 μl) was prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution at 8 mg/ml and the reservoir solution [100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.5, and 25% (w/v) PEG3350].

We initially tried to optimize this crystallization condition but failed to improve the crystal quality. Therefore, microseeding was employed. A stock solution of microseed crystals was prepared by crushing the needle-like crystals in 50 μL of the reservoir solution using the Seed Bead kit (Hampton Research) and by diluting hundred-fold with the reservoir solution.

Although high-molecular-weight polymers such as galactomannans (100 × 10 4 Da) and baker's yeast beta-glucans 2 have been structurally characterized, the exact molecular weight was not estimated because of their size and insolubility. There are many reports on low-molecular-weight glucans from Rhi- Microscopic and Particle Size Analysis. ZM appeared as an oval-shaped particle with a size below 3 μm ( Figure 4A), whereas ZMA appeared oval, but the morphology was not well-defined ( Figure 4B). The particle size distribution of ZM (1−3 μm; Figure 4C) was marginally larger than that of ZMA (< 2 μm; Figure 4D). It was reported that the size of β-glucan particles does not affect its cellular uptake by macrophages, and microparticles of a size of 1−5 μm are readily phagocytosed by macrophages through the Dectin-1 receptor. 40 The hollow and porous structures of yeast beta-glucans (2−4 μm in diameter) were used as microcarriers, and because the porous channels in the glucan shell were not uniform in size, they could help in loading drug molecules with different size distributions. 41 In water suspension, the average size of ZM ( Figure S3A) particles was 712.5 ± 7.9 nm with a zeta potential of 9.76 mV, while the average size of ZMA ( Figure S3B) particles was 650.0 ± 38.93 nm with a zeta potential of 25.22 mV. The higher zeta potential values indicated the stability of ZMA particles. In general, particles within the size range of 1−1000 nm could be used for prophylactic vaccine designing, with ZM reported as an immunepotentiator; it makes ZMA an ideal carrier molecule for vaccine delivery.",

Thinking that a cofactor was missing, we performed a thermal folding assay (Ericsson et al., 2006) with various additives (see below). Magnesium and sulfate improved protein thermostability ( Figure S2C) so we reasoned that they might aid stability during crystallization. Crystallization conditions were screened with sitting drop trays set up using the Mosquito (TTP Labtech; Cambridge, MA). We obtained crystals using recombinant FOG-3 (1-137 H47N C117A) with an intact histidine tag and incubating our trays at 4°C. After 3 weeks, rhomboid crystals were observed in conditions A (0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 10% (vol/vol) isopropanol, 10% (wt/vol) PEG 4000) and B (0.1 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 8% (wt/vol) PEG 10000). UV scanning with a UVEX-M (280 nm excitation, 350 nm emission; JANSi; Seattle, WA) identified these to be protein crystals. Both conditions were reproducible. We were able to collect complete datasets from the crystals grown directly from the condition B screening trays. Phasing was accomplished with molecular replacement using Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) and a human Tob homolog (PDB ID: 2Z15) as a starting model. Model building and refinement were done in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) and Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Water molecules were first modeled by Phenix before being checked manually. Three densities were too big to be water molecules. We could model one of the densities with sulfate. Two densities were observed in the solventaccessible area adjacent to residues 52-56 in both copies in the ASU. Density is observed at FoFc contour levels past 6 σ. We attempted modeling of acetate (too small) and citrate (too large), both molecules that were present in the crystallization conditions, but the fit was unsatisfactory. Thus, the final uploaded model does not account for these two large densities. Analyses of protein assemblies, dimer interactions and free energy estimations were done in PISA",

Subsequent complexes with fasudil (Toronto Research Chemicals), hydroxyfasudil (prepared as in Ref. 31), and H-1152P (Calbiochem) were made by soaking unliganded crystals (ROCK 6 -415) with 500 M compound and 5% Me 2 SO (final concentration) for 48 h at room temperature.\n\nThe Y-27632/ROCK diffraction data were recorded at the COMCAT (32-ID) Beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratories and Emerald Biosciences). All other diffraction data were recorded at Beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories). Intensities were integrated and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (32) and CrystalClear (33).",

Microcrystals and nanocrystals of proteinase K were then grown using the batch method and their size was optimized by seeding as described by Beale et al. (2019). Crystal seeds were required to reproducibly grow crystals of a uniform size. To produce seeds, a method based on the protocols described by Luft and DeTitta (1999) was used. Crystals several hundred micrometers in size were grown using the vapor diffusion method. Crystals were grown in CrystalQuick TM X plates (Greiner) at 19 • C over approximately 18 h. The drops contained 200 nL 50 mg/mL proteinase K in 25 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 200 nL reservoir solution [20% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.2 M ammonium chloride]. Crystals from these conditions were harvested by aspirating with a pipette into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 25 µL of reservoir solution and several small silicon beads. Crystals were crushed by three consecutive rounds of 30 s of vortexing followed by a 30 s incubation on ice. The seed stock, crystallization solution [20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M ammonium chloride] and protein solution were combined in a 1:2:3 ratio. The crystallization experiment was then incubated overnight with gentle agitation using an orbital shaker at 18 • C. Different dilutions of the seed stock were used to generate crystals either hundreds of nanometers in size (nanocrystals) or approximately 10 × 10 × 12 microns in size (for lamella), where more concentrated seed stocks produced the smaller nanocrystals.",

For crystallization, thawed protein was centrifuged (16 900g, 15 min), concentrated to 0.3 mM and mixed with microcrystal seeds (Dods et al., 2017) at a protein:seed ratio of 100:5. The seeded protein was mixed with monoolein (9.9 MAG) doped with 0.5%(v/v) ubiquinone-2 in a 40:60 protein:lipid ratio to form the LCP. Initial crystal hits were found by screening around previously published LCP crystallization conditions for the reaction center (Chiu et al., 2000) using an LCP Mosquito robot. The crystallization conditions were optimized by screening the concentration of 1,2,3-heptanetriol isomer T against the thickness of the LCP string. Following the general well-based crystallization protocol described above, the conditions were then fine-tuned by varying the concentrations of both the protein and the precipitant, as well as the volume ratio between LCP and precipitant solution. Ultimately, 10-12 ml LCP was dispensed into a well with 100 ml precipitant solution consisting of 40 mM zinc sulfate, 120 mM 1,2,3heptanetriol isomer T, 100 mM sodium citrate pH 6.0 and incubated for three days at room temperature.

Similar values for the kinetic coefficient were found for the crystallization of several other macromolecules [31,[36][37][38]. The lower values of b for macromolecular crystallization compared  with inorganic crystallization [35] has been attributed to the necessity of the pre-kink selection of the proper orientation of an incoming macromolecule for incorporation into the growth step [28]. At lower supersaturation a non-linear dependency of tangential step rate was observed (Fig. 8), presumably due to the influence of impurities, a phenomenon well documented for a number of other macromolecular and inorganic crystals [38].

Somewhat surprising was the unit cell we found for orthorhombic lysozyme, which had a significantly shorter b axis and a significantly longer c axis than the unit cells reported in the literature. The unit-cell volume of the largest known orthorhombic polymorph of hen egg-white lysozyme was about 13% smaller than that of our nanocrystals (Table 2). Unfortunately, our nanocrystals could not be grown to a larger size. Hence, we could not corroborate the new unit cell by X-ray analysis and in the absence of independent proof we cannot exclude the possibility that our algorithm failed to identify the correct unit cell of nanocrystalline lysozyme. It may be that the combination of randomly oriented diffraction patterns, a relatively large unit cell and a potentially anisotropic rocking curve frustrates our algorithm and we are further investigating potential improvements. However, using the large unit cell, we were able to index well aligned diffraction patterns using the program ELD (Zou et al., 1993), yet we failed to index these patterns if we used the unit cells of known",

For stainless steel, the threshold velocity will be approximately 1.79x10 5 m/s, corresponding to a 6.58 keV K + ion. Given the possibilities that the valence electrons can exchange momentum with the lattice during the excitation or that the electron-electron interaction is more efficient for heavy ions as the electron clouds are compressed during the collision, the maximum energy transferred will be greater than the value shown above and consequently the threshold velocity will be below that range [27].\n\nFrom this discussion and the experimental data shown in section IV, it can be concluded that the main electron emission mechanism will be KEE for the present ion energy range.\n\nAn ion entering a solid will lose energy to the medium.

                    "contents": "Ultrafast electron diffraction imaging of gas-phase moleculesThe typical pulse duration of the electron beam is around 500 fs but this can be compressed down to 200 fs using RF fields. However, this introduces a temporal jitter of 300 -400 fs between the pulsed electron beam and optical pulse used to generate the electron beam. A time-stamping procedure overcomes this optical-electron timing jitter, achieving a ´ of <100 fs as demonstrated in condensed matter UED studies [Gao2013]. Specifically, the timestamping procedure uses a laser-triggered streak camera to record the arrival time of each electron pulse, allowing for the arrival times to be resorted on a shot-to-shot basis [Gao2013]. Moreover, correction of °{™ to the attosecond timescale has been proposed using a lasercycle streaking method [Gliserin2016]. Another possibility in reducing ³ is to minimize the propagation distance of the electron beam to the target sample, with the ability to reach down to 500 fs for a 25 keV non-relativistic pulse. However, regardless of the propagation distance, the GVM between the optical excitation pulse and the non-relativistic electron probe pulse as they traverse the target sample will contribute significantly to Δ . This is typically not a problem with optical-pump optical-probe measurements since both pulses will traverse the target sample at the speed of light in vacuum, . For example, a beam of non-relativistic 25 keV electrons with a speed of 0.31 will take 4.3 ps to traverse a gaseous molecular beam with a diameter of 400 µm, whilst it will take 1.3 ps for the optical pulse with a speed of to travel the same distance. Thus, the GVM of roughly 3 ps will significantly contribute to the temporal blurring of the transient structures in time-resolved UED measurements. In fact, GVM not only arises from differences between the velocities of the optical and electron beams but additional temporal broadening also arises from non-collinear geometric overlap of the two pulses. Minimising the effects of GVM and temporal broadening can be achieved by (i) accelerating the pulsed electron beam to relativistic kinetic energies (i.e. 1 -4 MeV) as well as (ii) using a collinear geometry [Williamson1993, Centurion2016]. Details on relativistic (MeV) UED are given in the following",

The exponentially dependent ionization yield, thus, favors the early ionizing long trajectory, which is the reason why the short trajectory contribution is neglected.

The relativistic nature of MeV UED helps minimize space-charge repulsion effects to subsequently generate a high bunch charge electron pulse with a temporal resolution of ~100 fs (FWHM). A schematic of a typical MeV UED set-up based on one used at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) [Weathersby2015, Yang2018a, Yang2018b, Shen2019] is shown in Fig. 3.4A. In this SLAC MeV UED set-up, relativistic UED beams with an electron kinetic energy of 1 -4 MeV are typically generated through an S-band 1.6-cell photocathode RF gun consisting of two RF cavities (a half cell and a full cell), with a cross-sectional schematic shown in Fig. 3.4B [Weathersby2015, Yang2018b]. In the half-cell, a thin copper photocathode is impinged by a short (~100 fs), ultraviolet (266 nm) laser pulse generated by the frequency tripled output of an 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser system. This generates a pulse of electrons in a similar way to that of keV UED. What is different here in the MeV UED case is that the emitted electron pulse is then accelerated out of the RF cavity to much higher (MeV) kinetic energies using the relatively high electric field (>100 MV/m) [Akre2008] in the cavity as compared to keV UED (1-10 MV/m) in order to achieve electron pulses with pulse durations close to 100 fs (FWHM) [Chatelain2012].

Electron pulse generation\n\nThe development of the electron source and the generation of ultrafast electron pulses played a vital role in the establishment of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. The developments that are being carried out on the electron source focus on the enhancement of the temporal and spatial coherent resolution to capture faster dynamics of matter with higher resolution.\n\nSpatial coherence, which is defined through the maximum distance between two objects for which interference is still visible on the screen, is a critical parameter of the electron source and is determined by the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths of the source (see Section 3). On the other hand, the temporal resolution is defined by the electron pulse duration and the phase stability at the interaction stage. Both the temporal and spatial resolutions are reduced by the space-charge effect due to Coulomb repulsion of electrons in the wave packet [114], as discussed earlier in Section 2. The electron beam intensity requirements for the source are more difficult to define, since they depend on the sample under study, namely on the phase (i.e., solid, gas), the thickness, which should be in the range of 10-100 nm, and the background. Nevertheless, at least ~ 10 4 -10 5 electrons per pulse are needed to clearly resolve the diffraction peak and/or obtain a clear image in UED and UEM, respectively [18]. From the theoretical modelling and experimental study, it is obvious that it is impossible to use the conventional electron gun parameters to attain sub-ps electron pulses at the sample position with reasonable electron number densities [114][115][116]. In the pioneering work by Siwick and Miller on implementing a compact electron gun design, 600 fs pulse durations with up to 10,000 electrons per pulse were achieved [22]. This paved the way for the development of a source of high-brightness electron beams with pulse durations on the order of hundred femtoseconds, based on Radio Frequency (RF) compression [96,102,117], which will be discussed later.\n\n\n.

This plot indicates that the activation energy for dissociation from the potential well, 22.3±0.9 kJ/mol, is very close to the activation energy for electron diffusion, 20.5±0.2 kJ/mol (Fig. 7S) [60]. The same point is illustrated by the plot of W d /D e as a function of the temperature in Fig. 8(b), where D e is the diffusion coefficient for hydrated electron [60]. On the other hand, the activation energy for the recombination constant, W r , is much lower, 8.3±1 kJ/mol (which is equivalent to ca. 3 kT at 25 o C). Apparently, while the dissociation of the (OH:e aq -) pair is diffusion controlled, the recombination of \"caged\" partners is not. The activation energy for W r compares well with 7.9 kJ/mol obtained for rxn.

The reaction radius R eff estimated using eq. (18) is given in Fig. 8(a); this radius is independent of temperature since the increase in a is cancelled by the decrease in the probability 1-p d of the reaction. The model, therefore, predicts that bulk rxn. (2) is diffusion controlled, contrary to the results of ref. [16]. It is not presently clear, whether this discrepancy is significant. The estimates by Elliot and Ouellette [16] were obtained from a global fit to a complex kinetic scheme that involved >5 other reactions occurring on the same time scale.

We now turn to the discussion of the figures given in the first section of the paper for the velocity curves in the various materials. For the airvelocity curve Geiger deduced from his results the formula V3 = aR, where V is the velocity, a a constant and R the range of the a-particles emerging from the absorbing foil.

The electric field E(t) = −∂ A/∂t and the vector potential A(t) of such a pulse are depicted in figure 1(a). At time near 'a' where the electric field strength is large, an electron is released by tunneling ionization. Schematically, this electron is first accelerated to the right ( figure 1(b)), but it may be driven back in the next half cycle to recollide with the target ion, at time near 'b'. At the time of recollision near 'b', the returning electrons have energies of about 3.17 U P . Here U P is the ponderomotive energy, i.e. the mean quiver energy of an electron in a laser field. For electrons that are rescattered into the forward directions (the left-side of figure 1(b)) by the target ion, they will be decelerated by the laser field in the next half cycle and emerge at low energies. These rescattered electrons would carry structural information on the target. However, low-energy electrons on this side are also generated by tunneling ionization near 'a', about half a cycle after 'a'. These electrons would have energies up to about 2 U P , and would interfere with the forward rescattered electrons to damage the diffraction images. On the other hand, electrons that are rescattered into the backward directions will be accelerated by the laser field in the next half cycle and end up at much higher energies of up to about 10 U P [12]. In LIEM, we analyze only the momentum images of these high-energy electrons that have been rescattered into the backward directions. Their momentum images are not complicated by the laser field, and differential elastic scattering cross-sections of the ion by free electrons can be extracted. We note that these high-energy electrons have been observed previously [13]. In the calculated laserinduced electron momentum spectra of H 2 + , clear diffraction minima have also been identified at high energies [8]. These high-energy electrons are well understood as due to backscattering of the returning electrons in the laser field [12]. In this paper, we demonstrate quantitatively that it is possible to extract differential elastic scattering cross-sections by free electrons from these laser-induced high-energy electrons. The extracted quantities are independent of the lasers and they form the basis of LIEM.",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter. Y/n. This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

That is not to say that the quality of the work is not high, I think it is! Specific comments: In figure 2a I need a discussion on why ε_(SB) = 0.87 eV is used. If within, the time available between the pump and probe pulse, intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) takes place, energy will be transferred to vibrations, which then is not available for the outgoing electron. Thus, the red arrow (upper left in figure 2a) could start on the S1 curve as well and hence give an ε_(SB) which is about 0.4 eV lower than 0.87 eV. The same goes for figure 2b. I think this needs a comment in the paper at least. To see if IVR has fully occurred, one could look at the kinetic-energy spectrum after for example 100 ps.\n\nWe have included a discussion of this (as also suggested by reviewer #1). We chose to retain the internal energy (i.e. \"ignore\" IVR) as we state that this will give the maximum energy. The maximum is expected at lower energy in agreement with our data. We have clarified this point by also explicitly stating the expected energy from the bottom of the potential. We agree that IVR will occur after 100 ps, but we really want to focus here on the first picosecond over which the initial isomerisation dynamics occur. The data over longer timescales are of poorer quality and do not actually show much spectral evolution.",

In this approach, the generated gated electron pulse duration is limited only by the gating laser pulse, which could be on the attosecond time scale [27]. This approach might eventually lead to the generation of isolated attosecond electron pulses and could open the way for establishing a new \"Attomicroscopy\" field [26]. It will allow the realtime imaging of electronic motion as theoretically studied in atoms, molecules [28], and condensed matter [29], which could radically change our insight into the workings of the microcosm and could hold the promise for breaking new grounds in a number of fields of science and technology.\n\nThis review article provides an overview of the developments in the fields of time-resolved electron diffraction and microscopy. The article is structured as follows. After the introduction in Section I, Sections II-IV discuss the basic principles of UED, UEM, and SUEM, respectively. Then, some of the main applications of these tools that have been reported are discussed in Section V. In addition, Section VI presents the recent advancements in the electron source developments, which enhance both the temporal and spatial resolutions. In Section VII, the photon-electron interaction and the \"optical gating\" approach for generating the shortest electron pulse (30 fs) in UEM with sufficient intensity to image the ultrafast dynamics of matter are explained.

To evaluate Eq. 33 we have used adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature 58 . During the evaluation, the temperature used to calculate the derivative of the Fermi function ∂f ∂ is set to 100 K to bypass the singularity encountered at 0 K. In doing so, we have verified that the value of the friction coefficient is largely independent of temperature below room temperature. In Fig. 9, we present the kinetic energy loss observed after scattering has occurred. The results of the IESH simulations in the top panel can be directly compared to the MDEF results in the bottom panel. First, it is interesting to consider the qualitative trends that appear in both IESH and MDEF simulations. With incident energy below 0.5 eV, both methods predict adiabatic dynamics, where the collision is completely elastic. However, upon increasing the kinetic energy from 0.5 eV to 3 eV, all values of Γ display a monotonic increase in energy lost to the electronic subsystem. The initial onset of the monotonic increase depends to the value of Γ, with larger values leading to an onset at lower incidence energies. For all values of Γ greater than 0.02 eV, the shape of the curves is similar between the two methods. After the region of initial increase, the energy loss as a function of incidence energy appears to plateau for larger values of Γ. For smaller values of Γ, the energy loss increases monotonically across the entire range of kinetic energies. The most significant difference between the two methods is the Γ = 0.02 eV result. MDEF describes an energy loss profile that closely follows the Γ = 0.1 eV result and the dashed black line, whereas IESH predicts a smaller energy loss for Γ = 0.02 eV compared to Γ = 0.1 eV. The dashed black line shows the relative kinetic energy loss that corresponds to the particle returning with an energy of exactly 1.83 eV. This would be the case if the particle were to stop at the crossing point between the two diabatic states, lose all kinetic energy, and \"roll back down the hill\" to the starting point. The MDEF",

Shortest isolated electron pulse in UEM\n\nThe temporal resolution in UEM mainly depends on the duration of the electron pulse, which is finite due to the initial energy dispersion and the space-charge effect. In UEM, the typical temporal resolution spans the range from several hundreds of femtoseconds to a few tens of picoseconds, which is insufficient to resolve the faster transient dynamics of matter lasting from few tens to few hundreds of femtoseconds. Hence, the generation of short (few tens of femtoseconds) electron pulses is highly desirable for enhancing the temporal resolution of UEM.  In this work, an ultrafast electron pulse (several hundred femtoseconds) generated by photoemission inside the microscope was temporally gated utilizing a 30 fs visible laser pulse (Fig. 15).\n\nFirst, the temporal profile of the \"original\" electron pulse was characterized by cross-correlation between the \"gating\" visible pulse and the electron pulse. Since the \"gating\" pulse duration is much shorter, the cross-correlation directly reflects the temporal profile of the electron pulse. This is a common technique in electron pulse metrology [152]. The retrieved pulse duration of these \"original\" electron pulses is on the order of 500 fs. Second, for generating the isolated ultrashort \"gated\" electron pulse with maximum counts, the \"gating\" pulse is kept at the optimum temporal overlap (τ qrK = 0 fs) with the 500 fs electron pulse. Finally, the gated electron pulse, with the same temporal profile as the gating pulse, is characterized by using another laser pulse and measuring its cross-correlation temporal profile with the gated electrons. The principle of this measurement is illustrated in Fig. 16(a). The cross-correlation spectrogram ( Fig. 16(c)) was recorded first. Then, the temporal profile of this cross-correlation was retrieved from the spectrogram, which carries the signature of the coupling between the original electron pulse and NIR laser pulse and that between the gated electron pulse and NIR laser pulse. The crosscorrelation temporal profile of the latter is shown in the inset of Fig. 16(b), with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) on the order of 50 fs. Since the NIR pulse duration is 33 fs, the gated electron pulse duration is on the order of 30 fs, similar to the temporal profile of the gating pulse.",

While selecting the mechanism a random number r ' [in (0, 1)] is generated and the mechanism is selected if the relation ( ) > > ( − 1) holds true. If ( ) < , the electron is 'self-scattered'27,28,30,31 which means the state of the electron remains unchanged.Given an 'actual' scattering event occurs, once the phonon mode, final electronic band, and the nature of the scattering are extracted from the NSR table, the next task is to find the final electronic wave-vector. We use a method tactically similar to the one reported for covalent semiconductors29 and we treat the polar phonon mode scatterings separately. Here a brief details of the algorithm is given. Let us consider the initial electron band index is m and wave-vector is ki. First, all the k-points kj in the final band n that satisfy the energy conservation are shortlisted. Next, a further shortlisting is done based on the strict energy and momentum conservation with implementation of phonon dispersion. So this gives a list of final kj points that satisfy both the conservations. Now we exploit the full-band EPI elements and this is where both k and q dependence of the EPI elements are required. Another normalized table, (similar to Eq. 3) is formed based on the product of the local density of states (LDOS) at the potential kjs and EPI strength at the corresponding momentum conserving phonon wave-vector, qj. This is where the polar scattering needs to be taken care of separately. The small-angle preference of the polar mechanisms needs to be properly captured in order to reflect the lower momentum relaxation time compared to corresponding energy relaxation time. This is done with the aid of a separate fine qmesh that exists only near the zone center. Using a random number the normalized table is scanned through like it was done for NSR and a final kj is selected. However, this only gives the grid point in the reciprocal space. The final electron wave-vector could belong to anywhere within the small cube that is represented by this grid point. The scheme to select the final wave-vector within the small",

Increasing the photon energy results in increasing KE of the photoelectrons. When electrons have KE above the universal curve minimum (50 -100 eV), increasing KE leads to a larger IMFP or a deeper probing depth. The low KE range of the universal curve is less studied and also demonstrates less \"universal\" character for different materials and therefore is rarely used for depth profiling of the sample surface.\n\nThe IMFP of squalene, obtained in this work and shown in Fig. 6a, demonstrates predicable decrease for KE between 10 -50 eV. The minimum of IMFP at 50 eV KE corresponds to 0.7 nm, whereas the maximum IMFP value corresponds to 1.6 nm at 11.8 eV KE. There is a 2.3 fold difference between the IMFP values. It would be instructive to compare that value to the high KE range of the universal curve, which is normally used for the depth profiling experiments. For example, for electrons penetrating through a guanine layer, a change of KE by factor of 3 (from 500 to 1500 eV) leads to increase of EAL by the similar factor of 2.4 (from 1.3 to 3.1 nm). 47 Experimentally it might be harder to generate such KE difference because of the need for synchrotron beamlines generating X-rays in broad photon energy range.\n\nNevertheless, for the low KE range studied here, the picture is a bit more complex. For high KE electrons, the EAL is approximately equal to the IMPF, because the effect of elastic scattering is negligible in this energy regime (Fig. 6b, right cartoon). For the low KE electrons the situation dramatically changes, as it was demonstrated above: elastic cross-sections are high, leading to high number of elastic collisions, which may significantly change initial electron directions, essentially decreasing the EAL (Fig. 6b, left cartoon). It is of crucial importance to account for elastic scattering effect when analyzing probing depth of low KE electrons. This may include consideration of number of elastic scattering events (i.e. IMFP/EMFP) as well as directionality of elastic scattering in terms of differential elastic scattering cross-sections.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS",

For imaging and electronenergy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), the Zeiss SESAM microscope 12 was used. This instrument is equipped with an omega-type electron monochromator which allows an energy resolution below 100 meV. This is important for the detection of surface plasmons because the tail of the elastic peak at zero energy loss overlaps with the energy-loss region of surface plasmons. Electron monochromation largely reduces the tail intensity. After passing the thin sample, electrons exhibit a quasi-continuous energy-loss spectrum, dominated by bulk plasmon excitations, but also excitations due to surface plasmons, interband transitions, core-loss excitations, and so forth. Electrons of different energy are dispersed in the in-column MANDOLINE energy filter 13 resulting in an energy-loss spectrum in its energy-dispersive plane. Using a mechanical slit (0.2 eV energy width in our case) electrons of a particular energy loss can be selected and an image is formed only from these electrons. This is known as energy-filtering TEM (EFTEM). By changing the high voltage of the microscope, the selected energy loss is varied, in our case from 0 to 4 eV. This ensures that the electrons passing the energy filter have constant energy and no degradation of the optical properties of the filter takes place. In fact, EFTEM image series are always recorded from high to low energy loss because image intensity increases dramatically toward 0 eV energy loss. By doing so, image artifacts from scintillator afterglow are avoided. The resulting EFTEM image series can be considered as a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions and an energy axis. The EFTEM images are recorded on a 2048 × 2048 pixel CCD camera. For EFTEM, the camera is typically binned by a factor of 4, resulting in 256 × 256 pixel images, in order to reduce noise. Spatial resolution is not affected by binning because of the limitations of resolution mentioned below. Complementary to EFTEM, EELS spectra can be recorded from small areas by focusing the electron beam on a sub-nm spot. Typical spectra of 2048 channels cover an energy range of about 20 eV. Line scans or 2D maps (EELS spectrum images, EELS-SI) are obtained by scanning the spot across the desired line (area). In order to have a",

[23]Finally, we currently work on speeding up the DR even further, using ideas similar to those behind the CD or CHK propagator.\n\n\nConclusion",

In the LIFT analysis, F m is represented by F m−FRR as the averaged ChlF yield of 301st-302nd flashlet. F o is the ChlF yield of the first flashlet ( Fig. 1).

Therefore, thermodynamic calculations for H 2 S/Be 12 O 12 , H 2 S/Mg 12 O 12 , SO 2 /Be 12 O 12 , and SO 2 /Mg 12 O 12 complexes have been performed in the temperature range 300-700 K.

Moreover, at the end of the time, there is a trivial deformation in the geometrical structure of the SO2/Be12O12 and SO2/Mg12O12 complexes.

Previous NMR diffusion experiments have demonstrated that the stacking behaviour of G-quartets and thus the length of the stacks are not modulated by temperature in the range between 278 and 298 K 32 . To yield information about the thermal stability of the hydrogen bonds formed in dimers and G-quartets of 5′-GMP, we performed temperature-dependent FTIR measurements for 0.48 M Na 2 5′-GMP at pH 8 (Fig. 2). IR spectra of both the carbonyl band and the ring vibrations change markedly with increasing temperature, indicating dissociation of the dimers and G-quartets (Fig. 2a). Upon temperature increase, the carbonyl band shifts from 1673 to 1657 cm −1 and broadens. In the case of the ring vibrations, the band intensities at 1592 and 1537 cm −1 decrease at elevated temperatures, whereas the bands at 1582 and 1568 cm −1 show increased intensities and slight red shifts. To better describe the \"melting\" behaviour, we plotted the band intensities at 1673, 1592, 1568 and 1537 cm −1 as a function of temperature (Fig. 2b). The \"melting\" curves follow the same course, indicating that any of those bands can be used to follow the self-association of 5′-GMP. Assuming an apparent thermodynamic equilibrium between all the hydrogen-bonded and the monomer stacks, a global Boltzmann fit of the IR data was performed. We obtained a melting temperature of T m = 281 ± 2 K and a standard-state van't Hoff enthalpy change of ∆H vH 0 = 124 ± 8 kJ mol −1 for the dissociation reaction of Na 2 5′-GMP. In this thermodynamic model, the contribution of 5′-GMP monomers not participating in the self-association reaction, are not considered in the initial plateau values. Using 1 H NMR, we obtained comparable trends by analyzing the temperature-dependent population distribution of the monomer, dimer and G-quartet species (Fig. 2c).

Testing\n\nIn order to confirm that the signal truly reflects the heat capacity, it should obey the frequency dependence described by the general formula given in Ref. [5]. However, the simplified Eq.(1) describes well the signal as can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2. At low temperature (4.2 K) and pressure (0.7 GPa) the cut-off frequency is ≈ 450 Hz; the working frequency was chosen to be slightly higher, keeping in mind that the signal decreases with ω. Changing the temperature and the pressure influences the cut-off frequency: from 1 to 4 K we worked in the range 600-1000 Hz, and from 4 to 12 K between 2000 and 4000 Hz. The specific heat of the sample is certainly the main contribution to the signal. This follows implicitly from the fact that the frequency dependence is well described by Eq.(1) without any correction. However, a convincing argument is presented in Fig. 2, where the specific heat measured at ambient and low pressure (0.7 GPa) are compared. The former curve was obtained with a conventional relaxation technique using a comparatively large sample (14 mg) [9,14] whereas the investigated samples each had a mass of ≈ 10 µg. The phase transitions are clearly visible. They are also detectable with the ac-technique at 0.7 GPa, but slightly shifted in temperature as expected from the phase diagram [6,9,10,11,12]. The height of the specific heat jump at the second order transition (T N ≈ 9 K) represents 47% of the total signal compared to 51% for the ambient pressure curve. This indicates that the heat capacity measured under pressure is in majority the heat capacity of the sample.",

The terms in the backgrounds for each property are at most third order in temperature or in pressure.

The mass stoichiometric yield coefficient α 2 is increasing from about 0.2 above 300 K and approaching unity around 250 K. α 2 shows much stronger  temperature dependence than α 1 and a different functional dependence. The temperature dependence for α 1 can be approximated with a linear fit while for α 2 an almost exponential behaviour can be fitted. The physical meaning behind this is however not established. The following parameterisations of the mass stoichiometric yield coefficients (α i ) were derived from the individual experiments for the temperature range between 243 and 313 K and for humid conditions:  The sum of α 1 and α 2 may approach a maximum value of 1.25 at 243 K if we assume an average molar mass for the SOA of 171 g mol −1 , i.e. a SOA composition of 17% product 1 with 186 g mol −1 and of 83% product 2 with 168 g mol −1 . Please note that at 243 K the SOA yield is at its theoretical limit and the exponential fit exceeds this limit by about 10%. However, considering estimated uncertainties of about ±30% for the mass stoichiometric yield coefficients a further interpretation is not reasonable. The value obtained in this work for α 1 =0.11 at 302 K is significantly lower than the value of α 1 =0.239 reported by Cocker et al.

Then, assuming ideal behavior on the part o f all species, and knowing the equilibrium S 0 3 partial pressures or activities, it is possible to calculate the ideal solution behavior of V20 5 for each S 0 3 pressure and temperature on the basis o f the relationships: AG° = -RT InK [10] and, where K is the equilibrium constant, ( a Na2S04) ( a V2C>5) K = ________________ [11] ( a N a V 0 3) 2 ( a S 0 3)\n\nIn addition, noting that the S 0 3 concentration is below 10'3 in the melt and negligible in terms o f mole-fraction calculation, one can use the equilibrium weight gain data to determine the experimental V20 5 concentration produced for each set o f conditions. This allows a comparison between the ideal and experimental solution behavior for V20 5 at 700° and 800°C, as shown in Fig. 6 . Note, however, that while this comparison is useful for showing that V20 5 deviates significantly from ideal behavior, it provides no information as to the actual V20 5 activity.  Fig. 5 are smoothly monotonic, and show no sign o f a step-wise break in slope. This implies, assuming our analogy is correct, that no strong association or dissociation is occurring in the given V20 5 -Na2S0 4 -NaV0 3 system within the S 0 3 activity range being investigated.\n\n\nObservations Concerning Association in the\n\n\nReaction o f ImO? with SCX-NaV(X The reaction of ln20 3 with S 0 3-N aV 03 was investigated by experiments similar to those above, but with 0.10 mmols of ln20 3 added.

However, the comparison with the gas kinetic rates (see Fig.  7) shows that the Gökçen rate exceeds the limiting gas-kinetic rate at lower temperatures (below 200K). It has been replaced by the detailed balancing for the rate from Rohrig [24], obtained in the temperature   range T=2,200-2,600K). The obtained rate remains physically consistent at lower temperatures, down to almost 100K (see Fig. 7 for a comparison with the former Gökçen rate). The Arrhenius fit to the new rate yields an activation energy of −1,560K, showing that the pre-exponential factor A of the former Gökçen rate was over-estimated.  In the case of reaction 23 (CN+C→C 2 +N), the rate exceeds the detailed balance of the reverse gaskinetic rate, which means that the reverse reaction will be overestimated in the lower temperature ranges (in a way similar to rate 18). The rate has been replaced by the one proposed by Slack [25]. Fig. 8 shows a comparison between these different rates.",

One such quantity is H o (298.15 K)-H o (0 K), the standard molar enthalpy increment (standard integrated heat capacity) of H 2 16 O between 298.15 and 0 K [H o (0 K) = 0.0 J mol −1 ]. This value is given for water in the official CODATA compilation 10 as 9.905 ± 0.005 kJ mol −1 . Naturally, the value we compute, 9.904 04 ± 0.000 01 kJ mol −1 , falls within the uncertainty of the old value, but it is more accurate by about two orders of magnitude. The newly determined value is insensitive to any reasonable change in the energy levels; the value is completely determined by energy levels lower than about 5000 cm −1 , and, notably, even the present first-principles PoKaZaTeL energy levels yield the same value though with higher uncertainty. While the present suggested change in the standard molar enthalpy increment of H 2 16 O is more or less inconsequential for most thermochemistry, as enthalpies of formation cannot be determined with this exceedingly small uncertainty, it nevertheless exemplifies the fact that it is more and more realistic to use high-resolution spectroscopic data to directly calculate thermodynamic quantities with minuscule uncertainties.\n\n\nThe low-temperature limit",

The SI unit for specific heat is joules per Kelvin per kilogram (J/K/kg, J/ (kg K), J K −1 kg −1 , etc.) For specific heat capacity, we can write:\nCP = dQ dT · 1 m(5)\nThese definitions were only valid in the absence of chemical reactions and/or phase transitions. Nowadays, this concept has been expanded. In the absence of phase transitions and chemical reactions, c p is referred to as the baseline c p . The deviation caused by phase transitions and chemical reactions is valid the excess c p and the sum of both is known as the total specific heat capacity.

Experimental heat capacities are tabulated in Table S1. Figure 2 shows the representative data of the experimental heat capacities of crystalline D-sorbose together with those of L-sorbose [7]. Despite a much smaller amount of the sample used in this study, the two sets of experimental data exhibited excellent consistency except for the temperature intervals between successive data points. The difference reflected the improvement of the adiabatic heat capacity calorimetry. The coincidence confirmed the equivalence of two forms in the isolated state. Smoothing experimental data and integration over the smoothed curve in the appropriate manner yielded standard thermodynamic quantities (such as enthalpy and entropy) relative to 298.15 K under a constant pressure of around 10 5 Pa. These quantities are tabulated in Table S2. The reason why the reference state was not absolute zero is noteworthy. As explained in detail later, the crystalline sorbose exhibited a glass transition around 120 K, below which the crystal was out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Although the deviation from the supposed \"equilibrium\" was probably small, judging from the fact that no appreciable disorder was detected even at 100 K, it was logically incorrect to treat absolute zero as the reference state with vanishing entropy. Concerning the reason the derived quantities may be treated as those under constant pressure despite varying pressure during measurements, a note from [11] is useful.",

A detailed description of the calculation of C p from ΔT is available in Cp from ΔT. In Fig. 5 we observe that C p increases by almost a factor of 3 across the temperatures measured, rising from 75 J/mol/K at room temperature to about 218 ± 10 (SE, SEM) J=mol=K at 228.9 K. On further cooling to 228.5 K, there is a drop in the specific-heat capacity to an average value of 175 ± 14 (SEM) J=mol=K. This decrease in C p is observed for two independent measurements. Dataset 3 has the best spatial overlap and the coldest temperatures in the current experiment. In this dataset, we check for instrument drift with respect to time by returning to certain temperatures and repeating the measurements. Both measurements at 228.9 K result in higher C p than for the two measurements at 228.5 K.\n\nThe two-state model of water (28) shows a similar value at the maximum in water's specific heat capacity but the maximum is at ∼226 K. The maximum for our data is at 229.2 ± 1 (SEM) K, as averaged from the C p maximum from ΔT Q1 and ΔT area . An earlier study (13) using an almost identical experimental setup to measure water's κ T showed a maximum at 229.2 ± 1 (SEM) K. This temperature reported earlier was based on an extrapolated estimate of C p below 236 K as input to the Knudsen evaporative cooling model. This study gives a value of C p that is higher than previous estimates, resulting in a revised temperature of the κ T and ξ maxima (13) which is higher by 0.8 K. We also mention here that estimating C p is an iterative process because the first estimates of C p are used as an input in the Knudsen evaporation model, which subsequently yields new estimates of T and C p until self-consistency occurs within 0.05 K.",

Figure 2 displays the power required to maintain a temperature of 400 °C in CO pressures ranging from 10 -5 -10 Torr. A temperature of 400 °C provides an upper bound on heat lost from the furnace. The required amount of power was measured experimentally and is plotted in orange circles. The flat, dashed blue line depicts the simulated heat lost when no conductivity adjustment is implemented. One can see that the unadjusted case shows no pressure dependence on power loss and thus disagrees badly with the experimental measurements shown in orange.

It almost reaches a value of one at the collinear orientation for relative velocities ≤ 25 m/s, and decreases to 60% when going towards the T-shaped arrangement. However, for relative velocities below 12.5 m/s the probability reaches values ≥ 80% independent of the orientation.\nP (v, θ) = {[P C (v) + P T (v)] + [P C (v) − P T (v)](3cos 2 θ − 1)}/3.(9)",

In the metallic limit, when the level spacing is small compared to the temperature, the distribution tends towards the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, as expected. When the temperature is comparable or smaller than the level spacing, the distribution deviates significantly. Its limiting behaviour is well described by another Fermi-Dirac distribution function with an effective temperature which is half the real temperature.

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

The peaks in the density of states seen in Figure 1 are in good agreement with the analytic eigenvalues at E/hω = .488, 1.40 and 2.21. The finite widths of the peaks are a result of the gaussian representation of the delta functions and the finite number of Fourier coefficients used.

We calibrated the calorimeter using benzoic acid to determine the average energy equivalent (EE), which was 542.5863 ± 2.1002 cal/°C. We combusted pellets of each standard in 440 psi of O 2 inside the bomb, limiting pellet mass to 0.07 -0.23 g to prevent the release of greater than 1200 cal. We calculated the heat of combustion (cal/g) of each standard by monitoring the temperature rise of the water surrounding the bomb. We inspected each run for signs of an incomplete combustion (i.e., soot), and discarded these data. We performed a minimum of 3 complete combustions for each standard and corrected each sample for heat liberated due to the combustion of the fuse wire and formation of nitric acid. To account for heat released due to the formation of nitric acid from the N 2 gas in the bomb chamber, we applied a nitric acid correction of 1.5 cal [Parr-Instrument-Company, 2004] to all runs on samples which did not contain N. When samples did contain N, we determined the nitric acid correction by titrating the bomb washings with $0.07 N Na 2 CO 3 [Parr- Instrument-Company, 2004]. None of the standards used contained sulfur, so no sulfur correction was necessary.\n\n\nSamples\n\n[27] We purchased all chemical standards from commercial suppliers (Fisher Scientific or VWR International). All chemicals used were at least 98% pure; most were at least 99.5% pure. We stored standards and biomass samples in a dessicator when not in use. We put aliquots of standards and biomass in a drying oven at 50°C overnight prior to analysis.\n\n\nResults and Discussion",

The last difference was the quality of the mixing preparation. A coffee grinder was used in the experiment for this study when the authors of the work used only mortar and pestle, leading to poorer quality propellants in comparison to the coffee grinder used to prepare mixtures for the experiment's purposes.\n\n\nReliability of Sources\n\nThe sources included in this paper include books, previous studies, journals, and  Table 4.\n\n\nIt is suggested that there is a correlation between IHD and heat of combustion in \"Fuel-Oxidizer\n\nMixtures: Their Stabilities and Burn Characteristics.\" Table 4 \n\n\nMethod of data collection in the experiment\n\nChemicals (KNO3 and carbohydrates) are weighted using digital scale (uncertainty ± 0.0005g). They're well mixed with each other and grinded to a fine texture using coffee grinder.\n\nThe propellant is heated (and melted) during the common and well-known casting procedure.\n\nHowever, due to the fire risk and the lack of the necessary hardware to maintain the heating plate at a constant temperature, this method of preparation was not adopted. A custom \"casting\" method consisted of inserting 1.0000 gram (+/-0.0005g) of prepared earlier propellant into gelatin capsules (medicine capsules). After that, a hole was bored in the capsule and a pyrotechnic fuse was inserted there to make contact with the propellant. Each capsule was approximately 0.1250 grams (+/-0.0005g) each (mass varied between 0.1220 to 0.1265g).\n\nEnergy released by the capsule itself was approximated at 0.2375J (based on the information that pure gelatin releases 1.9kJ/Kg). This amount of energy is negligible when it comes to enthalpy change in the calorimeter during combustion of the propellant. The fuse was glued to the capsule, so it does not separate while burning. Glue also protects chemicals from reacting with the outside environment. Enthalpy of the fuse was not included in calculations as well because it was identical (or close to identical) for all the trials.",

However, the comparison with the gas kinetic rates (see Fig.  7) shows that the Gökçen rate exceeds the limiting gas-kinetic rate at lower temperatures (below 200K). It has been replaced by the detailed balancing for the rate from Rohrig [24], obtained in the temperature   range T=2,200-2,600K). The obtained rate remains physically consistent at lower temperatures, down to almost 100K (see Fig. 7 for a comparison with the former Gökçen rate). The Arrhenius fit to the new rate yields an activation energy of −1,560K, showing that the pre-exponential factor A of the former Gökçen rate was over-estimated.  In the case of reaction 23 (CN+C→C 2 +N), the rate exceeds the detailed balance of the reverse gaskinetic rate, which means that the reverse reaction will be overestimated in the lower temperature ranges (in a way similar to rate 18). The rate has been replaced by the one proposed by Slack [25]. Fig. 8 shows a comparison between these different rates.",

It would at any rate provide an estimate of the order of magnitude of the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex. Experiments designed to obtain such information were performed. As in all previous instances where it was desired to study the oxidation of gaiactose, well dissimilated cultures were used, both to lower the endogenous respiration and to extend the preadaptive period. Fig. 9 gives a typical rate-concentration curve of an unadapted culture oxidizing galactose. For purposes of comparison there are included similar curves for an adapted culture oxidizing in one case galactose and in the other glucose. It is immediately evident that the nature of the response of the respiratory rate in an unadapted culture to increasing concentrations of galactose is entirely different from that of an adapted one oxidizing either this hexose or glucose. A much higher concentration is required in the unadapted culture in order to arrive at the maximal rate of respiration. Unlike the adapted culture, the unadapted one responds over a very wide range of concentrations to increasing amounts of galactose. It is seen that, comparatively, there is relatively little difference in the behavior of the adapted culture with galactose and glucose insofar as concerns the concentration necessary to arrive at the maximal activity.\n\nThe behavior of the unadapted culture is consistent with the interpretation that the enzyme involved has a relatively low combining capacity for galactose. Measurements of the dissociation constant, according to the procedure of Lineweaver and Burk (26), would tend to bear this out. It was found that galactose being oxidized by an adapted culture gave a value of 0.0045. The same culture oxidizing glucose yielded a value of 0.0025. However, an unadapted culture oxidizing galactose resulted in a dissociation constant of 0.0385 which indicates a more than tenfold difference between the combining capacities of adapted and unadapted cultures for galactose. \n\n\nThe Oxidation of Sugars by Non-Adaptable Slrains",

In experiments conducted at pH values below 9, samples were sealed under argon in quartz tubes (3 mm ID, 4 mm OD). At timed intervals, samples were cooled and diluted 50-fold with D 2 O to which pyrazine had been added as an internal integration standard. Proton NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cold probe. The decomposition of sucrose, trehalose, and glucose was monitored by following the disappearance of the anomeric proton resonances at ∼4.2 ppm, while the decomposition of fructose was followed by monitoring the disappearance of a multiplet 7 at 3.5 ppm. In potassium phosphate (0.1 M, pH 8.1) or potassium carbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 10.3), the decomposition of each of these molecules followed simple first order kinetics to at least 95% completion under all conditions examined.\n\nFor sucrose, trehalose, glucose, and fructose, the rates of decomposition observed at various temperatures yielded linear Arrhenius plots ( Figure 1) with a least-squares regression coefficient of r 2 g 0.97 and n g 7.

According to Mortola 47 a good average for mammals is ΔT ~ 5 °C. Averaging for T e ranging between 15 °C and 30 °C, and for T s being 1 to 10 degrees higher than T e , h R gives values between 5.5 and 6.5, thus we take h R ≈ 6 as an average. This yields k′ ≈ 3 in SI units, for which Q(W) = k′M 2/3 ≈ 3M 2/3 (kg). Transforming into appropriate units Q(kJ/h) ≈ 0.1M 2/3 (g), i.e. k′ ≈ 0.1. Note that this estimation depends on several empirical variables that show variability, so this number should be taken with caution (performing a parametric analysis of k′ for a range of plausible values: d ∈ [5,7], h C ∈ [3,4], T e ∈ [280, 300], T s ∈ [T e + 1,T e + 10] we find however 〈k′〉 ≈ 0.1 so the approximation is robust). Note that k′ > b but of similar order of magnitude, as previously required. Since b = k′(1 − f) ≈ 0.079, our simple approximation predicts an estimated f ≈ 0.21, and the efficient energy metabolic consumption per mass unit k = a/f ≈ 0.0076 kJ/ hg. Now, whereas (to the best of our knowledge) there are no accurate direct experimental estimates for f in the literature, our prediction can still be tested against experimental evidence in the following terms. The principal sources of heat in the organism of mammals are the synthesis of ATP through the oxidation of nutrients 48 , and the subsequent use of this ATP as energy source for other biological reactions. Animal ATP is generated inside mitochondria mainly via oxidative phosphorylation, or cellular respiration. It has been estimated 49 that this pathway actually produces more that 90% of ATP.

The samples and materials used were placed in a platinum crucible and 0.0001 dm 3 of deionized water was added to ensure the thermodynamic equilibrium at the end of the combustion process. The bomb was purged five times with oxygen of high purity (x = 0.99999) and then filled to a pressure of 3.04 MPa. The water of the isothermal jacket of the calorimeter system was maintained and regulated at a constant temperature of 298.15 K by a refrigerated circulator Polyscience 9502 (PolyScience, IL, USA). The masses of the samples, cotton thread, auxiliary material, crucible and platinum wire were weighed on a DV215CD balance (Ohaus, Parsippany, NJ, USA) (accuracy ±0.01 mg). The electrical energy for the ignition of the sample was supplied with a 2901 Parr ignition unity, which provides 4.184 J to a platinum fuse wire attached to the sample by a cotton thread. The cotton thread used has a massic energy of combustion of ∆ c u o = −(16,945.2 ± 4.2) J·g −1 , and an empirical formula of C 1 H 1.742 O 0.901 [35].

Data collection and analysis were done in a Hitachi U-2000 double-beam spectrophotometer equipped with a signal processing and control system that allows the calculation of rates of reaction using the time scan procedure. The assay media were the same used in the calorimetric experiments with the addition of G6PD (2.0 units/ml) and NAD ϩ (1.0 mM). The reactions were started by the addition of Hxk1 or Hxk2. The results were corrected for the dilution caused by the addition of G6PD and NAD ϩ , absent in the calorimetric reactions. Enzymatic rates were determined by non-linear least square fits of the exponential growth of product formed with time, by monitoring the A 340 as a function of time.\n\nSpectrophotometric Determination of Glucose 6-Phosphate-The amount of Glc-6-P formed in the reactions at the calorimeter was determined in parallel to the calorimetric measurements with an aliquot of the same volume of reaction medium used in the calorimetric cell (1.38 ml). The reaction was started after equilibrating the reaction medium in a water bath at 25.0 Ϯ 0.3°C at the same time as the reaction in the calorimeter cell was started by adding the same amount of hexokinase as that injected into the cell. After reaching the baseline and before the second injection in the calorimeter, the test tube was removed from the bath and placed in boiling water for 1 min in order to stop the reaction. It was then transferred to ice for at least 10 min before addition of G6PD and NAD ϩ . After 20 min at 25.0 Ϯ 0.2°C, the amount of Glc-6-P was determined by measuring the A 340 , considering that for each Glc-6-P, one NADH is formed.

[19] The calorimetric system was calibrated using benzoic acid provided by NIST, having a massic energy of combustion of (− 26434 ± 3) J.g-1. Seven repetitions were made using aboout 1 g of benzoic acid in pellet form. The energy equivalent obtained was, ε (calor) = (9.7995 ± 0.0031) kJ·K -1 ; here the uncertainy corresponds to the standard deviation of the mean. The combustion experiments were carried out in pellet form using a platinum crucible. For all the combustion experiments, the apparent masses of the pellets, the cotton thread, the crucible and platinum wire were measured using a balance (Radwag AS 60/220/C/2 series, accuracy ± 0.01 mg). The apparent mass corrections were also applied. All the combustion experiments were carried out in the presence of 1 mL of demineralized water and 3.04 MPa of oxygen (mass fraction=0.99999) from Praxair. Five repetitions were performed for each compound. The aqueous phase obtained in the bomb after the combustion experiments of all compounds was collected to quantify the HNO3 formed during the reaction. This solution was transferred to a flask and diluted with distilled water to 50.0 cm 3 . The amount of HNO3 formed during the reactions was determined by titration with standardized 0.01M NaOH (aq). [20] Cotton thread was used as a fuse wire in all the combustions experiments, its empirical formula was determined with a LECO TruSpec micro elemental analyzer. The internal molar energy of cotton was determined experimentaly, ∆°( ) = -(461.14 ± 0.60) kJ·mol -1 .\n\nThe details of the combustion experiments of calibration and cotton thread are shown in the supporting information.\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry",

Although I believe that the authors present here is a robust study and that the interpretations drawn by the authors are consistent, this manuscript is not suitable for the broad audience of Nature Communications. I would rather recommend this manuscript to be submitted to a more specialized journal in chemistry or astrophysics. First of all, the manuscript is very focused on chemistry and astrobiology, see for instance the figures, all being chromatograms and mass spectra. Secondly, the manuscript does not contain significantly novel results or conclusions that would fit with the editorial recommendations of Nature Communications. Indeed, the important discovery that sugar and their derivatives can be synthesized by UV irradiation of ices has been already published elsewhere (Meinert et al. in 2016, cited by the authors). The main point of the authors here is that they identified 2-deoxyribose while Meinert et al. did not; although Meinert et al. reported ribose. I do not see where the novelty is; finding deoxysugars on top of sugars in ice experiments does not constitute, to my sense, a major breakthrough. A chemical mechanism for the formation of all the sugars in ice experiments would be new, but unfortunately, as the authors declare at lines 159-161, the mechanism remains unclear.\n\nWe thank the Reviewer for mentioning that our study and the interpretation of its results in our manuscript were robust and consistent. Short scientific papers cannot always target the broadest audience possible, as it is the case in journals such as Nature Communications and other Nature journals. Thousands of papers are published in such journals and describe very specific research restricted to specific field, but this does not mean they are not targeting a broader readership. One example is the Cooper et al. (2001) paper, published in Nature and cited several times in our manuscript, in which the figures were all chromatograms and mass spectra of meteoritic samples, but whose results has an impact for a broad scientific community. We believe our manuscript also targets a broad audience among the scientific community, because our work is related astrobiology and to the origin of life. Reviewers #1 and #2 seem to agree with us.\n\nRegarding the formation mechanism(s), we invite the Reviewer to read our answer to Reviewer #1's comment 2, where we address this question in detail.",

For example, the fructose-bisphosphate aldolase reaction-fructose 1,6-P dihydroxyacetone-P + glyceraldehyde 3-P-has a r G • of 23 kJ/mol and a K of 9.23×10 −5 (Alberty, 2003). This might be considered irreversible (i.e. always flowing in the backward direction), but when the three reactants are at a concentration of 100 μM, a typical intracellular concentration for metabolites (Bennett et al., 2009), the r G is about 0.2 kJ/mol, very close to zero. The reason for the huge difference is due to the fact that this reaction has a different number of products and substrates, and in low-enough concentrations, the effect of the reaction quotient (Q ) on r G is significant. Therefore, any reversibility index should properly account for this stoichiometric effect. Furthermore, if a reaction involves many substrates and products, the dynamic range of r G • given the physiological metabolite concentrations can be much wider. That is, a reaction with one substrate and one product with r G • = 30 kJ/mol is much more irreversible than a reaction with three substrates, three products and the same r G • .",

We can still use the original a, b boxes as references, and compute the changes in T a on going from the isolated a box to the a box-in-the-box situation.

The initial state occupies only a small central region in the simulation box. The contour plots in the main part of the figure show the evolution, both in the centre part of the simulation box (the box bordered in green) and a larger region encompassing the centre and the region to the right (the box bordered in blue). The pink region, constituting the outermost 50% of the simulation box in both the x and y directions, is the region that is monitored by weak measurements.\n\nThe figure also shows the cumulative probability that the particle will indeed have 'escaped' i.e. that it will have been measured to be in the pink region.

Since the potential energy V(x) is zero inside the box with dimension L (V(x)=0, 0<x<L) and V(x) is infinite at the walls of the box (V(x)= ∞ , x<0 or x>L) then the Schrödinger equation (7) will be denoted by the following expression:\nψ ψ − = 2 2 1 ( ) ( ) 2 d\nx E x dx (19) The approximate solution of equation (19), i.e. the wave function, was obtained by setting the following values for the parameters of the GA: population size N=44, recombination rate pr=0.65 and mutation rate pm=0.2 (ps=0.1). The termination criteria was a maximum number of 3200 generations or a fitness value equal or greater than 0.87. For the quantum system the potential energy value was V=0 and E= 0.02. The second quantum system simulated is the quantum harmonic oscillator which allows the study of quantum oscillatory systems, e.g. the vibration of molecules. If the system to be studied is the vibration of a diatomic molecule then the classical idea of a constant spring between the two atoms is used. In such case the potential energy is\n= 2 1 ( ) 2 V x\nx . Using this potential energy value in the Schrödinger equation, we obtain the equation for the harmonic oscillator: (20) Similar to the previous experiment the approximated solution of equation (20) was obtained with the GA by choosing the same parameters and termination criteria.

These equations have even been (approximately) extended to larger systems. However, this problem has been treated in the context of the (integral form) of the HK theorems. Below, the aforementioned differential forms are considered with their connection to the integral forms, which -the author thinksis worth to archive in detail. Consider the case N=1, M1, Z A 1 for ground and excited states. This is where one single electron is in the quantum force field of a nuclear frame. It is not in the general interest, except its M=1 subcase, the H-like atom. The latter is a basic problem in quantum mechanics. Solving it for  via Eq.2.1.1 is fully described in university textbooks; however, it is interesting with respect to solving it for  from the nonlinear equation Eq.2.1.23. From Eq.2.1.1 with =  1 f(r 1 ), multiplying by  from the left, integrating for spin coordinate and considering f as real function ((r 1 )= f 2 (r 1 )), Eq.2.1.23 takes the particular form in this case as D[N=1,(r 1 )]  -(1/4) 1 2 (r 1 ) + (1/8)(r 1 ) -1 | 1 (r 1 )| 2 +(r 1 )v(r 1 ) = E electr (r 1 ) (Eq.2.1.31) where the first two terms containing the nabla operator are an evaluation of the kinetic part D  [N=1,(r 1 )] = -(1/2)f 1 2 f = -(1/2) 1/2  1 2 ",

However, in the jellium and atomistic calculations the integral does not vanish as a consequence of the distortion of the wavefunctions beyond the box borders, indicating that this type of transitions is allowed.The derivation of the transition selection rule for a particle in a 3D infinite well is contrasted with the selection rule of more realistic models in the SI text.Briefly, the results of that analysis can be summarized as follows.The selection rules for an atomistic cluster with a box-like core shape become the following: (i) such transitions are forbidden where, in the direction of the electric field, the number of nodes is changed by an even number, (ii) in addition, such transitions are forbidden, where one other number of nodes changes by an odd number.In combination, this means that for an allowed transition, exactly in one direction (of the three possibilities) the number of nodes changes by an odd number.Thus, the sum of the nodal multiplicities changes by an odd number (since odd+even+even = odd).Since each delocalized state in the atomic cluster has either an even or an odd number of nodes in each direction x, y, z, there are in total 8 combinations.Non-zero transitions between the states can be organized in an octant-shape \"topography map\", see Figure S2 that also demonstrates again the TCM analysis of the 2.11 eV absorption peak when the occupied and empty states are classified by (odd/even ; odd/even ; odd/even) combinations.\n\nAlthough in this work we focus on the particular case of the box-like [Ag67(SR)32(PR3)8] 3+",

This diffusion process occurs in space and in imaginary time, which is actually connected to quantum energy.

This is consistent with the previous treatment since in the forbidden region V is infinitely high. Otherwise it depends on the system selected.\n\nFor example, in the treatment of spherically confined dihydrogen cation H + 2 , one eletron and two protons are placed inside an impenetrable sphere radius r 0 . The two protons (classical) are placed along the x axis, at x = d 2 and x = − d 2 respectively (d being the internuclear distance). Therefore\nV (d, r) = 1 |r − id/2| + 1 |r + id/2| + 1 d + E H(4)\nSome comments on this formula. This is not the value in the potential energy curves, this last is E T which is a function of d and r 0 . i is the x axis versor. It is necessary to include the repulsion energy of the two nuclei which is classical in nature. The addition of E H , which is the ionization energy of the 1s state of H, fixes E T = 0 as the asymptotic value of a free (r 0 → ∞) ion at large d (dissociation limit) in the ground electronic state.\n\nOur approach is simpler than that used in, say, quantum chemistry: we do not use for example the importance sampling technique, which is necessary for many-particle calculations, but adds complexity here. Instead, the initial population of walkers is distributed uniformly in a cube enveloping the barrier. This leads to a sharp start with strong fluctuations in N and E T .\n\nTo reduce the fluctuations, an additional solution is implemented in our codes: when the absolute value of the relative variation (N i − N i−1 )/(N i + N i−1 ) is small enough, in our tests 0.5%, the energy E T is replaced by the mean calculated in a large previous number of time steps.\n\nThis solution is very effective and a stable energy eigenvalues are attained in the limit of long simulation.",

Section 6 is devoted to the analysis of the single-particle-reduced entropy of the system. Finally, the conclusions are drawn.\n\n2 Simulation approach For our calculations, we have employed a multi-configurational self-consistent Green's function (MCSCG) approach [10,11] for a realistic description of discrete resonant states, beyond the mean-field approximation. We make use of a one-band tight-binding description of the channel in the effective mass approximation, represented by a basis of sites 2N localized single-particle spin orbitals. The benefit of the MCSCG approach stems from the self-consistent division of the channel system into a small subsystem of resonantly trapped (relevant) states for which a many-body Fockspace treatment becomes numerically feasible, and the rest of the system which is treated adequately on a conventional mean-field level. The Fock-space description allows for the calculation of few-electron Coulomb charging effects beyond mean-field, as manifested in the Coulomb blockade regime.\n\nIn the following, 1 ρ denotes the single-particle density matrix [14] of the system under non-equilibrium conditions. For the NWFET channel, 1 ρ is a sites\nsites 2 2 N N ¥\nmatrix and is obtained from the NEGF formalism (see Eq. (11) in [10]). The single-particle eigenvectors of 1 ρ are called natural orbitals [14], its eigenvalues are real and within the interval [0 1].\n\n, For the case of a single Slater determinant, 1 ρ would have only eigenvalues 0 and 1.\n\nThe MCSCG approach describes the state of the channel with fluctuating electron number as a weighted mixture of a few relevant many-body states, so-called configurations. In the current approximation, these configurations are assumed to be Slater determinants of resonantly trapped natural orbitals [15]. The corresponding weights are real, restricted to the [0 1]\n\n, interval, and their sum is unity. Thus, the relevant many-body statistical operator consists of a weighted sum of projectors, restricted in our case to a relevant sub-space of the whole Fock-space.",

The basis set used to fit the density [24] consists of a large number of ordinary STOs, instead of BSTOs. Because of the large number of fit functions included, the confined density is in general well described by ordinary STOs. When the confinement radius becomes very small, the diffuse fit functions can lead to numerical instabilities and the most diffuse functions are either removed or replaced by more contracted functions to accurately describe the density of the confined atoms.\n\nThe ground-state xc-potential we use for the confined atom calculations is the statistical average of orbitals potential (SAOP). The SAOP potential is asymptotically correct and has proven to give good HOMO orbital energies and response properties [32].

We treat a model with a similar property (spontaneous symmetry breaking) that is related to (1): the nonlinear particle in a box. In Ref. 16 it was shown that a quantum mechanical particle in a box obeying the NLS equation undergoes an spontaneous symmetry breaking in the probability density for a sufficiently large value of the nonlinear potential. The particle is confined either on the left or the right of the box and it is possible to produce tunnelling between the two situations under the presence of an external stochastic potential. The NLS, which is the equivalent to (1) for a continuous system, reads\nγ∇ 2 ψ(r) + β |ψ(r)| 2 ψ(r) = Eψ(r),(4)\nwhere ψ(r) is subject to the boundary conditions ψ(r)| ±a/2 = 0, with a = size of the box. E is the energy and γ < 0, β < 0 are the kinetic energy and self-trapping potential parameters, respectively. The relevant magnitude is the ratio ρ = |γ/β|, fixing the relative strength of both. For small ρ, an spontaneous self-localization of the wavefunction either to the left or the right of the box occurs [16], both sides playing the equivalent roles of the donor-acceptor sites in (1). The continuous model (4) allows the inclusion of an electric field competing with the stability of the self-localized ground state. The presence of an external potential, in the one-dimensional problem, is added to (4) through an additional term on the righthand side of the form:\nV 0 1 − 2x a ψ(x),(5)\nwhere V 0 is a constant, and r ≡ x in this case.

Probability of binding a chaperone of size λ = 1 near the wall in equilibrium can be calculated by its Boltzmann distribution as:\nP λ=1,Eq nw (E ef f ) = ( exp −E ef f 1 + exp −E ef f )(3)\nwhich does not depend on exponential rate α. However, in the case of λ > 1, one should consider the whole partition function Abdolvahab (2016) to calculate the equilibrium probability. Non-equilibrium behaviour in our simulation results and the complexity of translocation of a finite polymer led us to consider the dynamic of the problem in our estimation. To take into account the dynamics of the problem, we pay our attention to the time in which a chaperone stay in its position or the position remain bare of them. Those times can be estimated using the Boltzmann distribution as follows. Assume a chaperone is bound to the polymer near the wall. The time in which the chaperone stay in its place, its dwell time, should be proportional to\nP λ 0 = exp −λE ef f 1+exp\n−λE ef f . We estimate the time in which the chaperone are bound to the polymer with one monomer distance from the wall as P λ\n1 = exp −λE ef f −α 1+exp\n−λE ef f −α .

For simplicity, we assumed the particle had no surface charge. Simulations were carried out for a range of void diameters. The current was determined by the integration of the ionic fluxes passing through the top boundary of the pipette.\nCurrent = ∫ ∑ ⋅ (S8)\nThe current of an open pipette was used to calculate the percentage blockage from the presence of a particle. A calibration plot of normalised current as a function of particle diameter is presented in Figure 4 (inset) in main text. Note, while the axisymmetric simulation restricts us the simulating a particle coaxial with the pipette, simulations of resistive pulses in uniform media have shown that the current varies by only ~15% as the lateral position of the particle is varied. [16] This introduces only relatively minor uncertainties in calculating the nanoparticle diameter.\n\n\nEvaluating the Likelihood of Particle Escape\n\nTo assess the plausibility that a nucleated nanoparticle would exit the nanopipette, we solved the Fokker-Planck equation, which describes the time-varying likelihood (probability density) of finding a particle at a particular position, as a function of time. Such an approach has previously been used to calculate capture efficiencies and distributions of translocation times in nanopore systems. [17,18] We use the flows calculated as described above. The initial condition is that there is 100% likelihood of finding the particle in the small region representing where the nanoparticle forms. This approach is analogous to releasing a cloud of tracer particles of point size, which possess the diffusion characteristics of the particle (calculated from the Stokes-Einstein equation), and watching where they are transported to.\n\nIntegrating the flux of the probability distribution function (PDF) over the aperture of the nanopipette calculates the rate with which the particles leave the pipette. When this is integrated over time, it gives the fraction of particles anticipated to be released.\n\nThe probability density as a function of time for two release locations is shown in Figure S13.",

Here the gap is smaller than for the carborane case evidently because the present strain is less (with an angle off-set of just 1.5\n≈ o , vs. 3.2 ≈ o for our earlier carborane case).\nThere is a simple scheme to aid in the relief of stress --namely to introduceacetylenic linkages between the tetrahedral adamantylunits. That is, each C-C bond between 2 adamantyl building blocks is replaced by an acetylene bridge where the dashed lines on the left & right summarily indicate an adamantane cage. Indeed just such a replacement has been suggested previously, in related contexts: in graphene [14], in cubane [15], in different polyhedranes [16,17] and miscellaneous other carbo-cages [18] (including adamantane). Basically the total stress is reduced because the strain is spread out over3 bonds & 4 bond angles, rather than 1 bond & 2 bond angles, so that with the stress energy quadratic in the strain, the resultant total stress energy should be roughly half as big (from comparing",

[21] the equilibrium crystal structure at density 3 = 5.0 is the diamond structure. In principle, it is possible to think about the structure that we observed as about a strongly distorted diamond structure. In our guessed structure every particle also has 4 nearest neighbors and all these neighbors are at the distance 0.535 from the \"central\" chosen particle. The difference with the diamond structure is in the values of the angles. In the diamond structure all 6 angles associated with the \"central\" atom are equal to 109.5 ∘ . In our guessed structure 2 angles are equal to 82.1 ∘ (one can think about them as about two opposite angles), while the other 4 angles are equal to 124.6 ∘ . Thus the structure that crystallized from the liquid in our simulations is, in some sense, a distorted diamond structure.\n\nFor the density 0 3 = 5.24 the guessed structure, according to the visual analysis, is similar to the one at The symmetry of the solution that the Findsym software [64,65] found for the density 3 = 5.24 is the same as for the density 3 = 5.00. The optimized parameters of the unit cell are: = = 0.6910, while = 1.5987. The comparisons of the PDFs of the crystal structures obtained through the crystallization of liquids with the PDFs calculated on the ideal crystal structures are shown in Fig.6(e,f). It follows from Fig.6(e) that our guess is quite good for the density 0 3 = 5.0 -at least for the first six peaks. On the other hand, in Fig.6(f) there is a splitting of the second peak in the PDF of the crystal structure obtained from the liquids state. Our guessed model, despite being stable on heating, does not capture this splitting. We were not able to come up with a better structural guess and thus, for now, we leave the matter in its current state.",

If not done already, please quantify this for the full dataset (It's not clear to me whether these numbers are averaged from every hexagonal lattice in the dataset or just from the example in Fig. 3B). This analysis is for the entire dataset, otherwise the data would not be sufficient to justify use of Gaussian distributions in the analysis due to the small number of fibrils per CB. We have adjusted the methods text to better reflect this. We do not observe quantifiable variation between carboxysomes, but it's possible that this is due to the combination of a loosely-ordered lattice and a relatively small number of both dependent and independent datapoints rather than a lack of biological variance between CBs.\n\nLine 124, Results: \" We hypothesize that a disordered, lower-occupancy binding partner may maintain a maximum distance and promote tilt between fibrils. Such a linker would likely not be visible in a subtomogram average due to the combination of low occupancy and disorder, especially if there were also disorder in the binding site, causing the system to act as a 'fuzzy complex'. CsoS2 has the appropriate disorder, length and Rubisco binding sites to serve this role.\" -> Wouldn't a low-occupancy disordered linker promote significant flexibility between the Rubisco fibrils instead of this specific spacing and tilt? Perhaps there is a more physical packing explanation for the parameters of the observed hexagonal lattice?\n\nWe have adjusted the text to remove the mention of maximal distance and tilt, as well as other items requested by the other reviewer. Physically, a maximal distance would suffice for our distributions, as the minimal distance is provided by Rubisco itself and Brownian motion would take care of the rest within that confined space. However, we agree that the tilt is more difficult to explain.

Some of these densities are the correct size for carbonic anhydrase, which also is capable of binding Rubisco and was previously found to be shell associated\" -> Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't Blikstad et al. 2021 find that the carbonic anhydrase binds Rubisco and not the shell? I quote from that study: \"This screen showed that CsoSCA interacted with Rubisco, while none of the other carboxysome proteins had detectable binding above background.\" Could these shell-attached densities instead by aggregates of CsoS2, which does interact with the shell? Note that rupture of carboxysomes and resulting exposure of CsoS2 to the buffer would likely result in aggregation.\n\nLine 202, Results: \"roughly 5% of CBs also contain a large enzyme that is consistent in size and shape with a 20S proteasome (Extended Data Figure 5).\" -> This is very interesting, but it doesn't look like a 20S proteasome to me (I stared at many proteasome tomograms during my postdoc). Without a structural average, it's just guesswork, and I understand that there aren't enough particles for a good average. But… It looks quite similar to this archaeal chaperonin (See Fig. 1 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2011.03.005).\n\nLine 218, Discussion: \"We observed three Rubisco packing types in the CBs: sparse, dense and ordered ( Figure 2A).\" -> For clarity, it would be very helpful to include a small supplemental table detailing the number of carboxysomes in the tomograms that were ruptured / intact sparse / intact dense / intact ordered. This information could also be incorporated into Extended Fig. 1, to help readers understand how parameters such as Rubisco concentration correlate with the above classes.",

Figure 3 illustrates the expected crystallite shapes for the four stiffness values examined. At the smallest k a = 0.5, the shape is an octahedron (111) (cyan) truncated at the corners by a cube (100) (purple). As k a increases, the truncation by the octahedron increases, such for k a ≥ 1.5, the shape is essentially octahedral, though a careful inspection shows that the (110) plane (yellow) does slightly truncate the edges. This is also the shape predicted by the broken bond model. The importance of the (111) and (100) planes in the crystallite shape of DNA-functionalized NP lattices with diamond structure has been observed experimentally [31].",

Electronic band structures\n\nOppositely, the 3D carbon phase has a large band gap, indirect, with a value close to 5 eV. This is also observed in the 3D BN phase with a slightly lower band gap of 5 eV. The ionocovalent character brought by the presence of two chemical elements with different electronegativities is exhibited in the band structure of 3D BN where the s s-like bands due to nitrogen are below -15 eV and well separated from the p p block above this energy. Both 3D phases are considered as large band gap insulators, one covalent and the other iono-covalent.\n\n\n3-4. Mechanical properties.\n\nThe assessment of the mechanical properties is based on the elastic properties determined by performing finite distortions of the lattice and deriving the elastic constants from the strainstress relationship.\n\nIn hexagonal symmetry there are six independent elastic stiffness constants C 11 Tables 2b and 3b).\n\nVickers hardness (H V ) was predicted using three contemporary theoretical models of hardness: (i) Mazhnik-Oganov model [15], (ii) Chen-Niu model [16], and (iii) thermodynamic model [17]. The first two models use the elastic properties, while the thermodynamic model is based on crystal structure and thermodynamic properties. Mazhnik-Oganov model was also used for the estimation of fracture toughness (K Ic ). The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3.   Tables 2a and 3a  A slightly higher hardness of rhombohedral carbon compared to diamond (both cubic and hexagonal) is observed for all three models (Table 2a). The similar trend is also found for the dense rhombohedral boron nitride versus cubic and wurtzite polymorphs. A good agreement is observed for the bulk moduli estimated using the thermodynamic model (B 0 ) with the values calculated from the set of elastic constants (B V ).\n\nIn general, both rh-C 2 and rh-BN have superior mechanical properties and thus can be considered as prospective ultra-hard materials [28].\n\n\n4-Conclusion",

Afterwards, we performed geometrical relaxation of the nets using Systre 25 from the Gavrog package (http://gavrog.org/). To this end, we applied the concept of embedding of a net into 3D Euclidean space 25,26 with maximal space-group symmetry compatible with the net topology. Apart from the requirements of maximal symmetry, the nodes of the nets were placed in such a way that the distances to nearest neighbors (that correspond necessarily to the edges of the nets) should be equal, if possible, and then were finally set to 1.54 Å. However, it has long been recognized that not only the distances to nearest neighbors are important, but so are the distances to the next-nearest neighbors (normally referred to as 'non-bonding' distances). 27 For example, in the diamond structure the next-nearest neighbors are by B63% farther than the nearest neighbors of any atom. From the set of geometrically relaxed structures we extracted 665 nets where the distances to the next-nearest neighbours were by 40% longer than the distances to the nearest neighbors. These structures considered as being stereochemically feasible (in the sense of Öhrström and O'Keeffe) 27 were then optimized with the Tersoff force field 28 as implemented in the GULP package. 29 After this force-field calculation, 257 structures remained 4-coordinated and were subject to further optimizations using the density-functionalbased tight-binding method (DFTB) 30 in its non-self-consistent version as implemented in the DFTB+ package. 31 From the set of the DFTB-optimized structures, we selected 93 representatives that lie within a narrow energetic window (0.40 eV per atom) relative to diamond and performed structural relaxation (at the DFT-GGA (PBE) level) 32 using the SIESTA package. 33 The structures that are diamond-lonsdaleite polytypes were excluded from our calculations since they had already been widely discussed in the literature. 34,35 To identify polytypes (altogether 24",

(1977). We determine β using the local velocity gradient as given by our hydrodynamical model along with the local opacity using the Sobolev or large velocity gradient (LVG) approximation (eqn. 3-40 Kalkofen 1984). We use the 6-ray approximation for the angle averaging. We allow for one free scaling parameter on β to match the modeled emission line brightness to the observation. We scale the LVG opacity by 1/2. Because the opacity, column density, and line brightness, are all linearly related, the scaling could be considered to derive from any or any combination of these parameters. Given all the uncertain parameters, for example the mean grain cross-section which also affects the line brightness (appendix B), this factor of 2 is not significant.\n\nAn alternative method to calculate the excitation is the accelerated Λ-iteration algorithm (ALI). We do not know if this method is reliable with the extremely high optical depth, several hundred to a thousand. Λ-iteration generally converges, but whether it converges to the correct solution cannot be determined from the algorithm itself (eqn. 6-33 Mihalas 1978).\n\nThe excitation may be uncertain, but analysis with the escape probability method allows us to understand the effect of the uncertainty. For example, because we know that the dependence of the line brightness on the opacity or optical depth is linear, we can say that any uncertainty in excitation results in the same percentage uncertainty in the abundance of the chemical model, or the pathlength of the structural model.\n\nOnceJ is determined everywhere in the cloud, the equations of statistical equilibrium are solved to determine the emissivity and opacity. These are then used in the radiative transfer equation to produce the simulated spectral line emission and absorption. This calculation is done in MOL-LIE in the same way as ifJ were determined by any other means, for example, by Λ-iteration.",

The shift of the high intensity visibility curve toward the red is explained in terms of Kundt's rule for the progressive shift of the absorption maximum of a substance in solvents of increasing refractive index and density.\n\n5. Assuming Kundt's rule, it is deduced that the absorption spectrum of visual purple as measured directly in water solution should not coincide with its position in the rods, because of the greater density ' and refractive index of the rods. It is then shown that, measured by the position of the visibility curve at low intensities, this shift toward the red actually occurs, and is about 7 or 8 ~# in extent. Examination of the older data consistently confirms this difference of position between the curves representing visibility at low intensities and those representing the absorption spectrum of visual purple in water solution.\n\n6. It is therefore held as a possible hypothesis, capable of direct, experimental verification, that the same substance--visual purple-whose absorption maximum in water solution is at 503 u#, is dissolved in the rods where its absorption maximum is at 511 #u, and in the cones where its maximum is at 554 u~ (or at 540 #~, if macular absorption is taken into account, as indeed it must be).\n\nThe experiments for this paper were performed in the George Holt Physics Laboratory of the University of Liverpool.

Thereby, absorption by other tissue components are neglected. As Figure 2a indicates, a modulation frequency f above 200 Hz would have to be chosen to fulfill the requirement of µa > µs in water, whereas approx. 50 Hz appears sufficient for the epidermis. Usually we used f = 130 Hz for our experiments on skin to warrant µa > µs without unnecessarily reducing the PA signal amplitude which scales with f −3/2 (see Equation (3)). In fact, for a skin configuration of a 20 μm thick stratum corneum layer on top of the epidermis, the optical penetration depth 1/α might exceed 45 μm and one could even consider choosing f down to 20 Hz and could still expect a linear dependence of the PA signal on α. As expected, µ a is independent of f whereas µ s shows the f −1/2 -dependence. The data used for the calculation are given in Table 1 with material constants taken from [25][26][27]. Table 1.

( 14) in turn suggests that when NCP(0, MLD) is maximized ( dNCP(0, MLD) dC = 0), NCP(MLD) is negative (net heterotrophic) and hence the MLD is deeper than Z p (MLD > Z p ).This counterintuitive result is attributable both to the uneven distribution of light availability in the water column (Eq.13) and to water, which absorbs light but does not contribute to biomass accumulation.When the mixed layer is at the Z p , a slight increase in C will lead to negative NCP(MLD) due to decreasing light availability at the base of the mixed layer, but it will increase NCP higher in the water column because of the increase in biomass.The increase in NCP in the shallow parts of the mixed layer therefore overcompensates for the net heterotrophy at the bottom of the mixed layer, thus maximizing the depth-integrated NCP.If light were uniformly distributed in the water column, i.e., I m (0, MLD) = MLD • I m (MLD), and if water did not attenuate light (K w I = 0 in Eq. 11), MLD = Z p would maximize NCP(0, MLD), which is consistent with Huisman and Weissing (1994).We note that in Eq.

To attempt the collection and analysis hardly seems practical. The hypothesis of quantal uncertainty can be shown to lead to sensible results ff we assume a value of g. in the equation above, of 105, a value common among carotenoids at the wave length of maximum absorption.

On the one hand we have receptors such as the human eye, where evolution has conveniently concentrated the photosensitivity pigment. Threshold studies here must deal with the uncertainty of the exact number of quanta contained in any stimulating flash. In similar studies with Metridium, on the other hand, the number of quanta per stimulus is readily determinable with sufficient accuracy, but the uncertainty dement may still be present, since the pigment concentration may be so dilute as to render any adequate determination of it all but impossible.",

The agreement seemed to be fairly good and as the time necessary to make a measurement became an important factor in the later experiments on oxygen consumption, most of my measurements have been made by determining the absorption directly, a much more rapid method. Where two vessels of different thickness were used the B~, values usually come out within 10 per cent of each other, but the thicker vessel always gives the greater value.\n\n(3) Counting the Bacteria.",

While pure fresh water is largely transparent for UV (e.g., Su and Yeh, 1996;Ranjan et al., 2022), Cleaves and Miller demonstrated that UV flux is attenuated down to 1% of the initial value by just 2 mm of ocean water (Cleaves and Miller, 1998). Similar results were obtained in experiments with sedimental waters: the UV light is extinguished to 1% of the incident level by about 1 mm of sedimental waters (Garcia-Pichel and Bebout, 1996), or by water with a 2.5 g/L solution of FeCl 3 (Gómez et al., 2007).

QMC dipole moment of the water monomer and dimerWe have calculated the mean dipole moment, µ, of the water monomer and dimer. The dipole moment operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian and therefore the error in the DMC mixed estimate (µ DMC ) is linear in the error in the wave function. This error can be reduced to a quadratic error by using the so called extrapolated estimator, 2µ DMC −µ VMC , where µ VMC is the VMC estimate of the dipole moment. Both VMC and DMC estimates must, of course, be calculated using the same trial wave function.",

As we have shown, reaction and transition rates can at lowest order be treated as dependent only on some length scale (proportional to a 0 ) and some energy scale (atomic, rotational, or vibrational). Since H 2 has no dipole moment (d = 0), H 2 state transitions are quadrupolar, with the vibrational and rotational Einstein coefficients derived above. We neglect higher moments, which are less important for scattering rates and cooling processes. Lastly, several reaction rates will require the ground state polarizability, a tensor mediating the external electric field and the induced electric dipole moment, p ij ∝ a 3 0 ∝ 1/(m 3 α 3 ). This is straightforward to show for the H atom (see e.g. Sakurai & Napolitano (2017) for a discussion using perturbation theory), but is more complicated for the H 2 molecule (Kołos & Wolniewicz 1967). We have listed the parametric dependence and re-scaling equation for all of the aforementioned quantities in Table 1.\n\n\nAPPLICATION: ROVIBRATIONAL COOLING FOR DARK MOLECULAR HYDROGEN",

The distributions of cos # , where # denotes the angle between the dipole moment vector of the water molecule and the vector normal to the surface, are shown in gure 7 (left).The potential drop resulting from the orientations according to equation (1) agrees in the limits of error with the experimental value for the Pt(100) surface.But the agreement goes further as can be seen from gure 8.There it is demonstrated how the potential drop depends on the degree of coverage of the metal surface.This dependence has not been measured for the Pt(100) surfaces but the simulation shows a similar dependence as determined experimentally for other metals.It seems, therefore, that the potentials derived from the quantum mechanical calculations describe the structure of water near the surface correctly 2].Based on these results it can be expected that the in uence of the Pt(100) surface on the ions and their hydration shells can be calculated from the simulation with a high degree of reliability.For the results reported here a water molecule was replaced either by a Li + or an I ? in the adsorbed layer, instead of a simulation of a LiI solution between two platinum walls.During the simulation time of about 20 ps the ions did not leave the adsorbed layer.This nding can be read from gure 9 where the density pro les for both ions are shown.For comparison also the pro les for the O and H atoms are depicted as dashed lines.They are not signi cantly di erent from that for pure water at the surface ( gure 6).\n\nThe I ?pro le extends only over a very narrow distance range 1:8 < z < 2:4 A. There is no water molecule between the I ?and the surface.Its maximum at 2.0 A coincides with the potential minimum for a position of the iodide ion opposite to a hollow site of the Pt(100) surface ( gure 4), and it is obviously not in uenced by the I ?-water interactions.Therefore, the I ?can be called \"contact adsorbed\" on the Pt(100) surface.",

(2011)  theoretically demonstrated that the molecule stretches and bends with increasing field strength when the molecule's dipole moment is aligned with the external field, further supporting our observed FT-LIED structural changes in water for field strengths of 2.5 -3.8 V/Å.This is due to all electronic states (of the neutral and cation) being Stark-shifted in the presence of an external laser field, and leading to an altered ionization potential of water depending on whether the molecule's dipole moment is aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the electric field.In the case of parallel (anti-parallel)",

The ion-dipole distances denoted as r i−H 2 O and r i−DCE can be taken to be equal to the sum of the ionic radius plus the corresponding molecular radius. The average orientation can be estimated using Langevin's equation L(x) = coth(x) − 1/x with x = Eµ/kT. Thus, the first term on the r.h.s of eq. 13 represents the free energy decrease when the ion is solvated by a water dipole, and the second term represents the corresponding free energy increase due to desolvation of the corresponding part of the organic solvent. The values obtained from this equation are shown in Table 3 for the different ions considered here. As an estimation for the ∆G 0 dip−dip term we consider the free energy change corresponding to the dissolution of water in 1,2-dichloroethane at the saturation concentration, that can in principle be obtained from solubility data of H 2 O in 1, 2 − DCE. Since these solubility values reported in the literature [36] vary between 0.1 M and 10 −3 M, we estimated ∆G 0 dip−dip to be in the range 10 − 30KJ/mol. Whatever the accurate value, we see that within the present approximation practically all the ions considered in Table 3 should prefer solvation with one water molecule to be anhydrous in the organic solvent. Moreover, since the resulting values for ∆G 0 repl = ∆G 0 ion−dip + ∆G 0 dip−dip are of the same order of magnitude that a reasonable calculation or free energy of transfer without hydration would yield, we expect that even solvation with a single water molecule should deliver a meaningful contribution to this process.",

Attempts were made to calculate values of a and b in van der .Waals' equation from these data ; it was found, however, to be impossible, the equation not representing the facts with sufficient accuracy. Taking the simple equation pv = RT R is found to vary about 2 per cent, between -20° and 100°. Compressibility of Ammonia.-By comparing the density at half an atmosphere with that at one atmosphere, the compressibility of ammonia may be determined. The globe, was tilled with ammonia in the usual way, then connected with a pressure-gauge and about half the ammonia pumped out. Next the ammonia was allowed to blow off until equilibrium had been attained, when the pressure was immediately read. The readings were made on a mirror scale, the barometer standing in the same trough being read at the same time (see fig. II). Owing to the difficulty of reading the pressure and maintaining its constancy, no great accuracy was attained; the probable error is about 0 2 mm. As before stated, we cannot claim any great accuracy for this result, and we prefer to make use of Lord Rayleigh's number in proceeding to calculate the molecular weight of ammonia, the method and apparatus used by him being specially adapted to the purpose.* Lord Rayleigh found B = 1*00632 at 9°*7, which, corrected in the way indicated by him, becomes 1*00706 at 0°.\n\nThis gives a = -0*01413, and the correction factor The density calculated from Rayleigh's value for the compressibility (B = T00706) is 0*38272. The partial pressure of the ammonia in the above table is obtained by subtracting the partial pressure of the air (calculated from its weight) from the total pressure. I t will be seen that the density is nearly one part in 1000 higher than that calculated from the compressibility, and this represents the deviation from Dalton's law of a mixture of approximately equal volumes of ammonia and air.",

Between 0° and -20° the coefficient was 0*004003, and between 0° and 98° it was 0*003802.The expenses incurred in the above research have been defrayed by a grant from the Royal Society.Vapour Pressure of Liquid Ammonia and the Determination of itsBoiling Point.By J ohn H ughes D avies.It was suggested to me by Dr. Per man, to whom I am much indebted for kindly advice and assistance, th at I should repeat the determination of the vapour pressure of liquid ammonia at some of the lower temperatures, using pure ammonia, in order to obtain an accurate value for its boiling point.Apparatus.-(Fig. 2.)This consisted o f:-1.

The manometer tube was 6 mm. wT ide, so that the correction for capillarity may be neglected. The correcting factor (0*99971) for reducing the weights from the value of gravity at Cambridge to that at Paris, may also be neglected as the difference is not within the limits of accuracy aimed at.\n\nCarbon Dioxide.-This gas was prepared by heating together an intimate mixture of fused boric acid and recently ignited sodium carbonate, and passing the gas through a tube containing some pure phosphorus pentoxide distilled in oxygen. The apparatus for the preparation of this gas was sealed on to the inlet tube D beyond the stopcock and was thoroughly exhausted by means of a special charcoal reservoir and then finally connection was made to the previously exhausted flask A. The apparatus was allowed to stand for some time, and the special charcoal bulb sealed off. The large flask A was then ready to be filled with carbon dioxide through the inlet tube D.\n\nThe following results were obtained :- Rayleigh* gives the value 1*52909 as the weight of a litre of carbon dioxide compared to air at 0° and 760 mm., which is 1*9782 gramme per litre.\n\nSulphur Dioxide.-Some pure dry sulphur dioxide was liquefied in a glass bulb which, with a tube containing phosphorus pentoxide, was sealed on to D and the whole was then, while the sulphur dioxide was frozen in liquid air, exhausted by means of a pump followed by the use of charcoal in the manner described above. The vapour could now be changed into the previously exhausted flask A to any desired pressure.\n\nThe following results were obtained:- Guye* takes 2*9266 as the most probable value for the weight of a litre of sulphur dioxide at 0° C. and 760 mm.

The advantage of Ni is that it is less expensive than Ru and can be loaded at high concentrations to achieve the desired results. An anode supported SOFC (with an anode thickness of 500 μm, 40% porosity and 50% Ni by volume) requires a Ni loading of 0.134 g/cm². If it is operated at a current density of 5000 mA/cm², it consumes hydrogen at the rate of 11.6 mmol/min/g of catalyst. If the cell operates at 600 °C, then Ni can safely decompose ammonia at the required rate.\n\n\nReaction mechanism of ammonia decomposition\n\nVarious studies have investigated the reaction mechanism of ammonia decomposition. The reaction steps include 1) adsorption of ammonia onto catalyst sites, 2) cleavage of N-H bond on adsorbed ammonia, 3) recombinative desorption of N2 atoms [28]. These three steps are respectively illustrated in equations 2-4, where * refers to an active site and X * refers to species X adsorbed onto an active site.\n* * 3 3 NH NH + → (2) * * * * 3 2 NH NH H + → + (3) * * 2 2 2 N N → +(4)\nEarly studies observed that the rate of ammonia decomposition over Pt and Fe, shifted from zero order with respect to ammonia partial pressure at low temperatures (< 500 °C) to first order at high temperatures [29]. Tsai and Weinberg [27] proposed that on Ru crystal catalysts, below approximately 400 °C the recombinative desorption of nitrogen atoms (step 3) is rate limiting, whereas above 400 °C the cleavage of the N-H bond of adsorbed NH3 (step 2) is rate limiting. This was based on the observation that the apparent activation energy decreased from 180 kJ/mol at the low temperatures to 21 kJ/mol at high temperatures. It should be noted however, that these early studies did not consider the effects of hydrogen inhibition.",

The Molecular Heats of Nitrogen, Steam, and Carbon Dioxide at High TemperaturesIf P ' does not differ greatly from P the respective heat losses may be taken as inversely proportional to the initial pressure, and the true mean molecular heat of nitrogen is then directly obtained from the apparent values :-C,*, = 2*977a (Pc -P 'b)/bc (P -P').\n\nAccordingly two series of nitrogen diluted 2H2 + 0 2 mixtures were exploded a t initial pressures of 75 and 100 atmospheres respectively, and a series of argon diluted mixtures at an initial pressure of 100 atmospheres, with results which are summarised in Tables I to III, where Pm/P» = ratio of the observed maximum pressure to the observed initial pressure. P\"»ft/P*& ~ ra^° to P* each corrected for deviations from the gas laws. tm = time in seconds for the attainment of maximum pressure. Tw° K. = mean maximum temperature actually attained in the explosion. * A sm all correction is necessary due to the difference in the degree of dissociation of steam caused by changing the pressure from P to P' atmospheres.     From an inspection of results it will be seen that the upper temperature limit is determined by the nitrogen diluted mixtures at P* == 100 atmospheres (Table II), for when the nitrogen content fell below about 50 per cent, the explosions were so violent that vibrations were set up in the recording manometer, and it became difficult to measure with sufficient accuracy the recorded maxi mum pressure. On the other hand, the lower temperature limit was found to depend on the argon diluted mixtures (Table I) because when the argon content exceeded 72 per cent, the explosion time, and consequently the heat losses, increased rapidly as the mixture was made progressively weaker. Taking these facts into consideration no attem pt has been made to calculate molecular heats at temperatures below 2600° nor above 3000° K. Within these limits the explosion times never exceeded 0 • 025 second and the pressure-time records were free from secondary vibrations.\n\n\nMOLECULES DILUENT p e r 2 MOLS.

We may take the mean value 780 for the above ratio as the minimum for complete extinction under the experimental conditions. These were nearly the same as in the silver-ozone experiments of § 2. In those experiments it was concluded as probable that the actual number of collisions necessary to destroy a molecule was less than the superior limit indicated by observation in the ratio 1 : 1*6. If we assume that the same holds in the present case, we find that an active nitrogen molecule must on the average collide 500 times with an oxidised copper surface before it is destroyed. I have noticed, however, that the efficiency of an oxidised copper surface in this respect is by no means constant, but varies according to the treatment it has received. Thus its efficiency is greater after heating in a vacuum. The improvement persists for some time after cooling, but eventually disappears. The above number is only illustrative, and is not to be regarded as a definite constant. § 4. Volume Change of Ozone to Oxygen.",

In order to test if there were any inaccuracy caused by adsorption, successive readings were taken at an interval of 48 hours at 98°*1, of 24 hours at 80°, and of a month at 20°, but the readings in each case agreed within the limits of experimental error. Allowance was made for the expansion of the globe with rise of temperature. The correction for the tube connecting the globe and the gauge was inappreciable. The following are the results (see p. 40). I t will be seen at once that the numbers show a considerable deviation from van der Waals' equation, which may be written in the form = KT -C, where K and C are constants: K is proportional to the pressure-coefficient and varies, therefore, by nearly 6 per cent, over the range of temperature employed.\n\nThe values of the pressure-coefficient are, as would be expected, very close to those obtained for sulphur dioxide, and higher than those for carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide.\n\n\n.c. specific gravity b o ttle ............................ 14-29 sp. gr. bottle+ H2SO4 + NH3 after expt........... 6027 H2SO4 + NH3 filling b o ttle ........................ 45-98 sp. gr. bottle 4-fresh H 2S 0 4................................ 59'10 Fresh H2SO4 filling bottle ........................ 44-81 If no change in volume of acid had taken place, weight of mixture filling bottle would be 44-81 + 1-38 = 46-19 grammes (1*38 grammes = weight of NH3 absorbed).

The photochemical study of Sarkisov et al. 75 estimated an overall rate coefficient of 4.5 × 10 13 cm 3 mol −1 s −1 for the reaction NH 2 + HO 2 → products at 300 K, while Baulch et al. 76 recommended a value of 1.6 × 10 13 cm 3 mol −1 s −1 between 300 K and 400 K. The fit of the reverse H-abstraction obtained in this work overestimates the value of Sarkisov et al. 75 at room temperature by a factor of 2. Anyway, the previous evaluations of Dean and Bozzelli 55 and Sumathi et al. 77 underestimate the low-temperature data by orders of magnitude. This confirms the significant uncertainty existing in the theoretical evaluation of such an important step in the NH 3 oxidation mechanism. The calculated rate constants are included in Table 1 and in the CHEMKIN format as Supplementary Material to this paper. Input files for the MESS calculations, thus inclusive of energy barriers, stationary points geometries, and of the variational analysis results are also reported as Supplementary Material.\n\n\nNH 3 oxidation: experiments and kinetic analysis",

Mater. Chem. A, 2021, 9, 16917â 16927).However, delving deeper into probing local changes surrounding the defect centers would necessitate more extensive and specialized EPR investigations.Regrettably, such detailed EPR studies lie beyond the scope of our current work and could be a subject of future investigation.Nevertheless, in response to the reviewer's valuable suggestion, we have incorporated a brief mention of the g-factor shift into our revised manuscript.The revised lines are also pasted below: â Furthermore, line broadening due to dipolar couplings between electron spins and g-anisotropy cannot be ignored.Additionally, we noted a shift in the EPR signal with the increasing concentration of defects in both D-AAS-12 and D-AAS-25 samples.This phenomenon suggested that as the defect concentration increased, there may be concurrent alterations in the chemical nature or the local environment of the defect sites, thus resulting in potential changes in the g-factor.However, comprehensively probing",

Mater. Chem. A, 2021, 9, 16917â 16927).However, delving deeper into probing local changes surrounding the defect centers would necessitate more extensive and specialized EPR investigations.Regrettably, such detailed EPR studies lie beyond the scope of our current work and could be a subject of future investigation.Nevertheless, in response to the reviewer's valuable suggestion, we have incorporated a brief",

Figure S10 shows how the distance-dependence of the electric field strength and the associated Coulomb potential of the proton affects the different water molecules in the H 17 [18] . The magnitudes are scaled to each other. This comparison shows that similar patterns are observed in the spectral band positions and shapes for the inner H 3 O + unit, and the first and second closest H 2 O molecules. Less apparent are possible distinctions in the pre-edge/main-edge frequency shifts and ratios of pre-& main-edge vs. post-edge cross sections between the first and the second water molecule, making an assignment of H 5 O 2 + and H 7 O 3 + as key complex for the hydrated proton in aqueous solution non trivial (this aspect has to be taken into account when comparisons are made with previous AIMD simulations on the hydrated proton in aqueous solution [19] ). The reason for this is that the calculated cross sections for in particular the pre-edge bands of hydrated proton complexes to hydration shell water molecules are minor, caused by hydrogen bond donating interactions these water molecules having significant magnitudes (as is also the case for bulk water; panel (a)). Hence even less can be concluded from the XAS contributions of the five water molecules in the first hydration shell for H + (aq).Instead, for H 17 O 8 + , the hydrogen bonds of the first hydration shell water molecules to an acetonitrile solvation shell are distinctly weaker, leading to clearly discernible calculated pre-edge bands, showing a clear trend for pre-edge band frequency position and intensities.

The excellent SNR obtained on this small protein allows even to detect further correlations than only one-bond. Similar observations are e.g. observed in (Friedrich et al. 2020). The spin diffusion under spin-lock condition during the CP actually seems to provide efficient polarization transfer, despite the scaling of the homonuclear dipolar couplings by a factor of −0.5 (Rhim et al. 1970). This is due to the absence of chemical-shift differences in the rotating frame leading to a strong-coupling situation for the homonuclear dipolar couplings, corresponding to the laboratory-frame situation for almost degenerate chemical shifts. (Xue et al. 2018) In order to quantify the improvement in resolution when going to higher field, we compared the proton linewidths of ten randomly selected isolated peaks at 850 and 1200 MHz (Δ ppm (1200)/ Δ ppm (850), Figure S8). We observe that the improvement on the ppm scale is of about the expected value of 0.71 obtained from the field ratio. In the 2D hCH spectra recorded on the fully protonated samples a larger improvement is achieved, probably due to the more pronounced narrowing effect from the increased chemical-shift separation at higher field.

For 1, the magnetic hysteresis loops were not closed up to 13 K, which are in substantial agreement with the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled (ZFC-FC) magnetizations peak at about 11 K for 1 (Figure 3c). On the other hand, the butterfly magnetic hysteresis loops were observed only up to 5 K and did not have a peak in ZFC-FC magnetizations for 2 as shown previously [5]. Moreover, we could see a smaller step in zero dc field regime and even a wider hysteresis loop at 2 K for 1 compared to 2 (Figure 3b), which indicates a blocking temperature of SMM with D 5h local symmetry clearly higher than the one with D 4h local symmetry. We reasoned that this is because the pseudo-D 5h symmetric SMM can better restrain the quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) effect at zero field and hence, T B is enhanced.

Figure 2 shows a comparison between the spectra of the pH=1.53 Glutamic acid as prepared and after 10 and 20 min of exposure to the EMF. A subsequent measure repeated after 30 min of exposure shows no further modifications with respect to the spectrum acquired after 20 min, and it can therefore been assumed that the modifications of interest take place within 20 min. The overall effect of the field is the modification of the spectra in the regions of absorption of COOH and of the NH 3 + head group. However, because of the complexity of the spectra, a simple comparison of the spectra of exposed with those of unexposed samples may be misleading, a kinetic analysis using the ratio of the protonated/deprotonated forms is not straightforward and a more sophisticated statistical treatment such as the Principal Component Analysis is needed in order to verify the statistical difference between exposed and not exposed samples. Another interesting effect of the exposure is the splitting of the band centred around 1630 cm -1 . Such a shift witness a change in the C-O vibrations which are sensitive to H-bonds. At intermediate values of pH, the solutions were characterized by very complex IR spectra in which many of the bands were broader and overlapped and the attribution of absorptions to single modes is also more difficult at these pH values.\n\nA straightforward evaluation of the effect is possible at high pH values. Fig.3 shows a comparison between the unexposed and exposed spectra at pH=11.86, at which pH the Glutamic acid should be fully deprotonated; however, the presence of a small band centred around 1650 cm -1 reveals the presence of the contribution of the deformation of NH 3 + in addition to the deformation of NH 2 and the stretching of C=O. Such a band is severely restricted by exposure signalling the shift towards the deprotonated specie.",

At 600 MHz, 1 H line widths range from 5.2 Hz (F52) to 13.0 Hz (D22). With the exception of D22, 1 H N line widths at 900 MHz are narrower than at 600 MHz. Evaluating the calculated 1 H N line widths as a function of magnetic field strength, using our experimentally derived 1 H N CSA tensors, indicates that the field strength where the 1 H N line width is narrowest varies strongly from residue to residue, far more than for 15 N ( Figure 10A). On average, the narrowest line widths are obtained at a 1 H frequency of 1.2 GHz (Figure 10B), requiring a magnetic field strength of 28 T, not yet commercially available. As expected, the spread in predicted 1 H N line widths increases at higher magnetic fields, due to the quadratic increase in the importance of 1 H CSA as a relaxation mechanism. Complete cancellation of the dipolar and CSA mechanisms can only occur if the 1 H N CSA tensor is axially symmetric, with its unique axis parallel to the N-H bond vector, a condition that does not apply for any of the amide protons in GB3. The deviations from this condition determine what optimal line width is achievable for any given proton, and at what field the cancellation of the two relaxation mechanisms reaches that maximum.",

In fact, this is the only intense band at a frequency compatible with C=O groups among the ones that are associated with the transition at +237 mV, and it lacks a respective shifted band in the oxidized state. This feature may be representative of a strong perturbation of the environment close to the formyl side chain of heme a 3 upon reduction (which takes place during the physiological E → R transition). It is not immediately clear whether the band at 1,643 cm −1 correlates with the same redox transition, or if it is indicative of a separate process involving only the formyl side chain of heme a. In general, our data show that the ligand interaction sphere of heme a 3 is already disturbed in the O → R 2 CO transition, with possible propionate protonation/deprotonation events indicative of proton transfer close to the cofactor. This scenario would not involve heme a but only heme a 3 . Its formyl side chain may be responsive to these changes, resulting in the 1,662 cm −1 positive band. Adding this information to the probable protonation of PRAa 3 upon heme a oxidation, our analysis supports the assignment of the protonloading site to the propionates of heme a 3 Kaila et al., 2011;Sezer et al., 2017).\n\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nFB performed FTIR measurements, analyzed the spectroscopic data, and wrote the paper.

The acidic proton of the SO 3 H group appears at a low magnetic field and a shift of 12.9 ppm. With increasing H 2 O content w H 2 O , up to an equimolar composition (~6 wt.%), it shifts about 1.9 ppm towards a higher field.\n\nThe latter observation can be caused by strong interactions between the high acidic protons of the [2-Sema] + cations and the H 2 O molecules. If the kinetic of the proton exchange between the SO 3 H group and the H 3 O + ions is very fast, both species cannot be separated by 1 H-NMR. This results in a single signal at an averaged position. Adding H 2 O will increase the H 3 O + concentration in the protolysis equilibrium because of the high acidity of the [2-Sema] + cations and will increase the total concentration of the active (mobile) protons.   As the protons of H 3 O + ions can be expected at a lower field than the protons of H 2 O molecules and at a higher field than the protons of SO 3 H groups [11], this may lead to the observed shift to a higher field and in an increase of the relative integral peak intensity (area).

In Figure 3 the evaluated self-diffusion coefficients for a temperature of 90°C are shown as a function of the H 2 O content.

Because of the prescence of some dimer, experimentally a small low field shift to 7.4 ppm is observed. Surprisingly, the solid lines in Figure 12a were obtained with the same limiting values δ A1 and δ A2 for the toluene-d 8 and the CD 2 Cl 2 samples. Moreover, within the margin of error, we could not detect a temperature dependence of these values.

(c) The numbers obtained scatter strongly: the estimated barrier height may be stated to be 11eV. (d) The apparent barrier height appears to depend on the polarity of the bias potential. It should be kept in mind that even in vacuum STM the barrier to tunneling is expected to be lower than the workfunctions of the metals involved because of image effects associated with the fast electronic response of the electrodes. 91 Nevertheless, the reduction of barrier height in the aqueous phase seems to be considerably larger. Taking the vacuum barrier as input in our discussion lets consider the possible role of the solvent. These can arise from the following factors: (1) The position, on the energy scale, of the \"conduction band\" of the pure solvent. By \"conduction band\" we mean extended electronic states of an excess electron in the neutral solvent configuration. (2) The effect of the solvent on the electrode workfunction. (3) The hard cores of the atomic constituents, in the present case the water oxygens, which make a substantial part of the physical space between the electrodes inaccessible to the electron. (4) The possibility that the tunneling is assisted by resonance states supported by the solvent. Such resonances can be associated with available molecular orbitals -this does not appear to be the case in water-or with particular transient structures in the solvent configurations as discussed above. Factors (2)-(4) are usually disregarded in theories of electron transfer, while a common practice is to account for the first factor by setting the potential barrier height at a value, below the vacuum level, determined by the contribution of the solvent electronic polarizability. This value can be estimated as the Born energy of a point charge in a cavity of intermolecular dimensions, say a radius of a~5au, in a continuum with the proper dielectric constant, here the optical dielectric constant of water, ε ∞ =1.88. This yields e 2 (2a) -1 [ε ∞ -1 -1]~-1.3eV, same order as the result of a more rigorous calculation by Schmickler and Henderson, 329 and in agreement",

An exponential dependence on N, characteristic of the superexchange model, is seen to give way to a weak bridge length dependence at some cross-over value of N. Further analysis of this results 119,120 reveals that the dependence on bridge length beyond the cross-over may be written in the form ( ) 1\n1 1 − − − + N k k diff up ,\nwhere k up is the rate associated with the thermal activated rate from the Fermi-level into the bridge, while k diff corresponds to hopping (diffusion) between bridge sites. As N increases, the conduction behaves as N -1 , indicating Ohmic behavior. This inverse length dependence should be contrasted with non-directional diffusion, where the rate to reach a distance N from the starting position behaves like N -2 .

A multi-step incoherent hopping transport mechanism rationalizes the power-law length dependence (i.e., the carrier diffuses on the bridge). In this regime, thermal activation arises because of the activation free energy required to inject carriers onto the bridge and the activation free energy for site-to-site hopping [S7,S8], or in electrochemical junctions by reorganization energy of the redox couple [S11,S12]. McCreery et al. [S1,S2] and Porath et al. [S13] reported voltage dependences for the current in molecular junctions, which are attributed to lowering of the barrier and screening of the applied field by the molecules. This explanation assumes that the electronic states above the barrier are all extended. In most organic molecules, however, the states directly above the barrier are localized while extended states can only be found at much higher energies. Our theory, which accounts for the change in nature of the electronic states from localized to quasi-extended, also includes the change in the barrier height.\n\n\nOutline of the numerical calculation\n\nThe results given in the main text for the electron transmission probability and current through the molecules were obtained using two different numerical methods: (i) For the analysis of the singleband Hamiltonian (Eq. 1) we followed the numerical method of Ref. S14, which is based on the Poincaré map representation of the Schrödinger equation and is commonly known as the transfer matrix method. (ii) The transmission probability through DNA molecules modeled by the multiband Hamiltonian in Eq. 5 was obtained by numerical computation of the Green's function. Below, we outline both methods.\n\nCalculation of the transmission probability for the single-band model:\n\nThe aim of the numerical derivation is to find transmission probability for each realization of the disorder potential dis ( ), and then average it over a large number of realizations. In practice, we average the logarithm of the transmission probability, which is more stable and leads to faster convergence [S15].",

Writing the transmitted state in the form 1-dimensional rectangular barrier model, Eq. (72), and in the limit 1 >> d κ , this leads again to Eq. (73). Galperin et al 232 have applied the same approach to compute traversal times through water layers (see Sect. 4). For tunneling through a molecular spacer modeled as a barrier of width ~10 (N=2-3) and height U B -E ≅ E ~ 1eV, Eqs. (73) and (74) yield τ ≅ 0.2fs and τ ≅ 2fs, respectively, both considerably shorter than the vibrational period of molecular vibrations. When the barrier is lower or when tunneling is affected or dominated by barrier resonances, the traversal time becomes longer, and competing relaxation and dephasing processes in the barrier may become",

Moreover, there is a domain value of ∆ for which the conductivity attains its maximum value. According to the above discussions, it is clear that the conductivity of the system depends on the superlattice structural parameters, such as L and D.

In the description of Landauer this corresponds to a barrier in contact with reservoirs which also have a modulated potential. In this case the boundary conditions on both sides of the barrier are not free-electron-like, and the states in the barrier region have to match the eigenstates of the modulated reservoir potential. Many ab initio electronic structure codes are adapted to a lattice symmetry with three-dimensional periodicity. Therefore, it appears desirable to use these eigenstates to calculate the transport properties even in the case of tunnelling barriers.

It may be of interest to discuss the relevance of models concerning soluble molecules to surface-attached receptors. Let us consider two cell membranes bearing adhesion molecules within binding distance. A characteristic diffusion constant D for lateral diffusion is about 10 -10 cm 2 /s (as compared to 10,000 fold higher value in fluid phase for a sphere of 2 nm diameter). Thus, the time required for interacting molecules to exhibit a mutual displacement L of the order of molecular length, i.e. 10 nm, is ≈ 1 ms (i.e. L 2 /8D). This is much longer that the typical time for molecular rotations (i.e. about 0.1 µs for domains of flexible protein molecules ; Dandliker and de Saussure, 1970). This suggests that collision efficiency must be substantially higher between flexible membrane-bound molecules than between free molecules, because close contact is maintained for a higher amount of time. Association between flexible bound molecules should thus be essentially considered as diffusion-limited. If molecules are not fully flexible, the acquisition of a bound state is expected to be substantially impaired, and reaction rates should be dependent on the details of molecular shape and dynamics (see Pierres et al., 1998b, for very simplified quantitative estimates of the dependence of binding rate on membrane separation distance).",

The diffusion constant D in equation (1) has to account for three simultaneous processes contributing to the spatial movement of cells. First, dividing cells occupy increasing space, therefore a certain part of D, say D p , has to account for the spatial expansion of proliferating cells. The authors of [6,8,19,30] have proposed relations of the type\nD p = k 1 2 T d .\nHere is related to the typical length or diameter of a cell and T d is the doubling time. The dimensionless factor k 1 in [8] accounts for the expansion of the viable rim of dividing cells. We take to be the average increase in cell diameter between mitotic events. We assume the area of an average cell increases from approximately 50 µm 2 to 100 µm 2 , so we take = 3.3 µm. We assume the average cycle time is\nT d = 16 h. We take D p = 0.1 µm 2 h −1 (order of magnitude)\n. Second, individual cells plated on a Petri dish do not remain fixed in their position but undergo a random walk. It is natural to assume that the random walk is not biased and follows the laws of Brownian motion. Third, cells in a cluster may break lose from that cluster as TGF-β is known to decrease cell-cell adhesion [28]. Thus, a part of D, say D m , must account for this second and third contribution to cell movement. We propose here a modification of the standard Fisher-Kolmogorov equation (1). Our reasoning is that as the cells become more densely packed, their random motility should decrease. Thus, with U from equation (2) we propose\n∂ ∂t u(x, y, t) = ∇ · (D(U )∇u(x, y, t)) + αu(x, y, t)(1 − βu(x, y, t)), D(U ) = D m 1 − U |Ω| + D p .(3)",

However, because the target site dimensions are as small as a nanometer, there is concern about whether diffusionlike models are appropriate or not. We first point out that we are by no means the first to apply the diffusion equation down to the length scales characterizing individual molecules: in the chemical physics literature there are numerous examples where diffusion-limited association rates are computed within this framework, and even small deviations from the theory are taken seriously. For the general application to biomolecular context, see the review in Ref. ͓15͔; a concrete case that couples 1D and 3D diffusions in an association problem for a lac transcription factor is derived in Ref. ͓4͔, and has been generalized to curved DNA geometry in Ref.\n\n\n͓5͔.\n\nWith this remark in mind we note that our aim is to compute the equilibrium behavior of the occupancy of the binding site on long-time scales. We do not track the evolution of motion of a single molecule along the DNA, but actually imagine a number of molecules diffusing in the bulk and along the DNA. Our results will concern the noise in the → 0 limit, or, more precisely, the noise averaged over times which are much longer than the characteristic time that the TF particle needs to diffuse over length scales of the receptor or sliding length. Concretely, the noise in gene regulation is generally averaged on the cell division or protein lifetime scale, both of which are in the range of at least minutes, while diffusion across a region 1 nm in size at D ϳ 1 m 2 / s will take on the order of 1 s, and will be comparatively short even if such region is bigger by 2 orders of magnitude. This means that-over the relevant timescale-we will be able to define an ensemble of particles that samples the spatial neighborhood of the binding site extremely well and will thus be justified in using the diffusion equations. We expect that our continuous approach is inappropriate for probing small distances at short times, but this is not relevant here.\n\n\nIII. BINDING WITH 3D DIFFUSION",

As described in Murase et al. (2004) and Suzuki et al. (2005), D MACRO = D eff (33 ms) 100 ms has to be used for this calculation for the following reason. Each membrane molecule exhibits two diffusion coefficients: 1) the short-term diffusion coefficient, obtained on the time scale of 75 μs (25 μs × 3), representing the diffusion coefficient within a compartment (D micro ), and 2) the long-term diffusion coefficient, obtained on the time scale longer than the residency time within a compartment, representing the diffusion coefficient in space scales several times longer than the molecules actually undergo suppressed (more specifically, hop/confined) diffusion, and the simple-Brownian diffusion detected here is only true in the limited time scale >33 ms, representing long-term macroscopic diffusion. Similar observations and analyses for four other cell lines-HEPA-OVA, HeLa, T24, and NRK cells-revealed that TfR mostly undergoes effective simple-Brownian diffusion on the time scale of 33 ms to 1 s (30 video frames) in all of these cell types (Supplemental Table S1). Therefore the diffusion on this time scale can be described by a single effective diffusion coefficient, and here we used D eff (33 ms) 100 ms (obtained by the linear fitting of the MSD-∆t plot between 67 and 132 ms, with a midpoint of 100 ms, for data obtained at 33-ms time resolution), following Suzuki et al.

(10) and Eq. ( 12), we can compute the ratio between the steric factor f u corresponding to a sparse uniform configuration of the M receptors and that of the cluster configuration, f c , namely\nf u f c 2 √ M π + O (a/R)(13)\nFor a number of receptors M of the order of 10 4 ÷10 5 , one finds f u /f c 10 2 .This is a first, striking manifestation of the anticooperative effects caused by diffusive interactions.Summarizing, (i) the rate of capture for a ligand diffusing to a cell uniformly and very sparsely covered with receptors is essentially as large as that of a fully covered cell and (ii) about 100 times larger than in the case where all the receptors would be clustered in a single active patch.It is intriguing to observe than in many cases receptors are indeed densely clustered on the cell surface.Famously, this is the case of chemotaxis receptors in bacteria such as E. Coli, forming extended patches at the cell poles. 20,23,24One might argue that there should be other biochemical or structural constraints that offset such strong reduction to the rate of capture.\n\n\n4.",

However, in the case of absorbing system boundaries the depletion can be much faster: namely, of the order of the time needed for a AI molecule to diffuse across the system and get absorbed to the boundaries (some hours) 29 . These variations give rise to variations of the parameter α. Moreover, AI molecules get depleted by the QS-cells themselves and can be washed away by local fluid flows. The measured characteristic distances in the case of an absorbing boundary proposed in 28 is δ = D/ 3 mm which translates to α = δ/D ~ 0.1/mm 2 . The values of α in our model vary between 10 −3 and 10 3 /μm 2 that corresponds to the range of typical distances between ≈0.03 and ≈30 μm. The separation of 30 μm is indeed a typical extension of early-stage biofilms, both in QS experiments 14 and modelling approaches 49 , while 0.03 μm is clearly a very short length of spatial extensions for a bacterial colony. On the other hand, the boundaries in the current model are open and not absorbing. Finally, the measured diffusion constant of AHL molecules in agarose discs is D ~ 300 μm 2 /sec 28,29 . In the model we set a constant, bacteria-density-independent diffusion coefficient of AI molecules (a valid approximation for the early stages of colony development). Moreover, we refer to 75 for the absolute and relative-to-water diffusivities measured in bacterial biofilms for a number of solutes of different molecular weights. Lastly, the basal production rate of AI molecules by a single bacterial cell is in the range ~110 per sec 76 .",

Such distribution of residence times is defined as the inverse cumulative probability, or the probability for a molecule to have a life longer than t 0 :\nR 1 t 0 PðtÞdt.\nGiven the intrinsic limitations of single-molecule imaging when probing very stable binding events (as for cohesin), we use the Survival Probability curves to qualitatively sample the discrepancies between the different biological conditions.\n\nAnalysis of diffusion dynamics-The trajectories obtained from experiments at 50 ms were analyzed with custom codes implemented in Matlab. First, we computed the time-averaged mean-squared displacement (MSD) as MSD = 〈xt + nΔt − xt〉, where x(t) is the position at time point t, n = 1, 2 …, N, with N = maximum number of time points in a trajectory, and 〈〉 indicating the ensemble average over all the possible time lags of one individual trajectory.\n\nWe selected the trajectories with at least ten localizations.

We did not threshold data used to quantify the fraction of bound molecules nor to the estimation of the Survival Probability.\n\nOnce computed the MSD, we extrapolated what we call the instantaneous diffusion coefficient (D inst ) from each trajectory by fitting the MSD from point 2 to point 6.

At the lowest tension, 5 pN, a diffusion coefficient of 0.094 μm s −1 is found which is close to an in vivo result (0.14 μm s −1 ) reported earlier 32 .

This allow us to calculate effects on the free energy barrier, but also to consider possible effects on the radius of gyration of the protein. Note that Kamagata et al. used R, the radius of gyration of the protein structures corresponding to the HU-DNA complexes (PDB 1P71), and R oc ∼ R to calculate the freeenergy barrier (2.1 Tk B ) for diffusion. We obtained the free-energy barrier in 2.3 Tk B using the same R and R oc values (PDB 1P71), close to the previously reported value. We also obtained a radius, R = 2.52 nm, based on the measurement at 40 pN with Mg 2+ and the free-energy barrier (ε) obtained from Kamagata's work.

As shown in figures 6, 7, over random trials the distribution of the number of steps to initially reach a mitochondrion has a (somewhat left-skewed) bell shape when plotted as the logarithm of the number of steps. For a random walk stride of 0.01μm (diffusion constant of 0.01667μ²/s) plotted in the figure, a typical number of steps needed to initially encounter a mitochondrion is around 2 12 to 2 19 steps (roughly 4-524 seconds). However once the mRNA molecule encounters a mitochondrion, it very often bumps back into it right away, (30-35%) of the time on the first step! This strong tendency to quickly encounter the same mitochondrion again is to be expected. For example, consider the limit as the random walk stride becomes negligibly small relative to the radius of a mitochondrion. In that case the surface of the mitochondrion locally looks like a plane (in general at some angle not perfectly aligned with any of the axes of the random walk 3D lattice). Under those conditions any move of the mRNA is equally likely to move towards the surface of the mitochondrion as away from it. Occasionally however, the mRNA happens to move away from the immediate vicinity of the mitochondrion it just collided with and eventually encounters one of the other four mitochondria in the simulation. In this case the distribution (red bars at bottom of the second and third bars of the triples shown in figures 6, 7) of the number of steps taken is roughly similar to number of steps taken to initially reach a mitochondrion when starting from the nuclear exit point. The two figures 6, 7 differ only in the movement options used. Although the distribution sampled under the fixed option seems to have a longer tail on the number of steps for the first encounter; other than that the two look qualitatively quite simi-  lar. This is reassuring, as subsequent figures in this manuscript were computed using fixed1 movement (before we thought to investigate other movement strategies) and we hope the conclusions we draw from them do not depend on technical details of how the particle is moved during the simulation.",

As noted above, a striking difference is the distance-dependence of the mean first passage time (MFPT) of the searcher to the target site. The MFPT of non-compact explorers is essentially constant, depending solely on the total volume and not on the distance r to the target. Conversely, in the compact case, the MFPT still scales with the volume but also increases with the distance as ( ) w f D D r − . As an illustration, we computed the MFPT as a function of the distance (see analytical expressions of MFPT in Condamin et al., 2005;Bénichou et al., 2010), using the experimental data for c-Myc and P-TEFb, two examples of non-compact and compact explorers. For c-Myc, which behaves as an ordinary Brownian walker, the fractal dimension is D f = 3, and the dimension of the walk is D w = 2. We used a diffusion coefficient D = 9.8 μm 2 /s, the value obtained by a weighted average of the diffusion coefficients of the three subpopulations. (It is important to note that the value used for the diffusion coefficient does not affect the dependence of the MFPT on the initial distance to the target.) To calculate the MFPT, we used a nuclear volume of 600 μm 3 and considered a target in its center. For P-TEFb, we did not have direct access to the value of D f and used several values previously reported as estimations in the nucleoplasm (Bancaud et al., 2012). In Figure 6, we used D f = 2.6 and the results were qualitatively similar for values of D f = 2.2, and D f = 3 ( Figure 6-figure  supplement 1).

However, it was inversely proportional to the size of the target, similar to what is predicted from the diffusion-limited rate of bimolecular reactions (Nelson et al., 2008). In contrast, the MFPT of P-TEFb increased with the distance r but did not depend on the target size. The lack of size dependence can be simply viewed as a consequence of the redundant exploration of compact explorers, and reflects the fact that the limiting step to find a target is the time taken to reach its vicinity. We stress that the differences of MFPT can be very significant. For instance, the time needed to find a 10 nm target located at a distance of 250 nm is 68 times longer for c-Myc compared to P-TEFb (506.1 s for c-Myc and 7.4 s for P-TEFb). If the target is located at 5 μm of the TF, the difference in the search time is reduced to a factor of 8 (525.3 s for c-Myc and 64.6 for P-TEFb).\n\nHere, we considered that c-Myc has a full access to the nuclear volume. It is interesting to note that if, as suggested by the temporal variance of the angular distribution, c-Myc is confined to a smaller domain, the MFPT would scale linearly with this volume.\n\nWe also considered the case of a factor susceptible to bind to two different targets T1 and T2 ( Figure 6B). To do so, we computed the splitting probability P, that is the probability to reach T1 before T2 as a function of the initial distance to T1. For c-Myc, the probability was equal to 0.5 as soon as the initial distance was larger than a few tens of nanometers, in stark contrast with the case of P-TEFb, for which P varied almost linearly with the distance.",

Instead we will resort to the most general Einstein relation D = µk B T where µ is the particle's mobility. [30] In the case of spherical particles and low Reynolds number the mobility would be replaced by the reciprocal drag coefficient which is given simply by Stoke's law as drag = 6πηR where η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and R is the sphere's radius.

Table 3 that you have a new plasmid pREN151 presumably to synthesise E9R. Is there a calculation problem somewhere happening in this paper (or the previous paper)? Is the method for purifying E9R different now and it is not so pure compared to before? Is there a significant media difference that would therefore change the affinity of this E9R construct for BtuB? 2. You state that R-domain of ColE9 binds with higher affinity to BtuB than does vitamin B12. What is the evidence for this? I notice that you use 40× more E9R cf. Vitamin B12, why not less than that? In your Penfold paper again, they say it takes 10 nM before there is an inhibitory affect on growth, presumably Vitamin B12 binds more strongly than E9R. Alternatively, affinity has never been measured. 3. I am nearly convinced that it is passive, but I have taken an objective view and want to consider an alternative inference of your data. I think my point would be clearer if you had have depicted the reversible binding of E9R and ColE9-W39A in Fig. 4a/b (it must be reversible otherwise (i) your cells would be dead (ii) passive diffusion is less probable), but your interpretation of Fig. 4c does not include the possibility that E9R has a stronger affinity to BtuB than does ColE9-W39A and therefore naturally stronger inhibitory effect than ColE9-W39A would have (and hence the change in growth). I think your CryoEM data do complement your data (like you say ln 292-4), but I take the opposite approach. You solve two general structures. A partial structure that lacks BtuB (from passive dissociation like you imply or due to the purification process?) and the full structure that has been forced to stall (through an introduced disulfide) and demonstrate that in the absence of energy to pull ColE9 off BtuB you can solve the structure WITH BtuB.

BARD analysis applied to the TatA-YFP track data indicated a smaller but still significant proportion of 30-40% of all tracks exhibiting confined diffusion with a mean confinement radius of 60 + 40 nm, and the mobile population characterized by a smaller typical microscopic diffusion coefficient in the range 0.002-0.01 mm 2 s 21 ( figure 7c). For both the Helix1021-GFP data (A. Robson, A. Nenninger, C. Mullineaux, M. C. Leake, unpublished data) and the TatA-YFP data (figure 8), we were able to estimate the molecular stoichiometry of the diffusing fluorescent spots using a Fourier spectral technique that used the step-wise photobleaching of FPs [7]. This indicated a difference between the mobile and confined track populations suggesting that confined tracks were associated with a greater typical number of FP subunits. For example, we estimated the median stoichiometry from the mobile TatA-YFP spot population as being in the range approximately 20 TatA-YFP molecules per spot, whereas that of the confined population was higher by approximately 50 per cent (figure 8a). We saw no obvious differences in microscopic diffusion coefficient between the confined and mobile populations (figure 8b) nor of any clear correlation between molecular stoichiometry in each fluorescent spot and the inferred size of the confinement radius (figure 8c).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe ability to monitor single molecules or complexes diffusing in living cells is an excellent example of the 'nextgeneration' single-molecule cellular biophysics approaches that have emerged over the past decade. What some researchers are now trying to do with such exceptionally precise molecular-level data is to use them to increase our understanding of the functional architecture of both the diffusing molecules themselves and of their local cellular environment. However, to do so requires a development of novel computational methods that can accurately measure the underlying modes of diffusion from the typically noisy and limited data from these tracked molecules in vivo.",

As detailed in section 4, in each time step the molecule moves a small distance in a randomized way. The simplified architecture of the cell used in the simulator is shown in figure 5. Mitochondria are placed randomly in the spherical shell with an inner radius of 1µm and outer radius of 2.5µm, in such a manner that they do not overlap the nucleus or each other. The mRNA diffusion starts at the surface of the cell nucleus and continues until the mRNA has anchored to a mitochondrion or 11 minutes (a typical half-life of yeast mRNA) has passed. The speed of diffusion changes upon initiating translation. At the start the mRNA has not yet initiated translation, but at each step it may do so with probability equal to the length of a time step divided by the average translation initiation time (as measured by Shah et al. [2]) of the gene it represents. For a given set of parameters, the simulation is repeated many times and the mitochondrial localization probability is estimated as the fraction of runs for which the mRNA anchored to a mitochondria. At a conceptual level, the simulation has four parameters which we tried varying: the effective diffusion coefficients of mRNA before and after initiating translation, and the mitochondrial anchoring probability before and after initiating translation. Additional technical parameters describe the details of how the particle moves (section 4).\n\n\nOperations done at each simulation step",

At the beginning of the process, however, molecular transport by diffusion is very rapid, and the molecules within the pores are adsorbed to the surface quickly, which can be approximated by the first, diffusiondominated circumstance. As time progresses, the diffusion of molecules into the pore slows. The process therefore tends towards the second circumstance. Thus, the above two analytical results are suitable to describe the initial and long-time processes, and allow for preliminary estimation of the diffusion coefficient, adsorption rate constant, and desorption rate constant. To fill the gap between these two circumstances, we used the finite element method software COMSOL to set up an axially symmetric model ( Fig. 1(d)) to simulate the diffusion and attachment process of biomolecules in a single pore: the upper region of the pore (waveguide layer) is 10.0 nm in radius, 200 nm thick and the lower region (substrate layer) has a radius of 11.7 nm and thickness of 1500 nm. A fluidic domain outside the pore (modeling the flow cell, not shown in Fig. 1(d)) is 200 μm in height. In section 4, we will show that the parameters calculated from Eqs. (6) and (7) give good agreement with the results from numerical simulation using COMSOL.\n\n\nExperimental\n\n\nFabrication",

The evidence given in Table I shows the suspension medium to be well mixed, at least at 0.87 msec. after the reaction is initiated. The degree of mixing in the cell interior cannot be verified experimentally, but it is possible to calculate how rapidly diffusion alone would produce a given degree of mixing in the interior. Roughton's (9) treatment of the diffusion of dissolved oxygen in the red cell interior has been adapted for this purpose. In this treatment, the red cell is considered as a plane liquid sheet. It is possible to show that a substance present on both sides of such a sheet diffuses into the sheet according to the equation:\n1 8 6._(D~rt/4b2 ) t -(6)\nin which/3 is the average specific activity of THO in the cell interior, i~0 is the initial specific activity of THO outside the cell, D is the diffusion coefficient of THO in the cell interior, b is the half-thickness at the center of the red cell, and t is time. A value of D is necessary to calculate the time required for the cell interior to reach a concentration which is 90 per cent of 150. D is unknown, but may be estimated from the work of Wang (10) on the diffusion of I-I~O TM into concentrated ovalbumin solutions. In a solution which was 24.5 per cent protein by weight, D~2o18 was found to equal 0.978 X 10 -a cmY/sec, at 10°C. By using this value as a rough estimate of D in Equation 6, and setting b equal to 0.5 X 10 -q cm. (11), one obtains t = 0.2 msec. Thus, if no other force acts to mix the cell interior, diffusion alone produces mixing which is 90 per cent complete in about 0.2 msec. In these experiments the half-time for water exchange across the membrane is found to be about 4 msec. Thus the assumption of a well mixed cell compartment seems to be justified.",

One example is cells traveling through the blood that capture to a blood vessel surface as a first step in homing to tissue. Vascular homing processes occur as white blood cells are recruited to sites of inflammation, lymphocytes travel to the lymph nodes, cancer cells metastasize to spread to new tissues, and stem cells home to sites of injury to repair tissues [10][11][12]. A cell traveling in excess of hundreds of cell diameters a second may briefly bump into the wall, leaving no opportunity for the proteins in the membrane of the flowing cell and in the membrane of the immobilized cell on the vessel wall to adapt for an optimal, sorted presentation of molecules. Although the average density of CD2 on T-cells is around 200 molecules per square micrometer [13], within a factor of two of the average density of ligands mediating capture and dynamic adhesion on neutrophils [14], the adhesive contacts involving hundreds of molecules per square micrometer have been observed to require thirty minutes to fully form in vitro with assays for CD2 and LFA3 [7]. T-cell interactions with antigen presenting cells have been observed to go through several phases in vivo, involving contacts lasting a few minutes and contacts lasting hours [15], suggesting molecular sorting in the contact region plays a role in vivo. On the other hand, dynamic adhesion ligands are thought to be localized cellular membrane ruffles called microvilli [16]. The contact widths and times for these ridges during cell capture are much shorter and smaller than for CD2 and LFA3, as small as 100 nm and as short as 1 ms [16,17], respectively. Also, once they form, the reacting pairs must survive higher forces exerted on the cell. Consequently, there may be a specialized set of structural, dynamic, and kinetic features of the molecules responsible for cell capture that facilitate rapid molecular tether formation and lifetime.",

Taking 7 = 0*000009 and 0 about 84° C., 270 becomes 0*0015, a correction which it is necessary to make.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to consider whether the variation in mean free path is appreciable. In cases where the pressure remains constant, there is a considerable alteration when the temperature rises from atmospheric tem perature to 100° C. But in this case the density and not the pressure remains constant, and a calculation shows that under these circumstances the mean free path increases by only 6 per cent, over the temperature range referred to. Since the mean free path itself only enters the formula as a small correction, so small an alteration in its magnitude is quite negligible.",

An alternative model of the shape of the molecule has also been considered, namely, to treat it as an ellipsoid of revolution,* having its major axis coincident with the axis of the three spheres, as indicated by the dotted line in fig. 2. The results obtained for the mean area presented are according as we take the volume of the spheroid as being equal to that of the three spheres, or to their total volume less the common portions. The dotted line in fig. 2 shows the principal section of the first of these spheroids; the second spheroid lies close inside, its minor axis being 0'91 of the first. The justification for substituting a spheroid for the three spheres does not appear to be so great as when there are merely two spheres, and it seems reasonable to rely on the value of B as given in (3) rather than on the alternatives (a) and (b), especially as B is the intermediate value. The comparison will therefore be carried out on this basis. 6. We have now to consider the actual values of the mean areas presented as targets by the molecules of X20 and C 02.

For the number of molecules per cubic centimetre at N.T.P., Millikan's* modern value, 2*705 x 1019, has been adopted. The viscosity data are more uncertain.

There is the possibility, of course, that although gases might diffuse through the entire surface of the cell, they might diffuse much more rapidly through the watery pores.

Further increase in pressure led to the destruction of the anvils. In 11c, 1 H-NMR spectra of paraffin at increasing pressures of up to 72 GPa are shown. These spectra are all acquired after a single scan and demonstrate impressively how the spin sensitivity basically remains constant under compression; this is in drastic contrast to what was observed with the micro-coil setup. The attentive reader might have recognised that the spin sensitivities realised with the LL resonators are about 2 up to 4 orders of magnitude lower, thus more sensitive, compared to the micro-coil set-ups. The reason for this might strike some as trivial, but I would like to explain it nonetheless. Consider using a micro-coil of 150-200 µm in height and about 300-400 µm in diameter in a DAC equipped with two 800 µm anvils. The sample cavity in such a DAC is most often much bigger than what is considered a 'safe' pressure cell 9 . Under compression, of course, such a DAC can be at best considered rather unstable, and the sample cavity is prone to collapse due to significant flow of the Cu-Be metal. Thus, every micro-coil will be subject to immense deformations, leading to a decrease in the 'effective' sample cavity. To underline this thought, numerical simulations have been conducted of the RF B 1 fields in a micro coil set-up as well as for a LL-resonator, see figure 12.",

Similarly, the α angle is also a bit overestimated: it equals 116.5 in our study, whereas it equals respectively 111.7 and 112.2 at the MP2/6-31G* and B3LYP/6-31G* levels of calculation. 27,32,33 Going from the transition state structure found at 0K to that obtained at 300K leads to an increase of the double bond length due to thermal vibrations. On the other hand, the d CG distance is smaller at hight temperature. This comes from the fact that the barrier originates mainly from rotational entropy lost when the transition state is formed.

Numerical trials soon show that in the present problem the first term of the series is enough, and also that the values of the Bessel functions are such that we may expand simply by writing J 0 (a?) = 1 -cc2/22 and Jx Let a be the fraction of the collisions with the wall which destroy the active product. Then since the number of gram molecules striking 1 sq. cm. of surface per second is %pu we must have ^p = ^ccpu where u is the root mean square velocity.\n\n\nThe solution* in terms of Bessel functions is p = AjJ0 ( |V ) e-rfct +\n\nWe assume the following numerical values a = 0*8 cm. ; C = 100 (since the pressure is about 2 mm. and C at atmospheric pressure would be about 0*3); u -2 X 104. Knowing the half-life of the active substance we can find a by trial or, with the approximations introduced above, by direct solution. The result is approximately 10-5. We invert the process and calculate the time of decay with this value of a X 10~5 X 2 X 104 = 3*3 X 10~2. Therefore h= 3-3 X 10\" 4.\n\nSolving the equation we now obtain for the case where p/p0 = 0-5 the value t = 8 • 5 seconds. This is of the order actually observed in the 1 • 6 cm. diameter tube as shown in fig. 1. Thus we conclude that in so far as the active substance is destroyed only at the walls one collision in about 105 is effective. It is evident, therefore, that there is much room for variation in the effectiveness of the wall. This is quite in keeping with experiments on the decay of active nitrogen and hydrogen.",

For example, in the case of the H 2 : CO mixture at 600 atmospheres pressure a deviation of about 25 per cent, occurs. Recently Bartlett has attempted to correlate the pressure exerted by a mixture with its composition by the following modification of the \" additive pressure \" law : \" At constant temperature the pressure exerted by one constituent in a gaseous mixture equals the product of its mol fraction, and the pressure it would exert as a pure gas at a molecular concentration equal to the molecular concentration of the mixture.\" The deviations from this version of the law when applied to the data recorded herein never exceed 2 per cent., which show it to be a useful approximation.\n\nNo attempt has been made to apply any one of the recently proposed equations of state to our results on account of the limited temperature range so far covered; nor has any application been made of the Lennard-Jones partial pressure law which correlates the values of \" \" in the equations pvA -a -\\-bp + etc., for isotherms of gaseous mixtures because it affords little help at high pressures where the \" \" and \" \" terms may preponderate.\n\nRecently Lennard-Jones* has. pointed out the possibility of greater deviations from Boyle's law being exhibited by certain gaseous mixtures than by either of the separate constituents. This is attributed to the fact that the temperature of maximum deviation of a gaseous mixture lies between those of its con stituents and striking confirmation of the effect has been forthcoming as the result of researches by Masson and his collaborators^ into the compressibility of hydrogen-helium and hydrogen-argon mixtures at pressures up to 125 atmospheres A not unlike phenomenon may be observed on studying the isotherms in fig. 3 where, at 0° C. between pressures of about 370 to 460 atmo spheres (dotted lines) and at 25° C. between about 290 to 460 atmospheres, the three hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixtures studied are less compressible than either hydrogen or carbon monoxide taken singly. It would not appear that these results call for any new explanation ; no doubt they are special cases of the deviations already well recognised.",

The mean free path of an electron in helium at this pressure is about l -7 cm. The shortest distance between the glowing filament and the gauze was 3 mm., but the periphery of the gauze was about 2 cm. from the middle of the filament, so that electrons from the further parts of the gauze would mostly collide with gas atoms before reaching the filament. The photo-electric emission of electrons from the gauze is, however, strongest at the parts of the gauze nearest to the filament, and here the path they travel through the gas is much less than their mean free path, so that the possibility of these electrons colliding with the gas atoms will be increased by raising the pressure until the mean free path of the electron is about 3 mm. If, then, the observed break in the curve at 20 volts is due to a radiation produced below the gauze by collisions of electrons with gas atoms, the effect should be more marked at a pressure of 0'3 mm., at which the mean free path of the electron is 3 mm., unless the radiation produced is very easily absorbed in the gas, in which case the increase in the radiation produced by the larger number of electron impacts may be neutralised by absorption of the radiation at the higher pressure.",

However at this position, it all had a virial near -0.3 bar. This results indicates that steeper density gradient gives a larger absolute virial component. This founding agrees well with the definition of virial component proposed by Zhou[13]: he proposed that 'the virial component is a stress-like measure for momentum change in space'. Density gradient in our simulation can be simply converted into the form of momentum gradient in space.

There may be an independent homo geneous reaction with an almost negligible rate at lower pressures, and an explosion limit analogous to th at found, for example, with mixtures of oxygen and phosphine. Or, on the other hand, some mechanism may exist whereby the surface reaction itself inflames the gases. The decreased tendency to explode in vessels of small diameter indicates th at chains traverse the gas and are broken on the wall. The variability of the explosion pressure may be due to the changing efficiency of the walls in giving rise to or in breaking chains. Thus it does not seem possible to decide definitely whether the chains start from the wall or in the gas, but the very marked dependence on the state of the wall is evidence, though not conclusive evidence, in favour of the former alternative.\n\nThe abruptness of the transition from slow reaction to explosion could be explained in terms of the branching chain hypothesis which has been applied to other systems possessing explosion limits. But the whole effect is of a much less definite character than the limit phenomena found, for example, with mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen, and indeed seems to be rather accidental in character. We incline at present to the view that it is connected with the lag in the establishment of adsorption equilibrium already discussed. When the gases are first let into the bulb the relative concentrations on certain parts of the surface may be momentarily quite abnormal, and correspond to very rapid reaction rates. At this moment ignition may occur. If it does not, adsorption equilibrium establishes itself, and the corresponding rate is the normal slow one. This would explain the apparent abrupt limit, and the erratic nature of the whole effect. It should be expressly stated that this is a special explanation, which is not by any means applicable to limit phenomena in general.\n\n\nSummary.\n\nAt 700° C. cyanogen reacts with oxygen to give nitrogen and a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

From an inspection of results it will be seen that the upper temperature limit is determined by the nitrogen diluted mixtures at P* == 100 atmospheres (Table II), for when the nitrogen content fell below about 50 per cent, the explosions were so violent that vibrations were set up in the recording manometer, and it became difficult to measure with sufficient accuracy the recorded maxi mum pressure. On the other hand, the lower temperature limit was found to depend on the argon diluted mixtures (Table I) because when the argon content exceeded 72 per cent, the explosion time, and consequently the heat losses, increased rapidly as the mixture was made progressively weaker. Taking these facts into consideration no attem pt has been made to calculate molecular heats at temperatures below 2600° nor above 3000° K.

We have calculated the VPIE for 22 Ne and 20 Ne at the critical points of both isotopes. First we consider the critical temperature of the lightest isotope, 20 Ne. Note that this temperature is lower that the triple-point temperature of 22 Ne. This implies that at this temperature the vapor of 22 Ne may coexist only with  its solid phase (as a visual help see the phase diagram in Fig. 8, where there appear two critical points at different temperatures). Therefore we have calculated the vapor pressure of 22 Ne and 20 Ne at T tp ( 20 Ne )=24.538 K by the study of the solid-gas coexistence. In Fig. 11 we have plotted the pressure dependence of the Gibbs free energy for both solid and gas phases of 22 Ne and 20 Ne. The free energy of the solid was calculated by a RS simulation using Eq. (8), while the free energy of the gas was obtained from the classical EoS. 34 The vapor pressures of 20 Ne, p' = 0.313 bar, and of 22 Ne, p =0.296 bar, are read from the crossing points in the figure. The resulting value of ln(p ′ /p) is compared to available experimental data in Tab. V. 10 The VPIE at the triple point temperature of the heavier isotope, 22 Ne, has been calculated by the study of the liquid-gas coexistence shown in Fig. 12. Gibbs free energies for the liquid phases were derived from PI MC simulations while the gas phase results correspond to the Johnson parameterization. 34 Here the vapor pressure of 20 Ne and 22 Ne are p' = 0.330 bar and p =0.315 bar, and the calculated value of ln(p ′ /p) shows an excellent agreement to the experimental data (see Tab. V). 10,47 Our simulations correctly reproduce that the VPIE is larger in the solid than in the liquid phase. \n\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS",

Both solutions show a strong repulsion at the distances compared with the dimension of particles.

Calculating the potential energy of a particle inside a certain space in which the others are distributed nearly uniformly we must take into account only the action of particles inside a small sphere surrounding the particle in question. In fact the potential energy u of our a-particle is given by the integral:\nu = -[ f(r) . 47ir2p dr,(2)\n\nJd\n\nwhere d is the smallest distance between the particles and p the density of particles. In our case, where the forces diminish rapidly with distance, the integral converges rather quickly and practically need be taken only up to a certain distance r*. The sphere of radius r* is well known in the theory of capillarity as \" the sphere of molecular action.\" We can say that the particle inside the liquid has no resultant force acting on it if the distance from the boundary is greater than r*. In the surface region very strong forces arise, trying to drag the particle inside the liquid (surface tension). Such a collection of a-particles will be very like a minute drop of water where the inside pressure, due to the kinetic energy of quantised motion, is in equilibrium with the forces of surface-tension trying to diminish the drop-radius.",

Because of the large atomic weight of 219 Rn, after it escapes from the material that 223 Ra is in, it tends to stay low and gravitationally pulled down. This is evident from a few trial runs at collecting 219 Rn from a dry 223 Ra source in a vial. The first cone design used to aspirate 219 Rn from 223 Ra in a vial failed. The design was simply a cone, which was placed over the top of an uncapped vial. There was plenty of airflow at the vial top opening, but the carbon air filter in the aspiration hose didn't pick up any 211 Pb. Then a nozzle was added to the cone, so when the cone was placed over the uncapped vial the nozzle would enter the opening and aspirate air from inside the vial. This design was able to accumulate a large sample of 211 Pb in the carbon air filter. This was a clear indication that for the most part 219 Rn outgassing from 223 Ra stayed inside the vial. But once one creates airflow close to the source of the 223 Ra, then one can easily affect the movement of the 219 Rn. The dry 5 Â 5 mm 223 Ra source exposure of the paper disks inside the petri dish is another example. The 1.5 cm lip of the petri dish was sufficient to contain the spread of the radon as it was seen that there was very little activity on the paper sheet placed below the petri dishes shown in the autoradiograph exposure of the sheet (Fig. 4.) In the Introduction, the US NRC inhalation dose limits were briefly discussed for 223 Ra, 219 Rn, and 211 Pb. Because of the short half-life of 219 Rn compared to 223 Ra, a 1 h continuous inhalation of 37 kBq of 219 Rn gave a whole-body effective dose exposure of 0.27 mSv, which is on the order of 200 times less than the US NRC ALI of 50 mSv.

Thus the examination of this single band under high dispersion yields fairly conclusive evidence for a non-linear structure. It was extremely difficult on account of the water vapour lines to obtain anything like a clear cut contour of this band (and so no diagram is reproduced) but it did not seem to possess anything that might be interpreted as a Q branch, and our estimate of the separation between the two maxima is 31 cm.-1. The Band at 2226 cm.-1.-This band was examined using the first order of a grating with 4800 lines to the inch on a spectrometer capable of separating lines less than 1 cm.-1 apart. No sign of rotational fine structure was observed, but the band had a very pronounced gap in the centre indicating the complete absence of anything in the nature of a Q branch. It is important to notice that the mere presence of this band is an argument against the linear symmstrical structure, since it is obviously the combination of the fundamentals at 641 cm. 1 and 1615 cm.-1, a combination which would be forbidden by the selection rules for combination bands in this type of molecule.f The \" doublet separation 55 is approximately 31 cm.-1.

Waite and Miller 5 have calculated the energies and lifetimes (the inverse of the unimolecular decay rate) of the individual metastable quantum states of the system, and Figure 1 shows a sample of their results. Because of the C3 symmetry of the system, the calculation is carried out separately for states of A symmetry (solid circles in Figure 1), A2 symmetry (open squares), and E symmetry (open circles). The solid line in Figure 1 is the result given by standard statistical theory, i.e., microcanonical transition state theory, 6\nk(E)= 3 P[E-Vo-(n +1/2)hto*]/[2,rrhp(E)] (2.2)\nHere P is the one-dimensional tunneling probability as a function of the energy along the reaction coordinate, to*= x/g is the frequency of the \"activated complex\", p(E) the density of reactant states, and the factor of 3 is due to the three equivalent transition states.

To the extent that there is any trend at all, therefore, it is opposite to what one would predict on the basis of the quasi-periodic/chaotic character of the classical mechanics. The appearance of some degree of modespecificity at high energies is perhaps understandable in that even if the various degrees of freedom are strongly coupled, states with most of the energy in the reaction coordinate will decay essentially instantaneously (i.e., within one vibrational period) while those with most of the energy in inactive modes will require at least a few vibrations for the energy to flow into the reaction coordinate.",

The range of ∆µ O (defined as µ O − 1 2 E total O2 ) between the vertical dashed lines corresponds to the heat of formation of Ag 2 O, i.e., to the range in which bulk silver oxide is stable.

Clearly, in the limit of an infinitely thick film, the corresponding line would be very close to the vertical one at ∆µ O = −0.323 eV.

At 460 K, the bulk oxide is unstable when the pressure is lower than 10 3 atm. i.e. compared to 1 atm. as observed experimentally.

Recall from the introduction that both electrophilic oxygen 10,11,21,22 and the bulk oxide [39][40][41] have been postulated to play an important role in ethylene epoxidation.But because these species may not appear on the equilibrium phase diagram, to identify candidate structures we must turn to the calculation of the spectroscopic properties of different Ag-O species.\n\nFocusing first on structures that were enumerated in the development of the phase diagram shown in Fig. 10, we see that we must consider species that may be present at locally higher concentrations of oxygen.At lower oxygen chemical potentials, only low coverages of chemisorbed atomic oxygen are predicted to be stable.At higher oxygen chemical potentials the thin oxide-like surfaces are the most stable surface structures.To form such an oxide-like layer, subsurface oxygen must be present.While Fig. 10 shows that subsurface oxygen is thermodynamically unfavorable under the experimental conditions, it may still appear as a transient species during the formation of a thin oxide-like layer.As previously noted, subsurface oxygen is widely believed to give rise to the feature at 530 eV in the O 1s spectrum. 24While we have already shown that this statement is not true for oxygen beneath the Ag(110) surface, oxygen below an Ag (111) surface may give rise to higher O 1s binding energies due to the different types of holes present, as discussed in the next section.\n\n\nSubsurface atomic oxygen",

These estimates depend on the choice of (unknown) pseudopotential; e.g., Marchi et al. 20 and Rodriguez et al. 21 give for these two peaks 3.4 and 4 Å, respectively. The volume change on electron solvation at 1 atm is ca. 100 cm 3 /mol which is three times the volume occupied by a solvent molecule. 20 This volume corresponds to a sphere of radius of 3.4 Å. Using dielectric continuum models, Jortner 5 estimated the hard core radius of the spherical cavity as 3 Å, while Kestner 6 obtained a lower estimate of 1.7-2.2 Å.

Beginning in the early 1980s, most of the theoretical studies on electron solvation were carried out for the hydrated electron; [12][13][14][15][16] the interest in e am − was sporadic, except for a brief period of time following the discovery of am n − cluster anions in the gas phase, 22,23 by Haberland and co-workers 25 and others. 26 For water, there are many indications, both direct and indirect, that the",

From the standpoint of one-electron cavity models, 5-11,17-23 e am − is an electron inside a (nearly) spherical potential well. At the same level of idealization, the solvent-stabilized anion in ammonia can be viewed as an electron in a potential well that is shaped as a thin spherical layer (of nitrogen atoms in the first solvation shell), with some extension of the wavefunction towards the center of the cavity and towards the outside. Since both of these binding potentials are spherically symmetrical, the ground and excited states are s and p functions, in both of these two models. By suitable parameterization of these potentials and by allowing certain variation in these parameters, similar optical spectra can be obtained. Therefore, at the conceptual level it is very difficult to tell these two variants of the one-electron model apart.\n\nWe conclude that at some level of idealization, the many-electron and the one- In such a situation, the definitive test of the model is in its ability to reproduce the specific structural information, such as the spin density map given by the Knight shifts.\n\nFor ammonia, this evidence points away from the cavity-filling one-electron model and towards, at the very least, the spherical-shell one-electron model, which has its natural explanation in the multimer radical anion model examined above.\n\n\n22.\n\nHow general are these conclusions? Large Knight shifts for 14 N and 13 C nuclei for excess electron in dilute Na/methylamine solutions 31 suggest that electron solvation by the amino-and methyl-groups is qualitatively similar to that for the ammoniated electron. We have already suggested that electron solvation in alkanes 65 and acetonitrile 66 involves a solvent stabilized multimer anion with a fraction of the spin density transferred onto the frontier orbitals of C atoms in the methyl groups. It is very likely that a similar situation occurs in ethers, as such liquids also solvate the electron by their methyl and methylene groups. 68 The mode of electron solvation in alkanes (that comprise the largest class of electron trapping liquids) can be addressed experimentally, in two different ways. First, it might be possible to determine Knight shifts for 13 C nuclei in dilute Na/HMPA solutions.",

The hole is about 3 A in diameter ; the (n -f-1)** electron to be replaced in the L-shell is bound to the free atom with about 8 volts, and thus has a potential energy of about -16 volts, and the L-orbits have a diameter of about 1*0 A.We must consider what errors can occur in using the ionization potentials of the free atom in estimating the energy involved in steps(6)and (c). Two effects are to be taken into account; (1) the weakening of the binding-force of the electrons owing to the presence of the surrounding metal, and (2) the 294 H. W. B.

The magnitude of (2) depends on how the inner potential of the metal falls off within a distance of about 1 A., from the edges of the hole ; but this is a relatively large distance for forces due to incomplete shielding, and it seem s unlikely th at there will be any serious error. We shall see subsequently that this conclusion receives some empirical support. To sum up, it seems improb able that, in using the atomic ionization potentials to represent the work done in steps (b) and (c), we commit an overestimate of mor volts.In evaluating the energy involved in stages (a) and (d), it is simpler first to consider lithium, with only one valence-electron per atom. In removing an electron from the metal, we are undoubtedly freeing a certain atom of the valence-electron which may be said to \" belong \" to it, and we are thus clearing this atom for the stages (b) and (c). Consider the hole in the m etal; the potential energy of the metallic valence-electrons per atom is slightly raised in the formation of the new surface of the empty hole, but it is lowered again by the residual field of the K-excited atom with its two L-electrons.

In particular, the recent suggestion that the energetics of solvation is solely a function of water density [12] does not appear to be supported experimentally. [13,14] Negative EA is not a sufficient condition for the formation of the cavity electron: [10] the dimers and multimers of the solvent molecules should also have negative EA, lacking a way of accommodating the electron through the formation of bonded or stacked multimer anions. The depth of the potential well in which the electron resides broadly correlates with the solvent polarity. For such solvents as liquid water and ammonia, the trap is more than 1 eV below the CB of the liquid and thermal excitation of the electron into the CB is impossible. Solvated electrons in such liquids move adiabatically, following fast molecular motions in the liquid; in lowtemperature solids, such electrons undergo trap-to-trap tunneling in competition with deepening of the traps due to the relaxation of the cavity, which may take as long as micro-and milliseconds at 20-100 K. In nonpolar liquids, some of which (e.g., alkanes) also yield solvated electrons, the traps are just 100-200 meV below the CB and thermal excitation of the electrons localized in such traps is sufficient to promote the electron back into the CB. Such electrons perpetually oscillate between the bottom of the CB and the solvent traps. Only recently has it been shown how fast are these electron equilibria in the alkanes: [2] the typical residence time of the electron in a trapped state is under 10 ps (at 300 K) and the typical trapping time of the quasifree CB electron is just 7.",

From Figure 5, for Q H =0 the cavity is larger than 2 −5/6 σ (=1.78 A), since the solvent peak does not start until after 2Å, and the CT results, which use 1.77 as a cavity radius, therefore overestimate the free energy at low charges (see Figures 2). This raises a question as to whether the differences between the simulation and CT calculations are due to the approximation of a continuum solvent or just an inconsistent choice of cavity size. Estimates of the cavity size can perhaps be found from an examination of the liquid structure, although assigning a sharp solute/solvent boundary from a continuous distribution is ambiguous. A simple heuristic method is to find the radius which gives the best value for the Coulomb energy, U es . For each value of Q H the optimal oxygen radius is found (the hydrogen radius is set equal to a constant value of 0.8Å) and the free energy is calculated from Eq. 4. The resulting U es and ∆A es are in almost exact agreement with the simulation values (see Table   1). Of course, this agreement is by construction and with one adjustable parameter it is a trivial accomplishment to fit the simulation energies. However, this method also gives good values for the electric fields, which is not by construction(see Figure   6). The optimized oxygen radius is shown for each value of the hydrogen charge in At high charges the semicontinuum results are different from the continuum results.",

For comparison, when decomposing the absorption into two components, the lower limits would be 8.4×10 12 cm −2 and 1.8×10 12 cm −2 for the +65 and the +85 km s −1 , respectively. The column density of all the 15 NH 3 gas giving rise to this absorption then depends on which excitation temperature most accurately describes the population distribution and what the OPR is. For example, if the absorption in this transition is well described by the model for the NH 3 rotation-inversion lines observed by ISO (Ceccarelli et al. 2002), arising in a hot foreground layer (T kin =700 K, N(NH 3 )=3×10 16 cm −2 ), the [ 14 N/ 15 N] would have to be of the order of unity, almost three orders of magnitude smaller than expected. Thus, the major part of the ground-state 15 NH 3 absorption is not likely to have such a hot origin. Instead, if most of this absorption were to originate in the warm envelope (T kin =20-40 K, Lis & Goldsmith 1991) with the same column density of 14 NH 3 as found by Ceccarelli et al. (2002), the [ 14 N/ 15 N] isotopic ratio would lie between 600 and 1500 (for OPR=1), in agreement with previous measurements. A high [ 14 N/ 15 N] isotopic ratio is expected when the dominant nucleosynthesis process is CNO hydrogen burning, since the slow reaction of 14 N(p,γ) 15 O is the one setting the pace of the cycle.\n\n\nWater",

Here we examine an alternative model in which the ammoniated electron is regarded as a solvent stabilized multimer radical anion, as was originally suggested by Symons [Chem. Soc. Rev. 1976, 5, 337]. In this model, most of the excess electron density resides in the frontier orbitals of N atoms in the ammonia molecules forming the solvation cavity; a fraction of this spin density is transferred to the molecules in the second solvation shell. The cavity is formed due to the repulsion between negatively charged solvent molecules. Using density functional theory calculations for small ammonia cluster anions in the gas phase, it is demonstrated that such core anions would semi-quantitatively account for the observed pattern of Knight shifts for 1 H and 14 N nuclei observed by NMR spectroscopy and the downshifted stretching and bending modes observed by infrared spectroscopy. It is speculated that the excess electrons in other aprotic solvents (but not in water and alcohols) might be, in this 2.respect, analogous to the ammoniated electron, with substantial transfer of the spin density into the frontier N and C orbitals of methyl, amino, and amide groups forming the solvation cavity.",

Examination of density maps for HOMO of the cluster anions suggests that the electron wavefunction inside the cavity and in the frontier orbitals of N atoms have opposite signs, which makes it easy to distinguish these two contributions. Qualitatively, this partition can be assessed by examination of isodensity contour maps of spin-bearing HOMO of the anions (like those shown below inFigures 3 and 4).

Alternatively, it might be possible to determine spin densities on 13 C nuclei in 13 CH 3 labeled glass-forming branched alkanes that are known to trap electrons below 77 K.65,69 So far, the emphasis of the EPR and electron spin echo studies has been to determine anisotropic hfcc on the cavity protons.69 Our models suggest that a measurement of isotropic hfcc on13 C nuclei would be a more direct probe of the mode of electron trapping. Equally important would be revisiting the EPR of hydrated electrons trapped in alkaline ices 70 since hyperfine couplings for 17 O nuclei for the hydrated electron have never been determined and thus quantitative estimates as to the degree of penetration of the electron density on the frontier orbitals of oxygen atoms are lacking. Considerable downshifts for bending and stretching modes in the Raman spectra of the hydrated electron 47,48 and the prominent 180 nm absorption band in its optical spectrum 71 provide indirect evidence for partial occupation of these orbitals by the electron. The distinction between the cavity electron and the solvent stabilized multimer anion might be a matter of degree only. 72 23.5. Acknowledgement. IAS thanks Professors F. T. Williams and B. J.

Regarding the radii of the spheres for the SES-type cavity, we adopt the same strategy that for the vdW-type cavity, which is scaling the vdW radius of each atom by a scaling factor f, with f being equal to 1.2. The radii of the new GEPOL spheres (those that are not associated to atoms) are calculated from the radii of the pair of spheres considered to create it, as well as from the distance between them and from the radius of the solvent molecule R S . In order to determine R S for each solvent, we start from the Stokes-Einstein formula, [31] that gives the radius, R SE , of a sphere that diffuses at the same rate as the solvent under consideration,\nR SE = k B T 6πηDð19Þ\nwhere D is the self-diffusion coefficient of the solvent, η its viscosity, k B the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Only the species in which some electron density is located inside this cavity (or the interstitial voids between the solvent molecules) can be rightfully called the \"solvated electron.\" All such species exhibit a characteristic broad, asymmetric absorption band in the VIS (visible) or NIR (near infrared) most of which is from s-p excitation of the s-like ground state electron to three nodal plike (bound) excited states (for electrons in deep traps in polar solvents) or free p-waves in the conduction band (CB), in less polar and nonpolar solvents. Since the cavity is slightly anisotropic, these p-like states are nondegenerate, and the VIS-NIR band is a superposition of three homogeneously broadened p-subbands. The more anisotropic is the cavity, the greater is the energy splitting between the centroids of these three subbands. To the blue of this composite s-p band, there is usually a Lorentzian \"tail\" extending towards the UV, due to the transitions from the ground state directly into the CB of the liquid. Some other excitations (s-d) might also contribute to this \"tail\" absorbance, according to the theory. [44][45][46]62] So characteristic is this \"a bell and a tail\" composite spectrum that most of the \"solvated electrons\" in liquids have been identified by this feature alone. Another distinguishing property of the solvated electron is pronounced temperature dependence of this spectrum, [13,14] with systematic red shift of the absorption peak and broadening of the absorption line with the increasing temperature. Solvated electron is, in fact, one of the best molecular \"thermometers\" in chemistry. These trends are commonly 6.",

Note that this formulation only accounts for a single sphere type each for all solute and for all solvent species and, thus, does not necessarily reflect the actual shape of the cavity very well. As a remedy, extensions to multiple different radii have, e.g., been proposed by Claverie et al. 162 Nevertheless, the accuracy of such scaled particle theory based approaches still rests fully on the choice of solute and solvent radii. Many approaches have correspondingly been taken to fit such radii to various experimental properties 163−165 and at various experimental conditions 166,167 (thereby implicitly including the grand-canonical dependence of the cavity formation on the electrochemical environment).

Quantum Cavities Emissions [26, 27, 28].\n\nIn the late 1946's Purcell made an observation that placing an excited atom or molecule in a cavity could either enhance or diminish spontaneous emission [26]. In the late 1980's technology was advanced enough to create a useful cavity and cavity quantum electrodynamics was born in a series of experiments [27,28]. In a cavity the mode structure of the vacuum is significantly reduced if the cavity size, d, is comparable to the wave length. Further, if an excited atom or molecule has an electric dipole oscillating parallel to the cavity \"wall\" (mirrors or Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBR)), its lifetime can become infinitely long if 2 d λ <\n\n. The B850 complex structure (Fig 10A (top)) meets this criteria; is it just a nano-cavity or nano-resonator in conjunction with other B850's surrounding B875?

The authors don't report the simulation cell size, but 47 neutral waters at ambient density would have a cell length of 11.3A, and given the small solvation volume of the hydrated electron, its cell size should be similar. The concern of finite-size effects is exacerbated for the twin cavity: given solvation shell radii of 3A (see Fig. 1i), the first solvation shells of the twin cavity structure span essentially the entire simulation shell (4 3A = 12A) and under periodic-boundary conditions, the two cavities interact with their neighboring periodic images as strongly as the primary image.

To my eye, there appear to be around 100 PIMD data points in Fig S1(a), and around 600 PIMD data points in Fig. S1(b), suggesting that the authors indeed tested their ML model on the underlying training set. This then raises a serious concern that their ML model might suffer from overfitting and/or selection bias, and be unable to accurately describe the potential energy surface away from the training points. To show the validity of the model, the authors should test the ML energy and force errors against MP2 data on structures randomly selected outside of the training set. Of particular importance will be showing that energies forces are equally well reproduced for the following types of hydrated electron structure they observe: cavity, twin cavity, delocalized.\n\nPlease, see above.",

From the magnitude of the hydration energy it is clear that in aqueous solutions at room temperature an unhydrated K + has no physical reality. A parameter that is sometimes considered is the !'hydrated ion radius.\" This is obtained by measuring the ion mobility in aqueous solution and then calculating the radius of a sphere that would move under the driving force of the applied electric field with a velocity equal to the measured ion mobility, assuming Stokes's law. The validity of this operation is questionable: Stokes's law is applicable only to particles that are large compared with the solvent, and no allowance is made for solvent exchange which is a process whereby the ion can advance through the solvent by adding hydration in the direction of travel. A further difficulty is that the \"hydrated ion radii\" for Rb + and Cs + are practically identical with that for K +, yet the ions behave in the membrane as if their sizes were different.",

It's not clear whether these included configurations corresponding to twin cavity structures -their lack of overall spherical symmetry about a single center makes an RDF inappropriate. Likewise, for the classical simulation, it's not clear whether the reported delocalized electron structures were included in the RDF. Again, their inclusion might be inappropriate since the electron centroid may be ill defined for a delocalized state. The authors should clarify. But with that said, it is interesting to note that the e-H RDFs (both quantum and classical) have non-zero values at distances of less than 0.5A. This puts the oxygen atom (occasionally) within 1.5A of the electron, which is less than the Van der Waals radius of the oxygen atom. This is consistent with the recent fluxional cavity picture put forward in J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 1263 (2020) and it would be helpful for this connection to be pointed out.\n\nWe haven't include the double cavity structures in the RDF since the gyration centers of such structure doesn't make sense due to the lack of spherical symmetry as suggested by the referee. Similarly the delocalized electron structures haven't been included either due to the same reasons. We have revised our manuscript accordingly to avoid potential misunderstanding. We are grateful for the relevant reference. We have added a brief discussion of how quantum delocalization reduces entropic pressure.\n\n\nReviewer #3",

Accordingly, the ΔE g calculated upon exchanging oleate for benzenethiolate ligands is plotted in Figure 4a (details on calculations are given in the Supplementary Information), [25][26][27][28] showing values that are much smaller than those found experimentally ( Figure 3a). In addition, it is also evident that the calculated ligand-induced dielectric confinement effect on the QD first exciton energy largely depends on the dielectric mismatch between the ligand shell and the inorganic core, yielding larger ΔE g values for CdS than CdSe and PbS in agreement with their highfrequency 29 dielectric constants (5.7 for CdS, 25 for 10.2 CdSe, 30 and 17.2 for PbS 31 ). Previous explanation for ligand-induced optical band gap reduction based on the description of ligands at the QD surface as dielectric shell indeed envisages anomalously large polarization effects. 3 As further analogy to core/shell heterostructures, colloidal QDs had been described as hybrid heterojunctions, in which the height of the potential energy barrier at the ligand/core interface affects quantum confinement.

The relativistic nature of MeV UED helps minimize space-charge repulsion effects to subsequently generate a high bunch charge electron pulse with a temporal resolution of ~100 fs (FWHM). A schematic of a typical MeV UED set-up based on one used at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) [Weathersby2015, Yang2018a, Yang2018b, Shen2019] is shown in Fig. 3.4A. In this SLAC MeV UED set-up, relativistic UED beams with an electron kinetic energy of 1 -4 MeV are typically generated through an S-band 1.6-cell photocathode RF gun consisting of two RF cavities (a half cell and a full cell), with a cross-sectional schematic shown in Fig. 3.4B [Weathersby2015, Yang2018b]. In the half-cell, a thin copper photocathode is impinged by a short (~100 fs), ultraviolet (266 nm) laser pulse generated by the frequency tripled output of an 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser system. This generates a pulse of electrons in a similar way to that of keV UED. What is different here in the MeV UED case is that the emitted electron pulse is then accelerated out of the RF cavity to much higher (MeV) kinetic energies using the relatively high electric field (>100 MV/m) [Akre2008] in the cavity as compared to keV UED (1-10 MV/m) in order to achieve electron pulses with pulse durations close to 100 fs (FWHM) [Chatelain2012].

However, this introduces a temporal jitter of 300 -400 fs between the pulsed electron beam and optical pulse used to generate the electron beam. A time-stamping procedure overcomes this optical-electron timing jitter, achieving a ´ of <100 fs as demonstrated in condensed matter UED studies [Gao2013]. Specifically, the timestamping procedure uses a laser-triggered streak camera to record the arrival time of each electron pulse, allowing for the arrival times to be resorted on a shot-to-shot basis [Gao2013]. Moreover, correction of °{™ to the attosecond timescale has been proposed using a lasercycle streaking method [Gliserin2016]. Another possibility in reducing ³ is to minimize the propagation distance of the electron beam to the target sample, with the ability to reach down to 500 fs for a 25 keV non-relativistic pulse. However, regardless of the propagation distance, the GVM between the optical excitation pulse and the non-relativistic electron probe pulse as they traverse the target sample will contribute significantly to Δ . This is typically not a problem with optical-pump optical-probe measurements since both pulses will traverse the target sample at the speed of light in vacuum, . For example, a beam of non-relativistic 25 keV electrons with a speed of 0.31 will take 4.3 ps to traverse a gaseous molecular beam with a diameter of 400 µm, whilst it will take 1.3 ps for the optical pulse with a speed of to travel the same distance. Thus, the GVM of roughly 3 ps will significantly contribute to the temporal blurring of the transient structures in time-resolved UED measurements. In fact, GVM not only arises from differences between the velocities of the optical and electron beams but additional temporal broadening also arises from non-collinear geometric overlap of the two pulses. Minimising the effects of GVM and temporal broadening can be achieved by (i) accelerating the pulsed electron beam to relativistic kinetic energies (i.e. 1 -4 MeV) as well as (ii) using a collinear geometry [Williamson1993, Centurion2016].

To investigate whether it is possible to obtain sufficient scattering information from hydrogen relative to carbon, the ratio of the scattering crosssections of carbon to hydrogen, ë / ì , is shown in Fig. 4.12B for UED at an impact energy of 25 keV (green) and LIED at 50 eV (red) and 100 eV (blue). The angular range of typical operation in UED (green shaded area) shows that ë is a factor of 20 lower than ì , making it quite challenging to locate the position of hydrogen atoms within a molecule using UED imaging experiments. Whilst in the case of LIED, the ë / ì ratio approaches within one-orderof-magnitude (e.g. 0.5 ratio at 50 eV, and 0.2 ratio at 100 eV), enabling LIED to resolve the atomic positions of both light and heavy atoms in a target structure across a wide variety of ê . In particular, the appreciable scattering amplitude of hydrogen obtained with LIED makes it sensitive to locating the positions of hydrogen atoms in molecules, which other techniques (e.g. UED, non-covariance/coincidence CEI) are insensitive to and instead use heavier \"tag\" atoms such as halogens (i.e. iodine, bromine) to identify the molecular structure. This is particularly significant as most molecules contain hydrogen atoms, which in fact play a pivotal role in many biological and chemical processes such as hydrogen bonding in DNA and proton motion during respiration. Two important tools are required to perform MIR-LIED measurements: (i) a femtosecond MIR laser source with a repetition rate of >100 kHz, and (ii) a particle spectrometer that can simultaneously detect electrons and ions under coincidence conditions. Fig. 4.13A shows the pulse energy as a function of repetition rate for typical laser systems, with the diagonal lines indicating the average power. From this, it is clear that high average power (>10 W) is required to achieve femtosecond pulses with high pulse energies (~100 µJ) at high repetition rates (>100 kHz) in order to perform MIR-LIED measurements.

Due to an elastic scattering cross section that is larger by about a factor of ∼ 10 6 for 30 keV electrons compared to 12 keV photons along with the fact that inelastic, destructive reactions (electron impact excitation) occur with smaller cross sections and a factor of thousand less energy deposition compared to photon absorption, the number of electrons in the beam needed to record images as well as unwanted modifications of the sample molecules are significantly reduced [10]. In the most promising 'conventional gun' scenario, bunches of up to 10 5 electrons of 30 keV within ∼ 600 fs focused to spot sizes of 200 µm have been demonstrated to be feasible recently and structural information has been achieved. 100 fs pulse durations for bunches of 10 4 electrons seem to be feasible optimizing existing gun designs [10].",

E, 2012, 86, 051911, and Chapman et al., New Journal of Physics, 2012, 14(11), 115015).Will strong ultrashort pulses like these really be useful for diffractive imaging of chemical and biological systems and processes?John Spence answered: I agree we only want the bandwidth, and this can be an incoherent superposition of energies for Laue diffraction, it does not need to be coherent (coherence makes possible the phasing method I also suggest).The existing theory and experiment for our \"diffract-then-destroy\" experiments suggest that, for the purposes of nding atomic positions, the instantaneous elastic scattering will terminate even for attosecond pulses before the damaging photoelectron cascade gets going.Note that it is not necessary to destroy the sample to avoid damage.If the attosecond pulses are weak, one can still out-run radiation damage.\n\nMichael Woerner opened the discussion of the paper by Jasper van Thor by commenting: Typically, chemical reactions are performed in the liquid phase.We investigated an intra-crystalline acid-base reaction in ammonium sulphate: The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2010, 133, 064509.",

In particular, these models allow the classical trajectories to be calculated and mapped to experimental features, enabling the energy and propagation times of the returning electrons to be characterized. Measurements can be performed in the quasistatic regime (i.e. ≈ 0.3) by either increasing the peak laser intensity, 3 , or using a longer driver wavelength, . Fig. 4.8A shows that at a fixed peak laser intensity, 3 , of 1 × 10 Mä Wcm -2 typically used in near-infrared (NIR) measurements, one can perform measurements deep into the quasistatic regime by using a longer driver wavelength, . Whereas increasing the peak laser intensity has the disadvantage of depleting the number of ground-state molecules before the peak of the laser pulse, which is strongly dependent on the É of the molecule. This leads to a decrease in the number of rescattered electrons generated as a result of an increase in the direct ionization of molecules on the rising edge of the laser pulse. Thus, it is important to achieve an ionization fraction of much less than unity to have sufficient neutral target density to perform rescattering measurements. To exemplify this point, Fig. 4.8B shows the fraction of molecules ionized at the peak of a six cycle laser pulse as a function of driver wavelength for two molecules at = 0.3: (i) naphthalene with an É of 8 eV (which is a typical É for most relatively large organic molecules), and (ii) acetylene with an É of 12 eV. In the case of acetylene with a relatively high É , achieving a = 0.3 at 0.8 µm requires a peak intensity of > 1 × 10 Må Wcm -2 which leads to an ionization fraction of unity, already reaching ionization saturation. Whilst an ionization fraction of <0.01 with 3 < 1 × 10 Mä Wcm -2 is achievable at the longer wavelength of 3.1 µm.

The laser pulse is divided with a non-polarizing beam splitter and propagates along two paths. The first path, using approximately 10% of the total power, passes through two BBO crystals to frequency triple the pulse before imaging the beam onto a photocathode to generate electrons. The remaining power (the pump pulse) is sent to a delay stage to control the timing delay between the electrons and laser pulse. The pump pulse is then reflected off a grating to tilt the intensity front. Tilting the pulse reduces the temporal blurring caused by group velocity mismatch. 31,32 The laser is introduced to the sample chamber at a 60 angle relative to electron propagation. This matches the velocity of the laser and electron beams along the direction of propagation of the electrons. Figure 2 shows how the intensity front of the electron and laser pulses point parallel to electron propagation, as well as how the pulses from each beam overlap temporally. The tilted pulse is imaged onto the gas jet where it is measured to have a 260 lm (V) Â 190 lm (H) FWHM diameter and 200 fs pulse duration. The average power of the laser beam was measured to be 4.92 W just before entering the chamber.\n\n\nStructural Dynamics\n\n\nARTICLE\n\nscitation.org/journal/sdy",

In the present work, we describe the prototype setup of the electron diffractometer used in this study. At the core of the prototype diffractometer was an EIGER X 1M detector (DECTRIS Ltd), a hybrid pixel detector that is frequently used in X-ray crystallography but that is also suitable for detecting electrons (Tinti et al., 2018). This hybrid pixel detector has a negligible readout time of 3 ms, which enables shutterless, continuous data collection (Broennimann et al., 2006). It has a frame rate of up to 3 kHz, although in this study it was operated at 100 Hz. This enables fine-slicing of data (Pflugrath, 1999;Casanas et al., 2016) at a fast rotation of the sample for instruments where the beam intensity cannot be arbitrarily reduced. The sensor layer of 450 mm makes it radiation-hard at electron energies of 200 keV and makes a beam stop unnecessary (Tinti et al., 2018). The EIGER X 1M has a high count rate of 0.5 Â 10 8 s À1 mm À2 , which was saturated only by the top 2-3 pixels of the direct beam and by none of the reflections. At 100 Hz, the dynamic range of 16 bit was well above all recorded intensities. The detector is noise-free, and only scattering inside the TEM added to the noise in the data. The prototype diffractometer also includes solutions for proper calibration of the instrument, i.e. the reliable determination of experimental parameters. This work may act as a reference for future instrument design, and aims at encouraging other research groups to determine chemical structures from submicrometresized crystals with existing TEMs before a fully integrated solution becomes available.\n\n\nMethods and materials\n\n\nInstrumentation",

Electron pulse generation\n\nThe development of the electron source and the generation of ultrafast electron pulses played a vital role in the establishment of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. The developments that are being carried out on the electron source focus on the enhancement of the temporal and spatial coherent resolution to capture faster dynamics of matter with higher resolution.\n\nSpatial coherence, which is defined through the maximum distance between two objects for which interference is still visible on the screen, is a critical parameter of the electron source and is determined by the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths of the source (see Section 3). On the other hand, the temporal resolution is defined by the electron pulse duration and the phase stability at the interaction stage. Both the temporal and spatial resolutions are reduced by the space-charge effect due to Coulomb repulsion of electrons in the wave packet [114], as discussed earlier in Section 2. The electron beam intensity requirements for the source are more difficult to define, since they depend on the sample under study, namely on the phase (i.e., solid, gas), the thickness, which should be in the range of 10-100 nm, and the background. Nevertheless, at least ~ 10 4 -10 5 electrons per pulse are needed to clearly resolve the diffraction peak and/or obtain a clear image in UED and UEM, respectively [18]. From the theoretical modelling and experimental study, it is obvious that it is impossible to use the conventional electron gun parameters to attain sub-ps electron pulses at the sample position with reasonable electron number densities [114][115][116]. In the pioneering work by Siwick and Miller on implementing a compact electron gun design, 600 fs pulse durations with up to 10,000 electrons per pulse were achieved [22]. This paved the way for the development of a source of high-brightness electron beams with pulse durations on the order of hundred femtoseconds, based on Radio Frequency (RF) compression [96,102,117], which will be discussed later.\n\n\n.

Quick motion of monochromator is also used for the high-rate real-time-resolved XAFS observation, which is now approaching 100 Hz observation [14,15]. This technique is the exact opposite of dispersive optics from the viewpoint of the motion of optics. Dispersive optics shows no mechanical motion during XAFS observation, which brings about high data stability and low sample generality. Successive XAFS spectra taken by dispersive optics are very stable without any energy correction in one dataset. However, dispersive optics is almost only used under transmission mode. It is also noted that quick motion of monochromator is difficult in high-energy region because of the narrow bandwidth of diffracted X rays.",

Using state-of-the-art simulations in three molecules (deuterium, ethylene, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene), we demonstrate that the nature of the nuclear wavepacket initially prepared by the pump laser, and its subsequent dispersion as it propagates along the reaction path, limits the spatial resolution attainable in a structural dynamics experiment. The delocalization of the wavepacket leads to a pronounced damping of the diffraction signal at large values of the momentum transfer vector q, an observation supported by a simple analytical model. This suggests that high-q measurements, beyond 10-15 Å −1 , provide scant experimental payback, and that it may be advantageous to prioritize the signal-to-noise ratio and the time-resolution of the experiment as determined by parameters such as the repetition-rate, the photon flux, and the pulse durations. We expect these considerations to influence future experimental designs, including source development and detection schemes.\n\nIntroduction",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter. Y/n. This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

Employing a MHz relativistic electron gun in time-resolved MeV UED measurements will subsequently require a MHz high-average power optical source which is used to photoexcite the target sample. Such a MHz optical source will require an average power of greater than a kW [Schippers2019].\n\nFor both LIED and UED, more advanced structural retrieval algorithms are needed to successfully retrieve the geometric structure of more complex biomolecules, such as azo complexes or peptides. This is particularly important for time-resolved measurements which will possess multiple transient structures that may have non-negligible contributions to timeresolved electron diffraction data. Current retrieval algorithms (e.g. QRS and IAM theories) may not be tractable for such large molecular systems, requiring the extrema to be found in a multi-dimensional solution space. One possible alternative in the case of LIED, as discussed earlier, would be the use of FT-LIED, which does not rely on a priori knowledge of molecular structure or retrieval algorithms.\n\nFinally, user-facilities based on field-free and field-dressed electron diffraction techniques similar to X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) user-facilities that are currently offered will lead to a greater amount of interdisciplinary research between physics, chemistry and biology. The SLAC MeV UED user facility now offers external user experimental runs through a proposal selection procedure similar to that of XFELs, enabling MeV UED research in material and chemical systems [SLAC2019]. Both user-based facilities (e.g. XFELs, SLAC MeV UED) are highly complementary to small-scale laboratory-based techniques (e.g. LIED, keV UED, HHG), with both cases pushing one another to achieve the ultimate space and time resolution in time-resolved studies of biologically-relevant, complexes gas-phase molecules.\n\nFig. 1. 1\n1Various different physical phenomena in chemistry, biology and physics together with their corresponding spatial and temporal resolutions.

II). Although a similar momentum transfer range (i.e. Δ = 1 − 20 Å -1 ) can be achieved for both CED/UED and LIED, the approach used to achieve high momentum transfers is quite different for both methods. In the case of CED/UED, the kinetic energy of the incoming electron beam is typically increased (e.g. see 10 keV and 50 keV distributions in Fig. 4.11). Whilst in LIED, kinetic energies of ≳ 50 eV and scattering angles of ≳ 40° are adequate to achieve sufficient momentum transfer to pinpoint the atomic locations. To explain the scattering angle ranges that CED/UED ( = 0 − 12°) and LIED ( = 40 − 180°) measurements typically operate in, we must consider the scattering amplitudes and crosssections as a function of scattering angle. Fig. 4.12A shows the scattering amplitude for a carbon (blue) and a hydrogen (red) atom at impact energies of 50 eV and 20 keV typically used in LIED (solid lines) and UED (dashed lines), respectively. In the case of UED, elastic scattering information is restricted to = 0 − 10° due to the head-on nature of forwardscattered collisions that occur at the high impact energies used in UED. Going to > 10° is not viable in UED since the scattering amplitude significantly decreases, as is seen for both carbon and hydrogen. Whilst in the case of LIED, scattering information can be obtained at a wide variety of , providing greater scattering information than in UED. For example, at ê = 90°, the scattering amplitude from LIED is approximately 10 â times larger than that of UED. It should also be noted that the scattering amplitude of elastic scattering is not only dependent on the impact energy and the scattering angle, ê , of the rescattering electron but also on the identity of the atom. Typically, light atoms (e.g. hydrogen) have a lower scattering amplitude (and thus scattering cross-section, ) relative to heavy atoms (e.g. carbon). This is clearly seen by the smaller scattering amplitude for hydrogen than carbon at all energies and scattering angles in Fig. 4.12A. To",

Unlike the optical counterpart, however, TEM imaging is an interference image produced by the interaction of electrons and atoms as in the famous double-slit experiment (Fig. 4a). 10) Interestingly, TEM produces the image of the object only when it is slightly out of focus, i.e., no image is given when defocus is zero (at the Gaussian focus). It is also important to note that, in our molecular imaging studies below, it only suffices to consider that electrons interact with the specimen molecules exclusively as a wave and not as particles except when they hit the detector where each electron is recorded as a dot. No momentum of the incident electron was transferred to the single molecule when passing nearby the molecule, which was supported by the experimental fact that no molecule was blown away to the direction of the injection of an electron. 11) At 120-kV acceleration conditions that we routinely used (de Broglie wavelength of 3.35 pm at 120-kV acceleration; cf. C-C bonds, 125-156 pm), we shot about 1 # 10 5 electrons per second·nm 2 , which travel at 59% of the speed of light passing through a molecule of, for example, 1-nm thickness within an attosecond and arrive at a pixel detector where electrons are detected as particles (Fig. 4a).

This is particularly useful for high-repetition rate UED/LIED (i.e. >100 kHz) which will require high-average power optical sources. DUV pulses through singlering PCFs is generated through the emission of dispersive waves (DWs) from self-compressed solitons. Figs. 5.3A and 5.3B show the simulated temporal and spectral profiles of the selfcompressed deep ultraviolet pulse, respectively, with 53 bar Helium-filled single-ring PCFs using 17 µJ pulse energy. Here within the fibre, the generated DW at ~200 nm was selfcompressed down to <10 fs (FWHM) possessing a pulse energy of 2 µJ. Figs. 5.3C and 5.3D show the measured and simulated output UV pulse energy, respectively, for four different types of rare gases that fill the fiber. Here, the UV pulse energy is clearly dependent on both the identity of the rare gas and the input energy, with the best performance found to be with 53 bar of helium and an input pulse energy of >15 µJ [Köttig2017]. Utilizing such few-to-subfs tuneable UV-to-VUV pulses with 1 -10 µJ pulse energies coupled with MIR-LIED has the potential to record attosecond \"molecular movies\" of, for example, proton transfer and roaming reactions which occur on the sub-100-fs timescale. Thirdly, as discussed in Section IVc, electron diffraction techniques that rely on the strongfield tunnel ionization of the sample to launch the recolliding electron must take into account that the ionization potential decreases with larger, more complex molecules. Consequently, a suitable balance must be struck between ionization saturation and ionizing the sample molecule to initiate the elastic rescattering process.",

Indeed, there is no denying that vertical temperature gradients do exist in such heated or illuminated catalyst structures. Again, such gradients were measured by some of the authors of the current manuscript [7] and by others (e.g. [12,9]); they can also be extrapolated from the numerical simulations presented in Fig. S14 (performed over small voxels), and were described in detail in [5,11] -see also Appendix B. Now, since the high emissivity setting may result in a temperature reading which is colder from the actual surface temperature, we now show that the data can be fully reproduced with only thermal reactions. To do so, we evaluate the reaction rate by integrating the Arrhenius law over the entire sample, taking into account the calculated gradients T ( r) (see Appendix B) and assuming that the real surface temperature is T S plus some temperature shift δT , i.e., d rR 0 exp − Ea k B (T ( r;T S )+δT ) , with R 0 and E a taken from an Arrhenius fit to the reaction rate in the dark.\n\nIn particular, if the temperatures are shifted by δT = 27K (CW) and δT = 36K (white light), one obtains perfect predictions of the measured reaction rate without modifying the activation energy nor the prefactor (empty triangles in Fig. 1). Such a shift is of the same order of magnitude as the discrepancy between the thermocouple and camera readings reported by the authors themselves (Fig. S13(c)), and much smaller than the estimated error due to the emissivity and comparable to the independent thermal calculations shown in Appendix B.\n\nThus, by Ockham's razor, it seems far more likely that our simple yet remarkably quantitative thermal argument is the correct explanation for the faster chemistry reported compared with the speculative explanation provided in the original manuscript. Definitive proof of \"hot\" electron driven catalysis, particularly in light of the issues discussed above, will require approaches that can more precisely isolate thermal effects.",

The relativistic nature of MeV UED helps minimize space-charge repulsion effects to subsequently generate a high bunch charge electron pulse with a temporal resolution of ~100 fs (FWHM). A schematic of a typical MeV UED set-up based on one used at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) [Weathersby2015, Yang2018a, Yang2018b, Shen2019] is shown in Fig. 3.4A. In this SLAC MeV UED set-up, relativistic UED beams with an electron kinetic energy of 1 -4 MeV are typically generated through an S-band 1.6-cell photocathode RF gun consisting of two RF cavities (a half cell and a full cell), with a cross-sectional schematic shown in Fig. 3.4B [Weathersby2015, Yang2018b]. In the half-cell, a thin copper photocathode is impinged by a short (~100 fs), ultraviolet (266 nm) laser pulse generated by the frequency tripled output of an 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser system. This generates a pulse of electrons in a similar way to that of keV UED. What is different here in the MeV UED case is that the emitted electron pulse is then accelerated out of the RF cavity to much higher (MeV) kinetic energies using the relatively high electric field (>100 MV/m) [Akre2008] in the cavity as compared to keV UED (1-10 MV/m) in order to achieve electron pulses with pulse durations close to 100 fs (FWHM) [Chatelain2012].

However, this introduces a temporal jitter of 300 -400 fs between the pulsed electron beam and optical pulse used to generate the electron beam. A time-stamping procedure overcomes this optical-electron timing jitter, achieving a ´ of <100 fs as demonstrated in condensed matter UED studies [Gao2013]. Specifically, the timestamping procedure uses a laser-triggered streak camera to record the arrival time of each electron pulse, allowing for the arrival times to be resorted on a shot-to-shot basis [Gao2013]. Moreover, correction of °{™ to the attosecond timescale has been proposed using a lasercycle streaking method [Gliserin2016]. Another possibility in reducing ³ is to minimize the propagation distance of the electron beam to the target sample, with the ability to reach down to 500 fs for a 25 keV non-relativistic pulse. However, regardless of the propagation distance, the GVM between the optical excitation pulse and the non-relativistic electron probe pulse as they traverse the target sample will contribute significantly to Δ . This is typically not a problem with optical-pump optical-probe measurements since both pulses will traverse the target sample at the speed of light in vacuum, . For example, a beam of non-relativistic 25 keV electrons with a speed of 0.31 will take 4.3 ps to traverse a gaseous molecular beam with a diameter of 400 µm, whilst it will take 1.3 ps for the optical pulse with a speed of to travel the same distance. Thus, the GVM of roughly 3 ps will significantly contribute to the temporal blurring of the transient structures in time-resolved UED measurements. In fact, GVM not only arises from differences between the velocities of the optical and electron beams but additional temporal broadening also arises from non-collinear geometric overlap of the two pulses. Minimising the effects of GVM and temporal broadening can be achieved by (i) accelerating the pulsed electron beam to relativistic kinetic energies (i.e. 1 -4 MeV) as well as (ii) using a collinear geometry [Williamson1993, Centurion2016].

To investigate whether it is possible to obtain sufficient scattering information from hydrogen relative to carbon, the ratio of the scattering crosssections of carbon to hydrogen, ë / ì , is shown in Fig. 4.12B for UED at an impact energy of 25 keV (green) and LIED at 50 eV (red) and 100 eV (blue). The angular range of typical operation in UED (green shaded area) shows that ë is a factor of 20 lower than ì , making it quite challenging to locate the position of hydrogen atoms within a molecule using UED imaging experiments. Whilst in the case of LIED, the ë / ì ratio approaches within one-orderof-magnitude (e.g. 0.5 ratio at 50 eV, and 0.2 ratio at 100 eV), enabling LIED to resolve the atomic positions of both light and heavy atoms in a target structure across a wide variety of ê . In particular, the appreciable scattering amplitude of hydrogen obtained with LIED makes it sensitive to locating the positions of hydrogen atoms in molecules, which other techniques (e.g. UED, non-covariance/coincidence CEI) are insensitive to and instead use heavier \"tag\" atoms such as halogens (i.e. iodine, bromine) to identify the molecular structure. This is particularly significant as most molecules contain hydrogen atoms, which in fact play a pivotal role in many biological and chemical processes such as hydrogen bonding in DNA and proton motion during respiration. Two important tools are required to perform MIR-LIED measurements: (i) a femtosecond MIR laser source with a repetition rate of >100 kHz, and (ii) a particle spectrometer that can simultaneously detect electrons and ions under coincidence conditions. Fig. 4.13A shows the pulse energy as a function of repetition rate for typical laser systems, with the diagonal lines indicating the average power. From this, it is clear that high average power (>10 W) is required to achieve femtosecond pulses with high pulse energies (~100 µJ) at high repetition rates (>100 kHz) in order to perform MIR-LIED measurements. For example, a 3.25 µm laser pulse with a pulse energy of 131 µJ and a pulse duration of 97 fs (FWHM; sub-9-cycle) were generated",

Due to an elastic scattering cross section that is larger by about a factor of ∼ 10 6 for 30 keV electrons compared to 12 keV photons along with the fact that inelastic, destructive reactions (electron impact excitation) occur with smaller cross sections and a factor of thousand less energy deposition compared to photon absorption, the number of electrons in the beam needed to record images as well as unwanted modifications of the sample molecules are significantly reduced [10]. In the most promising 'conventional gun' scenario, bunches of up to 10 5 electrons of 30 keV within ∼ 600 fs focused to spot sizes of 200 µm have been demonstrated to be feasible recently and structural information has been achieved. 100 fs pulse durations for bunches of 10 4 electrons seem to be feasible optimizing existing gun designs [10].",

In particular, these models allow the classical trajectories to be calculated and mapped to experimental features, enabling the energy and propagation times of the returning electrons to be characterized. Measurements can be performed in the quasistatic regime (i.e. ≈ 0.3) by either increasing the peak laser intensity, 3 , or using a longer driver wavelength, . Fig. 4.8A shows that at a fixed peak laser intensity, 3 , of 1 × 10 Mä Wcm -2 typically used in near-infrared (NIR) measurements, one can perform measurements deep into the quasistatic regime by using a longer driver wavelength, . Whereas increasing the peak laser intensity has the disadvantage of depleting the number of ground-state molecules before the peak of the laser pulse, which is strongly dependent on the É of the molecule. This leads to a decrease in the number of rescattered electrons generated as a result of an increase in the direct ionization of molecules on the rising edge of the laser pulse. Thus, it is important to achieve an ionization fraction of much less than unity to have sufficient neutral target density to perform rescattering measurements. To exemplify this point, Fig. 4.8B shows the fraction of molecules ionized at the peak of a six cycle laser pulse as a function of driver wavelength for two molecules at = 0.3: (i) naphthalene with an É of 8 eV (which is a typical É for most relatively large organic molecules), and (ii) acetylene with an É of 12 eV. In the case of acetylene with a relatively high É , achieving a = 0.3 at 0.8 µm requires a peak intensity of > 1 × 10 Må Wcm -2 which leads to an ionization fraction of unity, already reaching ionization saturation. Whilst an ionization fraction of <0.01 with 3 < 1 × 10 Mä Wcm -2 is achievable at the longer wavelength of 3.1 µm.

The laser pulse is divided with a non-polarizing beam splitter and propagates along two paths. The first path, using approximately 10% of the total power, passes through two BBO crystals to frequency triple the pulse before imaging the beam onto a photocathode to generate electrons. The remaining power (the pump pulse) is sent to a delay stage to control the timing delay between the electrons and laser pulse. The pump pulse is then reflected off a grating to tilt the intensity front. Tilting the pulse reduces the temporal blurring caused by group velocity mismatch. 31,32 The laser is introduced to the sample chamber at a 60 angle relative to electron propagation. This matches the velocity of the laser and electron beams along the direction of propagation of the electrons. Figure 2 shows how the intensity front of the electron and laser pulses point parallel to electron propagation, as well as how the pulses from each beam overlap temporally. The tilted pulse is imaged onto the gas jet where it is measured to have a 260 lm (V) Â 190 lm (H) FWHM diameter and 200 fs pulse duration. The average power of the laser beam was measured to be 4.92 W just before entering the chamber.\n\n\nStructural Dynamics\n\n\nARTICLE\n\nscitation.org/journal/sdy",

In the present work, we describe the prototype setup of the electron diffractometer used in this study. At the core of the prototype diffractometer was an EIGER X 1M detector (DECTRIS Ltd), a hybrid pixel detector that is frequently used in X-ray crystallography but that is also suitable for detecting electrons (Tinti et al., 2018). This hybrid pixel detector has a negligible readout time of 3 ms, which enables shutterless, continuous data collection (Broennimann et al., 2006). It has a frame rate of up to 3 kHz, although in this study it was operated at 100 Hz. This enables fine-slicing of data (Pflugrath, 1999;Casanas et al., 2016) at a fast rotation of the sample for instruments where the beam intensity cannot be arbitrarily reduced. The sensor layer of 450 mm makes it radiation-hard at electron energies of 200 keV and makes a beam stop unnecessary (Tinti et al., 2018). The EIGER X 1M has a high count rate of 0.5 Â 10 8 s À1 mm À2 , which was saturated only by the top 2-3 pixels of the direct beam and by none of the reflections. At 100 Hz, the dynamic range of 16 bit was well above all recorded intensities. The detector is noise-free, and only scattering inside the TEM added to the noise in the data. The prototype diffractometer also includes solutions for proper calibration of the instrument, i.e. the reliable determination of experimental parameters. This work may act as a reference for future instrument design, and aims at encouraging other research groups to determine chemical structures from submicrometresized crystals with existing TEMs before a fully integrated solution becomes available.\n\n\nMethods and materials\n\n\nInstrumentation",

Electron pulse generation\n\nThe development of the electron source and the generation of ultrafast electron pulses played a vital role in the establishment of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. The developments that are being carried out on the electron source focus on the enhancement of the temporal and spatial coherent resolution to capture faster dynamics of matter with higher resolution.\n\nSpatial coherence, which is defined through the maximum distance between two objects for which interference is still visible on the screen, is a critical parameter of the electron source and is determined by the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths of the source (see Section 3). On the other hand, the temporal resolution is defined by the electron pulse duration and the phase stability at the interaction stage. Both the temporal and spatial resolutions are reduced by the space-charge effect due to Coulomb repulsion of electrons in the wave packet [114], as discussed earlier in Section 2. The electron beam intensity requirements for the source are more difficult to define, since they depend on the sample under study, namely on the phase (i.e., solid, gas), the thickness, which should be in the range of 10-100 nm, and the background. Nevertheless, at least ~ 10 4 -10 5 electrons per pulse are needed to clearly resolve the diffraction peak and/or obtain a clear image in UED and UEM, respectively [18]. From the theoretical modelling and experimental study, it is obvious that it is impossible to use the conventional electron gun parameters to attain sub-ps electron pulses at the sample position with reasonable electron number densities [114][115][116]. In the pioneering work by Siwick and Miller on implementing a compact electron gun design, 600 fs pulse durations with up to 10,000 electrons per pulse were achieved [22]. This paved the way for the development of a source of high-brightness electron beams with pulse durations on the order of hundred femtoseconds, based on Radio Frequency (RF) compression [96,102,117], which will be discussed later.\n\n\n.

This technique is the exact opposite of dispersive optics from the viewpoint of the motion of optics. Dispersive optics shows no mechanical motion during XAFS observation, which brings about high data stability and low sample generality. Successive XAFS spectra taken by dispersive optics are very stable without any energy correction in one dataset. However, dispersive optics is almost only used under transmission mode.

Using state-of-the-art simulations in three molecules (deuterium, ethylene, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene), we demonstrate that the nature of the nuclear wavepacket initially prepared by the pump laser, and its subsequent dispersion as it propagates along the reaction path, limits the spatial resolution attainable in a structural dynamics experiment. The delocalization of the wavepacket leads to a pronounced damping of the diffraction signal at large values of the momentum transfer vector q, an observation supported by a simple analytical model. This suggests that high-q measurements, beyond 10-15 Å −1 , provide scant experimental payback, and that it may be advantageous to prioritize the signal-to-noise ratio and the time-resolution of the experiment as determined by parameters such as the repetition-rate, the photon flux, and the pulse durations. We expect these considerations to influence future experimental designs, including source development and detection schemes.\n\nIntroduction",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter. Y/n. This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

Employing a MHz relativistic electron gun in time-resolved MeV UED measurements will subsequently require a MHz high-average power optical source which is used to photoexcite the target sample. Such a MHz optical source will require an average power of greater than a kW [Schippers2019].\n\nFor both LIED and UED, more advanced structural retrieval algorithms are needed to successfully retrieve the geometric structure of more complex biomolecules, such as azo complexes or peptides. This is particularly important for time-resolved measurements which will possess multiple transient structures that may have non-negligible contributions to timeresolved electron diffraction data. Current retrieval algorithms (e.g. QRS and IAM theories) may not be tractable for such large molecular systems, requiring the extrema to be found in a multi-dimensional solution space. One possible alternative in the case of LIED, as discussed earlier, would be the use of FT-LIED, which does not rely on a priori knowledge of molecular structure or retrieval algorithms.\n\nFinally, user-facilities based on field-free and field-dressed electron diffraction techniques similar to X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) user-facilities that are currently offered will lead to a greater amount of interdisciplinary research between physics, chemistry and biology. The SLAC MeV UED user facility now offers external user experimental runs through a proposal selection procedure similar to that of XFELs, enabling MeV UED research in material and chemical systems [SLAC2019]. Both user-based facilities (e.g. XFELs, SLAC MeV UED) are highly complementary to small-scale laboratory-based techniques (e.g. LIED, keV UED, HHG), with both cases pushing one another to achieve the ultimate space and time resolution in time-resolved studies of biologically-relevant, complexes gas-phase molecules.\n\nFig. 1. 1\n1Various different physical phenomena in chemistry, biology and physics together with their corresponding spatial and temporal resolutions.

II). Although a similar momentum transfer range (i.e. Δ = 1 − 20 Å -1 ) can be achieved for both CED/UED and LIED, the approach used to achieve high momentum transfers is quite different for both methods. In the case of CED/UED, the kinetic energy of the incoming electron beam is typically increased (e.g. see 10 keV and 50 keV distributions in Fig. 4.11). Whilst in LIED, kinetic energies of ≳ 50 eV and scattering angles of ≳ 40° are adequate to achieve sufficient momentum transfer to pinpoint the atomic locations. To explain the scattering angle ranges that CED/UED ( = 0 − 12°) and LIED ( = 40 − 180°) measurements typically operate in, we must consider the scattering amplitudes and crosssections as a function of scattering angle. Fig. 4.12A shows the scattering amplitude for a carbon (blue) and a hydrogen (red) atom at impact energies of 50 eV and 20 keV typically used in LIED (solid lines) and UED (dashed lines), respectively. In the case of UED, elastic scattering information is restricted to = 0 − 10° due to the head-on nature of forwardscattered collisions that occur at the high impact energies used in UED. Going to > 10° is not viable in UED since the scattering amplitude significantly decreases, as is seen for both carbon and hydrogen. Whilst in the case of LIED, scattering information can be obtained at a wide variety of , providing greater scattering information than in UED. For example, at ê = 90°, the scattering amplitude from LIED is approximately 10 â times larger than that of UED. It should also be noted that the scattering amplitude of elastic scattering is not only dependent on the impact energy and the scattering angle, ê , of the rescattering electron but also on the identity of the atom. Typically, light atoms (e.g. hydrogen) have a lower scattering amplitude (and thus scattering cross-section, ) relative to heavy atoms (e.g. carbon). This is clearly seen by the smaller scattering amplitude for hydrogen than carbon at all energies and scattering angles in Fig. 4.12A. To",

Unlike the optical counterpart, however, TEM imaging is an interference image produced by the interaction of electrons and atoms as in the famous double-slit experiment (Fig. 4a). 10) Interestingly, TEM produces the image of the object only when it is slightly out of focus, i.e., no image is given when defocus is zero (at the Gaussian focus). It is also important to note that, in our molecular imaging studies below, it only suffices to consider that electrons interact with the specimen molecules exclusively as a wave and not as particles except when they hit the detector where each electron is recorded as a dot. No momentum of the incident electron was transferred to the single molecule when passing nearby the molecule, which was supported by the experimental fact that no molecule was blown away to the direction of the injection of an electron. 11) At 120-kV acceleration conditions that we routinely used (de Broglie wavelength of 3.35 pm at 120-kV acceleration; cf. C-C bonds, 125-156 pm), we shot about 1 # 10 5 electrons per second·nm 2 , which travel at 59% of the speed of light passing through a molecule of, for example, 1-nm thickness within an attosecond and arrive at a pixel detector where electrons are detected as particles (Fig. 4a).

This is particularly useful for high-repetition rate UED/LIED (i.e. >100 kHz) which will require high-average power optical sources. DUV pulses through singlering PCFs is generated through the emission of dispersive waves (DWs) from self-compressed solitons. Figs. 5.3A and 5.3B show the simulated temporal and spectral profiles of the selfcompressed deep ultraviolet pulse, respectively, with 53 bar Helium-filled single-ring PCFs using 17 µJ pulse energy. Here within the fibre, the generated DW at ~200 nm was selfcompressed down to <10 fs (FWHM) possessing a pulse energy of 2 µJ. Figs. 5.3C and 5.3D show the measured and simulated output UV pulse energy, respectively, for four different types of rare gases that fill the fiber. Here, the UV pulse energy is clearly dependent on both the identity of the rare gas and the input energy, with the best performance found to be with 53 bar of helium and an input pulse energy of >15 µJ [Köttig2017]. Utilizing such few-to-subfs tuneable UV-to-VUV pulses with 1 -10 µJ pulse energies coupled with MIR-LIED has the potential to record attosecond \"molecular movies\" of, for example, proton transfer and roaming reactions which occur on the sub-100-fs timescale. Thirdly, as discussed in Section IVc, electron diffraction techniques that rely on the strongfield tunnel ionization of the sample to launch the recolliding electron must take into account that the ionization potential decreases with larger, more complex molecules. Consequently, a suitable balance must be struck between ionization saturation and ionizing the sample molecule to initiate the elastic rescattering process.",

Indeed, there is no denying that vertical temperature gradients do exist in such heated or illuminated catalyst structures. Again, such gradients were measured by some of the authors of the current manuscript [7] and by others (e.g. [12,9]); they can also be extrapolated from the numerical simulations presented in Fig. S14 (performed over small voxels), and were described in detail in [5,11] -see also Appendix B. Now, since the high emissivity setting may result in a temperature reading which is colder from the actual surface temperature, we now show that the data can be fully reproduced with only thermal reactions. To do so, we evaluate the reaction rate by integrating the Arrhenius law over the entire sample, taking into account the calculated gradients T ( r) (see Appendix B) and assuming that the real surface temperature is T S plus some temperature shift δT , i.e., d rR 0 exp − Ea k B (T ( r;T S )+δT ) , with R 0 and E a taken from an Arrhenius fit to the reaction rate in the dark.\n\nIn particular, if the temperatures are shifted by δT = 27K (CW) and δT = 36K (white light), one obtains perfect predictions of the measured reaction rate without modifying the activation energy nor the prefactor (empty triangles in Fig. 1). Such a shift is of the same order of magnitude as the discrepancy between the thermocouple and camera readings reported by the authors themselves (Fig. S13(c)), and much smaller than the estimated error due to the emissivity and comparable to the independent thermal calculations shown in Appendix B.\n\nThus, by Ockham's razor, it seems far more likely that our simple yet remarkably quantitative thermal argument is the correct explanation for the faster chemistry reported compared with the speculative explanation provided in the original manuscript. Definitive proof of \"hot\" electron driven catalysis, particularly in light of the issues discussed above, will require approaches that can more precisely isolate thermal effects.",

Table 1 reports potential neutral species detected in this work compared to molecules in CSEs up to the detected mass range analysed in this work. We discuss below the similarities and differences with observations. Methanimine and methylamine were both observed as gas-phase interstellar molecules and thought as potential interstellar precursors to the amino acid glycine (NH 2 CH 2 COOH) (Theulé et al. 2011;Danger et al. 2011). CH 2 NH was found in every environment in nearly every environment, but critical production pathways are still lacking. Gas-phase reactions such as CH + NH 3 (Tenenbaum et al. 2010) or photolysis from CH 3 NH 2 (Michael & Noyes 1963) have been proposed to explain the observed fractional abundances of methanimine. However, the formation rates are too low and alternative sources in condensed matters have been proposed, such as sequential hydrogenation of HCN on grain surfaces producing both methylamine and methanimine (Halfen et al. 2013). The potential detection of both species in this grain-free work would support the fact that there is still missing formation pathways in the gas-phase. Since ammonia has not been detected in this work, the reaction between NH 3 and CH radicals is unlikely and other bimolecular neutral-neutral reactions should be considered such as N( 2 D) + CH 4 (Yelle et al. 2010).",

The production of NH 3 can follow either the dissociative (L-H mechanism) or associative route (E-R mechanism) 4,6,13,26 . DFT calculation was performed to understand the pathway of NH 3 synthesis over Co-N-C. The steps to construct the model of Co-N-C for NH 3 synthesis is shown in Supplementary Fig. 24 (please see Supporting Information for more details), and it can be observed that the Co atom is located at the center of phthalocyanine and coordinates with the Ndopant site on the carbon sphere. The changes of free energy for the formation of NH 3 and the detailed reaction steps of N 2 + 3H 2 → 2NH 3 reaction on Co-N-C are illustrated in Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 25, respectively. Notably, it is very difficult to dissociate N 2 directly on a single Co atom, while the hydrogenation of *N 2 to **NHNH on single Co sites in the form of steady-state Co 1 -N 3.5 is feasible (Fig. 5a). The theoretical outcomes are in agreement with the Ar-TPD-MS result that N 2 molecules are first adsorbed on single Co sites in the form of Co 1 -N 3.5 , and then directly activated by hydrogen species to form *NHNH intermediates rather than undergoing direct dissociation to N atoms. In the present study, the ΔG values for the hydrogenation of *NHNH to *NH-NH 3 and that of *NH-NH 3 to *NH 2 -NH 4 on single atom Co 1 -N 3.5 sites is −2.608 and −2.411 eV, respectively. Finally, *NH 2 -NH 4 can transform into two NH 3 molecules with ΔG value of −0.769 eV (Fig. 5a). The NH 3 synthesis pathway over the single Co sites in the form of steady-state Co 1 -N 3.5 is illustrated in Fig. 5b.

By working with NH 3 and CO 2 , we have discovered that an important requirement for a good dOH-bond blocker is the po- Fig. 10. Schematic illustration of the interactions between A) dOH and ammonia (NH 3 ) and B) dOH and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). NH 3 is a polar molecule, it tightly binds to the dOH via H-bonding between the N atom and the dOH. CO 2 is an apolar species, with binding energy three times lower than that of NH 3 . This implies that NH 3 is a more effective dangling-OH band blocker over CO 2 . The reported binding energies are from Ferrero et al. (2020). The simplified geometries are an adaptation of real geometries obtained with quantum chemical calculations in Ferrero et al. (2020). larity of a molecule, its ability to form H-bonds and to reside tightly at the dOH site, therefore impeding CO molecules from reacting with the dOH. As a general rule, we can state that polar molecules, especially NH 3 and CH 3 OH, are efficient dOH blockers, whereas apolar species (e.g., CO 2 ) are not good dOH blockers, unless significantly more abundant than polar species, in agreement with the findings of Cuppen et al. (2011). Based on the evidence that ammonia is one of the most abundant polar species of interstellar ices after H 2 O (its abundance is approximately a factor of 3 higher than that of CH 3 OH; Zanchet et al. 2013;Boogert et al. 2015), we propose that in addition to the impact of thermal annealing and energetic particles, ammonia is one of the main contributors if probably not the only one in the suppression of the 2152 cm −1 band, and more generally of all the dOH bands.\n\n\nOther dOH-blocker candidates",

The 2152 cm −1 band is the result of the interaction between absorbed CO and dangling-OH bonds (dOH) on amorphous water-ice surfaces (Sandford et al. 1988;Buch & Devlin 1991;Devlin 1992;Palumbo & Strazzulla 1992;Palumbo 1997;Collings et al. 2003a;Al-Halabi et al. 2004;Palumbo et al. 2010;He et al. 2019). This feature has been identified in laboratory CO:H 2 O ice mixtures, whereas it appears to be absent in observational spectra of interstellar ices. The question then is why CO molecules apparently do not bind to the dangling-OH site in pre-and protostellar environments, resulting in spectra lacking the 2152 cm −1 band.\n\nAt first, the nondetection was attributed to the low signal-tonoise ratio of observations in the 4 µm region, and thus, to the difficulties in resolving this band when the abundance of the responsible interstellar molecules is too low (e.g., Sandford et al. 1988;Ehrenfreund et al. 1997). A second explanation ascribed the nondetection to the low spectral resolution of the observations because of the overlap of several bands in the 4 µm region, such as gas-phase CO rovibrational transitions, the H 2 Pfund-β emission line at ∼2149 cm −1 , and the C−N stretching mode at 2165 cm −1 (Schmitt et al. 1989;Schutte & Greenberg 1997;Pendleton et al. 1999;Novozamsky et al. 2001).",

We performed a systematic study of different H 2 O:NH 3 and H 2 O:CO 2 ice mixtures, using porous ASW as the main ice analog component. CO was deposited on top of both mixtures. NH 3 and CO 2 were selected because they are ubiquitous species in astrophysical environments. In particular, they have been detected in the gas reservoirs of inner and outer regions of protoplanetary disks and in protostellar cores (Gürtler et al. 2002;Gibb et al. 2004;Öberg et al. 2010;Mandell et al. 2012;Salinas et al. 2016;Bosman et al. 2017;Pontoppidan et al. 2019;Najita et al. 2021) and on comets and planets (Mumma & Charnley 2011;Altwegg et al. 2020;Swain et al. 2008;Millan et al. 2021). This work focuses on the 2152 cm −1 feature; we do not attempt to tackle the red component at ∼2136 cm −1 . We do not compare the measured spectra with observations either because our measured spectra are in reflection mode, which should not be compared directly with observations. This paper is structured as follows. We begin in Section 2 by describing the experimental setup used to record the laboratory spectra. In Section 3 we test the effectiveness of CO 2 and NH 3 as dOH bond blockers and present the key experimental results. Section 4 discusses the results and explains them by comparing the chemical behaviors of CO 2 and NH 3 embedded in H 2 O. Additionally, it supplies a list of additional dOH-blocker candidates. We summarize our conclusions in Section 5.\n\n\nExperimental setup",

LOW TEMPERATURE RATE CONSTANTS AND MODELING OF NH, NH2, AND NH3 ABUNDANCES IN DENSE INTERSTELLAR CLOUDSIn the gas-phase, ammonia, NH 3 along with the other neutral nitrogen hydride species NH and NH 2 originate from molecular nitrogen reactions rather than from atomic nitrogen ones due to the low reactivity of the latter toward H 3 + (Herbst et al. 1987;Bettens & Collins 1998;Milligan & McEwan 2000). N 2 itself is produced by atomic nitrogen reactions with small neutral radicals (Daranlot et al. 2012;Le Gal et al. 2014) which experimental and theoretical studies have shown to be less efficient than previously assumed (Jorfi & Honvault 2009;Daranlot et al. 2011Daranlot et al. , 2012Daranlot et al. , 2013Ma et al. 2012;Loison et al. 2014a , and NH 4 + . Dissociative recombination (DR) reactions of these species lead to the neutral hydrides NH, NH 2 , and NH 3 . NH is also produced from the DR reaction of N 2 H + (following the N 2 + H 3  + N 2 H + + H 2 reaction) with a small yield (Vigren et al. 2012) which is nonetheless sufficient to make this process the major source of NH radicals in current gas-phase astrochemical models (Le Gal et al. 2014). Reaction (R1) is problematic due to the endothermicity of the N + + para-H 2 (p-H 2 ) reaction (Zymak et al. 2013). In the current state of modeling studies, N + reacts with ortho-H 2 (o-H 2 ) many orders of magnitude faster than with p-H 2 at temperatures relevant to dense interstellar clouds. As a result, the abundance of NH 3 produced by purely gas-phase chemical models is highly dependent on the H 2 ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) which is only poorly constrained. Using a pure gas-phase model at steadystate with an OPR for H 2 of 10 −3 , Dislaire et al. (2012) were able to reproduce the abundance ratios of NH/NH 2 and NH 3 / NH 2 observed in IRAS 16293-2422(Hily-Blant",

In some of these places, the temperature can fall to a few kelvins, as in low mass star forming regions. Others, as for example shocked media, have temperatures as high as a few thousand kelvins. Depending on the temperature, the chemistry that leads to ammonia formation can follow different paths. Given the importance of this molecule, in particular in the context of nitrogen chemistry, much effort has been made in the past in order to characterize the corresponding formation or destruction mechanisms. This proved to be successful and nowadays, most of the observations can be, at least qualitatively, understood. In some cases, however, astrochemical models and observations still show discrepancies, as in the case of circumstellar envelopes where the models under-predict the observed molecular abundances by a few orders of magnitude (Menten et al. 2010). Additionally, in recent years, it was found that the nuclear-spin ⋆ E-mail: fabien.daniel@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr states of a given molecule are not necessarily populated according to simple statistical considerations. This is the case for ammonia, for which some observations report ortho-to-para ratios (OPR) in the range 0.5-0.7 (Hermsen et al. 1988;Persson et al. 2012), while a statistical ratio of 1 was expected in the past, for a formation in the gas phase. If ammonia is formed in the solid phase, and subsequently released from the grains, this ratio would be ∼2. Recently, astrochemical gas-phase models have been updated by including rigorous nuclear-spin selection rules relevant to describe the ammonia formation. It was found that ratios lower than 1 can be well accounted for by such models in the low temperature regime, where the H 2 gas is para-enriched Faure et al. 2013;Sipilä, Caselli & Harju 2015).",

The intermolecular part of the N-H RDF shows the presence of both H-bonded and non-H-bonded H atoms in the first solvation shell. The shoulder up to about 2.7 Å can be attributed to hydrogen bonded H atoms, while the more pronounced peak at the larger distance at around 3.75 Å corresponds to the hydrogen atoms in the solvation shell which are not hydrogen bonded. Again, both functionals are found to describe well the non-hydrogen bonded first solvation shell peak when compared with the corresponding experimental result. For the hydrogen bonded part, however, the HCTH407ϩ result is found to exhibit a less pronounced shoulder than what is found in the experiments and for the BLYP functional. This is probably a result of the slight overestimation of the hydrogen bond length by HCTH407ϩ already on the level of the dimer, see Table IV. Considering both hydrogen bonded and non-hydrogenbonded H atoms, a sphere of radius 5.3 ͑5.2͒ Å around a central N atom is found to contain 34.1 ͑34͒ intermolecular H atoms for the HCTH407ϩ ͑BLYP͒ functional. The radius of the sphere is set to 5.3 ͑5.2͒ Å because the first minimum of the intermolecular N-H RDF is located at this distance. The corresponding radius for the experimental N-H RDF is 5.0 Å, yielding the experimental value of 34.8 for the abovementioned coordination number.

Calculations of the PES capable to determine that it is so flat around the minimum were not possible in the 1980s and 1990s and in fact our work presents the first such PES. While one may find speculations in the literature that the ammonia dimer is highly fluxional, only our calculations provide convincing evidence. For example, the results from a limited sampling performed in Ref. 24 indicated that the minimum region of the PES is flat, but the global minimum was found incorrectly at a C 2h configuration (which is not hydrogen bonded), so also the findings concerning flatness could be questioned. A similar text, except for the last sentence, was added to the Conclusions.\n\nMore data on different isomers, NH2D perhaps might confirm i.e. leading to different averaged structures?\n\nWe could perform such calculations, but we believe the evidence and the explanation of the isotope effects is already very convincing. The change from NH 3 -NH 3 to ND 3 -ND 3 represents the most substantial isotopic effect, significantly larger than the effect of replacing NH 3 by NH 2 D. Moreover, the NH 2 D dimer has a different PI group, so comparisons between NH 3 , ND 3 , and NH 2 D isotopologues would not be straightforward.\n\nThe authors emphasize completely different aspects. They point to the directional H-bonding in the (meaningless ?) equilibrium structures, and downplay in their interpretation (I think) the fact that TS is only 5 cm-1 away.\n\nWe believe we do emphasize the very small, 5 and 22 cm −1 , barriers between minima. We added an explicit statement about it in the Conclusions. However, we think the equilibrium structure is not meaningless. As Fig. 5 shows, the probability of the dimer to be at the equilibrium geometry is still the prevailing probability, higher than at the \"experimental\" (or theoretically averaged) geometry. Tunneling between symmetry-equivalent equilibria is present in essentially all hydrogen-bonded dimers of small molecules, although the tunneling splittings are much larger here. A similar text was added to the Conclusions.\n\nI think the title is hard to justify. This is a remarkable system.",

The inversion lines from different rotational ladders (J=1,2...) are coupled only collisionally and have similar frequencies. Furthermore, the combination of its energy level structures and the numerical value of Einstein coefficients A i j makes the majority of the NH 3 population stay in the metastable states. In the temperature range of 10-100 K, inversion lines of NH 3 have modestly high critical densities of 10 4 cm −3 (e.g., Ho & Townes 1983;Walmsley & Ungerechts 1983;Crapsi et al. 2007;Rosolowsky et al. 2008;Juvela & Ysard 2011). These unique qualities make NH 3 a great interstellar thermometer for the gases of modestly high densities (e.g., inversion lines, see Li 2002;Li et al. 2003) and high densities (e.g., the rotational transition lines, see Caselli et al. 2017). Two regions in our pilot sample (G 14.49-0.13 and G 34.74-0.12) are covered by the RAMPS program, so we use the p-NH 3 lines (J,K)=(1,1) and (2,2) to provide the gas temperature maps toward them. To derive the gas kinetic temperature T kin (p-NH 3 ) maps at an angular resolution of 34 , we apply two Monte Carlo fitting tools, one is HfS developed by Estalella (2017), and another is a much faster temperature-fitting algorithm (Wang et al. 2020) 4 . We found consistent results of T kin (p-NH 3 ) from both tools, spanning in the range of 11-21 K in our pilot sample.",

Taken together, our data indicate that photochemical reactions occurring within the APSIS reactor from H 2 -CO-N 2 gas mixtures are relevant to simulate processes of molecular growth within the irradiated, outermost regions of CSEs. We find the dominant products of photochemical reactions between CO, N 2 and H 2 to be N 2 H + , and most importantly HCO + , which has been widely observed within CSE environments. Molecular ions are known to play a significant role in building up the molecular complexity observed within, e.g., the interstellar medium, PDRs, dark clouds, and star-forming regions. However, their detection in (post-)AGB stars or planetary nebula remains limited to simple ions (HCO + , N 2 H + , CO + , NH + , CH + , OH + ; see, e.g., Zhang et al. (2008); Pardo et al. (2007); Aleman et al. (2014)). In our experiment, heavier molecular ions have also been detected, but their identification is challenging. Nevertheless, their presence in our experiment witnesses that complex ion-molecule chemistry is at stake within stellar environments, possibly as a result of photochemical reactions starting from simple molecules (H 2 , CO and N 2 ) in the gas phase. 2. Some of the neutral species detected in our experimental setup have been observed in the circumstellar medium, e.g. small C 2 hydrocarbons such as C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 4 , oxygenated molecules with methanol CH 3 OH and formaldehyde H 2 CO, and the first N-bearing molecules HCN and CH 2 NH. Additionally, we detected complex nitrogenized species: methylamine CH 3 NH 2 , methyldiazene CH 4 N 2 , triazene N 3 H 3 , and an heteroaromatic structure triazole C 2 H 3 N 3 , which have not yet been observed around evolved stars and could therefore potentially be searched for. It is worth noting that some of the species observed within our experiments have already been observed during photo-desorption experiments of circumstellar ice analogues. Regarding the ionic species, we detect less species at high molecular weight than has been observed in the circumstellar medium. This could be explained by the fact that CO and N 2 are the",

The results of these angular distributions are shown in Fig. 5͑b͒ for 2.7 ÅϽR (NH) Ͻ3.7 Å and in Fig.  5͑c͒ for 3.7 ÅϽR (NH) Ͻ4.7 Å.

[28] ammonia was treated as a rigid molecule, implying that the umbrella inversion motion of the NH 3 molecule was not considered.",

Here, we briefly summarize our findings, focusing on the electronic background of the N-O bond activation by cobalt active sites. We have qualitatively reproduced  5 ]-NO} forms immobilized in cages. Our calculations of NO stretching frequencies for small cluster models suggested that it were the adduct with three ammonia ligands co-bound to cobalt (in the singlet spin state, being still linked to the negative framework) that produced the highest red-shift of the NO frequency of over 200 cm −1 and yielded the low-frequency range of the experimental spectrum. On the other hand, the singlet adduct {[Co(II)(NH 3 ) 5 ]-NO}, no more capable of forming bonds with cluster oxygens representing electron-rich framework, showed smaller red-shift of the NO stretch (ca. −160 cm −1 ) and was pointed responsible for the intermediatefrequency region of the experimental spectrum. These findings led to tentative re-interpretation of the FTIR spectra.",

LOW TEMPERATURE RATE CONSTANTS AND MODELING OF NH, NH2, AND NH3 ABUNDANCES IN DENSE INTERSTELLAR CLOUDSThus the conversion time of atomic carbon to CO versus the timescale for NH 3 formation in the gas-phase is a key parameter of these models. Assuming that half of the initial atomic carbon has already been converted to CO in the diffuse parent cloud does not significantly change the results while starting with all atomic carbon in the form of CO reduces the effect of this reaction until a few 10 5 year. In the gas-phase, NH 3 along with the other neutral nitrogen hydride species NH and NH 2 originate from the N + + H 2 reaction as described earlier. Consequently, when the OPR of H 2 = 3, nitrogen hydrides are produced efficiently. In this scenario, the pure gas-phase network can roughly reproduce the observed NH 3 abundances in dark clouds (Ohishi et al. 1992;Pratap et al. 1997;Ohishi & Kaifu 1998;Dickens et al. 2000;Hily-Blant et al. 2010) when the atomic carbon abundance falls below 1 × 10 −6 with respect to H 2 (at times longer than 1 × 10 6 years in Figure 4). However, this model substantially underestimates the observed NH and NH 2 abundances, even at steady state. This is a notably different result compared with earlier gasphase models (Le Gal et al. 2014), the main differences arising from the rates used for the O + NH, O + NH 2 , and N + NH 2 reactions, as well as due to the newly added C + NH 3 reaction. The rate constants for the O + NH, O + NH 2 , and N + NH 2 reactions used in this work can be found in the KIDA database and in a recent publication of datasheets from the KIDA website (Wakelam et al. 2013). The rate constant values come from various experimental studies. Adamson et al. (1994) and Hack et al. (1994) for the O + NH reaction, Adamson et al. (1994) and Dransfeld et al. (1985) for the O + NH 2 reaction and Dransfeld & Wagner (1987) and Whyte & Phillips (1983) for the N + NH 2 reaction, these rates being much higher than those used by Le Gal",

Apart from the energetics, also the structure of the ground state of the ammonia dimer, i.e., the eclipsed C s structure, is dramatically improved, see Table IV for details. In particular the hydrogen bond angle HNN is now much larger and thus closer to the reference value than any other density functional method; note that also the functionals PW91, B97-2, and PBE0 were considered. The same is true for the HNN angle in the staggered variant of the C s symmetric structure. However, it is also clear from this table that the N¯H distance is clearly overestimated: HCTH/407ϩ yields a distance of about 2.5 Å instead of around 2.3 Å as required. This seems to be typical for the HCTH family as both HCTH/120 and HCTH/407 yield similarly large values exceeding 2.4 Å ͑and HCTH/93 leads to 2.614 Å͒. In addition, the same trend of producing too long hydrogen bonds is found for the C 2h structure. This deficiency is corrected by both -HCTH and -HCTH hybrid functionals. Here it should be noted that both BLYP and PBE describe the hydrogen bond length quite well, however at the expense of making it much too linear and grossly disfavoring the cyclic structure energetically.",

The structure and energetics of important isomers are obtained to unprecedented accuracy without resorting to experiment. The global minimum of eclipsed C s symmetry is characterized by a significantly bent hydrogen bond which deviates from linearity by as much as Ϸ20°. In addition, the so-called cyclic C 2h structure, resulting from further bending which leads to two equivalent ''hydrogen bonding contacts,'' is extremely close in energy on an overall flat potential energy surface. It is demonstrated that none of the currently available ͓generalized gradient approximation ͑GGA͒, meta-GGA, and hybrid͔ density functionals satisfactorily describe the structure and relative energies of this nonlinear hydrogen bond. We present a novel density functional, HCTH/407ϩ, which is designed to describe this sort of hydrogen bond quantitatively on the level of the dimer, contrary to, e.g., the widely used BLYP functional. This improved generalized gradient approximation functional is employed in Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of liquid ammonia to judge its performance in describing the associated liquid. Both the HCTH407ϩ and BLYP functionals describe the properties of the liquid well as judged by analysis of radial distribution functions, hydrogen bonding structure and dynamics, translational diffusion, and orientational relaxation processes. It is demonstrated that the solvation shell of the ammonia molecule in the liquid phase is dominated by steric packing effects and not so much by directional hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, the propensity of ammonia molecules to form bifurcated and multifurcated hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase is found to be negligibly small.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION",

                    "contents": "A Large-scale Approach to Modeling Molecular Biosignatures: The DiatomicsWe use a Boltzmann distribution to obtain the relative intensities for each transition. This statistical law states that, for a system of N total molecules, only a fraction N J N will occupy particular energy level E J a fraction. This can be written as:\nN J N = g J e −E J kT f(21)\nWhere, the degeneracy, g J , the energy of a given level, E J , and the partition function, f are described as:\ng J = (2J + 1) (22) E J = B 0 J(J + 1) (23) f = g J e −E J kT(24)\nHence, the full equation now becomes:\nN J N = (2J + 1)e ( −BJ(J+1) kT ) f(25)\nFrom here the code calculates the transition positions using the appropriate equations depending on the rotational branches considered. The full derivations for these equations have been included in the appendix, section A.3. They are summarised as follows:\nν O = ν 0→1 + B 1 J (J + 1) − B 0 (J + 2)(J + 3) (26) ν P = ν 0→1 − (B 1 + B 0 )(J + 1) + (B 1 − B 0 )(J + 1) 2 (27) ν Q = ν 0→1 − J (J + 1)(B 1 − B 0 ) (28) ν R = ν 0→1 + (B 1 + B 0 )(J + 1) + (B 1 − B 0 )(J + 1) 2 (29) ν S = ν 0→1 + B 1 (J + 2)(J + 3) − B 0 J (J + 2)(30)\nWhere ν 0→1 represents the band origin, B 0 and B 1 represent the rotational constants for their appropriate vibrational levels. As previously mentioned, for our code we use the solution calculated by TOSH (equation 8) as the band origin.",

This extension exceeds the value of 0.5 Å, supposed by Sheu et al. [40] to be sufficient for breaking interchain hydrogen bonds. A somewhat arbitrary choice of R = value is unimportant for the results obtained because only Q pd contains R = value in Equation (8).

First of all, the second boundary is at infinity, so we can't explicitly get the values on this boundary. We could use some large finite value instead of infinity and avoid this problem, as long as the solution doesn't diverge at infinity for an incorrect choice of the parameters ∆ρ and ∆m. Unfortunately it does diverge, so the linear shooting method doesn't work in this simple way. The reasons for the divergence are the error involved with the numerical method and the absence of solutions for most choices of ∆ρ and ∆m. The error involved with the numerical method increases as we approach a cusp in free energy landscape; this is one of the reasons for the divergence. By varying the parameters ∆ρ and ∆m we can push the beginning of this divergence to larger distances, so we can obtain part of the solution (including part of the tail) before the divergence occurs. However, this gives large errors in estimating such quantities as the free energy barrier, surface tension, etc. We could decrease the numerical error of the shooting method in the interface region by using Runge-Kutta methods with adaptive step size, but if we desire reasonably small values of the errors, the step size becomes too small for simulations [17].\n\nTo avoid these difficulties we use a more advanced shooting technique -shooting with a fitting point. The fitting point was chosen at r = R core where the solid and fluid branches of the free energy intersect. The value of R core depends on the parameters ∆ρ and ∆m. Next, we know the exact solution for the fluid part of m(r) (22), where δ ρ is a parameter. By matching the fluid and solid parts of m(r) and their derivatives at r = R core we determine ∆m for a fixed values of ∆ρ and δρ. The next step is to obtain ∆ρ and δρ by matching the values and derivatives of the fluid and solid parts of ρ(r). Note that the value of ∆m depends on the value of ∆ρ, so when we shoot with a particular value of ∆ρ we obtain a value for ∆m each time. This shooting with a fitting point minimizes the numerical error as compared with standard shotting method.",

Indeed, when a nonzero Tolman's delta and an offset are included, the optimal value of γ ∞ within LD-A significantly decreases, reaching 30 mJ/m 2 at 220 K, while remaining definitely larger for LD-B and LD-C. The bad performance of the latter two schemes in predicting the correct value of γ ∞ casts a shadow on their effectiveness as adequate schemes for nucleation (see more below).\n\nA further comment is in order. In CNT, the height ∆G * of the nucleation barrier and the critical size n * are related by ∆G * = (1/2)|∆µ|n * . On account of this formula, LD-C would be perfect for both T = 220 K (where β|∆µ| = 0.536) and T = 230 K (where β|∆µ| = 0.428), while LD-A (LD-B) leads to a n * value that is systematically smaller (larger) than expected from the same equation. However, I argue that this result is of little value, since (a) CNT is actually inaccurate as a theory for ∆G(n), as widely recognized; (b) the value of n * depends strongly on the details of particle classification, much more than the barrier height. Therefore, LD-C could not be considered superior to LD-A just on the basis of the performance in the above test. The same concern about the accuracy of CNT may also be expressed for any method of computing the nucleation rate which deeply relies on this theory, such as the seeding method.",

In Figure 5, this is observed for all simulated systems at different initial hydration settings (n = 6, 2, and 0). However, after 300,000 MC moves, the systems which started at a hydration level n of 0 and 2 are still far from equilibrium. At 340 K, an estimated hydration level between 2 and 4 appears; from the thermodynamic values, the tetrahydrate (n = 4) crystalline structure is expected. At 380 and 400 K, the GCMC simulations equilibrate approximately around a hydration level of 2, where the thermodynamic dihydrate (n = 2) can be found between 369 and 390 K, from eq 2, at the given vapor pressure. At 500 K, the GCMC algorithm predicts a hydration level of 1, where the thermodynamic rules indicate anhydrous MgCl 2 (n = 0). The deviations between the results from the GCMC algorithm and the calculated equilibrium lines from thermodynamic values (eq 2) can be explained by the use of disordered microparticles (23−50 Å) in the simulations, versus the used crystalline bulk thermodynamic values (H 0 , S 0 ).

The value of a 293 has been estimated as 3.586 Å by extrapolation of lattice constants at higher temperatures [13]. The hypothetical melting point for gFe has been defined as a temperature where the Gibbs energy for gFe is equal to that for liquid Fe and has been estimated as 1793 K using thermodynamic data [16], as shown in Fig. 2. Inspection of Fig. 1 shows that temperature coefficients of the linear thermal expansions for these metals are very small near 0 K and become larger as the temperature increases.

We have confirmed the latter by performing a committor analysis, 35,36 whereby the probability of configurations constrained to lie along the separatrix to commit to the product basin, p B , is estimated by integrating an ensemble of trajectories from an initial Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities. If the dividing surface is a true representation of the transition state ensemble, there should be an equal probability to be committed to either reactant or product basins. Shown in Fig. 2b)  at p B = 0.5 confirming that the combination of n w and R is capable of characterizing the dynamics that lead to hydrolysis from N 2 O 5 .\n\nWe have employed the Bennett-Chandler method 37 to quantify the rate constant for hydrolysis. Specifically, we compute the rate, k h (t), as a product of the transition state theory estimate, k TST , and the transmission coefficient, κ(t), k h (t) = κ(t)k TST . The transition state theory estimate of the rate is computable from\nk TST = ν exp[−∆F (ξ * )/k B T ]\nwhere the prefactor ν is related to the mean velocity of ξ in the reactant basin. The transmission coefficient corrects transition state theory for dynamical effects at the top of the barrier, and is given by the plateau region of the flux-side correlation function. 25 The transmission coefficient is shown in Fig. 2c) and plateaus to a value of 0.25 within 0.5 ps. Taken together we find the rate of hydrolysis to be k h = 4.1 ns −1 , implying an average lifetime of N 2 O 5 to be nearly 240 ps.

However, the comparison with the gas kinetic rates (see Fig.  7) shows that the Gökçen rate exceeds the limiting gas-kinetic rate at lower temperatures (below 200K). It has been replaced by the detailed balancing for the rate from Rohrig [24], obtained in the temperature   range T=2,200-2,600K). The obtained rate remains physically consistent at lower temperatures, down to almost 100K (see Fig. 7 for a comparison with the former Gökçen rate). The Arrhenius fit to the new rate yields an activation energy of −1,560K, showing that the pre-exponential factor A of the former Gökçen rate was over-estimated.  In the case of reaction 23 (CN+C→C 2 +N), the rate exceeds the detailed balance of the reverse gaskinetic rate, which means that the reverse reaction will be overestimated in the lower temperature ranges (in a way similar to rate 18).

The T m of a protein occurs when it is equally likely to be folded as unfolded. Figure 2 shows an example trajectory of a protein below its melting point. From the relative frequencies of folded versus unfolded structures, we can calculate DG fold . Furthermore, by considering how DG fold changes with respect to temperature, we can plot a melting curve and apply the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to determine the protein's heat capacity (C p ) and enthalpy of fusion (DH) (see equation below). Figure 3 gives an illustrative example of a computed melting curve.\nDG~DH m (1{ T T m ) {DC p (T m {T)zT ln ( T T m )\nThe Coarse-Grained Lesson\n\nIn this lesson, we consider the protein G related albumin-binding domain (PDB code: 1PRB). This is a small globular protein that has been extensively studied, both experimentally and theoretically [37][38][39]. Experiment has shown that this protein folds near the semi-empirical speed limit of *1ms [40]. In solution, 1PRB forms a three-helix bundle ( Figure 1); it readily interconverts between its folded and unfolded states, allowing rapid convergence of its thermodynamic properties. These features, taken together, make it an ideal candidate to demonstrate the efficacy of CG methodologies in an educational environment. The sequence of steps that are carried out by the lesson, along with their inputs and outputs, are shown in Figure 4.\n\n\nSteps 1 and 2: Upload a Protein to CHARMMing and Build the CG Structure",

The only parameter, which was varied in our kinetic mechanism, was the rate coefficient of reaction (R2). According to [23][24][25][26][27], the observable value of activation energy E a of the rate coefficient of reaction (R2) falls in the range of 39-48 kcal/mole. In this case, the majority of researchers accept the value of 39 kcal/mole.

The latter functions evaluate the similarity transformation according to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion, including up to four nested commutators. Obviously, many of these commutators will evaluate to zero (e.g. quadruple commutators involving t2), but the work to evaluate these zeros could be avoided through the use of lower-level commands specifying the non-zero commutators, double commutators, etc. (see Table II). Equations for the doubles cluster amplitudes could be obtained in a similar way; one need only change the bra state via pq.set_left_operators(['e2(m,n,f,e)']) (see Appendix A).",

Similarly as above, first a short ab initio MD simulation was performed on a 2 x 2 x 2 supercell with CeO 1.875 composition at high temperature. This configuration was used to calculate the forces acting on the ions and these, in turn, were used for the fitting procedure. These calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [39][40][41] within the DFT+U framework. A value of U = 7 eV was chosen to ensure correct localization of the f electrons. Although this is slightly higher than is generally used 7,8 , it was found to be necessary to ensure localization in the non-equilibrium structures used in the potential fitting. We used the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Wang 91 (PW91) exchange-correlation functional and an energy cut-off of 400 eV. The Ce 3+ cations were identified as those with spin 1, while the Ce 4+ ones have no spin. The Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ cations are then treated as two different cationic species in the potential parametrization and separate terms are obtained to describe the interactions between, for instance, Ce\n4+ -O 2− and Ce 3+ -O 2− . The parameters for the Ce 4+ -O 2− and O 2− -O 2−\nwere then fixed to the values obtained before for the Y doped CeO 2 system, so that these parameters are consistent and can be used all together. This procedure is equivalent to treating the Ce 3+ cations as a dopant species, in the same way as was done for Y. While an ionic model for reduced CeO 2 might not be justified a priori, the picture arising from DFT+U calculations and experiments seems to confirm this model. The f electrons are, indeed, found to be strongly localized on the Ce 3+ cations in agreement with an ionic picture.",

Our method can also be thought as complementary to the finite field method use in conjunction with DMC. In this method a term of the form (␦A) is added to the Hamiltonian and the value of ͗A͘ is obtained by determining the slope of E(␦) computed in a series of different runs. Our method could be used to calculated all these E(␦) in a single run. Since the E(␦) are correlated, the slope of its plot as a function of ␦, the expectation ͗A͘, will be obtained more easily. If the amplitude of the operator A is small, like those we have in this work, the linear response approach most probably becomes too noise and it would be necessary to use our method. For nonlocal operators, like the kinetic energy of a component in a multicomponent system, it would be very interesting to learn if it is possible within the linear response approach of Ref. 48 to assume that the diffusion does not change for the different values of ␦. If this is true, them always would be advantageous to use the finite field approach together with our method. The extension we have proposed to the DMC method might be very useful not only for the helium systems, but also for other quantum many-body systems where a clue is need to identify the best description between competing interacting potentials. Even if these potentials differ by very small amounts, the nature of the interactions they describe can be different. A better understanding of these differences and their relevance is important on its own and so as mean of obtain better analytical representations of the interacting potentials. The calculations of small energy contributions of spin-orbit terms in molecular physics 47 might be another situation where our method can help in better understanding a physical system.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was conducted, in part, using the facilities of the ''Centro Nacional de Processamento de Alto Desempenho em São Paulo.''

The agreement was found to be satisfactory for the case of the lowest Σ states as seen in Fig. 1. Additionally we have compared the A 2 Π u state calculated using the same ECP+CPP method to the core-valence MRCI+Q/cc-pwCVQZ calculation using the 3s3p4s3d + 4p x space discussed above. These two calculations agree very well, as demonstrated by Fig. 1. Because of the good agreement with the all electron calculations and the computational limitations in performing multi-reference core-valence correlation calculation, we have used the ECP+CPP method to calculate the A 2 Π u state in this paper. We note in passing that the use of the CPP is essential; without it one does not obtain the correct ordering of the excited atomic asymptotes.",

The auxiliary functions ′ ′ , therefore, arising in the case of four-center electron-repulsion integrals have been studied in recently published paper[50]. It should be noted that all the one-, two-and three-center multicenter integras appearing in HFR equations can also be calculated from the formulas (4.4) and(4.5). For this purpose we must calculate one-and two-center overlap integrals of three STOs and use Eqs.(4.9), (4.13), (4.14) and (4.15). The convergence properties of the series expansion relation for three-center nuclear attraction integral obtained by the use of unsymmetrical one-range addition theorems of the Coulomb potential for − are shown in tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. These tables list the partial summations in Eq. (4.4) corresponding to progressively increasing upper summations limits denoted by , N L and M . As can be seen from tables 4.1 and 4.2, the Eq. (4.4) displays the most rapid convergence to the numerical results with twelve digits stable as a function of summation limits L and M . We see that the convergence of the series with respect to L and M is rapid; therefore, we can include only a few terms obtained from the summation over indices l and . Table 4.3 shows that the accuracy of computer calculations obtained in the present algorithm is satisfactory for m 15 N = . Greater accuracy is attainable by the use of more terms in the expansion in Eq. (4.4).",

To do that we can extend the concept of the effective Hamiltonian H eff to other operators such as the effective dressed electricdipole operator D eff and the P,T-odd operators. These operators account for the core-valence correlations. As in pure RPA approach of Sec. III A, we solve the RPA equations summing a certain sequence of many-body diagrams to all orders of MBPT [13,16,17]. Since requirements to the accuracy of calculations are not very high we disregard in this consideration small corrections like normalization and structural radiation.\n\nWe perform the calculations in the CI+MBPT method in V N −1 and V N −2 potentials. The former is a bit more \"natural\" for the lowest-lying odd-parity states of the considered atoms such as nsnp 3,1 P o 1 (n = 6 for Yb and Hg, and n = 7 for Ra), because 6p 1/2,3/2 (or 7p 1/2,3/2 ) orbitals are constructed at the stage of solving DHF equations for the configuration [core]nsnp. The latter is somewhat simpler (e.g, due to an absence of the subtraction diagrams). We have checked that the final results in both potetials are in good agreement with each other. For this reason when we discuss results, we do not distinguish between these potentials.",

Although the freezing density calculated by this last method practically follows our results, the value obtained with this method for the melting density is almost constant and equal to 29.29 nm Ϫ3 , independently of the potential used. This last result could lead to the false conclusion that three-body interactions does not affect this property.\n\nOther consequence of including many-body interactions in the potential can be seen in the calculation of the equilibrium density ͓Table III, Eq. ͑5.1͔͒. For both potentials, V 2D and V 2DJ , the theoretical computed value of the equilibrium density becomes almost identical to the experimental value. The equilibrium density obtained using the full interatomic potential V 2DJ diminished 0.3 nm Ϫ3 from its value computed with the two-body potential. In the solid phase, in which the contribution of the exchange energy is greater, the parameter 0 decreases 0.75 nm Ϫ3 in a similar comparison.\n\nThe theoretical determination of a realistic equation of state of 4 He requires an accurate two-body potential ͑like the one we use 7 or the one 8 employed in Ref. 12͒ together with three-body terms. 26 Further understanding of these interactions requires 24 a quantitative discrimination of their different contributions to the properties of the system. In this work by introducing reweight in a DMC calculation we can follow how each term of the three-body interaction used affects the binding energy, the equilibrium, freezing and melting densities.",

The second excited 2 Π u state comes from an atomic asymptote of Ca 4s4p and Ca + 4s, which lies ∼ 1500 cm −1 above the A 2 Π u asymptote. We find, however, that valence CAS+MRCI calculations incorrectly predict the Ca 4s4p and Ca + 4s asymptote to lie below the Ca 4s 2 and Ca + 3d asymptote. The correct ordering of the atomic energy levels is obtained when core-valence correlation including double excitations of the inner valence electrons are included in the correlation treatment using the cc-pwCVQZ (or better) basis set. We expect that a balanced description of valence and core-valence interactions in the A 2 Π u state would be obtained from a CAS (19,26)+MRCI calculation that includes molecular orbitals arising from the atomic 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s and 4p orbitals. This is a much more demanding calculation than those required for the X 2 Σ + u and B 2 Σ + g states that correlate to ground states atoms. It was found that a smaller CAS(19,21)+MRCI+Q/cc-pwCVQZ (MRCI plus Davidson correction) calculation correlating the 3s3p inner valence electrons with a 4s3d + 4p x valence reference was sufficient to obtain the correct ordering of the first and second 2 Π u molecular states. Extending this calculation to include the entire 4p reference space using the cc-pwCV5Z was attempted but was too computationally demanding for our available resources. An alternative approach to the multi-reference all electron calculation is to replace the argon core of the Ca atoms with an effecive-core potential (ECP) where the effects of core-valence correlation are including using a core polarization potential (CPP) [13]. This method was used with great success by Czuchaj et al for Ca 2 ground and excited states [14]. We have performed comparisons between the all electron calculations for the first two 2",

For later interpolation it will be useful if these are roughly equidistant in the parameter space. For this purpose it is useful to consider the coordinate systems which describe well the two asymptotic arrangements of the reactant and product. We choose two suitable coordinate systems to describe the arrangement of atoms for the reactant and product side. We use Jacobi coordinates for the CaF-CaF arrangement as shown in Fig.1a, where R J is the distance between two centers of mass (CM) of two monomer CaF molecules having bond lengths r 13 and r 24 , respectively. The molecules are tilted with respect to the intermolecular axis by polar angles θ 1 , θ 2 , while φ 1 is the torsion angle. For the product side (CaF 2 -Ca) we use spherical polar coodinates, as depicted in Fig.1b. Here, R S is the distance between two Ca atoms. The bond lengths r 1 and r 2 represent the distance between the atoms Ca1-F3 and Ca1-F4. The parameter α is the angle between the atoms F3-Ca1-F4, θ and φ 2 are the azimuthal and polar angles, respectively. Initially, we calculate the optimized geometries of the four-body surface incorporating the basis set described above. Using the method of geometry optimization in MOLPRO [44], we find one global minimum and one local minimum of the four-body surface Ca 2 F 2 . At present, we are unaware of literature values of either global or local minima of the Ca 2 F 2 surface. Therefore, to estimate the uncertainty in our current method of calculation, we determine the same optimization for the global and local minima by another level of theory, coupled-cluster singles, doubles and perturbative triples excitation [CCSD(T)] using the same basis sets: Ca = cc-pwCVTZ-PP and F = aug-cc-PVTZ. For both of the minima, the geometric parameters and corresponding energies are tabulated in Table III for both ab initio methods.",

However, to evaluate the uncertainty of the CBS extrapolation, we have also employed two alternative schemes introduced in the previous section: the scheme of Martin [33] (M), and of Lesiuk and Jeziorski [34] (LJ). Table 4 contains the extrapolated results using the different schemes. When comparing the different schemes we observe that the LJ results are consistently higher than H values while the M results are lower by a similar amount. This almost uniform behavior further justifies us to use the central H extrapolation scheme for the final values obtained in this work. However, the spread in these values allows us to determine their standard deviation (σ) and hence also the typical 95% confidence interval (1.96σ) as our CBS uncertainty estimate.\n\nThe uncertainty due to the incomplete description of the region distant from the nucleus is estimated by taking a conservative half of the difference between the (3-aug)-CBS-acvN z and the extrapolated (∞-aug)-CBS-acvN z results. This uncertainty is negligible for the ionization potentials but more significant for the electron affinity of Og.\n\nNext, we turn to the errors stemming from the treatment of the electron correlation, namely the effect of cutting off the virtual correlation space and of neglecting excitations beyond (Q). To estimate the effect of the virtual cutoff, we take the difference between the results obtained with the cutoff of 300 a.u., which we use for the final values presented in this work, and those with a cutoff of 2000 a.u. (using the cv4z basis set). In all cases this contribution to the uncertainty is found to be negligible.\n\nSimilarly to the base value, to estimate the uncertainty for the higher excitation contributions, we combine the ∆T CBS extrapolation error (determined as above), together with the virtual cutoff error (difference with respect to the 40 a.u. cutoff), and the neglect of the contributions beyond the perturbative quadruples. The latter was estimated as a half of the ∆(Q) contribution itself based on the typical decreasing hierarchy of CC contributions exemplified also by the comparison between the ∆(T) and ∆T contributions shown in Table 2. This choice was further justified by ∆Q contributions calculated at the (1-aug)-v2z level being all below 1meV.",

( 3), see Fig. 2. The resulting vapor pressure of the saturated solution, p sat,L (290.9K)=(2.1±0.7)×10−5 Pa, agrees within error with the one obtained for the solid particle after one day of evaporation.Thus, we conclude that the particle after efflorescence contains a substantial amount of material which evaporates at higher rate than the stable solid.For glutaric acid, we indeed have indication of aqueous inclusions from hygroscopicity cycles performed on particles in the EDB (see Fig. 5 of Zardini et al., 2008).During the main efflorescence step only a part of the water is lost.Subsequent continuous water loss over a broad RH range is observed until the hygroscopicity cycles close.Because the same initial mass is reached for several subsequent cycles we can exclude irreversible mass loss (e.g. by evaporation) as explanation for this effect.The amount of crystalline material present in the effloresced particle initially may be estimated from the extrapolation of the orange dashed line in Fig. 4 to the start of the experiment.This implies that about 60% of the mass of the solid after efflorescence were crystalline and 40% were aqueous inclusions.The implications of this observation will be discussed further below.One immediate consequence for our own measurements is that if these ratios are representa- tive also for larger particles, the time needed before measuring the relevant vapor pressure of the crystalline solid exceeded those we often used.This becomes evident when plotting our data versus temperature as shown in Fig. 5.As discussed, the solid vapor pressures at T =290.9K span a considerable",

The net result is that A loses K + and C loses H + which is equivalent thermodynamically to an exchange of K + for H + (though the actual transport through B may be mostly in molecular form, e.g. as undissociated HG and KG).\n\nAs stated in the preceding paper ~ it seems probable that the concentration of ions in the G.C. mixture (whose dielectric constant is low) is small compared with that of molecules and unless the mobility of the ions were extremely high ionic exchange would play a subordinate r61e. The following calculations bear this out.\n\nFrom considerations set forth elsewhere 44 an exchange of Ko + for Hi + might be expected to proceed according to the formula d__QQ = dt C7 [(H~) (Ko) -(K,) (Ho)], where C7 is a constant.\n\nWe may use the following values for activities. ~ At the start: *L (Ko) = (0.05) (0.817) = 0.04, (Ho) = 10 -9.~, and (K~) = 0.

Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c) 14 reveal that M2 with 24 H2 molecules (blue line) and M3 with 32 H (red line) have the lowest ∆G with equilibrium PH2 of 1.07  10 28 Pa and 2.86  10 17 Pa, respectively. In Fig. 6(a) and (c), the hydrogen solubility would increase from one H2 to three H2 molecules and 32H to 48H driven by the increasing PH2. While in Fig. 6(b), the preferred solubility will not change with PH2 increase. In order to investigate the transition of dissolution mechanism driven by PH2 at 300K, the preferred dissolution states in M1, M2 and M3 are drawn together in Fig.   6 Fig. 6(d). The influence of temperature on dissolution mechanisms is also discussed supposing that the structure and solubility of dissolved hydrogen will not change distinctly within 400K. At 400K, the equilibrium PH2 for M1 is 1.18  10 10 Pa, and PH2 for M1 → M3 transition is 4.07  10 15 Pa, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than those at 300K. Therefore, increasing PH2 and temperature can promote the subsequent polymolecular and (H + H2) mixed dissolution of hydrogen in α-Pu2O3.\n\n\nConclusions",

The pot, after weighing, is placed in a silica tube, in which a high vacuum is maintained. The silica tube is then inserted in a hole in a large copper block maintained at a constant temperature. The 471 small pot is weighed again at the end of the experiment, and the loss of weight gives the amount of vapour which has escaped through the hole.\n\nThe vapour pressure can be calculated from the loss in weight, the time and the \" resistance\" due to the dimensions of the hole and tube. The resistance is inversely proportional to the area of the hole, because the mass of vapour passing through area A in time r is l pc A t, where c is the average velocity of the molecules and p the density of the vapour.\n\nA correction enters for the number of molecules that get back from the far side through the hole to the space occupied by the vapour in equilibrium with the metal. This amounts to the additional resistance presented by the silica tube itself, via.:-3 1 L 4 * v ' 27^:R3, where L is the length from the hole to the point where the metal deposits, and E is the average radius of the tube. The correction only amounts to about 1 per cent, for the size of the silica tube employed (3 cm. diameter).\n\nThe deposit occurs over a distance of 3 to 5 cm., but the bulk forms in a film of about 1 cm. breadth, so that the error introduced by the measurement of L is less than about l/1 0 th of a per cent.\n\nThe vapour pressure is then calculated from the relation^? = Gt/ t .

For the V1 sample, 60 : 40 MO/water, the Pn3m and Ia3d parameters were 87 Å and 138 Å , respectively. In the phase diagram for MO (Briggs et al., 1996) at ambient pressure lattice parameters decrease with temperature, which is the opposite to the cooling effect expected during vacuum injection. Hence, temperature does not explain the reduced lattice parameters. Dehydration after injection could potentially explain the discrepancy, although equilibrium studies suggest the Pn3m phase would vanish if this were the case (Briggs et al., 1996). Lower pressure can result in increased curvature of the lipid bilayer, and hence a smaller lattice parameter (Czeslik et al., 1995), which may be a plausible explanation for these observations. Interestingly, the reduced lattice parameter was not observed for the MO/buffer mixture, sample V3, for which the Ia3d parameter was comparable with that for air injection. This may be a result of the buffer components ameliorating the effects of low-pressure or resisting dehydration of the sample.\n\n\nPressure effects in sample reservoir",

Table 2. The general rule for selecting the cell number is to make the cell size L slightly smaller than  0 since the change of permeability due to the computational error associated with the spatial resolution L becomes negligible when L/ 0 is less than 1 as shown in Fig. 2. Table 2 also shows that it deserves priority to increase the cell number along the directions perpendicular to the driving direction if high spatial resolutions at all directions are not affordable because of the prohibitive computational cost. Additionally, the resolution difference between different directions should be less than one order of magnitude. Using more cells improves the accuracy but meanwhile also increases the computational cost since the average number of simulated molecules per cell is usually fixed. Based on the above error analysis, the pore-scale gas flows at different pressures ranging from 0.001 to 3 MPa are studied using different cell numbers to ensure that L/ 0 is always less than 1. The permeability variation with the reciprocal pressure is plotted in Fig. 3. As we can see, the permeability is a constant (i.e., the intrinsic permeability   ) when the pressure is very large making Kn<0.01, which is consistent with the observation of conventional reservoir, where the permeability is a rock property and independent of the flow conditions and the nature of fluid. In the case of Kn<0.01, the numerical methods based on the N-S equation and no-slip boundary condition are valid and will predict a constant permeability as expected. At another limit with a very low pressure making Kn>10 (note: could occur earlier with Kn>2 as shown in Table 3 for this particular case), the permeability becomes a linear function of the reciprocal pressure, which is consistent with the constant volumetric velocity component (i.e., 0.36 m/s) observed in the simulations at large Kn since the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet linearly increases with p 0 in our simulations. This constant volumetric velocity can be understood using the kinetic theory behind the Boltzmann equation as follows:",

For small packing fractions (f t 0.3), D t /D id t decreases linearly with increasing concentration. The decay is reasonably well described by the theoretically expected relation 1 À 2f for colloids in solution. 52 However, a better agreement is obtained for the relation 1 À 2.2f, i.e., a 10% larger prefactor. Remarkably, the decrease of D t for f t 0.3 is essentially independent of the activity. Significant deviations between the individual curves are visible for higher concentrations and larger Péclet numbers, where a phase separation appears. At the critical concentration, the diffusion coefficients for Pe 4 30 exhibit a rapid change to smaller values. A further increase in concentration implies a further slowdown of the dynamics. Interestingly, at high concentrations, the larger Péclet number ABPs diffuse faster than those with a small Pe. We attribute this observation to collective effects of the fluids exhibiting swirl-and jetlike structures. 21 Another reason might be an activity induced fluidization, since the glass transition is shifted to larger packing fractions. 22 Fig. 3 displays the density dependence of the total pressure p p e p i for the considered Péclet numbers.

A second result from elementary statistical mechanics removes a potential objection to the above argument. What if the volume of pure solvent is reduced? If the volumes of liquid and vapour are held constant, the number of vapour atoms is (for a fixed temperature) a definite fraction of the number of atoms in the liquid phase. The more general result is that the concentration of atoms in the vapour phase is a definite fraction of the concentration of atoms in the liquid phase. The vapour pressure above a liquid in a sealed container does not, in equilibrium, depend on the volume of liquid in the container. Thus (1 À x)N atoms of solvent in the container without xN atoms of dissolved solute would not (and does not) result in a pressure reduced by (1 À x). The reason is as follows. The energy levels for atoms in the vapour are those of particle waves confined within the volume between the liquid surface and the walls of the container. For an ideal gas, the number of energy levels in a given interval of energy is proportional to the volume -the spacing goes down as the volume goes up. If the volume available to vapour doubles, the number of levels in some interval Á\" at \" also doubles and hence so does the number of molecules in the vapour. Thus the concentration of atoms in the vapour phase is constant as the volume increases -the pressure remains the same. Similarly, the molecules in the liquid roam throughout the liquid volume and their wavefunctions are constrained by the walls and the liquid surface. If the volume of liquid is reduced, the sum over the populations of liquid energy levels is reduced because there are fewer of them. The spacing between energy levels in the liquid goes up with the reduction in volume and the concentration in the liquid remains the same. Thus the saturated vapour pressure above the liquid remains constant as the ratio of vapour volume to liquid volume is increased, until of course all the atoms originally in the liquid are in the vapour phase.\n\nThereafter, as the volume is increased (by pulling back on a piston perhaps) the vapour density, and so the pressure along the isotherm, falls.",

For the HPP technology the cap should have the same or higher compressibility than the main body. Consequently, the tightness of the closure can increase with rising pressure. A notable problem appears if filling of the bottle is not complete and the \"parasitic\" air-layer remains. Compressing water up to P = 600 MPa results in relative volume change. For P = 400 MPa one obtains compressible than water. All these may cause irreversible distortions or even break of the bottle when compressing.

The uncertainty in our experiment is dominated by the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz, corresponding to 50 µeV 49 . In addition, there are several minor effects contributing to the uncertainty: for an LaB 6 surface ionizer, as used in this experiment, the energy spread has been determined to be of the order of 0.55 eV 51 . This implies a velocity spread of the ions which is compressed due to the acceleration over a high potential in the subsequent ion beam extraction process 52 . The compressed velocity spread of the ions is given by the expression ∆v = ∆W / √ 2mW , where m is the ion mass, ∆W the energy spread of the ions and W the kinetic energy of the ion beam 53 . The velocity spread of the ion beam can be converted to a spread of the frequency of the laser light of ∆ν = ∆v/λ seen by the ions. This results in a frequency Doppler broadening of only a few MHz in the fast ion beam. The divergence of the ion and laser beams and the interaction time will also contribute to the broadening. However, this accumulates to uncertainties of less than 10 MHz. Consequently, the uncertainties arising from these minor effects could be ignored and only the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz needs to be considered. In addition to these statistical errors, some systematic uncertainties arise: the Doppler shift due to the velocity difference of ions and photons is very large but it can, as described above, be eliminated to all orders by performing the experiment with both co-and counter-propagating laser and ion beams and calculating the geometrical mean to determine the Doppler-free threshold. Hence, the Doppler shift does not contribute to the uncertainty of the result, barring slight potential angle misalignment of maximum 24 mrad as defined by the apertures. However, uncertainties of the ion beam energy and the wavelength calibration could potentially affect the results. Such drifts were estimated to be smaller than 20 µeV by comparing two reference scans on stable 127 I which were performed with the same setup before and after the measurements on astatine.",

For information: Each Ag atom in the historic SGE had a mean momentum of p x = 54 a.u.. Since the mean deflection in z direction in the 3.5 cm long magnet was 0.1 mm the Ag transverse momentum was p z = 0.15 a.u.. This corresponds to a transverse kinetic energy of 1.6 · 10 −3 eV. Using narrower slits (e.g. 1.5 micron) and a velocity selected atomic beam the momentum resolution could be strongly improved below 0.005 a.u. corresponding to an energy change in the atom kinematics of below 10 −5 eV. This excellent resolution value demonstrates the great power of momentum measurements and the great breakthrough of the historic SGE in resolution. Heisenberg (1927) discussed the SGE as a benchmark example of the resolution limits in a quantum physics measurement in his famous paper on the uncertainty relation. But he considered only the energy and not the momentum measurement of the magnetic atom in the magnetic field. He concluded that the precision of the energy measurement depends on the time of flight through the magnetic field t F . The precision of momentum measurement in a single scattering event is not restricted by Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. The uncertainty relation does not affect Stern's measurement approach. Notice, though, that a direct energy measurement would never yield such a resolution.\n\nThis precisely measurable exchange of transverse momentum via the magnetic field interaction implies a reduction to a single eigenfunction (Devereux, 2015). According to (Bohm, 1951, ch. 21) one can calculate the path for a super-positioned two-spin state wave function and the super position remains until impact on the detector. But in momentum space (because of the extremely small de Broglie wave length) the two spin states after entering the magnetic field region are immediately distinguishable by their transverse momenta and follow detectable classical trajectories. This is in full agreement with Bohm's interpretation of the SGE, where he stated: \"It would be possible in principle to measure the spin by measuring the momentum transmitted to the particle by the magnetic field\" (Bohm, 1951, p. 596).",

Such -and even larger-improvements are possible using two-photon spectroscopy. For example, in Refs.

For the purposes of this discussion we do not distinguish between and an ion and a molecule, and we may therefore use the terms interchangeably. The RMS energy uncertainty is given by:\n∆E = kT 2 C v(1)\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C v is heat capacity [1,2,3]. One can estimate the heat capacity using the equipartition theorem. By analogy to the Debye theory of heat capacity of crystals, at room temperature we can assume that most of the vibrational degrees of freedom of a large protein molecule are low frequency modes and can therefore be considered to be fully thermally active. Each oscillator will contribute to the heat capacity, and there are three oscillators per atom. If the molecule contains vibrationally active atoms the equipartition theorem [3] predicts a heat capacity of C v = 3kN . Since we are dealing with large ions we ignore the fact that there are three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, which would effectively reduce by a count of six. After some substitutions and algebra we have:\n∆E = √ 3N kT(2)\nConsider an averagine molecule with chemical formula C 9877 H 15517 N 2715 O 2955 S 83 . In counting atoms to generate a value for N we exclude hydrogen atoms, because they are associated with high frequency modes which, generally speaking, are not thermally activated at ambient temperatures. We therefore calculate by counting the number of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms in the molecule, giving a value of N = 15, 630.\n\nSubstituting this into the Eq. (2) and assuming T = 300 we estimate the thermal energy uncertainty for a single ion to be ∆E = 8.97 × 10 −19 J. Using the relationship between mass and energy from special relativity E = mc 2 we calculate the energy uncertainty to be equivalent to a mass uncertainty of ∆m = 9.98 × 10 −36 kg or ∆m = 6.00 × 10 −9 Da.",

Whether the same energy consideration applies to the WT channel would require a set of calculations on WT; these are left for future work. Because the single proton energy difference is very large going to the down state, we presumably must take two protons to have a realistic representation of the system (possibly a third proton should also have been included to provide adequate gating current, but we saw earlier that this may not be close to the main section of the VSD, hence would be of lesser importance.) If we look primarily at the two proton case, there is a difference of 0.006 Ha ≈ 6 kBT between the open configuration (H + up + middle) and the closed (H + down + middle), a very reasonable difference. The proton-field interaction energy would be larger than 0.006 Ha, approximately 0.004 Ha favoring the closed position, just as would be required. MD simulations generally favor motion of the entire S4. Not all MD simulations lead to the same displacement. These are large and careful calculations, and have been recently reviewed [45], but as we have discussed proton transfer is not allowed: also, there are problems with water in nanoconfined spaces, different types of hydrogen bonds, polarization, variations in salt bridges with water content, and neglect of charge transfer. (It should be immediately acknowledged that there are problems with quantum calculations as well: the calculation is effectively at 0 K, and the energy minimum that is found is not always the global minimum. More important, distant sections of the system must be omitted. Therefore our calculation may also require some revision eventually). We can say, based on the calculations presented here, that the effects of R→C substitution are profound; it is not appropriate to assume that the channel is functionally unchanged by the mutation, with only a mechanical shift in S4 adequate to explain the experimental results.",

A thorough analysis of systematic effects points out that the total uncertainty is 1.1 p.p.b., and the result (ν 0 = 383, 407, 177.38(41) MHz) differs by only 0.6 p.p.b. from the theoretically predicted value (ν th = 383, 407, 177.150(15) MHz). A large contribution to the systematic uncertainty is the effect of chemical reactions in the Coulomb crystal, of which the 1σ uncertainty is 0.61 p.p.b (0.23 MHz).

Since X-ray absorption is Z and edge dependent, there may well exist a spectral and chemical window in which site-specific Thomson scattering results in displacements visible by X-ray pump, X-ray probe experiments at X-ray doses that do not obliterate crystals immediately.Just as in EF-X (51), however, the deposition of linear momentum is a vectorial perturbation.It is therefore essential to analyze the resulting diffraction data in the appropriate reduced-symmetry space group (most generally P1) and to account for the orientation of each crystal relative to the X-ray beam when doing so.\n\nRecently, it has also been proposed that radiation may directly stimulate certain quantum phenomena.For example, Katona and colleagues (70) described the putative observation of quantum behavior in the collective vibrational modes of hen egg white lysozyme crystals stimulated by low-amplitude terahertz laser pulses.Without a doubt, the quantummechanical nature of matter can manifest itself in surprising ways, and this research direction deserves further elaboration.",

In addition to providing protection from the reactive consequences of fermionic 1RE transfer in an atmosphere high in 3 O 2 , 2RE transfer of a bosonic orbital electron couple may have additional advantage. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty of momentum (Δp) multiplied by the uncertainty of position (Δx) is always equal to or greater than ½ħ, that is, ΔpΔx ≥ ½ħ [17]. With regard to 2RE transfer, the bosonic orbital electron couple has S = 0. Consequently, the positional uncertainty of the electron-couple must be proportionally large. The S = 0 nature of HOMO-LUMO redox transfer involving a 2RE orbital electron-couple opens the possibility that such transfer is facilitated by quantum tunneling. The nature of such transfer would be analogous to the emission of a bosonic S = 0 alpha particle from an atomic nucleus in alpha radiation decay [19,20].\n\n\nMyeloperoxidase",

This can be measured directly by enclosing the atoms in a well-characterized blackbody environment and recording the clock shift as this temperature is systematically varied (this simultaneously decreases uncertainty in the BBR environment). The technical challenge lies in the control of temperature homogeneity over various functional areas of the vacuum chamber while accommodating sufficient optical access for a variety of atomic manipulations. One possible solution is to cool and trap atoms in a standard chamber and then transport them in a moving lattice (34) to a secondary chamber, where an ideal, welldefined blackbody environment is established (16). Such an approach avoids the complexity of cryogenic operation and can be generalized to other lattice clock species. These improvements can potentially improve the BBR-related uncertainty to far below 10 −16 .

Our analysis is particularly thorough, including three very different water models: a fixed pointcharge model, a dissociable machine-learned potential fitted to hybrid density functional theory data, and a state-of-the-art many-body forcefield that has shown consistently quantitative accuracy in reproducing many of the classical and quantum properties of water. [43][44][45] We repeat our simulations at different thermodynamic conditions, spanning a range of 100K around the experimental melting point, to exclude the possibility that anomalous effects may be shifted to a different temperature due to the inaccuracies of the models. The three potentials are in excellent agreement with each other, despite being based on widely different models and physical approximations. The ≈ 2 meV accuracy of DINS measurements is not sufficient to discriminate between them. This should elicit new efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of DINS experiments, that despite the technical challenges offer a rather unique approach to probe quantum nuclear fluctuations in aqueous environments, complementing other kinds of neutron spectroscopies. 27 We suggest that ice Ih constitutes a very promising system to be used for benchmarking. Measurements on single crystals should give a better handle of the anisotropy of the distribution, and allow for a more stringent benchmark of both atomic-scale models and of measurements of the integrated, radial distribution, that is necessary before a comparison in more challenging conditions 1 can be meaningfully attempted. Meanwhile, the scaled-gradient estimator we introduce here, together with the efficient and comprehensive implementation in an open-source code that can be interfaced with many electronic-structure packages, and the use of short-range machine-learning potentials that reduce the cost of performing high-end ab initio path integral calculations, should make it possible to further test the accuracy of the atomistic models for this difficult problem.",

Thus, we perform the first few iterations with everything except the three-body Jastrow enabled. After this brief initial optimization, our statistical precision is much improved and it is safer to begin optimizing the more difficult three-body terms. At this point, optimization continues in stages in which different subsets of parameters are allowed to vary.

In this approach the most dangerous aspect of the modeldependence -implicit assumptions on the large-r behavior due to the choice of the model density or model form factor which affect the curvature of G(q) below q min -is replaced by a tail constraint that is explicitly stated and can be included with appropriately specified uncertainties.\n\nWhen using this type of approach one can employ rather general multi-parameter expansions of the density/form factor such as Hermite and Laguerre polynomials times their weight function, or SOG densities; these allow to fit with good χ 2 the data over the full q-range where data are available. As we have discussed above, this is most desirable in order to also constrain as much as possible the shape of the density, including the large-r tail, by the e-p data themselves.",

Therefore, the better timing resolution of 207 Bi with respect to 60 Co might be explained by the fact that low scattering angles, i.e., photon energies near the Compton edges, are producing an effectively lower jitter in the average travel time and distance. Moreover, the differential cross-sections of the Compton scattered photons behave differently for the gamma-ray energies of the three isotopes which might also contribute to the timing jitter.\n\nNevertheless, these effects do not explain the deviation in the IRF broadening between 60 Co and 22 Na, since one rather would expect a FWHM for 22 Na tending to lower values as for 207 Bi due to their close Compton edge energies in the STOP window region ( 207 Bi: 393.3 keV; 22 Na: 340.7 keV). These deviations might be due to erroneous detection of single annihilation events (e.g., PMT 1: start -PMT 2: start + stop) or summation of signals causing pile-up events, which cannot be fully suppressed by software-based filtering, considering that 22 Na was available in a significantly (25×) higher activity (25 µCi vs. 1 µCi) and additionally generated at least three photons per contributing event evidently producing a higher probability of signal-misinterpretation.

The slope of the parameterized form factors at q=0 yields the charge-and magnetic rms-radii, respectively.\n\nThis topic of the proton radii has recently become a subject of intense discussion with the publication of the charge rms-radius determined from the Lamb shift in muonic Hydrogen [1]. This radius, 0.8409±0.0004fm, disagrees by many standard deviations with the value 0.8775±0.005fm from the world data on electron scattering [2], and it also disagrees with the recent value extracted from the transition energies in electronic Hydrogen [3], 0.8758±0.0077 fm.

The sensitivity coefficients of the observed transitions at 78.135, 79.008, and 89.956 GHz transitions were calculated to be K µ = −0.87 for the first two and K µ = −1.4 for the third transition, respectively (see Table III). These three methylamine lines have a mean radial velocity of v CH 3 NH 2 = −6.2±1.6 km s −1 [6]. With |∆K µ | = 0.563 and the uncertainty interval ∆v = 1.6 km s −1 , we obtain a preliminary estimate of ∆µ/µ:\n∆µ µ = ∆v c∆K µ < 9 × 10 −6 ,(10)\nwhere c is the speed of light. A tighter constraint on ∆µ/µ is obtained from the comparison of v CH 3 NH 2 with the radial velocity of the methanol line at 60.531 GHz also detected at z = 0.8859; v CH 3 OH = −5.3 ± 0.5 km s −1 [6]. According to Ref. [3], this transition has a sensitivity coefficient K µ = −7.4. In this case we have |∆K µ | = 6.5 and ∆v = 0.9 ± 1.7 km s −1 , which yields |∆µ/µ| < 10 −6 . This estimate contains an unknown input due to possible non-co-spacial distribution of CH 3 OH and CH 3 NH 2 . More robust constraints on ∆µ/µ are derived from observations of lines of the same molecule. In this approach the low frequency transitions of CH 3 NH 2 at 2166 and 4364 MHz would be particularly attractive as the difference of their sensitivity coefficients is ∆K µ ≈ 21.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe possibility that the quantum dynamics of the spins in radical pairs could underlie the magnetic compass sense of migratory songbirds has attracted a great deal of recent interest. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] One indication that this might be possible is provided by the first experimental demonstration that a radical pair recombination reaction can function as a magnetoreceptor in an Earth strength magnetic field. 14-16 A carotenoidporphyrin-fullerene (CPF) molecule rapidly undergoes two successive electron transfer reactions after photoexcitation to form a long-lived C •+ PF •− radical pair, predominantly in its electronic singlet state, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Once the radical pair has formed, hyperfine interactions between the electron and nuclear spins in the carotenoid radical cause coherent transitions between the singlet and triplet radical pair states, a process which is also affected by the Zeeman interaction of the electron spins with an applied magnetic field. Because the singlet and triplet radical pair states decay at different rates, the time-dependent survival probability of the carotenoid C •+ radical in the pair, which is detectable by transient absorption spectroscopy, [14][15][16] is also sensitive to the applied magnetic field. This sensitivity has been detected experimentally in magnetic fields as low as 39 µT, 14 and also simulated theoretically with semiclassical spin dynamics calculations. 17,18 Since the carotenoid radical contains 45 protons with significant hyperfine coupling constants, going beyond the semiclassical approximation to the spin dynamics presents a considerable challenge. The full spin system has a Hilbert space of dimension 2 47 > 10 14 , and a Liouville space of dimension 2 94 > 10 28 , which makes a naive brute force calculation of the quantum mechanical spin dynamics quite impractical. Using efficient sampling techniques, the upper limit that such a calculation can currently reach is a system with ∼ 20 coupled nuclear spins, 19,20 which is far fewer than are present in C •+ PF •− . A number of semiclassical methods have been developed with the aim of simulating the spin dynamics of radical pairs as complex as this, 17,21-23 but until recently it has not been possible to validate these methods by comparison with exact quantum calculations for such large spin systems.",

On the other hand, lifetimes of most micellar radical pairs are on the same order as this 'maximum limit', so that those lifetimes seem to be long enough for observation of LFEs.This paradox has not frequently been mentioned in previous studies but indicates severe effect of spin relaxations.In the report on TMDPO in the SDS micelle [31], we tried a simulation based on the Liouville equation, but the LFE is overestimated even if the microsecond-order conventional spin relaxations (deriving from anisotropic HF interactions) [60] were taken into account.It turned out that the LFE is dramatically quenched by fast spin dephasing processes of 10 8 −10 9 s −1 , which damps coherences between the sin-glet-triplet and triplet-triplet states (ST and TT dephasings) as\nˆ dephasing = −k STD Ms=−1,0,+1 × {|ST Ms ST Ms | + |T Ms S T Ms S|} − k TTD Ms=−1,+1 {|T 0 T Ms T 0 T Ms | +|T Ms T 0 T Ms T 0 |}(16)\nwhere k STD and k TTD are the rate constants for ST and TT dephasing, respectively [61,62].",

As we pointed out above, the thermally-induced µ CP mol of radicals is many orders larger than permanent µ CP mol of diamagnetic molecules discussed in [17]. The magnetic noise from paramagnetic radicals is also much higher as they have traditional magnetic moments associated with unpaired electron spin,\nµ mol = 2µ B Ω n z .(10)\nThese moments lead to random magnetization of the sample and generate a fluctuating B-field. Unlike B CP , this field is not correlated with the direction of the external E-field and it is the main source of the noise. In our case, the signal-to-noise ratio is\nS/N = 3 µ CP mol µ B N t τ ,(11)\nwhere N is the number of molecules, t is the observation time, and τ is the correlation time for the random thermal magnetization. Factor 3 at the right hand side appears because of the averaging of the magnetic moment (10) over orientations of the molecular axis n. For a strong spin-rotation coupling, as in the case of HgH, τ is determined by interaction of molecular axis with environment. One of such mechanisms is the dipolar interaction between guest radicals, so that τ ∼h/(D 2 n) = 4πh/(3k B T ) for the optimal density (4). For the weak-field limit (8) we get the final expression for S/N:\nS/N = 3 8π EE eff d e k B T V t/h ,(12)",

Our system consists of a NbN thin-film planar superconducting microresonator designed to have a concentrated mode volume to couple to a small amount of paramagnetic material, and to be resilient to magnetic fields of up to 400 mT. At 65 mK we measure high-cooperativity coupling (C ≈ 19) to an organic radical microcrystal containing 10 12 spins in a pico-litre volume. Inspired by protocols developed for qubit measurements, we detect the spin-lattice decoherence rate via the dispersive frequency shift of the resonator. Techniques such as these are enabling pulsed ESR interrogation of very few spins and could provide insights into the surface chemistry of, for example, the material defects in superconducting quantum processors.\n\nIntroduction",

This shape contains a dispersion-to-absorption ratio that describes microwave dispersion from the skin effect but also mimics the more general shape for itinerant resonant spins (conduction electrons), the so-called Dysonian lineshape [10,11]. This \"Dysonian\" is crucially determined by the diffusion of the resonating spins through the microwave penetration depth of the conductive environment. The ratio between the average time of diffusion within and the time of electron spin relaxation, T D ∕T 2 , is related to the asymmetry parameter A / B which is the ratio between the maximum and minimum of the dP/dB lineshape. A∕B = 2.7 refers to the local, stationary case with T D ∕T 2 → ∞ for which a dispersive Lorentzian shape is applicable.\n\nFor our samples and ≤ 34.1 GHz, the smallest was about 1 μm at the lowest temperatures where ≈ 20 μΩcm [1].

A similar shift in the resonance field near simultaneous resonance is reported for coupled ferromagnetic bilayers 58,60 due to a fieldlike torque acting along or against the Larmor precession, with possible contributions from both interfacial exchange coupling 58,60 and spin current transport. 60 Accordingly, the g-factor decrease at θ H ≈ ±68°can be qualitatively understood in the context of a similar macrospin model where the incoming spin current from the NiFe layer can cause the resulting field-like term, which acts as an effective field or equivalently a shift in the g-factor.\n\nΤhe successful emission of spin current from the EBR indicates the possibility of realizing spin pumping even in the absence of long-range ferromagnetic order. Further evidence toward this possibility is the successful observation of spin pumping from a crystalline inorganic paramagnet, showing the same relative change in linewidth (∼10%) as in the present study, 10 together with a theoretical description for spin pumping from a fluctuating ferromagnet near T c . 13 These reports and the results presented here suggest that a generalization of the spin pumping theory is required beyond systems with long-range ferromagnetic order and in particular for the case of organic radicals.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated spin current creation via spin pumping from a purely organic radical following the successful fabrication of stable radical films at room temperature. The spin resonance linewidth and the g-factor can be dynamically controlled via absorption by the radical film of a spin current emitted from a nearby ferromagnet. The present study illustrates the potential of organic radicals to act as spin sources in future spintronic devices.\n\n\n■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n\n\n* sı Supporting Information\n\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c01044.",

Since the authors used an ensemble of NVs, detecting an ensemble of P1 centers respectively, and since no other information is given, I can only surmise that the signal arising from all NVs in the confocal spot (one micron cubed) was taken into consideration. From the low contrast of the resulting data, I also believe that this kind of measurement would not be easy to reproduce on the single spin level (NV and target spin). Therefore, the word 'nanoscale' here is somewhat problematic. I am positive that with different improvements to the experimental setup, the microwave power stability could be mitigated, but as long as that is the case, I fail to see the impact such a measurement could yield compared to the traditional ESR (induction-based) methods. If this were nanoscale ESR, then the fourth figure captures the essence of this work in a striking way, specifically figure 4c and 4d. In general, I think more focus should be given to the impact of this method, namely page 4 and figure 4. Regarding the pulse sequence: the authors' description of it is confusing, to such extent that I am not sure someone else in the community would be able to straight-forwardly reproduce it (not impossible, but just not trivial). I believe more effort should be made in clarifying the experimental details with emphasis on the pulse scheme.\n\nTo summarize: While the manuscript definitely shows great potential, I am not completely convinced that it would have a great impact in the field. If the authors address all the points mentioned in this review and if the problematic issues (nanoscale volume, universality, analytical model) are dealt with, it would indeed be possible to recommend it for publication in Nature Communications.",

Sample Preparation. Radicals 1−9 were dispersed in PMMA. Radical 3 (0.2 mg) and PMMA (150 mg) were dissolved in CHCl 3 (10 mL). Following this, the solution was evaporated to dryness. The product was obtained as a transparent solid on the walls and the bottom of the beaker. The transparent solid was fractured using a microspatula to obtain the product in the form of a powder. A similar procedure was followed for preparing the samples in the presence of other radicals. The samples were stable for at least 6 months.\n\n2.3. Instrumentation. ESR spectra were recorded at room temperature using an X-band spectrometer (JES-FA300 or RE-1X, Jeol) equipped with a TE 011 cylindrical cavity resonator. The powdered specimen (2−3 mg) was packed in a commercial ESR tube (quartz glass; length: 270 mm; o.d.: 5 mm). Following this, the tube was sealed under an atmosphere of He for prolonged storage, and future experiments were conducted under conditions of low temperature (pressure: 4 kPa). The benzene solution of the radicals (10 5 mol L −1 ) was poured into an ESR tube. The X-band (e.g., 9.07 GHz) microwave power was set in the range of 0.001−1 mW under nonsaturated conditions. The magnetic field range and fieldsweep rate were set at 323 ± 15 mT and 30 mT/8 min, respectively. A field modulation of 100 kHz with an amplitude of 0.1 mT was used for the studies. The spin concentration was determined by comparing the double integral of the cw-ESR spectra of the weighed samples with that of the TEMPOL standard solution. The signal intensity of a manganese standard was used as the reference. The experiments were carried out under conditions of a constant cavity loading. The estimated error was 30%.",

The lower bound of Rabi frequency is limited by the transverse relaxation rate of the NV center, which is ~ MHz. While the upper bound of Rabi frequency is limited by the zero-field splitting of the NV center, which is ~ GHz (detail in the reply of comment #4). For some isolated radicals without any intrinsic interactions, it is indeed difficult to detect them by our method as the energy splitting is near zero. However, we believe that this frequency detection range (MHz-GHz) can cover most of the usual paramagnetic radicals and complexes.\n\n02. If all spins give the same signal, is there a spatial feature? What is the sensing volume? What is the no. of NVs in said sensing volume? What is the no. of P1 centers in said sensing volume? How does it compare with standard (traditional) ESR? Reply:\n\nWe apologize for the unclear statement in the previous version. The resonance frequencies (i.e. signal position) of all the spin are the same, but the coupling rates with the NV (i.e. signal intensity) are spatially dependent. The statement has been corrected and a detail description is given in the revised SI.\n\nAs mentioned above, the detection range is less than 15 nm with about four P1 centers residing in the detection area of each NV, the mean NV spacing is ~135 nm with ~100 NVs residing in the confocal spot. Here we note again that the NV is a local sensor, and all the NV sensors are working independently. There is no principal limitation for further single-NV applications.\n\nFor traditional ESR, the best spatial resolution is ~ micron (The traditional ZF-ESR usually need a sample with size of ~cm). While for our NV-based ZF-ESR, the spatial resolution is ~10 nm, it is indeed a significant improvement. 03. \"Methods/State evolution\" is not clear. Too simplistic in my humble opinion. Not only that, but I could not really understand from that section what exactly the pulse sequence used to probe the hyperfine interaction is (I could from the main text, but the \"state evolution\" section only confused me).

In this study, we show that such a radical film can fulfill the role of a source of spin current in a way that is analogous to spin pumping from a ferromagnet. We fabricate a stable Blatter-type radical/NiFe bilayer and carry out simultaneous electron spin resonance (ESR) and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements. A signature of spin current emission from the radical is obtained through its increased linewidth. By carefully tuning the two resonances to coincide, we demonstrate that the radical linewidth increase can be reversibly reduced due to emission of a backward spin current from the FM layer, effectively canceling the radical's emission. This successful use of a radical film as a spin current source indicates the potential of radicals as an alternative to conventional metallic ferromagnets in spintronics.",

Line cuts at four values of B 0 are shown in Figure 2(b) along with their fitted curves. The known resonant dips from the |m S = 0 → |m S = ±1 transitions in the GS [23,26] are present, as well as the additional unreported dips that shift with the applied field along paths parallel to the GS resonance lines, which we attribute to spin transitions in the ES. To quantify the electron spin resonance (ESR) transition frequencies, we fit each ODMR trace with the appropriate number of Lorentzians, and plot the resonant frequencies as a function of applied field [ Fig. 2(c)]. Note that because the ODMR contrast of the ES resonances are significantly lower than those of the GS, we are not able to accurately fit the ES ESR frequencies around values of B 0 where the two overlap, and thus there are some gaps in the ES data. We fit the ESR data with Eq.2 to extract the Hamiltonian parameters. Our measurements agree with previously reported [16,23,1,26] GS splitting parameters D gs = 3.48 ± 0.02 GHz and E gs = 48.0 ± 7.1 MHz, and establish the ES splitting parameters D es = 2.11 ± 0.03 GHz and E es = 74 ± 42 MHz. We also observe that g es ≈ g gs ≈ 2, which indicates that the orbital angular momentum does not play a significant role in the ES spin structure. The average ES linewidth over the field sweep at this microwave power is 133 ± 32 MHz. These measurements were taken at multiple locations from three different hBN flakes with repeatable results. We do not resolve hyperfine splitting in the ES possibly due to power broadening, the short ES lifetime, and inhomogenous broadening in the defect ensemble. Based on the observed linewidth, we estimate an upper limit of ∼100 MHz for the ES hyperfine splitting.",

How will dipole-dipole interactions with nearby (13C) __nuclear__ spins will manifest in the ZF-ESR spectra? Could they explain the unknown dips inFig.3c? Reply:The hyperfine interaction (including the dipole-dipole interaction and the Fermi contact interaction) between the P1 electron spin and a nearby 13C nuclear spin will induce an extra splitting of the resonance lines, and thus the positions of the dips will change. Considering the large difference between the positions of the P1 dips and the extra dips, only the interaction with the nearest 13C nuclear spins may possible induce such large deviations.

Given that this is Nature C ommunications, I am recommending a minor revision to additionally voice my criticism that the manuscript's introduction should be re -written in the broader context of hyperpolarization rather than dissolution DNP alone. The findings and the work conducte d though is of the highest caliber and the manuscript / this contribution will be of broad interest to scientists around the world. I note that more that 100 DNP systems have been sold around the globe (and many home built setups were developed), so this work would be of immediate relevant to a wide range of scientists: from physicists to medical doctors.Key Points: 1) First sentence of the Main text \"Because hyperpolarized 13C MRI is currently the only modality allowing real-time metabolic imaging in vivo\": has no merit. Hyperpolarized 13C MRI is the recent metabolic imaging modality, but certainly not \"the only\". This is a huge insult to the entire field of molecular imaging, and no credible scientists would be able to accept this sentence. I can name a few techniques: detection of redox and other reactions with optical imaging, EPR imaging of oxygenation states, FMISO PET, hyperpolarized 129Xe sensing of receptor imaging… There is a long list.2) There is a second issue with this first sentence. 13C is not the only hyperpolarized nucleus that can be used to track metabolism in vivo. I would rather see the authors to articulate, why 13C is so ubiquitous for biomedical uses: i.e. huge chemical shift dispersion, ubiquitous presence in the vast majority of biomolecules and metabolites, and low natural abundance background. This is Nature C ommunications, and the authors owe it to the reader to guide it to the importance why this work is a big deal (and it is).3) The literature and the Introduction is narrowly focused on selected eighteen references, a significant fraction of those are self-references.

However, U f may become arbitrarily large, as the density difference D0 increases. An estimate of the upper bound of U f can be found by noting that the spreading velocity is bounded by the potential energy of the plume, i.e., the potential energy is converted only to kinetic energy of plume spread. Therefore, the spreading velocity is approximated with (Webber et al., 1992a) \nU f ¼ min K f ðgD0HÞ 1=2 ; ð3gDHÞ 1=2 ;(7)\nwhere K f ¼ 1.05 is the densimetric Froude number, obtained by fitting the modelled plume spread with the Thorney Island experiments. The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (7) represents a theoretical limit value, due to the conservation of energy, based on the analysis of Webber and Brighton (1986) on shallow water equations for liquid pool spread. However, the second term in U f will rarely be significant, only for a short time in the initial stages.",

We tried to repeat his conditions but were unable to obtain such a low velocity. Whether Geiger's result may prove correct or not there must be some very radical change accompanying the absorption of the a-particles when their velocity falls to 0*41 of the initial velocity (radium C). We now turn to the discussion of the figures given in the first section of the paper for the velocity curves in the various materials. For the airvelocity curve Geiger deduced from his results the formula V3 = aR, where V is the velocity, a a constant and R the range of the a-particles emerging from the absorbing foil. Putting in the value 6'94 for the total range at 15° and 76 cm. Hg, the values given in Column 6 of Table II were deduced and it will be seen that except for velocities less than 0*41 they show a good agreement with the experimental values. With regard to the velocity curves in other materials the formula does not hold, the curve approaching more nearly to that expressed by V2 = &R for substances of increasing atomic weight. This is indicated by the energy curve for gold shown in fig. 1. Darwin (loc. cit.) first attempted to deduce expressions for the velocity curve in various materials, the assumption being that the a-particle loses energy by setting in motion the electrons in the atoms of the absorbing substance. To avoid, as far as possible, any hypotheses as to the structure of atoms Darwin also assumed that an a-particle only acts on the electrons in an atom when it actually passes through the atom. Bohr has extended Darwin's results and removed the objection of limiting the action of the a-particle. Bohr arrives at a formula which may be reduced to",

Taylor used equation (3) with Ke instead of KR + KE. These results were used by Taylor to deduce the values of KE, from the observations of the heights at which pronounced bends in the temperatureheight curves were found to occur.\n\nIf we assume a value 105 for KR + K E, corresponding to fairly turbulent conditions, KE being greatly in excess of KE, then the height to which a surface change of temperature is transmitted in * seconds is given by z2 = 4-105*, or z = 2 • 102a/ 10* where z is in centimetres.

The stress tensors σ j and the associated forces F j and torques τ j include the hydrodynamic effect of the wall (i.e., the consequences of imposing the no-slip boundary condition u = 0 at the wall), while the slip velocity v s at the particle surface includes the chemical effect of the wall (i.e., the consequences of imposing the no-flux condition ∂c/∂n = 0 at the wall). Via substitution of suitable alternatives (see below) for these quantities, we can identify the roles of the two effects in determining the particle motion. In order to identify the chemical effect of the wall, we can use as the dual problem a particle translating or rotating in free space, and substitute the f ree space stress tensor σ j f s and the associated forces and torques into Eq. (7). In order to identify the hydrodynamic effect of the wall, one can calculate the slip velocity v f s s for the active particle in free space, and substitute this quantity into the rhs of Eq. (7). Now we consider the wall-induced chemical and hydrodynamic contributions toθ = −Ω x for half coverage (χ 0 = 0) (note that the minus sign is due to the definition of θ, see Fig. 1(a) in the main text). Strikingly, the chemical contribution of the wall to rotation is orders of magnitude smaller than the hydrodynamic contribution (Fig. 5). This is to be expected: it has been shown that irrespective of the spatially non-uniform distribution of the solute, a phoretic rotation of a spherical particle with uniform surface mobility b(r) cannot occur [8]. Therefore the rotation appearing in the trajectories in Figs. (1)-(3) in the main text are solely due to the hydrodynamic interaction of the particle with the planar wall. In fact, because we expect the chemical contribution to be identically zero, Fig. 5 . This plot includes both the chemical and hydrodynamic effects of the wall: since the wall is impenetrable to the product, it creates a gradient in number density; and since there is a no-slip condition at the wall, it reflects the disturbance flows created by the particle.

(10) or Eq. (11), the value of the nuclear velocity can be estimated from the energy conservation condition. We have two different values forṘ:Ṙ adi , which assumes a motion on the ground adiabatic state, andṘ dia for a motion in the first diabatic state. Both velocities would then represent an unperturbed motion in their respective bases. Given an initial total energy for a trajectory, the velocities are evaluated aṡ\nR = 2 M ( − E) 1 2 ,(12)\nwhere forṘ =Ṙ dia (Ṙ adi ) we use E = E a (E 1 ) at the diabatic crossing point. Since we are working with the adiabatic values, we will be using the velocity estimate using E = E 1 in Eq. (12).\n\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTo illustrate correlation between our indicator and performance of mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods we performed simulations with the EH, SH, and SO methods on two one-dimensional models. All MQC simulations were run using 2000 trajectories with initial conditions sampled from a Wigner Gaussian distribution with the standard deviation of 1/ √ 2 for both nuclear positions and momenta. Dynamics were propagated using the fourthorder Runge-Kutta method for ≈ 121 fs, with a time-step of ∆t = 1.0(0.1) a.u. for a sinusoidal (metallic surface) model. In all cases, dynamics were checked to yield converged results with respect to the time-step. The particle mass was set to be of 2000 a.u.\n\nAll SH dynamics were done in the adiabatic basis except in the low coupling case shown in Fig. 4c,d. For this case, the motion is highly diabatic, and as discussed in Ref. 24, SH yields better results in the representation with fewer hops, which is the diabatic representation in this case.",

For a particle incoming from z = ∞, on the lower surfaces U 0 , there is an energetic barrier to reach the crossing point. When broadening is taken into account (e.g., through the BCME), this barrier is lowered. The arrows show the crossing point with or without broadening.\n\nconcern is how will the dynamics depend on different values of x 1 and Γ 0 (as well as in the incoming momentum in the z direction, p 0 ). In Fig. 1, we plot the individual components making up the diabatic potential energy surfaces in Eq. (19). In Fig. 2, we plot the total potential surfaces in the z direction (for one fixed x), and we show the effects of broadening. We also plot the hybridization function Γ(r).\n\nFor each calculation reported below, we have run 5000 trajectories. To roughly simulate the Wodtke experiments, 8 each trajectory was initialized to the 15th vibrational state.\n\nIn the x direction, trajectories were initialized with a microcanonical ensemble: we weighted all (x, p x ) satisfying E x = E 0 vib = 15.5 ω equally. In the z direction, trajectories were initialized at position z = 15 and the momentum p z was chosen from a Gaussian distribution with p 0 and σ = mkT 2 . We used a time step dt = 0.25 a.u. and propagated trajectories for 2 × 10 6 steps. Dynamics were carried out with the velocity-Verlet propagator. Unless stated otherwise, the trapped particles were not considered, and we analyzed exclusively reflected particles (which were collected at z = 20).\n\n\nIV.

[2] and Shabanian et al. [31] for further details.To estimate the total loss of energy during the collision interval, Darabi et al. [2] proposed an approximate analytical approach to estimate viscous, capillary, and solid-solid contact losses and then combine them through the superposition principle.Since the general equation of motion, as described in Eq.

In the noise-free case T = T R = 0, the self-propelled motion is linear along the particle orientation, i.e. the selfpropelled particle is a linear swimmer .Its propulsion speed is the imposed v 0 .As a remark, the orientational dynamics can equivalently be written as\nγ R ṅ = g(t) × n (3)\nwhere we extended all vectors to three dimensions such that n = (n x , n y , 0) and g(t) = (0, 0, g(t)).Let us first discuss the number of independent parameters inherent in the equations of motion ( 1) and (2) in the steady state.By choosing suitable units for length and time such as the persistent length p = v 0 /D r and the persistence time τ p = 1/D r where D r = k B T R /γ R denotes the rotational diffusion constant, a scaling of the equations results in only one remaining independent parameter which can be chosen to be a dimensionless Peclet number",

When comparing the expression obtained from our STAP model to the simulations, we need to fit the parameters of the effective medium that confines the tracer particle, i.e. the effective friction coefficient (λ), and the effective elastic confinement (k).\n\nWe now compare the analytic expression that we obtained for the tracer particle's mean kinetic energy T a kin (Eq.1), with the values obtained in the simulations [3,4].

However, U f may become arbitrarily large, as the density difference D0 increases. An estimate of the upper bound of U f can be found by noting that the spreading velocity is bounded by the potential energy of the plume, i.e., the potential energy is converted only to kinetic energy of plume spread. Therefore, the spreading velocity is approximated with (Webber et al., 1992a) \nU f ¼ min K f ðgD0HÞ 1=2 ; ð3gDHÞ 1=2 ;(7)\nwhere K f ¼ 1.05 is the densimetric Froude number, obtained by fitting the modelled plume spread with the Thorney Island experiments. The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (7) represents a theoretical limit value, due to the conservation of energy, based on the analysis of Webber and Brighton (1986) on shallow water equations for liquid pool spread. However, the second term in U f will rarely be significant, only for a short time in the initial stages.",

We tried to repeat his conditions but were unable to obtain such a low velocity. Whether Geiger's result may prove correct or not there must be some very radical change accompanying the absorption of the a-particles when their velocity falls to 0*41 of the initial velocity (radium C). We now turn to the discussion of the figures given in the first section of the paper for the velocity curves in the various materials. For the airvelocity curve Geiger deduced from his results the formula V3 = aR, where V is the velocity, a a constant and R the range of the a-particles emerging from the absorbing foil. Putting in the value 6'94 for the total range at 15° and 76 cm. Hg, the values given in Column 6 of Table II were deduced and it will be seen that except for velocities less than 0*41 they show a good agreement with the experimental values. With regard to the velocity curves in other materials the formula does not hold, the curve approaching more nearly to that expressed by V2 = &R for substances of increasing atomic weight. This is indicated by the energy curve for gold shown in fig. 1. Darwin (loc. cit.) first attempted to deduce expressions for the velocity curve in various materials, the assumption being that the a-particle loses energy by setting in motion the electrons in the atoms of the absorbing substance. To avoid, as far as possible, any hypotheses as to the structure of atoms Darwin also assumed that an a-particle only acts on the electrons in an atom when it actually passes through the atom. Bohr has extended Darwin's results and removed the objection of limiting the action of the a-particle. Bohr arrives at a formula which may be reduced to",

The stress tensors σ j and the associated forces F j and torques τ j include the hydrodynamic effect of the wall (i.e., the consequences of imposing the no-slip boundary condition u = 0 at the wall), while the slip velocity v s at the particle surface includes the chemical effect of the wall (i.e., the consequences of imposing the no-flux condition ∂c/∂n = 0 at the wall). Via substitution of suitable alternatives (see below) for these quantities, we can identify the roles of the two effects in determining the particle motion. In order to identify the chemical effect of the wall, we can use as the dual problem a particle translating or rotating in free space, and substitute the f ree space stress tensor σ j f s and the associated forces and torques into Eq. (7). In order to identify the hydrodynamic effect of the wall, one can calculate the slip velocity v f s s for the active particle in free space, and substitute this quantity into the rhs of Eq. (7). Now we consider the wall-induced chemical and hydrodynamic contributions toθ = −Ω x for half coverage (χ 0 = 0) (note that the minus sign is due to the definition of θ, see Fig. 1(a) in the main text). Strikingly, the chemical contribution of the wall to rotation is orders of magnitude smaller than the hydrodynamic contribution (Fig. 5). This is to be expected: it has been shown that irrespective of the spatially non-uniform distribution of the solute, a phoretic rotation of a spherical particle with uniform surface mobility b(r) cannot occur [8]. Therefore the rotation appearing in the trajectories in Figs. (1)-(3) in the main text are solely due to the hydrodynamic interaction of the particle with the planar wall. In fact, because we expect the chemical contribution to be identically zero, Fig. 5 . This plot includes both the chemical and hydrodynamic effects of the wall: since the wall is impenetrable to the product, it creates a gradient in number density; and since there is a no-slip condition at the wall, it reflects the disturbance flows created by the particle.

(10) or Eq. (11), the value of the nuclear velocity can be estimated from the energy conservation condition. We have two different values forṘ:Ṙ adi , which assumes a motion on the ground adiabatic state, andṘ dia for a motion in the first diabatic state. Both velocities would then represent an unperturbed motion in their respective bases. Given an initial total energy for a trajectory, the velocities are evaluated aṡ\nR = 2 M ( − E) 1 2 ,(12)\nwhere forṘ =Ṙ dia (Ṙ adi ) we use E = E a (E 1 ) at the diabatic crossing point. Since we are working with the adiabatic values, we will be using the velocity estimate using E = E 1 in Eq. (12).\n\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTo illustrate correlation between our indicator and performance of mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods we performed simulations with the EH, SH, and SO methods on two one-dimensional models. All MQC simulations were run using 2000 trajectories with initial conditions sampled from a Wigner Gaussian distribution with the standard deviation of 1/ √ 2 for both nuclear positions and momenta. Dynamics were propagated using the fourthorder Runge-Kutta method for ≈ 121 fs, with a time-step of ∆t = 1.0(0.1) a.u. for a sinusoidal (metallic surface) model. In all cases, dynamics were checked to yield converged results with respect to the time-step. The particle mass was set to be of 2000 a.u.\n\nAll SH dynamics were done in the adiabatic basis except in the low coupling case shown in Fig. 4c,d. For this case, the motion is highly diabatic, and as discussed in Ref. 24, SH yields better results in the representation with fewer hops, which is the diabatic representation in this case.",

The arrows show the crossing point with or without broadening.\n\nconcern is how will the dynamics depend on different values of x 1 and Γ 0 (as well as in the incoming momentum in the z direction, p 0 ).

[2] and Shabanian et al. [31] for further details.To estimate the total loss of energy during the collision interval, Darabi et al. [2] proposed an approximate analytical approach to estimate viscous, capillary, and solid-solid contact losses and then combine them through the superposition principle.Since the general equation of motion, as described in Eq. ( 5), (17), or (S.1), has no analytical solution even when neglecting the body forces, Darabi et al. [2] recommended neglecting the capillary contribution in the equation of motion to obtain an analytical expression for the particle speed and, hence, expressions for the viscous and solid-solid contact losses.One can independently obtain an analytical expression for the loss of energy due to the capillary effect.They showed that the approximate analytical values obtained through the proposed analytical energy balance model were in good agreement with those attained by solving the equation of motion numerically.According to Darabi et al.'s model, two colliding identical wet particles agglomerate if e w = 0, i.e., the maximum possible energy dissipation calculated by the analytical energy balance model is equal to or greater than the total initial kinetic energy of the system.Otherwise, a rebound outcome can take place and the corresponding e w (0 < e w ≤ e) can be estimated.",

In the noise-free case T = T R = 0, the self-propelled motion is linear along the particle orientation, i.e. the selfpropelled particle is a linear swimmer .Its propulsion speed is the imposed v 0 .As a remark, the orientational dynamics can equivalently be written as\nγ R ṅ = g(t) × n (3)\nwhere we extended all vectors to three dimensions such that n = (n x , n y , 0) and g(t) = (0, 0, g(t)).Let us first discuss the number of independent parameters inherent in the equations of motion ( 1) and (2) in the steady state.By choosing suitable units for length and time such as the persistent length p = v 0 /D r and the persistence time τ p = 1/D r where D r = k B T R /γ R denotes the rotational diffusion constant, a scaling of the equations results in only one remaining independent parameter which can be chosen to be a dimensionless Peclet number",

The power dependence clearly demonstrates the onset of nonlinear absorption above 30 GW/cm^2. At this excitation, they document a change in absorption at 1513 cm-1 as a direct measure of the fraction of cis photoproduct. The onset of nonlinear absorption sets in at approximately an excitation fraction of 30% (consistent with the estimated number of photons per retinal in the supplemental material). If one looks at the signal level at 180 GW/cm^2, the highest excitation done for the laser power dependence, the signal is approximately the same as at 30 GW/cm^2 and a factor of 50% less than at 60 GW/cm^2. The signal should have been at least as large as the signal at 60 GW/cm^2 which would be the saturation excitation. This single measurement definitely shows that there are other processes occurring that are depleting the 1-photon channel for absorption. The amount of cis photoproduct is going down not up in relation to other excitation channels. This measurement was done at 180 GW/cm^2, which is a factor 3 less than the peak power used for the time resolved x-ray studies. If the nonlinear multiphoton process is being dominated by 2-photon processes, then the fraction of retinal excited by 2-photon processes would be 10x larger than the maximum peak power done in the laser titration. Taking 30% to be the fraction excited at 30 GW/cm^2, there would only be 3% of the retinal excited via 1-photon channels at the 500 GW/cm^2 used in the experiments. This control study shows the multiphoton absorption is not a minor channel but is the major photon absorption pathway. (It should be noted that 3photon channels will make this situation worse.)",

The peculiar nature of HD 44179, its location within an optically thick disk, and its uncertain distance make it difficult to estimate the total visual attenuation of its light as seen from Earth. Here we adopt the latest model (Men'shchikov et al. 2002) which assigns a distance of 710 pc and a total luminosity of 6050 L ⊙ to the central object, with uncertainties of 10 % and 20 %, respectively. Given a visual brightness of V = 8.83 (Cohen et al. 1975), we then estimate a visual attenuation of A V = 4.2 mag. Here, we deliberately distinguish between attenuation and extinction. By extinction we understand the partial obscuration of direct star light due to absorption and scattering by dust along the direct line-ofsight to the star, while attenuation measures the reduction of observable flux due to absorption and scattering in a complex geometry, where the residual observable flux may indeed only be scattered light re-directed into the line of sight while the direct light is totally absorbed, as is the case in the RR.",

It is clearly seen that in the case of a 0.1 bar CO 2 atmosphere, the influence of the atmosphere on these radiative fluxes, hence the influence on the planetary albedo, is rather small. The profiles all remain approximately constant throughout the entire atmosphere in this case. In contrast to that, in the 20 bar scenario, the atmospheric influence is very strong.For the planet around the Sun, the incoming stellar flux is roughly reduced by a factor of 2 (black line, 340 Wm −2 incoming flux at the top of the atmosphere, ∼ 160 Wm −2 reaching the surface). Most of this radiation is reflected back to space due to very efficient Rayleigh scattering (red line). The surface albedo contributes around 70 Wm −2 to the upwards flux at the top of the atmosphere, while the Rayleigh scattering component amounts to 120 Wm −2 . For the planet around the M-dwarf AD Leo, the influence of the atmosphere in the 20 bar scenario is also very prominent. However, in this case it is primarily due to the absorption of near-IR radiation by CO 2 . The surface and the Rayleigh scattering both contribute with about 50 % to the overall outgoing flux, but in absolute terms, the Rayleigh scattering component is reduced to about 35 Wm −2 (i.e., almost a factor of 4 compared to the Sun). The stellar flux reaching the surface is reduced from 340 Wm −2 to less than 150 Wm −2 , which is only slightly less than for the planet around the Sun. Comparing the Rayleigh scattering component with the reduction in downwards flux, one finds that approximately 150 Wm −2 are absorbed in the atmosphere. It is noteworthy that although the planetary atmosphere has a huge impact on the flux profiles, in the case of the planet around AD Leo the planetary albedo does not change that much. In the 0.1 bar and the 20 bar scenario, both top-ofatmosphere outgoing flux values are nearly identical.",

In Aikawa & Herbst (1999) and Paper I, the visual extinction A v from the central star is obtained at each position in the disk by integrating the density distribution along the line of sight to the central star, and the dissociation rate is obtained with the NSM depthdependent rates. The dissociation rate via the interstellar UV field is obtained in a similar way using the depthdependent NSM rates and calculating A v from the disk surface. Figure 3 shows the total dissociation rate via UV radiation from the interstellar field and the central star. In the dotted and dashed lines, the two components can be easily distinguished: radiation from the central star dominates at Z ∼ > 50 AU, while interstellar radiation dominates at Z ∼ < 50 AU. In Fig. 3, it is seen that the dissociation rates are significantly underestimated at Z ∼ 50 AU, if the approximate depth-dependent rates described above are used. This is caused by geometrical effects: the depth-dependent rates are originally obtained for a plane-parallel cloud, whereas the central star irradiates the disk obliquely. For 50 % of the photons which are scattered in the disk surface, the grazing angle between the disk and the ray path becomes larger than the initial value, which causes deeper penetration into the disk.",

The heat so received by any body so placed in the focus, must, after the body has acquired its highest temperature, be emitted from it at the same rate_ The heat so enutted will consist: first, of heat radiated into that part of space toward which the radiating surface of the body looks; secondly, of heat carried of by convection of the air; thirdly, of heat conducted away by the body supporting the body subjected to experiment; fourthly, of heat rays, if any, reflected, and not absorbed, by the body subjected to experiment. Assuming it as a reasonable conjecture that full half of all this* consists of heat radiated into the single hemisphere looking upon a flat surface, we may conclude that the body, at its highest acquired temperature, radiated not less th.an 2'.th as much heat as is radiated by an equal extent of surface of the sun's photosphere, over and above such part of that radiation as may be intercepted by the sun's atmosphere, and such rays of low intensity as are totally absorbed by our own atmosphere, the whole of which apparently cannot be great. No allowance seems necessary for the chromatic and spherical dispersion of the lenses, since the diameter of the focus is stated at half an inch, while the true diameter of the sun's image would be not less than one-third of an inch. Now we are not without the means of forming a probable approximate estimate of this temperature at which the radia~ion becomes 2~th, more or less, of that of the sun's photosphere.

For example, the original ex vivo data from Boettner and Wolter (1962) shows that there is a window of increased ultraviolet transmission through the anterior media that is centered around 320 nm (40 nm full bandpass) such that nearly as much 320 nm radiation reaches the retina as 400 nm light [5]. This window of transmission seems to sharply decline with age [6] until nearly all detectable UVB (280-315nm) and wavelengths up to 320 nm appears to be absorbed by the anterior media past about the age of 30 years. This age-related decline in ultraviolet transmission appears to be relatively sharp [7]. The average transmission of 320 nm radiation by the crystalline lens goes from around 4.57% at age five to less than half of one percent by age 25 [8,9]. Despite such low levels of transmission, the exposure of the retina to UVB is likely clinically significant [9]due to the nature of the phototoxic effect of such short-wave high energy quanta. UVB radiation, for instance, is sufficiently energetic to initiate not only phototoxicity but also photocarcinogenesis due to its ability to effect DNA.\n\nGiven that the anterior media is clear enough in children [10] and young adults to transmit this damaging ultraviolet, it follows that this group is particularly vulnerable to its actinic effects. Historically, this also included aphakics [11] or patients with implants without UV absorbing chromophores [12]. Other groups, however, are likely also susceptible due to excessive exposure. This includes professions such as welders, outdoor athletes, and individuals taking drugs that act as photosensitizers [13].",

The diurnal distribution of UV ocular exposure is different from the distribution of the horizontal ambient UVB irradiances where all the fitted equations fit the linear function in the total SEA range. This paper calculates the dosimetry ratios of ambient and ocular exposure to UVB spectrum irradiances of three SEA ranges to the total SEA range at specific wavelengths. For the ratio of ambient UV spectrum irradiance at these wavelengths, we found that the maximum ratio of the wavelengths in the three different SEA ranges of ambient UV irradiance reached ,60% in the 60u-85u SEA range around noon when the UV rays are strongest. The maximum ratio of the selected wavelengths in the SEA range of 60u-85u is several times greater than the minimum ratio in the SEA range of 7u-30u for the same wavelength. However, for the ratio of ocular exposure to UV spectrum irradiance of the wavelengths in the three different SEA ranges to the total SEA range, we found that the maximum ratio of ocular exposure to the UV spectrum irradiance was ,50% of all the selected wavelengths in the 30u-60u SEA range. Thus the dosimetry distribution of the ambient and ocular exposure to UVB spectrum irradiance varies considerably.  This work suggests that the high-risk period for eye-damaging solar UV radiation is not only at noon but also in the morning and afternoon in the 30u-60u SEA range. Additionally, the ratio of ocular exposure to UV irradiance in the 60u-85u SEA range at the 300 nm wavelength is similar to the ratio of ocular exposure to UV irradiance in the 7u-30u SEA range. However, the ratio of ocular exposure to UV irradiance in the 60u-85u SEA range of the other",

For a given chemical reaction, the NO 2 absorption crosssection and the quantum yield at a given wavelength are available from laboratory measurements (Keller-Rudek and Moortgat, 2010). They depend only slightly on temperature. The actinic flux, however, is highly variable since it is a function of the actual radiation conditions, the spectral field of direct, diffuse and reflected radiation. Thus the actinic flux depends on the solar zenith angle and on the scattering and absorption processes in the atmosphere, i.e. on the amount and type of the aerosol particles, the absorbing gases, the air molecules and the surface albedo. For the photolysis frequency of NO 2 the radiation in the range below 420 nm is of interest, with a relatively large amount of diffuse radiation. Since the radiances from all directions participate in the actinic flux with equal importance, also the radiances from directions with large zenith angle contribute essentially.",

In this section, we present a review of some recent work on this topic and discuss how our work differs from it. Cockell (2002) calculated the UV flux received at the surface of Earth at 3.5 Ga using a monolayer delta-Eddington approach to radiative transfer, assuming a solar zenith angle SZA = 0°(i.e., the Sun directly overhead) 2 , for an atmosphere composed of 0.7 bar N 2 and 40 mbar and 1 bar of CO 2 , as well as an atmosphere with a sulfur haze. Cockell (2002) found the surface UV flux to be spectrally characterized by a cutoff at >190 nm imposed by CO 2 . The author further found the surface UV flux for non-hazy primordial atmospheres to be far higher than that of the modern day due to a lack of UVshielding oxygen and ozone, with hazes potentially able to provide far higher attenuation. Cnossen et al. (2007) calculated the UV flux received at the surface of Earth at 4-3.5 Ga at SZA = 0°. To calculate atmospheric radiative transfer, they partitioned the atmosphere into layers. They computed absorption using the Beer-Lambert law. To account for scattering, they calculated the flux scattered in each layer and assumed half of it proceeds up and half proceeds down. They iterated this process to the surface and explored the effect of atmospheric composition on surface flux, assuming an N 2 -CO 2 -dominated atmosphere with levels of CO 2 varying from 0.02 to 1 bar, levels of CH 4 spanning 1 order of magnitude, and levels of O 3 spanning 5 orders of magnitude. Cnossen et al. (2007) found that atmospheric attenuation prevented flux at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm from reaching the surface in all the case studies they considered. In all cases, they found the surface flux to be far higher than that of modern Earth, again due to lack of UVshielding oxic molecules. They further found that the surface flux was insensitive to variation in CH 4 and O 3 concentration at the levels they considered and that the wavelength cutoff from CO 2 rendered",

The value of B can be obtained from that of the emissivity as follows :-Let E be the emissivity (the ratio between the heat emitted by unit area of the surface to that emitted by unit area of a black body in the same circum stances) of the (grey) radiating surfaces, in this case the vacuum adjacent surfaces of a Dewar vessel. If X is the amount of heat radiated by unit area of a black body, then the amount radiated by unit area of the surface under con sideration is XE. This radiation falls on the opposite surface, and a part of it, XE (E), will be absorbed ; the remainder, XE (1 -E), is reflected back again to the original surface, where XE (1 -E) (1 -E) is again reflected, and XE (1 -E) E re-absorbed. The reflected portion falls once more on the receiver where XE (1 -E)(l -E) E is absorbed, so that the net heat transfer by radiation from one surface to the other is given by the sum of the geometric progression :-\nX [E2 + E2 (1 -E)2 + E2 (1 -E)4 + . . .],\nwhich is :-\nXE2 _ XE 1 -(1 -E 2) 2-E' U\nIt has been assumed that the heat transferred between unit areas of two E black bodies is X, and therefore -----=-is the factor B, and equation (2) 2 -E representing the heat transfer between unit areas of two grey bodies may be written :-\nQ = K (Tx4 -T24).(4)\nThis argument only holds good if the two surfaces have the same emissivity E. If they are still grey, but have different emissivities E and E', an argument similar to the above leads to the series :-",

We compute 25 transmission spectra, equidistant in orbital phase. Furthermore, we assume an edge-on orbit, a semi-major axis of 0.033 AU, a stellar radius of 1.73 sun , and an orbital period of 1.81 days -commensurate with the parameters of the WASP-76 system (West et al. 2016). We ignore effects of limb darkening as these were reported have a negligible impact on the Doppler shifts obtained from cross-correlation .\n\nAs discussed in Wardenier et al. (2021), Monte-Carlo radiative transfer is a stochastic technique. To compute a transmission spectrum, we initialise photon packets with a random impact parameter and impact angle at each wavelength. During ingress and egress we only illuminate the part of the limb that is blocking the star. The spectrum converges to the true solution in the limit → ∞ (we use = 10 5 in this work). For each photon packet, we compute the optical depth along the line of sight, whereby we Doppler-shift the opacities in each atmospheric cell according to the local line-of-sight velocity los that results from winds and planetary rotation (see Fig.  4). We refer to Section 3.3 in Wardenier et al. (2021) for the relevant equations. Because we account for scattering through absorption cross-sections (a treatment justified in transmission as scattering causes photons to depart from the line of sight and not contribute to the flux), we effectively use gCMCRT as a randomised-transit-chord algorithm. The propagation direction of the photon packets does not change after their initialisation.",

(2003).",

This work is e2/r , which becomes 1'16 x 10~u erg if we put e -3 4 x 10\" 10 and r = 10-8 cm. All the best determinations of the energy necessary to make an ion give a value of this order.\n\nWhen an atom is ionised the electron must possess an amount of kinetic energy equal to the above to enable it to get away from the positive atom. But besides this it probably has an additional quantity of energy sufficient to make its temperature equal to that of the parent atom. The mass of an electron given by the equation e /m = l* 8 4 x l0 7 is 6*1 x 10-28 gramme. If the mass of a hydrogen molecule is taken as 14'2 x 10\"25 gramme, and its velocity of translation at 0° C. as 185,900 cm. per second, then we have v2 x 6*1 x 10-28 = 14*2 x 10-25 x (185,9002), where v is the additional velocity of the electron. This equation gives v = 9 x 106 cm corresponding to this velocity is 2'47 x 10-u erg, which is small in comparison with the energy expended in separating the electron from its parent atom.\n\nI t is of interest to note that the slow cathode particles set free by the a-particle and by cathode rays have a velocity of 3'4 x 108 cm. per second, and this velocity is independent of the nature of the metal which emits them.* The kinetic energy corresponding to this velocity is 3*5 x 10~12 erg, which is of the same order of magnitude as the energy necessary to make an ion.",

Two-photon ionization of xenon, where one of the photons is 118 nm and the other is a 355 nm photon, is likely the mechanism producing xenon ions. The intensity of the 355 nm light is much larger than that of the third harmonic, so we can assume the absorption of the 118 nm light is the rate limiting step. We model this process as two-photon, two-color ionization model where the absorption of the 118 nm photon is far from resonance and is affected by the pressure in the gas cell due to pressure broadening. This pressure broadened absorption is the proposed mechanism for loss of 118 nm light in the detection region for high cell pressures. In Xenon the two lines closest to resonance with the 118 nm light are the Xe ( 2 P 3/2 )5d 3 2 line at 119.2 nm and the Xe ( 2 P 3/2 )7s line at 117 nm. We also must consider the Kr ( 2 P 1/2 )5d 1 2 resonance line at 116.5 nm, which can lead to additional absorption in the case of phase matching with Kr. Argon does not have any transitions near enough to 118 nm to cause significant loss.",

The energy of the rays was measured by their heating effect. They obtained for the energy necessary to make an ion the value 19*6 x 10-11 erg. This value is probably too high, for according to Barkla a large amount of energy is dissipated in the form of scattered radiation.\n\nA gas at a high temperature undergoes considerable ionisation. Equilibrium is reached when the number of ions formed is equal to the number lost by recombination. The thermodynamics of such a process, which has been worked out by Gibbs and others, gives an equation connecting the work of dissociation or ionisation with other known quantities. This relation has been used by H. A. Wilson^ to determine the energy of ionisation from by the Cathode Rays eje measurements of the conductivity of a gas. He obtained the value 2'8 x 10-12 erg in this way.\n\nTownsend,* in his experiments on ionisation by collision, was able to determine from the electric field applied the velocity of the electron when it produced an ion by collision. This velocity he found to be 2*7 x 10? cm. per sec. He thus obtained the value 2*3 x 10-11 erg as the energy necessary to produce an ion. This velocity is of the same order as the thermal velocity of agitation of an electron at a temperature of the order of 1000° C. Possibly at high temperatures the free ions in m atter might produce fresh ions merely by their velocity of agitation.\n\nStark found from other data the value 5*1 x 10-11 erg, while Langevin gives the value 10*1 x 10\" 11 erg.\n\nR utherfordf has determined the energy necessary to make an ion by the a-particle. Knowing the heating effect of a gramme of radium and the number of a-particles ejected, the kinetic energy of an a-particle was calculated to be 4 7 x 10~6 erg. Now 48 per cent, of the kinetic energy is spent on ionisation, and since an a-particle produces about ^6,000 ions, the energy necessary to make an ion becomes 2-7 x 10\" 11 erg.",

The most common decay (99.57%) is by emission of a beta particle and formation of the stable isotope 85 Rb. The emitted beta particles have a maximum energy of 687 keV and an average energy of 251 keV. We will use the average energy for our calculations. Krypton-85 has the advantage that it is an inert gas. Therefore it is used in many applications, e.g. in leak detection [39] or as a small admixture to argon as an ignition aid for high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps [40].\n\nWe use a mixture of 9.9 ppb (parts per billion) of 85 Kr in pure nitrogen. Details of the impurities in this mixture as specified by the gas supplier are given in table 1. This mixture has a specified decay rate of 500 Bq cm −3 (=500 kBq l −1 ) at standard temperature and pressure, or about 13.5 nCi cm 3 (nCi = nanocurie = 37 decays per second). In our vessel with a volume of about 100 L, this leads to about 5 × 10 7 decays per second at atmospheric pressure. The average time between decays is 20 ns which means that during a streamer discharge of 100 ns-1 µs duration 5-50 decays will take place in our gas volume.\n\nAccording to an empirical formula by Glendenin [41,42], the penetration length of a 251 keV beta particle in air at atmospheric pressure is about 50 cm which is nearly equal to the dimensions of our vacuum vessel. The average path length before an emitted particle hits the wall is about 25 cm. Therefore we assume that only half of the energy of the particle is absorbed inside the gas.\n\nWhen we assume that half of the energy loss of the particle inside the gas is used to ionize molecular nitrogen (ionization energy 15.6 eV), we can estimate the electronion pair production at about 4000 pairs per emitted beta particle.",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

Using the same apparatus and measurements described above, xenon and krypton were phase matched with an optimum Kr/Xe ratio of 4.6, which agreed with the krypton dispersion calculated in Mahon et al. 34 This mixture also produced a maximum of 118 nm light followed by a decrease with increasing gas pressure. The fluorescence streak was also present only with a phase-matched mixture of the two gasses. (Fig. 6). Spectra of the fluorescence were obtained for the Xe/Ar (Fig.7 (a)) and Xe/Kr (Fig.7 (b)) systems using an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer. Spectral lines were assigned using data from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database. 35 We mark the location of all lines in the NIST database that are above a certain threshold relative intensity 35 in order to identify observed lines and note which lines are missing from the spectra. For Xe and Kr, a threshold of 500 was used, and for Ar a threshold of 20000 relative intensity was used. The Xe/Ar spectrum (Fig. 7 (a)) shows predominantly Xe I spectral lines and weak Ar I spectral lines. The lines are similar in relative signal to those observed from a xenon arc lamp, indicating that the fluorescence is likely from electron-ion recombination in xenon. The spectrum for the Xe/Kr system (Fig.7 (b)) also shows predominantly Xe I spectral lines, with Kr I spectral lines appearing relatively weakly. Xenon is ionized preferentially despite being present in a lower concentration than the phasematching gasses (Ar or Kr). This would seem to indicate that ionization is not due to just the high electric field of the 355 nm light, but a resonant process involving xenon. The energetics suggest a two-photon process is causing the ionization of xenon. The energy of a single 118 nm photon (10.5eV) is below the ionization potential of xenon (12.1 eV). However, the combined energy of one 118 nm photon and one 355 nm photon (14 eV) is enough to ionize xenon, while being below the ionization potential of argon (15.8 eV). The ionization potential of krypton (14",

An equilibrium temperature of 157° C. was thereby attained. Oxygen enclosed in its container at the same pressure was then admitted to the reaction vessel, the heating current being maintained constant. At the low pressure at which we were working the mixing of the hydrogen and oxygen was complete after a few seconds. The resulting mixture contained 1 molecule of oxygen to 10 molecules of hydrogen, and the total pressure was, of course, the same as the original common pressure of the unmixed hydrogen and oxygen. The admission of the oxygen caused the temperature of the wire, as measured by its electrical resistance, to fall im mediately to 128° C. As combination of the gases occurs at this temperature there was thereafter a gradual fall in pressure and a consequent rise in tem pera ture.* In a second experiment conducted in the same manner with a current of 1*0 ampere the temperature fall was from 119° C. to 98° C., but in this case no combination of the gases could be measured. Now the sudden fall in temperature of the wire observed immediately after the admission of the oxygen to the reaction chamber could not have been due to the replacement of hydrogen molecules by an equal number of oxygen molecules since oxygen removes less heat from a hot surface than hydrogen at the same pressure. In fact, when the wire was heated by a current of 1-1 amperes in oxygen at a pressure of 48810 X 10\" 6 mm., its equilibrium temperature was as high as 167° C.",

At low temperatures the life of an adsorbed atom is comparatively long, and consequently there will be very few leaving the surface, and hence very little free ( i .., unadsorbe tact with the surface. At high temperatures, the life of an adsorbed atom on the surface will be extremely short. The surface will thus have very little adsorbed gas. Every molecule which strikes the surface will still be condensed, but will almost immediately leave again in the form of atoms. Hence as the temperature rises, although the actual amount of adsorption decreases, the concentration of atomic oxygen in the neighbourhood of the surface will increase rapidly. Those atoms which leave the surface in an outward direction will recombine at once to form molecular oxygen. Some, however, will leave it in an inward direction and will diffuse into the metal. The number entering the metal, i.e., the rate of diffusion, will depend on the concentration of free atoms at the surface, and will consequently increase very rapidly with rising tempera ture. The rate of diffusion will thus depend simply on the rate of formation of atomic oxygen at the surface, that is, on the rate of evaporation of adsorbed atoms from the surface. The effect of temperature on the rate of evaporation from the surface is given by M = Aa/ T exp.(-X/RT),* where A is a constant and X is the internal latent heat of evaporation. It has been shown by Johnson and Larose ( loc. that the rate of through silver is expressed by Richardson's equation\nQ = K \\/T exp.(-RT),\nwhere Q is the rate of diffusion and q and K are constants. Richardson's equation also holds for the diffusion of hydrogen through platinum,f nickel,J and steel. § The above two equations are identical in form, and hence it seems fairly well established that the rate of diffusion depends on the rate of evapora tion of adsorbed atoms from the surface.",

Actually, however, helium diffuses about 22 times as fast as hydro gen.* A possible explanation of this lies in the fact that the helium atom is symmetrical in form, while the hydrogen molecule is presumably unsymmetrical, and, taking an extreme case, a spherical atom would be expected to diffuse much more rapidly than an elongated molecule having about the same total volume. It is noteworthy that the temperature coefficients of the rates of diffusion of hydrogen and helium are almost identical, as would be the case if the process were one of capillary effusion. The temperature coefficient for helium becomes slightly greater than that for hydrogen at high temperatures, but this is to be expected, as the increased rotational energy of the hydrogen molecule would decrease the rate of diffusion to a certain extent.\n\nJacquerot and Perrotf have obtained a ratio for hydrogen and helium with porcelain which agrees with that calculated for a simple case of capillary diffusion. It would appear probable that the capillary spaces through which the gas diffuses are considerably larger in the case of porcelain than with quartz. Consequently, the effect of the shape of the molecules would be outweighed by their relative masses. It is only when the size of the pores is just slightly larger than the size of the gas molecule that the shape would become the predominating factor in the process of diffusion.\n\nIf the diffusion of hydrogen through quartz is a simple case of effusion, the temperature coefficient can be calculated from the kinetic theory. The chance of a molecule hitting an opening is proportional to its velocity and hence to \\ / T . The rate of diffusion depends on both the chance of collision with an opening and on the number of molecules present. At constant pressure the number of molecules will be proportional to 1/T.

The actual condition of the oxygen after the dis sociation has taken place cannot be definitely established. The two most likely possibilities are the solution of the oxygen in the atomic state, or as Ag20. At the temperatures investigated Ag20 would be in existence at oxygen pressures far below its dissociation pressure. It is possible, however, that Ag20 would be stable, even under these conditions, when in dilute solution.\n\n* ' J. Soc. Chem. Ind.,' vol. 29, p. 987 (1910).\n\n\nP 2\n\nThe explanation of the minimum in the solubility-temperature curve is difficult. The fact that a sudden change occurs in the rate of solution at this temperature seems to point to a transition of the silver from one allotropic form to another. It is interesting to note in this connection that Holt* was obliged to assume two forms of the metal in order to explain his results on the rate of solution of hydrogen in palladium.\n\nThere is also the possibility of a change in the manner of combination of the oxygen. From the shape of the solubility-temperature curve, the heat of solution is obviously positive at the lower temperatures, zero at about 400° C., and negative at higher temperatures. The heat of formation of Ag20, calculated from the measurements of Lewis,f is positive, while the heat of dissociation of oxygen is negative. It is therefore possible that at low temperatures the majority of the dissolved oxygen exists as Ag20, while at temperatures above 400° C. it is mostly atomic oxygen.\n\nSolution and Diffusion.-The phenomena of absorption of gases by metals and diffusion of gases through metals must be fundamentally connected. It is virtually impossible to conceive of a mechanism for diffusion other than that of solution on the high-pressure side of the metal and subsequent giving up of the gas on the low-pressure side which is supersaturated. Apparently, then, solution must precede diffusion. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that there is no known case of a gas diffusing through a metal in which it is not appreciably soluble.",

The drop in pressure is apparently due to the oxidation of mercury vapour in the bulb. The oxide then distils out and condenses in the colder part of the apparatus, more mercury vapour diffuses in and the process goes on continuously. By keeping the tap between the bulb and the mercury surface closed between readings, the difficulty was overcome and no further drop in pressure was noticed.\n\n(3) A further difficulty was met with in connection with the use of tap grease on the tap mentioned above. Blank experiments showed a slow but appreci able absorption of oxygen by the ordinary type of grease, consisting of rubber, paraffin, and vaseline. A mixture of paraffin and vaseline did not absorb oxygen and gave satisfactory results.\n\n\nSample Calculation.\n\nIn order to illustrate how the calculations were carried out, the complete data of one experiment are given below. The volume of gas admitted to the bulb was 2-985 c.c. under standard con ditions, or 3-247 c.c. at room temperature. The total volume of the bulb and dead space was 5-222 c.c.

This may be done by finding a minimum value of the external hydrogen pressure which would just stop the diffusion outwards for an instant. If the velocities of the escaped hydrogen molecules were suddenly reversed, the diffusion would stop momentarily, and the external pressure then occurring would give the minimum external pressure which would keep the hydrogen inside the surface layer in equi librium. The equilibrium pressure might be greater than this, but could not be less. In the experiment the mass of hydrogen diffusing through 1 sq. centim. per second at 1380° C. = 2*65 x 10~7 gramme. In free hydrogen at 1 centim. pressure the mass which is carried across an area of 1 sq. centim. per second = 2'3xl0~2 gramme at 1380° C. Hence the minimum value of the external pressure with which the hydrogen instantaneously present inside the surface layer could be in equilibrium is 1*15 x 10-4 millim. It is necessary to show that a pressure of this amount of hydrogen would have produced an appreciable increase in the value of the leak. According to one. table given by H. A. W i l s o n ( l o c. cit., p. 265), at 1350° millim. pressure increases the negative leak by a factor of 2500. The writer, however, is inclined to think that a more accurate comparison with the present experiments can be got by comparing the tables on pp. 260 and 269 of W i l s o n 's paper. These show that hydrogen at a pressure of 1 3 x l0 \"4 millim. increases the leak at 1375° C. by a factor of 8, so that lT 5 x !0~4 millim. would cause an increase by a factor of not less than 1*6. The experiments recorded in the present paper (p. 52) also indicate an increase in the leak of about 100-fold at 1340° C. due to hydrogen at a pressure certainly less than 10~2 millim.

The dissolved hydrogen could not be removed in a vacuum at a temperature below a red heat.\n\nExperiment I I B established the following facts At 16° C. metallic silver will adsorb enough oxygen to cover its entire surface with a layer of silver oxide. The oxidation was initially very rapid even at the lowest pressures, and practically ceased after 5 minutes. The pressure of oxygen in equilibrium with the oxide could not be measured, and no oxygen could be removed by exhaustion. The oxide was readily reduced by hydrogen at 16° C., and nearly all of it could be removed by this means in 12 hours. After reduction it was possible to reform the oxide layer and to synthesise indefinite amounts of water by repeating the alternate oxidation and reduction.\n\nThere seems, therefore, to be no reason why a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen should not by alternate oxidation and reduction of the silver at 16° C. be completely converted into water. Since the oxidation is much faster than the reduction, the silver is during the synthesis almost completely covered with oxide. Furthermore, the rate of formation of water must be the same as the rate of reduction of this oxide and therefore proportional to the partial pressure of the hydrogen. That the rate is proportional to the partial pressure of the hydrogen and independent of th a t of the oxygen has been shown to be the case by W. A. Bone and R. V. Wheeler* and by A. F. Benton and J. C. Elgin.f\n\nThe mass of silver used was 58*265 grm. Its volume was 5*554 c.c., and its total surface 872*545 sq. cm.\n\nThe number of gram atoms of oxygen required to oxidise the surface atoms of the silver completely (assuming th a t the faces (100), (110) and (111) are present at the surface in equal proportions) is 0*833 X 10-6.",

The right-hand (blue) curve is obtained from the 121-Torr one by scaling the time axis by 121/25 and normalizing the starting amplitude to the 25 Torr value.The starting amount of absorbed oxygen in the two runs inFig. 5was very similar and near saturation, so the degree of initial oxide coverage should be similar. If the scavenging rate were limited by out-diffusion of O atoms rather than by the incident CO flux, then the time for total depletion should be similar for these two curves, which is not the case. Alternatively, if the scavenging rate just depended linearly on the incident CO flux density (assuming a very high rate of out-diffusion) then one would expect these two curves to be displaced by a time factor of 121/25 = 4.8. This time scaling of the dashed curve is shown as the (blue) curve on the right, whose amplitude has been normalized to that of the /1!O one at t = 0 s. The right-hand curve falls much more slowly than the /1!O one after about the first 150 s, indicating that other factors are affecting the scavenging rates.

The bulb F was 2 cm. below surface of the solid oxygen in G.The remarkable constancy of this pressure seems to indicate that it is not very far from the real melting pressure. The pressure in the solid oxygen jacket G is undoubtedly falling, probably to a limit of 0-2 or 0'3 mm., through the action of the charcoal exhaust, yet the pressure in F is not altered, whereas if appreciable supercooling took place it would be shown by a continual lowering of pressure.It is possible that the jelly was not in good contact with the bulb F, whereby the cooling effect would not be perfectly transmitted. Such a jelly or solid is a bad cooling medium, in the same way as solid hydrogen would not be a very good cooling jacket, liquid hydrogen at a little above melting pressure being preferable.Estrecker has made observations both of the melting temperature and pressure of oxygen which had been solidified by the use of liquid hydrogen and allowed slowly to melt. The melting pressure observed was 09 mm., while the temperature of the melting point was 46° abs. It is interesting to calculate the pressure corresponding to the melting point either by the use of a Rankine or Willard Gibbs vapour-tension equation. Thus the Rankine two-term formula derived from Onnes' oxygen observations, viz.:logp = 6-9725 -3 6 8 -3 /T gives, if T = 46°, p 0092 log= 7*0072-3 7 1 -2 /T \" p = 0-086 If p -1*12 mm., the corresponding T would be 53*3° abs. Similar calculated pressures obtained from either a three-term Rankine or a Willard Gibbs are too low. If Onnes' three standard values of liquid oxygen temperatures and pressures are taken, then log p = 02247 -237-83/T -5694-5/T2 (Rankine), or p -0*023 when T = 46° abs., and when is = 1*12 mm. the corre sponding value of T is 55'2°.

                    "contents": "The kinetics of the combination of hydrogen and oxygenAnother factor has also to be taken into account. The reaction is a highly exothermic one. Each pair of steam molecules which are formed have between them an excess energy equivalent to well over 100,000 calories, and thus may possibly set up what Christiansen calls a chain reaction by activating fresh molecules which they encounter. Such a chain would be interrupted when any of the highly activated molecules collided with the walls of the vessel, since the time of relaxation in such a collision is extremely small, and molecules rebounding from a solid surface are, in general, in thermal equilibrium with it. The smaller the free space in the reaction bulb the shorter will be the reaction chains, and the much smaller rate in the packed vessel could thus be accounted for.\n\nThese two possible explanations are not mutually exclusive, since the auto catalyst, which we have referred to as hydrogen peroxide, is probably only capable of existence in an activated form.\n\nThe reaction chain hypothesis has two things in its favour. First, it is con sistent with other work* on negative catalysis in general. Secondly, it is inherently probable since the excess energy possessed by the steam molecules is just of the order of magnitude of heats of activation for reactions taking place in the region of 500°-600° C. It has moreover the advantage of giving a picture of a continuous transition from the region of slow reaction to the region of explosion. At the lowest temperatures the reaction is entirely confined to the surface, and we have complete thermal equilibrium. As the temperature increases reaction centres appear in the gas, or at the surface, whence chains pass through the gas. When the gas reaction first becones appreciable there are probably many unfruitful encounters which may terminate a chain, but the proportion is likely to diminish with increasing temperature. The system ceases to be in thermal equilibrium in the sense that the heat of reaction makes each new steam molecule a potential source of further reaction, but it remains isothermal in the sense that the unreacted gases and all but the freshly generated steam have energies in accordance with Maxwell's law at the temperature of the walls of the reaction chamber. At last a point is reached where the rate of production of energy in the system is so great that even the unreacted gas no longer remains in thermal equilibrium with the vessel, and inflammation occurs. The large and complex variation of the reaction velocity with temperature and pressure is thus understandable.",

The big leak obtained on letting in the fresh gas is a somewhat surprising result, but might possibly be due to impurities which are gradually destroyed or removed. The point which seems most important is the small value, 5'2x 10~12 ampere, of the steady leak at this pressure. This was only two and a-half times the value of the positive leak obtained after the wire had been heated for 3^ hours in a good vacuum. The value of the positive leak in oxygen at this pressure and temperature would have been about 10\"10 ampere, or nearly twenty times the above number.\n\nOwing to the smallness of the positive leak in hydrogen, together with other difficulties which arose, few other satisfactory measurements were made on it.\n\nMeasurements of the variation with pressure of the negative ionisation from hot platinum in hydrogen have been made by H. had been admitted to a wire previously oxidised in nitric acid.

Section 6.3:This looks quite promising and very interesting.I would however make more clear somewhere in the paper that there may be other explanations, which possibly work equally well, and which are not discussed in this manuscript.\n\nIn particular, while your argumentation leading to this explanation is quite logical and sound, the weak point is your assumption of a rather arbitrary fixed rate here, where you don't really know where it comes from.That is quite comparable to the situation with my ad hoc assumption of a 5 K shift in HCl solubility, where I don't really know where it comes from.\n\nIt is true that the suggested process and the rate is speculative which has been clearly stated in the manuscript.As pointed out above, from the analysis of the \"fingerprint\" of the discrepancy as well as the temperature dependence in the critical region, we think that the process (or the processes) explaining the HCl discrepancy should show a similar fingerprint regarding the HCl depletion rate than our suggested process.\n\n21. Section 6.3: How does the simulated HNO 3 compare to MLS HNO 3 , with the decomposition switched on and off?A better agreement when switching on the decomposition would strengthen your point.\n\nThe additional NAT decomposition results in a small increase of HNO 3 in the gasphase, especially where the HNO 3 gradient is large.Figure 4 of this reply shows this comparison.The largest effect of 0.5 ppbv on the 500 K level would be at some spots near the vortex edge around 1 August and also about 0.5 ppbv lower down in the vortex C14 core at the 400 K around 1 September.In the interesting region of the \"HCl tongue\" the difference is below 0.15 ppbv.Unfortunately this is below of what could be validated by MLS data due to its vertical resolution and accuracy.Therefore we refrain from including this plot into the revised manuscript.",

In each of these the reaction proceeded with extreme slowness at temperatures far above that at which explosion would have occurred in an empty bulb. The following is an example. Even at 700° C. under these conditions the high order, autocatalytic reaction did not come into prominence. * The range of possible measurement was lim ited in two distinct ways. A t higher pressures the mixed gases exploded a second or so after mixing, the rate of evolution of heat in the interior of the m ixture being so great th a t the conditions ceased to be isothermal. A t lower pressures, when the reaction velocity in the mixed gases is much smaller, it might be supposed th a t measurements could still be made. The tendency of a jet of oxygen to inflame a t the point where it enters an atmosphere of hydrogen increases as the pressure of hydrogen diminishes (Dixon, ' Mem. and Proc. Manchester L it. and Phil. Soc.,' vol. 70, p. 29 (1926) ). This is evidently due to variation in the heat conducting power of the m ixture, and places a lim it on the low pressure side to the experiments which can be made a t high tem peratures. Under the conditions of the present investigations measurement at high and low pressures ceased to be possible a t about the same temperature. If hydrogen was streamed into oxygen, low pressure experiments became impossible from this cause at a lower tem perature th an if the mixing were attem pted in the reverse order. The value for the gas reaction is not easy to specify, as it varies somewhat with pressure and temperature, tending to increase with both.\n\nIn bulb 1, for example, the temperature coefficient over the range 547° -567° is 3-3 for 10° for a pressure of 320 mm.

For example, in the case of the H 2 : CO mixture at 600 atmospheres pressure a deviation of about 25 per cent, occurs. Recently Bartlett has attempted to correlate the pressure exerted by a mixture with its composition by the following modification of the \" additive pressure \" law : \" At constant temperature the pressure exerted by one constituent in a gaseous mixture equals the product of its mol fraction, and the pressure it would exert as a pure gas at a molecular concentration equal to the molecular concentration of the mixture.\" The deviations from this version of the law when applied to the data recorded herein never exceed 2 per cent., which show it to be a useful approximation.\n\nNo attempt has been made to apply any one of the recently proposed equations of state to our results on account of the limited temperature range so far covered; nor has any application been made of the Lennard-Jones partial pressure law which correlates the values of \" \" in the equations pvA -a -\\-bp + etc., for isotherms of gaseous mixtures because it affords little help at high pressures where the \" \" and \" \" terms may preponderate.\n\nRecently Lennard-Jones* has. pointed out the possibility of greater deviations from Boyle's law being exhibited by certain gaseous mixtures than by either of the separate constituents. This is attributed to the fact that the temperature of maximum deviation of a gaseous mixture lies between those of its con stituents and striking confirmation of the effect has been forthcoming as the result of researches by Masson and his collaborators^ into the compressibility of hydrogen-helium and hydrogen-argon mixtures at pressures up to 125 atmospheres A not unlike phenomenon may be observed on studying the isotherms in fig. 3 where, at 0° C. between pressures of about 370 to 460 atmo spheres (dotted lines) and at 25° C. between about 290 to 460 atmospheres, the three hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixtures studied are less compressible than either hydrogen or carbon monoxide taken singly. It would not appear that these results call for any new explanation ; no doubt they are special cases of the deviations already well recognised.",

No vibrationally excited states were modeled for B2, as they were not detected in the observations and only the ν 7 = 1 state was modeled for B1 and G35.03. HC 3 N ν 6 = 1 was modeled for A and B3 and was coupled with HCC 13 CN ν 6 = 1 with the 12 C/ 13 C isotope ratio fixed at 50. HC 3 N ν 7 = 1 was also modeled coupled with the three different 13 C isotopologues of HC 3 N ν 7 = 1 for A and B3 with the isotope ratio fixed at 50. HC 3 N ν 7 = 2 was only modeled for A and B3 where the emission becomes very compact.\n\nWe determined vibrational temperatures from all of the observed HC 3 N lines for each peak and found them to be in agreement with our RADEX and XCLASS results (see Table 5 and Fig. 9). The temperatures ranged from 120-210 K, which indicates that our assumption of LTE is reasonable, even where species are vibrationally excited.

The 240 vibrations can be decomposed into the irreducible representations of the factor group D 2 as Γ = 60 (A + B 1 + B 2 + B 3 ). Among these modes, three (B 1 + B 2 + B 3 ) belong to the acoustic branches. All phonons are Raman active but only phonons with B 1 , B 2 and B 3 symmetries are infrared active. In Fig. 2(a) we show the Raman spectra between 50 and 200 cm -1 for several temperatures, obtained upon cooling. Here we find the first indication of a conformational change. This region encompasses the modes of the A-H···B structure [20], (A-H···B), and low-wavenumber internal modes. The 50-160 cm -1 region displays the lattices modes of the crystal. We make the assignments on the basis of published data for certain group wavenumbers and vibrations in amino-acid crystals. For example, the band at 170 cmresults for L-leucine [21] and L-alanine [22] crystals. At room temperature (285 K), in Fig. 2(a), we can clearly see five bands, which remain in the Raman spectra down to 30 (To appear in Volume 43 of the Brazilian Journal of Physics) K. Upon cooling the intensities of these bands are not significantly changed, although the linewidths decrease.Lorentzian fits to their lineshapes yield the peak wavenumbers, which are plotted as functions of temperature, between 30 and 285K, inFigs. 2(b) and 2(c). The plots n the lowwavenumber region [Fig. 2(b)] are linear. The peak wavenumbers rise as the temperature drops, simply because the force constants grow as the intermolecular distance is reduced[23]. By contrast, the torsional band τ(CO2-) of the CO2-unit displays the more structured behavior inFig. 2(c): (i) predominantly linear for temperatures between 165 and 285 K, and (ii) exponential for temperatures below than 161 K. The latter dependence is quite well fitted by the exponential function deduced by Balkanski",

The thermodynamic properties of heat capability (Cp), entropy (S) and enthalpy (H) for 5B3N2C are also dictated by temperature dependence. Up to the decomposition point of the studied compound, the thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity, entropy, and enthalpy were computed. The melting point is 101-109 C, so that the 5B3N2C is unstable at 1000K. the thermodynamic properties are therefore measured at 500K. The Perl THERMO.PL [53] script has been used and is tabulated in Table 10. It is identified that, with temperatures varying from 100 to 500K, these thermodynamic functions are increasing due to the fact molecular vibrational intensities increase with the temperature. The association with temperature changes between heat capability, entropy, and enthalpy is a built-in quadratic formula. For these thermodynamic properties, the fitting factors (R 2 ) are respectively. The appropriate fitting Eqs. (II, III, IV) are as follows, and Figure 14 demonstrates the accepted statistical graphs [54]. In the gas phase, all the thermodynamic measurements were performed and they could not be included in the solution. For more assessment on 5B3N2C, all these thermodynamic data provide helpful details. They can be used to quantify other thermodynamic functions, and according to the second thermodynamic law, to evaluate the path of chemical reactions.\n\n\nConclusion",

Table 5 presents these results for a temperature range of 5 -4000 K. The results are also graphically presented in Figure 1. The table and figure reveal that although our results and those of of Sidhu et al agree very well at temperatures below 1200 K, they differ significantly at high temperatures and the deviation increases as the temperature rises. This can be explained by the fact that ST1 contains more energy levels which contribute increasingly at high temperatures. We therefore expect our partition function to be the more reliable one for T > 1200 K.\n\nUsing a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear curve-fitting routine, we fitted the ST1 partition function curve to a fifth order polynomial\nz(T ) = 5 i=0 aiT i(4)\nin temperature and obtained the following coefficients for T in K: \n\nThis polynomial is not shown on Figure 1 because it is virtually identical to the ST1 curve.  \n\n\nCooling Function\n\nST1 was also used to compute the cooling function of H2D + as a function of temperature. The cooling function W which quantifies the rate of cooling per molecule is given by\nW (T ) = 1 z u,l A ul (Eu − E l )(2Ju + 1)gue ( −Eu kT )(6)\nwhere u and l stand for the upper and lower levels respectively, and z is the partition function as given by Eq. 3. Figure 2 graphically presents our cooling function as a function of temperature alongside the H + 3 cooling function of Neale et al (1996). As seen, the two curves are close for T > 600 K. However the H2D + cooling function continues to be significant at lower temperatures, whereas at these temperatures the cooling curve of H + 3 was not given by Neale et al (1996) because they considered it too small to be of significance. curve is obtained from a digitized image from Neale et al (1996).

Despite computing all rovibrational levels below 8000 cm −1 (J ≤ 165), and all transitions from these states to states with  E ≤ 15 000 cm −1 , there is still a minor contribution from energies above this cut-off to the partition sum, corresponding to all values of J.However, the neglected transitions are expected to make only a small additional contribution to the overall intensity at this temperature.The completeness of the line list may be quantified by considering the ratio of the partition function at the 8000 cm −1 cut-off and the total partition function, Q Total , which takes into account all computed energies.Figure 3 shows this ratio as a function of temperature.For T ≤ 1500 K the line list is over 96 % complete.As can be seen from Figure 3 the level of completeness decreases with increasing temperature; at 2000 K the ratio falls to 86 %, and as low as 33 % for 5000 K.These values assume that Q Total is equal to the 'true' value of the partition function and tests suggest that for T = 3000 − 5000 K, the partition function is still converged to within 0.1 % when all computed energy levels are taken into consideration.\n\nTable 3 gives a portion of the SO2 states file.As DVR3D does not provide approximate quantum numbers, Ka, Kc and the vibrational labels ν1, ν2 and ν3, these have been taken from the calculations of Huang et al.

(2015). In Tab. 7, the values of the harmonic approximation for the vibrational partition function Q harm vib (T ) and the internal partition function Q rv (T ) (A1) for the main isotopologue are given. Q harm vib (T ) is calculated using the experimental fundamental vibrational energies taken from Perrin et al. (2003Perrin et al. ( , 2006 and the rotational partition function is computed from the JPL rotational energies predicted up to J=99 and K a =25 (Pickett et al. 1998). The uncertainties of the rovibrational partition function (Carvajal et al. 2019) are obtained considering the uncertainties of all the rotational energies provided in the JPL database (Pickett et al. 1998) and the experimental uncertainties of the vibrational fundamental energies (Perrin et al. 2003(Perrin et al. , 2006. These values are compared with those from CDMS catalog (Endres et al. 2016) and from Al-Refaie et al. (2015). According to the relative differences between the approximated internal partition function (A1) and the one calculated more thoroughly (Al-Refaie et al. 2015), the two results are comparable in the temperature interval from 2.725 K and 500 K. However, the difference with the values provided in the CDMS catalog is of -8.8% at 500 K and of -0.72% at 300 K. Therefore, as the approximation (A1) using a harmonic vibrational partition function is acceptable for the interval of temperature typical for the ISM and improves notably the values of JPL and CDMS catalogs for higher temperatures, this is going to be used for the other isotopologues of formaldehyde.",

(2014), the value for the same temperature is computed as 6336.803,which is in excellent agreement with their calculated value of 6336.789.Figure 1 shows the partition function values as a function of a J cut-off for a range of T .The highest value of J considered, J = 165, defines the last point where the lowest energy is less than 8000 cm −1 , which is used as the maximum value of lower energy states in DIPOLE3 calcula- tions.As can be seen from this figure, the partition function is well converged for J = 165 at all temperatures.The J-dependent convergence of Q gives a good indication of the completeness of the computed energy levels with respect to their significance at each temperature.However in order to ascertain the reliability of the line list for increasing temperatures it is more pertinent to observe the convergence of Q as a function of energy cut-off; this is illustrated in Figure 2. The importance of this lies in the fact that the computed line list in the current work only considers transitions from energy levels below 8000 cm −1 .Since the physical interpretation of an energy level's contribution to Q is the probability of it's occupancy, the completeness of the line list can only be guaranteed if all transitions from states with non-negligible population are computed.In other words, the line list may only be considered 100 % complete if Q is converged when summing over all E ≤ 8000 cm −1 .",

For the isotopologue H 2 C 18 O only the values of the rotational partition function are evinced in Tab. 8. These values and their uncertainties have been calculated using the CDMS rotational data (up to J=54, K a =16) complemented with those predicted for the excited rotational levels from JPL database (up to J=20, K a =20) when missing in the CDMS catalog. The vibrational partition function could not be calculated because, as far as we know, there are neither fundamental energies nor excited vibrational energies reported in the literature at all. This hindrance could be overcome providing the vibrational fundamental energies calculated by ab initio or other empirical approaches. Therefore, the partition function in the present work is practically the same reported in CDMS apart from the uncertainties and the new values of the rotational partition function for temperatures from 300 K to 500 K.",

This approximation is only valid at sufficiently low temperatures when the asymmetry of the potential energy landscape for the vibrational energy states can be neglected. To quantify the magnitude of the errors introduced by the harmonic approximation, Table 2 presents the minimal, maximal, and mean errors of the temperature-dependent part of the Gibbs free energies of all molecules for all functionals and basis sets for two temperatures, 400 and 1500 K. The temperature-dependent term of the molecules arising from the vibrational contribution differs from its experimental counterpart by −312.72 to 297.78 kJ mol −1 at 1500 K, while the range is only −45.53 to 60.53 kJ mol −1 at 400 K. Although these numbers seem huge, ultimately, we are only interested in energy differences between products and reactions. The variation over the different basis sets and functionals is minimal. When carrying out the sign analysis approach only at lower-temperature windows [39] (300-400 K), we found an improvement of 2-4 percent points in terms of the percentage of correct predictions made. Considering only Gibbs energies between 300-400 K, the results are presented in Table 3. Table 3. Percentage of all reactions with a constant equilibrium composition correctly described by DFT in the range of 300 K-400 K.

A calculation of the partition function of water at 3,000K using the 221,097 energy levels in BT2 yields a value that is 99.9915 percent of the Vidler & Tennyson (2000) value, which indicates that levels missing from BT2 only contribute about 85 parts in a million to the partition function of water at this temperature, the reason being that there is a diminishingly small probability of states above 30,000 cm −1 being occupied at this temperature. For comparison, the PS line list, which has 28,000 cm −1 cut-off gives a partition function at 3,000 K that is only 99.493% of the Vidler & Tennyson value.\n\nAlthough the exclusion of levels above 30,000 cm −1 does not materially affect the completeness of the BT2 list, it does affect absorption at shorter wavelengths.

This is able to be absorbed by a water molecule in a particular rotation-vibration eigenstate provided that there is another eigenstate exactly 10,000 cm −1 above this lower state into which the molecule may be excited. It follows that since the BT2 line list has an upper cut-off of 30,000 cm −1 , none of the energy levels in the list above 20,000 cm −1 are capable of being excited by a 1µm photon, since there is no corresponding upper level.\n\nIf we examine the extent to which Q(3,000K) computed from BT2, but excluding all levels above 20,000 cm −1 , falls short of the Vidler & Tennyson value we will have an indication (this is an upper limit as it takes no account of blending effects) of the opacity that has been excluded by adopting a 30,000 cm −1 cut-off.

Strategies for observing the b2 levels Prior to our IR-UV double resonance experiments, we attempted other schemes to observe the ν 3 fundamental of theC state, including hot-band pumping, using a vibrationally hot (but rotationally cold) expansion from a heated nozzle. This approach proved to be difficult, because, although the antisymmetric stretching mode ν 3 has the lowest fundamental vibrational frequency in thẽ C state (212 cm −1 ), it has the highest fundamental vibrational frequency in theX state (1362 cm −1 ). The maximum population in theX(0, 0, 1) level does not occur until a vibrational temperature of ∼1200 K is reached, at which temperature the population inX(0, 0, 1) is only 5%. It is even more unfortunate that the much stronger C(0, 0, 0) ←X(1, 0, 0) hot band lies within 2 cm −1 of the desiredC(0, 0, 1) ←X(0, 0, 1). Thus, it was difficult to identify hot band transitions to theC(0, 0, 1) level. IR-UV double resonance proved to be a much more effective technique. We chose theX(1, 0, 1) state as the IR intermediate because of the strength of thẽ X(1, 0, 1) ←X(0, 0, 0) IR transition at 2500 cm −1 .\n\n\nB. Experimental details",

In theory, the model uses all optically active vibrational modes present in the probe molecule. Obviously, the number of modes is truncated to N most active accepting vibrational modes in the ground state. Similarly to hν 0 in Eq. 1, E 00 is the energy gap between the lowest levels of the fitted vibronic modes of S 0 and S 1 states. The parameter n j is the vibronic number of the j-th accepting mode. The summations in Eq. 3 has been limited to small values, high enough to properly model the spectra. The symbol n j is the j accepting mode frequency, ν is the frequency at which the emission spectrum is measured, Δn 1=2 is the full width at half-maximum of the Gaussian inhomogeneous broadening, and ξ j is the Huang-Rhys vibrational coupling factor related to the equilibrium bond distance difference between the excited and ground states.

The presence of peaks in T*(ν) suggest the presence of more then one manifold, whose number can be related to the number of the peaks.

Under these circumstances differences arise with the situation previously studied, ascribed to both the rate constant and the determination of the adsorbed quantities (surface coverage). The rate constant now depends on the probability function  i p , which is not given by the Boltzmann distribution anymore; in turn, as discussed in more detail below, it is expected to depend upon reaction rate. As regards the surface coverage, while in the equilibrium case it can be linked to thermodynamic quantities (such as the chemical potential), under nonequilibrium conditions it is determined by the reaction kinetics. For a non-Boltzmannian energy distribution function of the vibrational ladder it is not straightforward to define the adlayer temperature, although the mean energy and the entropy of the adlayer can be both defined.

Second, we have shown in our previous work (Erfort et al., 2020a), that for H 2 CO and H 2 CS the differences between experimental Q(T) values and theoretically approximated Q vib Q rot values for the partition function are lower than 2 % up to 300 K. In addition to that, the partition function is the same global factor for every transition and since we are primarily interested in relative intensities rather than in absolute intensities, it is therefore not crucial for us. The last two factors in Equation (2) correspond to the frequency of the transition (E ′ − E ′′ ) and the squared transition moment R 2 . The calculation of the latter within RVCI has been outlined previously (Erfort et al., 2020a). For ketenimine all nuclear spin statistical weights show the values of 24. Further approximations are used to limit the calculation times. First of all, we are not considering hot bands. Due to relatively low temperatures and absence of fundamentals with particularly low energies, these bands have fairly low intensities and are mainly hidden behind significantly more intense transitions arising from the vibrational ground state. This is supported by a comparison to the results of Bane and coworkers (Bane et al., 2011c). Moreover, the inverse effective moment of inertia tensor µ is expanded to the 0th order for the RVCI calculation.

The detailed experimental setup is described in Reference [17]. The laser beam with an effective power of 5 W at 403 nm crosses the gas cell, after which the scattered light is collected at 90° as an uncertainty of 0.9° with respect to the beam direction.

The summation of reactions (1a)-(6a) such that D r H 7a ¼ D r H 1a À D r H 2a þ D r H 3a þ D r H 4a þ D r H 5a À D r H 6a yields the standard enthalpy of formation of Cs 2 MoO 4 as D f H o m (Cs 2 MoO 4 , cr, 298.15 K) = À(1514.7 AE 1.5) kJÁmol À1 .

[28], while the heat capacity of NaCl(l) was recently recommended by van Oudenaren et al. [29].The authors critically reviewed the four studies available on the determination of the heat capacity of NaCl(l) [30][31][32][33] and found that there was no discrepancy between the data by Dawson et al. [33] and the rest of the authors, in contrast with what Glushko et al. had argued.Considering the average of the four studies, van Oudenaren et al. recommend (68 ˘1) kJ ¨mol ´1 in the 1074 to 2500 K range.In the case of ThCl 4 (cr,l), the data used were recommended by Fuger et al. [5] and Capelli and Konings [34].As mentioned in the introduction, ThCl 4 crystallises in two phases.Using an adiabatic calorimeter, Chiotti et al. [35] measured an enthalpy of transition equal to (5.0 ˘1.5) kJ ¨mol ´1 at (679 ˘2) K. Taking the heat capacity of ThCl 4 -α (the low-temperature phase) to be equal to that recommended for ThCl 4 -β (the high-temperature phase), the standard enthalpy of formation and standard entropy of ThCl 4 -α were optimised in this work, such that the transition between both phases matched the values reported by Chiotti et al. [35].The enthalpy of fusion (61.5 ˘5.0) kJ ¨mol ´1, melting temperature (T = 1042 K), and heat capacity recommended by Capelli and Konings [34] were used to describe ThCl 4 (l).The thermodynamic functions of the intermediate compounds were optimised in this work to match the experimentally determined phase diagrams as closely as possible.All values are given in Table 2.\n\n\nLiquid Solution",

The only parameter, which was varied in our kinetic mechanism, was the rate coefficient of reaction (R2). According to [23][24][25][26][27], the observable value of activation energy E a of the rate coefficient of reaction (R2) falls in the range of 39-48 kcal/mole. In this case, the majority of researchers accept the value of 39 kcal/mole.

We also compared the results of our calculations with the results of numerical simulations with the use of the widely known kinetic mechanisms presented in [28][29][30][31], in which the initiation channel (R2) was absent.",

Experimental and theoretical rates available from the literature are also shown. 21-24,26,65 The shaded area shows the confidence limit for Thielen et. al. data. The equilibrium constants for the N( 4 S) + NO(X 2 Π) ↔ O( 3 P) + N 2 (X 1 Σ) reaction have been computed using Eq. 9 between 3000 and 6000 K and compared with the values reported in the JANAF 66 tables. The QCT results from this work are in good a agreement with the JANAF data computed from thermodynamic quantities. This suggests that the present PESs are accurate enough to describe the forward and the reverse reaction and other electronic states play only a minor role in the dynamics of both reactions. Both N( 4 S) + NO(X 2 Π) → O( 3 P ) + N 2 (X 1 Σ) and the reverse reaction are among the reactions which play an important role at hyperthermal conditions during the reentry of space vehicles into earth atmosphere. Analytical expression for the rates are useful to simulate hypersonic flow during reentry. In this work, the rates are calculated at hyperthermal temperature for both reactions and modified Arrhenius functions (k(T ) = AT n exp(−E a /T ))",

It is clear from the figure that vibrational excitation of H 2 leads to a significant increase of k(T ), especially at low temperatures. For example, at 500 K the ratio between the rate coefficients for v = 4 and v = 0 is 7.5 × 10 4 , while at 1000 K this ratio is just 640. Interestingly, even for v = 5 the rate coefficient is not independent of temperature, as it would be expected for a barrierless reaction. For v = 0-1, our results are in good agreement with those calculated by Balakrishnan (2004) on the PES of Rogers et al. (2000), which predicted a somewhat smaller collinear barrier. Also in agreement with previous results (Weck et al. 2006), we also predict the existence of an energy  3), is compared with the experimental one (Baulch et al. 2005). Rate coefficients for H 2 in the (v = 0, j = 0) and (v = 1, j = 0) states are also shown for the sake of comparison. The inset highlights the behavior at high temperatures (> 1000 K).\n\nbarrier for v = 2-3. However, to the best of our knowledge there are not previous calculations for v > 3 for which the reaction proceeds without no barrier.\n\n\nImpact on the abundance of OH\n\nPrevious studies of the impact of reactions of vibrationally excited H 2 on the chemistry of molecular clouds have shown that the most dramatic effect of including state-dependent rate coefficients is attained in dense and strongly UV-illuminated PDRs like the Orion Bar (Agúndez et al. 2010;Zanchet et al. 2013aZanchet et al. ,b, 2019aGoicoechea et al. 2021). To evaluate the role of FUVpumped vibrationally excited H 2 reacting with atomic oxygen on the abundance of OH we have therefore focused on the Orion Bar PDR.",

No LH contribution is observed at all. In spite of the reaction (3) competes with ER reaction (4) with much higher reaction probabilities ( Fig. 2c and d), its lower rate constants (i.e., k3 < k4; see Fig. 3a and c) together with the small amount of free surface sites (see [s]ss in Fig. 4), can justify its negligible contribution to gO.\nγ O =k\nThese two contributions in gO are in agreement with previous assumptions made in similar kinetic models 5, 37 . At very large pressures the LH reaction seems to gain importance for b-quartz 29 , leading to larger gO values (0.01 ≤ gO ≤0. 35). In a previous work 23 we directly compared the experimental gO values with QCT ER reaction probabilities, obtaining similar values although with a slope closer to the experimental one than that of the present work. The seemingly better previous results could be fortuitous because another processes (e.g., specially the atomic adsorption) should be included in a more reliable calculation of this coefficient. On the other hand, as the calculated gO coefficients are based on QCT reaction probabilities, some improvements on those could increase slightly the gO values. Thus, the inclusion of physisorbed O atoms (not only chemisorbed on T1/T1\" sites) in the ER study would probably increase the O2 formation. Moreover, the integration at longer times (e.g., 2.5-5 ps) for reaction (3), which produces adsorbed O2, could increase the molecular desorption with following final augment of the ER contribution. For instance, simulations for b-quartz 29 were ran at least for t < 5 ps, showing also a significantly increasing of gO but possibly at too long times (i.e., 1.5 ns).",

Számoltam a bimolekuláris állandót a reaktánsok fogyására, és az N 2 O illetve N 2 termékek keletkezésére, valamint összehasonlítottam a kísérleti eredményekkel. Az egyezés az elmélet és kísérlet között elfogadhatónak bizonyult. As summary, a comparison of the collected available experimental data with the theoretical ones indicates that the VRRKM theory with the master equation can reproduce experimental data reasonably. However, these rate estimation methods and the accuracy of the potential surface calculations must be improved, and on the other hand, experimental results also suffer from large errors.266Thesis-38-Application: Kinetics of the CN + NO reactionA pulsed-laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence technique was employed in the determination of the pressure and temperature dependence of the reaction of CN with NO in the range from 207 to 740 K and for Ar bath gas pressures ranging from 30 to 900 Torr. The variational RRKM model coupled with the one-dimensional master equation treatment has provided a reasonably satisfactory description of the available kinetic data for both, the association and dissociation processes. The association kinetic data was best fit by a collisional energy transfer parameter for the simple exponential down model gradually increasing from -35 cm -1 at 100 K to -500 cm -1 at 740 K. The expression reproducing the theoretical estimates for the high-pressure rate constant in the range from 207 to 740 K is 3.4x10 -10 exp(120/T[K]) cm 3 s -1 .A CN+NO reakció nyomás és hőmérséklet",

At the temperature T, the vapor pressure p of the crystalline sample contained in each effusion cell was calculated using Equation (3):\np = m A o w o t 2πRT M 0.5 (3)\nwhere M is the molar mass of the effusing vapor and R is the molar gas constant (R = 8.3144598 J·K −1 ·mol −1 [72]). The standard uncertainties of the temperatures and vapor pressure measurements were estimated as u(T/K) = 0.01 and u(p/Pa) = 0.02.\n\n\nStatic Method Based on Capacitance Diaphragm Manometers\n\nThe vapor pressures of both the crystalline and liquid phases of 2,4-DCBN and of the crystalline phase of 2,6-DCBN, over a wider temperature interval than the one determined using the Knudsen effusion method, were measured using a static apparatus based on capacitance diaphragm manometers, that was tested and fully described before [73]. The measurements were taken using an MKS Baratron diaphragm capacitance manometer (model 631A11TBFP) operating at a self-controlled temperature (T gauge = 473 K), which is suitable for measuring pressures in the range of 3 to 1.3 × 10 3 Pa [74]. The expression U(p/Pa) = 0.1 + 0.0050 (p/Pa) describes the expanded uncertainty (0.95 confidence level, k = 2) of the pressure results, and the standard uncertainty of the temperature measurements is estimated to be u(T/K) = 0.01. Prior to the vapor pressure measurements, the samples were fully degassed under reduced pressure inside the apparatus, allowing for the eventual removal of any trace of volatile impurities.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nRelevant thermodynamic properties of phase transitions of 2,4-, 2,5-, and 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acids as well as of 2,4-and 2,6-dichlorobenzonitriles were determined in this work.\n\n-",

The latter biphasic organic systems are needed for compounds that are not stable in an aqueous environment, or are too insoluble in water to enable an accurate measurement of the water-to-organic solvent partition coefficient which might used in calculating solute descriptors for future log P predictions.",

[23] and represented by the five large discs of Fig. 8.For the same value of the temperature, the discrepancy between the pressure data, which could reach 257.1 atm at around 294.8 K, is manly due to the use of different experimental sets and to the method itself.Similarly, for the same pressure, the temperature deviations are up to 6.7 K. From this point of view it is worth mentioning that phase transitions are \"characterized by the hysteresis of melting and crystallization\" [24].This means that the melting temperature is higher than the crystallization temperature with a difference that can reach 400 K [24].Recall that the uncertainties are u r (p) = 0.005 and u(T ) = 0.2 K while for the data extracted from Ref.

Bernal-García and coworkers measured the density of aqueous MDEA in 280 the whole composition range at temperature range of 263.15 -363.15 K and, based on their 281 data, calculated the excess molar volumes of the binary systems. For our calculations at the 282 temperature of 393 K which was not studied in the afore-mentioned work, the excess molar 283 volume was extrapolated. It is worth mentioning that the deviations in number of moles of H2S 284 calculated by the Ideal Gas Law equation and REFPROP employing the most up-to-date 285 Helmholtz energy-based EoS led to deviations in the liquid loading lower than 1.5% at 283 and 286 353 K, while the deviations were higher at 393 K (max 2.7%). For more accurate results, we 287 used the results based on the latter. 288 Ebulliometer. Approximately 0.8·10 -4 m 3 of liquid was charged inside the still, preceding purge 289 with nitrogen. The desired temperature was set and equilibrium was assumed after 10 min of 290 stable pressure and temperature. The vapor pressure of MDEA was measured at the temperature 291 range of 405 -435 K. Validation of the apparatus was performed by measuring the vapor 292 pressure of water and a 1.5% maximum error from the literature was found in equilibrium 293 pressure.",

The data revealed the existence of new unknown states besides the ground state 2 Σ + g and the first excited state 2 Π u of H + 2 . The first theoretical calculations of the states were made by Bottcher and Docken in 1974 [2], who calculated the energy position and widths for dissociative Q 1 1 Π u and Q 2 1 Π u states for 1a.u. ≤ R ≤ 10a.u., using the Feshbach projection-operators [3]. More recently Sánchez and Martín [4] have done systematic calculations in which they estimated tens of doubly excited states symmetries and their autoionization widths for 1,3 Σ + g,u , 1,3 Π g,u and 1,3 ∆ g,u , in the range of 0 ≤ R ≤ 5a.u.. They employed the Feshbach projectionoperator method and a L 2 representation of the non resonant continuum, with B-spline type functions. In what concerns the dissociation into neutral atoms, perhaps the most relevant theoretical work in the recent years was done by Dalgarno and collaborators [5] who calculated the doubly excited H 2 states converging to H(n=2) + H(n'=2) for all the internuclear distances. Using different techniques to solve for each internuclear distance region and taking special care of intermediate distances in order to connect the different regimes in which calculations were done, they were able to calculate potential energy curves from 3 a.u. to 200 a.u. Recently our experimental group [6] observed the pair H(2s) + H(2s) by measuring neutral fragments in coincidence after H 2 dissociation induced by electron impact, confirming for the first time the existence of such states. The purpose of the present work is to shed light on the description of the doubly excited states that may dissociate onto a pair H(2s) + H(2s), since this dissociation channel, as discussed in [7], may be used to probe the spin coherence between",

For example, reference [6] used a locking field strength ω 1 =γB 1 =22,000 rad s -1 . Current IEC normal operating limits for humans are 1.5 W/kg averaged over any 15-min period for whole body SAR [31]. SAR depends on many factors, but data from reference [32] on a head coil at 7 Tesla (300 MHz proton) with linear B 1 lets us estimate that such a field applied for 100 s would dissipate 10,000 times the SAR limit. The newer approaches use states that are naturally immune to evolution (and thus avoid long spin locking); still, the M2S sequence in reference [20] used 96 40-µs composite π pulses (ω 1 =2π*25000 Hz), which under the same assumptions would dissipate 20 times the SAR limit. In contrast, the SLIC pulse sequence in Fig. 1 [21,22] consists of three pulses. First a hard 90-degree pulse creates transverse magnetization (I 1x +I 2x in the case of a ypulse), then the transverse magnetization is irradiated along the direction of the magnetization. A typical application requires irradiation with a locking field equal to the carboncarbon J-coupling (ω 1 ≈2π*180 Hz) for typical times of about 250 ms, and decreases the power dissipation to <0.1 times the SAR limit.",

The peak RF power required for the pulses is well-within hard-pulse power limits for modern high resolution probes. However, in multipulse sequences, repeated application of what might be deemed a modest power level for a single pulse can be a problem if the total energy delivered to the sample (integrated power) is too high. There are also limits on the total energy that can safely be delivered to a given probe. For these reasons, the most general and widespread applications impose peak power levels that are more conservative than what might be necessary for broadband refocusing using a typical probe. We therefore incorporate a time-dependent RF limit into the optimal control algorithms to keep peak power low for most of the pulse, but allow short increases in this limit where it can have the most benefit. We utilize algorithms A T and A S,T (defined in §2.1.2) to investigate the possibility of generic broadband refocusing pulses suitable for use with any standard probehead in any pulse sequence.\n\n\nThree adiabatic inversion pulses\n\nThe best broadband refocusing performance available in the standard Bruker pulse library satisfying the required conservative pulse power limits is obtained using the pulse designated Chirp80 [45]. This pulse is constructed from three adiabatic inversion pulses with pulse lengths in the ratio 1:2:1 [19]. It utilizes for its shortest element a 500 ms smoothed chirp pulse [44] with 80 kHz sweep. The first 20% of the pulse rises smoothly to a maximum constant RF amplitude of 11.26 kHz according to a sine function before decreasing in the same fashion to zero during the final 20% of the pulse. The final pulse is thus 2 ms long.\n\nMaintaining this pulse length and mindful of the given conservative peak RF amplitude, we designed the set of four pulses listed in Table 1. For most of the pulse, the nominal RF amplitude is a constant 10 or 11 kHz. A maximum RF amplitude of 15 kHz is applied for 60 µs in the middle of the pulse, as illustrated in Fig. 2. This short increase in pulse amplitude provides significant improvement in pulse performance compared to Chirp80.",

In fact, for just this reason, they were incorporated into the M2S sequence in many recent papers. However, as Figure  3 (d-f) shows, this approach fails completely for the SLIC sequence. The reason is that in the conventional two-level problem, the irradiating field creates an off-diagonal term with phase dictated by the pulse phase, and the diagonal term is the offset from exact resonance; but for SLIC, the irradiating field produces a diagonal term in the relevant basis, and the off-diagonal term is the coupling difference between the two spins. Furthermore, phase shifting the rf changes the system drastically: a 180° phase shift couples\nS A S B to X 1 A T 0 B instead of X-1 A T 0 B , and a 90° phase shift couples X 1 A T 0 B , X 0 A T 0 B and X-1 A T 0 B",

The observed limitation is primarily due to B 1 inhomogeneity. Frequency offsets play a secondary role here because of the high field homogeneity of the employed magnet, but would become significant in imaging applications. To gain insight into the behavior of SLIC under imperfect B 1 amplitude and rf-offset we simulated ( Figure 3) the behavior of an AA'BB' system that approximately matches the J-coupling network of 13 C 2 -DPA (J Σ =180 Hz and ∆=5.06 Hz). For the basic SLIC experiment (Fig. 3 a-c) full singlet-triplet inversion is achieved as expected for 140 ms irradiation (= 1/( ∆√2)) with ω 1 =2πJ Σ on resonance. As can be seen from Figures 3b-c,  (Top row a-c) shows the behavior for the simple spin-lock with 5Hz bandwidth in the B 1 amplitude and 62 Hz bandwidth in the rf-offset. The traditional composite pulse (second row d-f) completely fails to produce the singlet state whereas singlet composite pulse (third row g-i) improves both the B 1 -amplitude resonance condition bandwidth (10Hz) as well as the rfoffset resonance bandwidth (84Hz),. Further improvement is provided by the singlet adiabatic pulse (bottom row j-l), yielding a B 1 -resonance bandwidth of 30Hz and rf-offset bandwidth of 140Hz.",

The fast turnoff of the shaped pulse is an important asset of the paper. However, in the figure a parasitic field is seen at around 13 psec, and the statement is that during the relevant time window of around 3.3 psec the residual field is less than 1 % of the peak value. This is a critical element for the claim of field free alignment. The first question is experimental -how was the 1 % value determined, and what is the error level of this estimate? The second is more fundamental -do we know that this residual field does not affect the molecular alignment? It is possible, inprinciple, that a weak field may not be enough to align the molecule, but might be enough to maintain alignment that had already been achieved. This point cannot be ignored and must be discussed in detail.\n\nAn extensive discussion of the characterization of the laser pulse parameters, in particular the laser intensity, was already given in our answer to question 1 of reviewer 1, vide supra.\n\nWe have carried out and compared simulations with and without residual alignment laser fields, set to 0.1 % and 1 % of the peak intensity of the alignment laser pulse; the results are shown in the SI, new Figure 5. As one can clearly see in this Figure the effect of a residual field on the order of 1 % of the peak intensity does not have any influence on the degree of alignment and its temporal evolution up to 13 ps, in particular the value of the maximum degree of alignment is the same in all cases.\n\nWe have added a paragraph in the supplementary information (l. 226-239 in SI), discussing the results from the simulations shown in Figure 5 of the SI and stating that a possible residual field on the order of up to 1 % does not have any effect on the measured degree of alignment in the region of interest, which extends up to 13 ps, where an unwanted postpulse emerges.\n\n2. Another issue is the theoretical analysis of the in-plane degree of alignment. The experimental statement is that \"Furthermore, the degree of molecular alignment retrieved from the angular momentum distributions of H + and C 2+ can be misrepresented mainly due to two reasons -the many-body Coulomb break-up of the multiply charged indole cation, with ionic fragments violating the axial-recoil approximation, as well as the indistinguishability of fragments emitted at different molecular sites.\"",

For sufficiently short time periods, we note that probe RF limits can be higher than conservative limits that protect the probe from arcing under any conditions. Enforcing a lower probe limit for an entire pulse duration can sacrifice performance unnecessarily. We therefore introduce a time-dependent RF field limit to allow increased RF amplitude for short time intervals and achieve improved performance. Empirically, we find that low RF limits force algorithm A to request higher RF amplitude in the middle of the pulse for improved performance.

Thus, adapting shaped or composite pulses to this problem requires some transformations. The coupling ∆ is constant and real, so the simplest solutions start with constant-amplitude pulses of constant phase. First we will consider the composite pulse case, and rewrite the composite pulse 90 x 180 y 90 x in an equivalent form, 90 x 90 -z 180 x 270z 90 x . There are two ways to perform the z rotations. The first and simplest is to turn off the irradiation field, in which case the states are separated by 2πJ Σ and free evolution is equivalent to a -z rotation. Thus, a free evolution of πJ Σ /2 gives the 90° rotation, and evolution of 3πJ Σ /2 gives a 270° rotation. The sequence 90 x (free evolution, πJ Σ /2) 180 x (free evolution, 3πJ Σ /2) 90 x , shown in Figure 3 (g-i), generates improvement. The B 1 -amplitude resonance condition is now 10 Hz wide at FWHM (Fig. 3h), roughly doubled from 5 Hz for the basic SLIC, and the bottom of the resonance appears much flatter. The rf-offset resonance condition is now 84 Hz wide (Fig. 3i), an improvement of 35% over basic SLIC. This sequence works well because the total needed phase shift is small. More generally, however, turning off the field during a spin locking experiment is risky, particularly if there is a range of resonance frequencies. This leads to a second and more general solution, which is to mismatch the irradiation amplitude from the exact spin locking condition. For example, a 2π pulse (T=2π/ω 1 ) of any amplitude significantly attenuates the effect of the ∆ matrix elements, because they connect states which differ in energy by ω 1 -2πJ Σ , but if ω 1 ≠2πJ such a pulse generates a z phase shift of (2π (1-2πJ Σ /ω 1 )). Thus for example, a 2π pulse with 75% of the correct spinlock amplitude generates a phase shift of +90 o , and a 2π pulse with 125% of the correct spin-lock amplitude generates a phase shift of -90",

This pulse can be concatenated into five \"smaller' (weaker amplitude) but otherwise identical RF pulses, as shown in Figure 1(c) with a slight improvement near the center.\n\nThe ten units version of this pulse is shown in Figure 1(d) and reproduces well the desired (ideal) phase pattern of Figure 1(a). This pulse contains a total of 8 × 10 = 80 hard pulses. If each hard pulses is 10 µs long, the total length of this pulse would be 800 µs. A 800 µs shim pulse is already an improvement by an order of magnitude over the Topgaard adiabatic pulses.\n\nIn practice, the total duration of each hard pulse depends on the available maximum B 1 amplitude. When considering the time-optimality of this shim pulse, only the pulse area for each hard pulse matters (duration × amplitude). Thus, in order to halve the total duration of the shim pulse, we require the doubling of B 1 .\n\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe basic idea of using RF gradients to generate arbitrary order shim pulses works, as shown in the previous simulations and theoretical expressions. Two basic errors arise in these analytical expressions: for the generation of an I z shim pulse, the presence of I x and I y which \"contaminate\" a desired I z rotation, and the actual coefficient of I z contains not only the desired monomial but monomials which are higher order in the spatial variables. A similar argument applies to I x or I y pulses for excitation purposes.",

Further increase in pressure led to the destruction of the anvils. In 11c, 1 H-NMR spectra of paraffin at increasing pressures of up to 72 GPa are shown. These spectra are all acquired after a single scan and demonstrate impressively how the spin sensitivity basically remains constant under compression; this is in drastic contrast to what was observed with the micro-coil setup. The attentive reader might have recognised that the spin sensitivities realised with the LL resonators are about 2 up to 4 orders of magnitude lower, thus more sensitive, compared to the micro-coil set-ups. The reason for this might strike some as trivial, but I would like to explain it nonetheless. Consider using a micro-coil of 150-200 µm in height and about 300-400 µm in diameter in a DAC equipped with two 800 µm anvils. The sample cavity in such a DAC is most often much bigger than what is considered a 'safe' pressure cell 9 . Under compression, of course, such a DAC can be at best considered rather unstable, and the sample cavity is prone to collapse due to significant flow of the Cu-Be metal. Thus, every micro-coil will be subject to immense deformations, leading to a decrease in the 'effective' sample cavity. To underline this thought, numerical simulations have been conducted of the RF B 1 fields in a micro coil set-up as well as for a LL-resonator, see figure 12.",

The formalism can not be used to treat problems where the rf field interactions are modulated in both amplitude and phase, since the underlying assumption, that the rf field Hamiltonian at different times commute, is not valid here.

We then consider the refocusing performance of two 180 • P P pulses. In both these comparisons, RF amplitudes are limited to a relatively conservative peak value of 11 kHz (22.7 µs hard 90 • pulse) for widespread use in 13 C spectroscopy. Finally, we present a set of 180 • BU RBOP pulses that utilize the higher RF power limits allowed for short time intervals to increase the maximum RF amplitude from 11 kHz to 15 kHz (16.7 µs hard pulse) in the middle of the pulse. The performance of these pulses is compared with the composite adiabatic pulse scheme [19] implemented as a smoothed Chirp pulse [44,45] in standard Bruker software .  [20]. This 1 ms constant amplitude phase-modulated excitation pulse transforms greater than 99% of initial z-magnetization to the x-axis over a resonance offset range of 50 kHz for RF amplitude anywhere in the range 10-20 kHz. For all but the lowest RF amplitudes, the transformation is greater than 99.5%.

The construction procedure rotates phase deviations relative to the target axis out of the transverse plane, reducing spectral phase errors that are the primary interest. Increased phase dispersion is allowed in a plane orthogonal to the x-y plane, resulting in reduced projected transverse magnetization.",

Over the years, a number of methods have been developed for determining the amplitude of the B 1 field, beginning with the sideband strategy outlined by Bloch (38) and demonstrated by Anderson in 1956 (39). With the advent of pulsed NMR, nutation resulting from on-resonance irradiation was proposed as an efficient method for calibrating the applied RF field (40,41). In heteronuclear NMR involving 15 N or 13 C isotopelabeled samples, the magnitude B 1 field can be measured from the residual splitting observed in a multiplet pattern when the decoupling of the scalar-coupled nucleus is applied off-resonance (36,(42)(43)(44). While this method is ideal for B 1 amplitudes comparable to or larger than the heteronuclear coupling constant (90 -150 Hz), much smaller B 1 fields are used routinely used in CEST experiments.\n\nThe current method for measuring weak B 1 fields proposed by Guenneugues et al. (45) is a variation of the nutation experiment (41,46) where the RF field of desired strength is applied on z-magnetization for a systematically incremented time duration. Transverse components of magnetization are subsequently dephased with a gradient and the z-component is quantified through a read-pulse. Fourier transformation of this time-dependent signal provides both the amplitude and the probability distribution of the B 1 field across the sample. While this approach has been successful over a broad range of B 1 field strengths, it is challenging to use when measuring small RF fields of the order of 1 -10 Hz. This is because of the need to place the RF transmitter on-resonance to within a value much smaller than the magnitude of the B 1 field, or alternatively to treat chemical shift offset as a fitting parameter while modeling intensities in the nutation spectrum.",

In these experiments, two transients where collected at each value of the low field pulse duration (β) in order to compensate for magnetization build-up during transport between the low and the high fields. The first HF pulse is absent (θ = 0°) during the first transient whereas it becomes a 180°pulse for the second transient. Concomitantly, the receiver's phase is cycled between 0°and 180°between the two transients, effectively subtracting the signal acquired in the two transients. Prior to pulse optimisation, and in order to find the correlation between the nominal and the effective power output of the amplifier, the peak-to-peak voltage produced by the low field amplifier was measured as a function of the spectrometer's power level settings for the channel. Knowing the coil characteristics, we have decided to supply an effective power of 61.6 W, corresponding to a voltage of 55.5 V. According to simulation of the actual coil, this should provide a pulse length of around 20 μs for a 90°pulse.\n\nThe results of a pulse calibration obtained using the pulse sequence in Figure 4A and with B 0 inhomogeneities compensation obtained by supplying a 3.2 A current to the Z-shim coil is reported in Figure 4B.

The narrowness of the spike has been suggested as a possible explanation for the high precision of the magnetic compass sense of migratory birds. 38 The additional spikes at θ 40 • and θ 140 • in Fig. 3 are generated by the RF field: they occur when the frequency of this field becomes resonant with an energy level spacing ofĤ (0) (θ). These spikes are not purely Lorentzian: they have more complicated lineshapes that are sensitive to the initial phase and inclination of the RF magnetic field.\n\nThe results in Fig. 3 show that the Floquet approximation is essentially exact for this model problem when |B (1) | = 250 nT and τ = 100 µs. But from the derivation presented in Secs. III and IV, one would expect it to become less accurate as the strength of the perturbation is increased and the radical pair lifetime is decreased. In order to explore this, we have gone on to investigate what happens when |B (1) | is increased and τ is decreased by 1-2 orders of magnitude.\n\nThe effect of increasing |B (1) | is shown in Fig. 4.

Here a pressure broadened regime is examined with a pressure of 90 µbar for pulse durations from 50 to 1000 ns. The characteristic relaxation time (T2) for OCS at this pressure is 370 ns. The 50 ns pulse suffers from a weak average response but has almost no amplitude variation from start to finish. The variation of the response is clearly observed at 400 ns and confirmed by the experimental data. At 1000 ns the response to any lines positioned at the start of the pulse is almost zero whereas those at the end display to strongest response. The experimental data where measured using a single isolated transition while modifying the CP to place the transition at different positions. The observed variation is strongly dependent on the pressure which defines the relaxation characteristics in the time domain and linewidth for a frequency based representation. Indeed, we suggest an optimal duration pulse can be determined by maximising the response to lines at the start of the pulse if a degree of response variation can be tolerated.

However, two PP inversion pulses with suitable interpulse delays can be used to construct a refocusing sequence [17,18], which is effectively a 360 • U R pulse. Alternatively, a 180 • U R refocusing pulse can be constructed from three adiabatic inversion pulses [19] with either pulse length or bandwidth of the adiabatic frequency sweep in the ratio 1:2:1. More generally, we have shown that one can construct a UR pulse of any flip angle from a PP pulse of half the flip angle preceded by its time-and phase-reversed waveform [20]. Thus, a 180 • U R pulse can be constructed from two 90 • P P pulses. The reliance on composites of PP pulses to construct UR pulses highlights the perceived difficulty of creating stand-alone UR pulses. The de novo design of UR pulses for NMR spectroscopy has received comparatively little attention [9,21], so it is an open question whether the composite constructions using PP pulses achieve the best possible performance. Yet, the demonstrated capabilities of optimal control for designing PP pulses [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35] are equally applicable to the design of UR pulses [36,37,38]. The required modifications to the basic optimal control algorithm are fairly straightforward [36,39,40] and maintain the same flexibility for incorporating tolerance to variations in experimentally important parameters, such as RF homogeneity or relaxation.",

For example, a 90 • P P excitation pulse of length T p that produces a linear phase dispersion ∆ωRT p (0 ≤ R ≤ 1) as a function of offset ∆ω could be followed by τ -180 • P P -(τ + RT p ) -180 • P P . The first τ -delay already includes a phase evolution equivalent to time RT p , which is included in the next delay of the standard spin-echo. The second inversion pulse then compensates the phase errors of the first [14], which is unnecessary if a single 180 • U R is employed. A shorter sequence for this example is (τ − RT p ) -180 • P P -τ -180 • P P . The resulting modified spin-echo procedures rotate magnetization 360 • and are not UR inversions, but this is not an issue for refocusing.\n\nBIP [14] and BIBOP [15,16] pulses are optimized to provide exceptional performance as 180 • P P pulses, which translates to similar performance when incorporated into the above refocusing scheme. There is little room for improving the refocusing performance of two 180 • P P pulses. A similar conclusion was reached in the context of relatively high bandwidth selective pulses [46]. On the other hand, a single 180 • U R pulse can be simpler to incorporate into complex pulse sequences with respect to adjusting the timings and synchronization among various pulses. Conventional hard 180 • pulses can be easily replaced in an existing sequence by 180 • BU RBOP pulses without further change of the pulse sequence. By contrast, incorporating two 180 • P P pulses can require the adjustment of phases and a correspondingly detailed understanding of the pulse sequence. 8 We therefore find at most a modest advantage in using algorithms A or A S to generate a 180 • U R pulse compared to the overlapping spin-echo sequence using optimized 180 • P P pulses. However, incorporating a time-dependent RF limit into the optimal control algorithm does provide a distinct advantage for generating a single 180 • U R pulse compared to existing pulses, as illustrated in what follows.\n\n\nAlgorithms A T and A S,T",

(10). These matching conditions are wellpredicted by our analytical model, hence the 13 C flip angle and carrier frequency can be chosen by inspecting the calculated analytical 2D map for a given magnetic field strength and MAS frequency (Appendix S3). Once the 13 C carrier frequency and pulse flip angle are chosen, PULSAR can be optimized with only two steps. First, we optimize the 1 H CW rf field with a 1D experiment that includes a Cα selective echo before the P-TSAR block, by maximizing the non-Cα intensities (Fig. S1a). Second, we locally optimize the 13 C pulse length to again maximize the transferred intensity in the desired spectral regions. PERSPIRATION CP experiments require an additional step of optimizing the 15 N pulse length with respect to the 13 C pulse length, which is simple once the 13 C flip angle has been selected.

These changes did not depend on the BCL used (Fig 4). Under the action of a time-dependent stretch mimicking the global passive stretch experienced by the left atrium during the reservoir phase (scaled to 30%, see Figure 5A), AP underwent minimal changes -see Fig 5b. However, the timing of the passive stretch relative to the AP led to the appearance of some after-depolarizations, driven by ISAC_NS. We note that ISAC_K has the opposite effect to ISAC_NS at this time, causing a repolarization dip in the action potential. For the current parameterisation of the SAC channels, the combined effect of these MEC pathways gives rise to an afterdepolarization. Cm does not play a role in appearance of these changes in V after the action potential. \n\n\nResults\n\n\nSingle Cell Simulations\n\n\nTissue Simulations",

For example, a 90 • universal rotation of single-spin magnetization about the y-axis axis averages Φ P P for M z → M x , M x → −M z , and M y → M y .\n\nFigure 4 Figure 4 :\n44shows the TOP curves we found for the performance limits of UR 90 • and UR 180 • pulses suitable for use in the toroid. These pulses require approximately twice the time of PP pulses to approximate an ideal quality factor of one. This is consistent with earlier work on the construction of UR pulses from two PP pulses(34). The composite pulses of Ref.(22) are not able to achieve the UR performance of a simple hard pulse in the toroid.To date, the only other UR pulses with sufficient tolerance to rf scaling and resonance offset that might make them suitable for use in toroid probes are the adiabatic BIR-4 pulses(35). However, pulse lengths of ∼ 50 µs for the UR pulses obtained here, requiring an extremely rapid 12.5 µs half-passage in each BIR-4 segment, are too short for good adiabatic performance. The peak performance we were able to obtain from BIR-4 at one particular combination of offset and rf scale factor was Φ U R = 0.75. The performance over the volume of the toroid is considerably less. The BIR-4 pulse was constructed using the A B Time-optimal pulse (TOP) curves showing optimal performance as a function of pulse length for the universal rotations UR 90 • x (A) and UR 180 • x (B) applied to the toroid geometry and resonance offset range described in the text. By comparison, the quality factor for the best optimally parameterized (36) OP-BIR4 pulse we were able to generate for T = 50 µs is 0.9588.

The first part of the sequence, creation of the singlet, is applied on the 1 H-channel; this is also where the B 1 amplitude is swept. The second part, reconversion into magnetization and readout is done on resonance on the 13 C-channel. With the composite pulse there is an improvement of 54% at ω 1 =2πJ Σ . With the adiabatic pulse the signal of the basic SLIC is outdone by 163% reaching the maximum of 60% of signal from thermal 13 C-magnetization, predicted by simulations that assume neither B 1 amplitude inhomogeneity nor frequency offsets.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that SLIC can be successfully implemented for chemically equivalent as well as nearly equivalent spins, and that novel composite and adiabatic versions of the SLIC pulse can improve robustness while taking advantage of the reduced power requirements of SLIC as compared to M2S. This work could be extended to amplitude-modulated shaped pulses, such as the sech-tanh pulse, by inserting unequally spaced π pulses to partially refocus the ∆ coupling (at the expense of higher power dissipation) but in practice, for any given set of tradeoffs between power dissipation and needed robustness past these simple solutions, it is likely that computerized optimization is the best approach. The Hamiltonian in equation (3) has clear analogs in atomic and molecular optical spectroscopy and in general in applications where a \"dark state\" is made accessible by avoided crossing.

A linewidth of 3.8 kHz provides a partial immunity to field fluctuations spanning over a 1.1 kHz bandwidth, allowing signal averaging with minimal signal loss.\n\nIn order to relate magnetic field fluctuations with the acquired echo-signal, we may consider the maximal instability of the field during the acquisition in the presence of the readout gradient [19]. If we want the accumulated phase of the magnetization during the acquisition time (during which the G FE gradient is switched on, see Fig. 2) to be small, we may consider the condition γ∆B 0 T read <π. Here ∆B 0 represents the standard deviation of the fluctuating field and T read the readout time during which the echo signal is recorded. The\n\nNyquist criterion relates the spatial resolution with the readout parameters so that the previous condition can be written as ∆B 0 <G FE ∆x, that is, field fluctuations should be smaller than the pixel bandwidth. In our case we may consider a typical readout gradient of 30 mT/m and a pixel size ∆x = 1 mm. This implies a required field stability of 240 ppm that is in fact worse than the measured stability of the current (220 ppm). The fact that we do not observe undesirable ghosting in the images is also consistent with the fact that the effective field inhomogeneity is larger than the field fluctuations bandwidth.\n\n\nPulse sequences and imaging parameters\n\nThe spin-echo sequence was chosen for image acquisition due to its robustness under the presence of B 0 inhomogeneities [52].

The region colored in light gray in Fig. 2 (before the 90-degree RF pulse) is used to stabilize the magnetic field gradient and also to dephase any remaining transverse magnetization (spoiler gradient).\n\nAppropriate gradient parameters must be chosen to effectively rephase all spins across the selected slice; otherwise signal intensity can be severely degraded [53].",

What the latter does offer is a semiquantitative a priori estimate of the importance of scalar relativistic corrections.\n\nThere is, alas, one notable, clear-cut relativistic effect that a model based on only q s (Z) is intrinsically unable to capture: the scalar relativistic correction to atomic electron affinities [10][11][12] (which for B-F and Al-Cl basically corresponds to the effect of an extra p electron). Since the p parameters for the first row are ill-determined statistically, one could instead assign fixed values from the calculated contributions to electron affinities, ionisation potentials or their average -the latter corresponds [65] to the Mulliken electronegativity except for a constant.\n\nWe As can be seen in Table 2, this model captures 99.3% of variance for the first row and 99.0% for both rows (with SF 6 omitted). It should be noted that the ratio between s and p coefficients for a given element grows with Z from about a factor of 2-15: hence, clamping the p coefficients rather than fitting them does not greatly impact accuracy. As also shown in Table 2, the SSQ recovery for both rows can be increased to 99.2% by adding d parameters; if the outlier point SF 6 is brought back in, we are back at 98.7%. These parameters are not statistically welldetermined, however, and we have chosen to omit them in deference to Occam's law of parsimony.\n\nWith NBO-based charges, things are not as simple. We can recover 99.5% for the first row, but for both rows together, this drops to just 92.2% -deleting HClO 4 and SF 6 as outliers brings us back to 95.2%, which can be lifted up to 98.0% even with HClO 4 included if a q d (Z) term is added.",

As the case of the nuclear shell model demonstrated, it might be interesting to have a look at the answers that theoretical chemists give to predict the chemical properties of superheavy elements. Traditionally, the chemical properties of an unknown element and its compounds were predicted by exploiting the fundamental relationships of the physicochemical data of the elements and their compounds within the groups and the periods of the Periodic Table. However, with the increasing nuclear charges in heavy elements, the innermost electrons become more tightly bound and are thus moving with velocities which are a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore they obey the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics. Due to relativistic rearrangements, which are predicted for the electronic structure of the heaviest elements, quite unexpected chemical properties are to be expected. These so-called relativistic effects are already severely influencing the chemical properties of lighter elements such as gold. The yellow color and the rather inert chemical behavior can be attributed to relativistic effects and explained by fully relativistic quantum chemical calculations. [17] Early predictions of the chemical properties of superheavy elements were rather spectacular. One of the articles was entitled 'Are elements 112, 114, and 118 relatively inert gases?'. [18] Nowadays, with the use of powerful supercomputers the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations is increasing rapidly. Latest calculations come to the conclusion that element 112 (Cn) is not completely inert as expected for a noble gas, but should form a chemical bond with Au, which, however, is weaker than that of the lighter homolog Hg. [19] Also, element 114 might be relatively inert but should interact stronger with an Au surface than Cn. [19] Element 118 is predicted to be the first element in the row of noble gases with an electron affinity. [20] Due to the considerable experimental difficulties in experimentally studying the chemical properties of superheavy elements, the gap between experimental observables and theoretical predictions is still large.",

Increased accuracy has been obtained, but full advantage cannot be taken of it until higher resolution is available on account of the inevitable error involved in measuring the distance between lines not of the same intensity. The two unit mass intervals between 202, 204 and 204, 206 and also the three unit intervals 201, 204 and 204, 207 were measured on several plates, and in each case appeared integral within one-hundredth of a unit (1 in 20,000), but the line 204 cannot possibly be similar in intensity to 201, still less to 202, and too little is known of their exact mass differences, or indeed of their packing fractions, to enable the masses of 206 and 207 to be fixed.

The X-ray values can be obtained from the emission measurements of Thoraeus.* These measurements give the values of the Ln, Lin and M levels. The value of the Lr level can be calculated since Lj -Mu in = b/33, 4 but Thoraeus' values of the 4 lines do not include cobalt. Stonerj' has, however, calculated the energy of the LT level from Sommerfeld's equation (Lx)4 -(Ln )* = 0-57. Accordingly the values of the L and M levels can be found. The inflection at 900 • 6 can be associated with the removal of an electron from the Lx orbit outside the atom altogether or to the MIV v level. Stoner's calculated values for these are 917 and 907 volts. The line at 856*5 volts is probably due to the transition from the LT to the Mn in level, the calculated value being 852 • 9 volts. The value at 775 volts may be due to an electron being removed from the Lm orbit outside the atom altogether or to the MIV v level, the calculated values being 783*6 and 775 * 5 volts. There is besides an inflection at 836 • 5 volts. It is difficult to say exactly what accounts for this, but it is not improbable that it is due to multiple impact, that is, a bombarding electron removing at the same time one electron from the Lm level to the MIV v level, and another, in the same atom or in another atom, from the Mn m level to the periphery. The total value in this case is 839*6 volts. Multiple impacts, especially of this double, type, in such experiments as these, are by no means impossible. An electron may have sufficient energy after a resonance encounter to produce ionisation or resonance in another atom, as has been mentioned by Stoner in his discussion on the theory of Thomas on multiple impacts. The probability of such collisions should be small, and hence one should expect the intensity of such inflections to be small. The intensity of the break at 836 • 5 is seen to be much less than the intensities of neighbouring breaks, thus lending con siderable weight to",

Relativistic effects increase approximately with the square of the atomic number and are responsible for the distinct color of gold and for the liquid state of mercury at room temperature. For example, these effects stabilize s and p 1/2 orbitals, whereas p 3/2 and d orbitals are destabilized in energy. This leads to changes of the atomic ground state configurations compared to the trend observed in the elements we find in nature. In lawrencium (Z = 103), for example, a 7p 1/2 ground state is predicted instead of a 6d state [4]. At some point, a deviation from the regular pattern that governs the ordering of elements in the periodic table is expected. Such deviations were predicted for the superheavy elements copernicium (Z = 112) and flerovium (Z = 114) in the mid 1970s [5].

Perhaps the first convincing evidence that such corrections could affect light elements was the pioneering work by Garcia de la Vega on atomic electron affinities at the Hartree-Fock level [10,11] -extended later [12] through basis set limit full CI extrapolation, and shown there unambiguously to be the 'missing link' in achieving millielectronvolt accuracy (see also [13]).",

It must be due to a particular element. As mentioned above, since in the periodic table element 112 is in the same column as Hg having a closed s-d shell, it was concluded that the fission fragments are due to this element. It should be mentioned that this conclusion is also in accord with recent relativistic calculations [15]. It is shown [15] that the p 1/2 and s 1/2 level energy distance even increases from Hg to element 112 and thus makes partial p 1/2 occupancy at least as improbable as in Hg. Occupation of the p 1/2 shell by one electron or more, (Z = 113 and higher) or removal of at least one electron from the s-d shell (Z below 112) would drastically change the chemical and physical properties. E.g. from the experience with s-d atomic level structures in the periodic table we see that the evaporation temperatures stay high as long as the s-d shell is not closed, with a strong drop for the closed d l0 s 2 configuration as in Hg and Z = 112. On the other hand the ns l/2 and (n-1)d 5/2 which were quite apart in Hg are now almost energetically degenerate, because the 7s 1/2 orbital becomes more bound due to a direct relativistic effect and the 6d 5/2 less bound due to indirect relativistic effects (stronger shielding of the nuclear charge by the relativistically enhanced deeper binding of the s l/2 and p l/2 orbitals). The less bound 6d 5/2 makes it more reactive and the more bound 7s 1/2 makes it more noble than in Hg. These two effects may compensate and make chemical behaviors of Hg and element 112 similar. (For instance, according to the relativistic calculations [15] the binding energies (D c ) of Hg and element 112 on Cu are almost the same). On the other hand the chemistry of Hg cannot be similar to that of any other superheavy element in this Z region. Therefore it may be",

The transfermium elements remained out of reach for such an approach until recently, as neither primordial isotopes of these elements exist nor can macroscopic samples be synthesized. These radioactive elements have to be produced by heavy-ion induced fusion-evaporation reactions yielding low rates, which inevitably calls for ultraefficient and fast spectroscopy techniques of extreme sensitivity.

Laser resonance ionization spectroscopy of the element nobelium (No) has long been anticipated at the GSI in Darmstadt [7]. To this end, the so-called RAdiation Detected Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (RADRIS) technique was employed [8,9].

He had been \"lent\" by Hans Bethe (at Cornell) to William A. Fowler (at Caltech) 7 to tackle various problems in nuclear astrophysics (Salpeter 2008). Salpeter was aware of the \"Wheeler\" resonance but not of the work by Opik, though the latter (Opik 1977) was quite scrupulous about sending copies of papers produced at his Armagh Observatory to other institutions on an exchange basis. The Pasadena copy was almost certainly at the offices of Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories, in those days a pleasant halfhour walk from Fowler's lab, which, however, very few people took. Salpeter (1952) required a temperature for 3 He 4 → C 12 lower than Opik's (where an additional alpha capture and other reactions would have destroyed the carbon as fast as it formed), but high enough that C 12 (α, γ)10 16 had a cross section larger than that for triple alpha, so that oxygen would dominate the product mix by a large factor. Indeed it is the more abundant of the two in stars and interstellar gas and all, but there is, in fact, enough carbon in the real world for us to be organic, in the original meaning of the word. This brings us to the \"Hoyle resonance\" in C 12 (Hoyle 1954). It is the second excited state and has the right spin and parity to increase the cross section for Be 8 (α, γ) C 12 by a very large factor. This lowers the temperature needed for triple alpha and so discriminates against oxygen production, for which the Coulomb barrier is, of course, higher. The resonance was present in a pre-war study (Holloway and Moore, 1938) but not there in seemingly better data (Malm and Beuchner 1951). Thus when Fred Hoyle came to Kellogg Radiation Lab at Caltech in 1953 and said that the state must exist or we wouldn't be here to talk about it, he was arguing not exactly in the absence of data but in the face of the data. And he actually persuaded the Kellogg crew to have another look and find the resonance (Dunbar et al. 1953). This permitted us all to continue",

At the 1983 Few-Body Conference in Karlsruhe we [35] stated that \"we believe that f 2 p is probably more in the neighborhood of 0.075 than of 0.080.\" This belief was based on our PWA of the low-energy pp data. It lasted until 1987 before we could make our suspicions hard, that is, before we could give solid evidence based on statistics. In our energy-dependent PWA [36] of the pp scattering data below T lab = 350 MeV we found f 2 p = 0.0725 (6). Unfortunately, the magnetic-moment interactions were not yet included in these analyses. When that was finally done [37], we [38,39] obtained f 2 p = 0.0749 (6). At that time we had not made a determination of f 2 c by ourselves. Therefore we had to assume that the value for f 2 c determined in πN scattering was correct and that there was thus evidence for a large breaking of charge independence. That raised hell. Many people [40,41,42,43,44,45,46] had their own explanation about what was wrong with our analyses. Those \"explanations\" were almost all based on wrong assumptions and ignorance about energy-dependent PWA's. Nobody, on the other hand, questioned seriously the value for f 2 c from πN analyses. Of course there are people who are familiar with PWA's. Arndt et al. noticed that in the energy-dependent VPI&SU analyses of the np data a lower coupling constant was favored. This encouraged them to have a fresh look at the πN data. In 1990 the VPI&SU group [47] came up with the new value f 2 c = 0.0735 (15). Again, many people [44,48,49,50, 51] had their own \"explanation\" about what was wrong with this analysis. Of course, nothing was really wrong! In order to try to appease the opposition the VPI&SU group [52] included dispersion-relation constraints in their analyses of the πN data. This lead then to the value f 2 c = 0.0761 (8). In our",

Thus even when most of the core of a star is C ~2, 016, and Ne 2~ it will still have at least one excess neutron for every 104 baryons.This number rises through the later burning stages up to the iron core which collapses.At this stage, the parameter is generally given as Ye, the number of electrons per baryon.Central values are Ye = 0.41-0.45,lower in the cores of less massive stars where high densities and low temperatures encourage direct electron captures on some nuclei (Thielemann and Arnett 1985;Hillebrandt and Wolff 1985).Y~ at the center makes some difference to how likely a shock is to survive and make a Type II explosion happen (Hillebrandt and Wolff 1985).Y~ in the ejecta determines whether you get the right ratios of isotopes like Fe 54,57,58 to Fe 56.It is never smaller than 0.49 in the material ejected from the 1987A models computed by Thielemann et al.

We suggest, however, that this minimum is a real feature, missing in the Marshall and Pople calculations, although its position and depth for the triplet H 2 system we do not expect to get right with electron gas theory. We base this first on the physical intuition that the loss of spherical symmetry, resulting from the interaction, that reduces diamagnetic shielding begins to reverse as the interacting atoms get very close. There is also indirect experimental evidence that this minimum exists, at least in heavier systems. Jameson [20] has extracted from experimental data obtained [21] in her laboratory an empirical estimate of the interaction chemical shift, as a function of internuclear separation, for pairs of 129Xe atoms, a real interacting closed-shell system. Her results are shown in figure 4. Note that, in parallel to what we find in the triplet H2 system, there exists a minimum in the interaction deshielding near 'contact' (the equilibrium separation Ro). Figure 4 also shows the function of the xenon interatomic potential Jameson found that best reproduces the experimental data. While there are no compelling reasons for the interaction chemical shift to depend in a simple way upon the interatomic potential, it is interesting that, of the class of functions that do so, the one that works best is very similar to our interaction magnetic shielding as shown in figure 1. We feel that it would be worthwhile to perform an electron gas calculation for the 129Xe system, where the plethora of electrons lends the electron gas assumption considerably more accuracy in the region of importance. With a good xenon interatomic potential [22], the temperature and density dependence of the magnetic shielding of 129Xe could then be directly calculated and compared with Jameson's experimental results. Our preliminary work on triplet H 2 suggests there is a good chance this comparison will be favourable, since the minimum in the interaction magnetic shielding function, at least the most obvious feature demanded of it for agreement with experiment, which is missing in previous theoretical formulations, is here found even in the electron desert limit of the electron gas. We wish to make three further comments. First of all, it should be borne in mind that the electron gas results are expected to be best at intermediate distances.

Of particular note is the Deslandres-d'Azambuja band system which has been seen in flames (Hornbeck & Herman 1949), plasma plumes (Camacho et al. 2008), laser ablation of graphite (Acquaviva & De Giorgi 2002) and astrophysics (Gredel et al. 1989;Berdyugina et al. 2007). Yet remarkably the only modern, high resolution study of these band was made of 13 C 2 (Antić-Jovanović et al. 1985). A high resolution study of the Deslandres-d'Azambuja bands for 12 C 2 is overdue.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Klaas Nauta, Tim Schmidt and Scott Kable for helpful discussions and feedback.

Bond lengths are given inÅ.\n\na Linux system. 18 The geometric parameters of the stationary points including reactants (R), intermediates (IM), transition states (TS), and products (P) are fully optimized using the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) with standard 6-311G(d,p) basis set. [19][20][21] This MP2 method has been used successfully in previous studies on the similar reaction systems. [22][23][24][25] The zero point vibrational energy (ZPE), the Gibbs free energy, the enthalpy, the entropy and the harmonic vibrational frequencies of various species are obtained at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level (see Tables S1 and S2 †). Each transition state is veried to connect the designated reactants and products by performing an intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) 26,27 analysis. To obtain more accurate energetic data, the single-point energy calculations are carried out at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples CCSD(T) method with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. 28 Unless otherwise specied, the energies in this paper include the zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections and scaled by a scaling factor 0.95. 29 In other word, these D(E + ZPE) values at CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p)//MP2/6-311G(d,p) + 0.95 Â ZPE level were used for the reaction mechanism analysis and kinetic calculations. Furthermore, the T1 diagnostic values have been calculated at the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p) level (see Table  S3 †) and the values of all the species are less than 0.045, 30,31 which implies that the energy data obtained from singledeterminant wave function of CCSD(T) are reasonably reliable for this reaction system.",

S is the entropy, h is the Planck constant, ν is the computed vibrational frequencies, Θ is the characteristic temperature of vibration, k is the Boltzmann constant, and R is the molar gas constant.T is the temperature and is taken as 298.15K.The entropy of other adsorbed states (TΔS) is calculated from the vibrational frequencies associated with the standard modes in the harmonic approximation [15].The contributions are listed (Tables S8 and S9).For adsorbates, E ZPE and S are obtained from vibrational frequency calculations with harmonic approximation, and contributions from the slabs are neglected.In contrast, for molecules, these values are taken from NIST-JANAF thermochemical Tables [16].\n\n\nResult and Discussion",

The barrier height is quite high compared to k B T at room temperature (which corresponds to 0.027 eV). The uphill and downhill barriers are similar with a difference of 0.4 eV. In this process, the SiCl 3 dissociate into SiCl 2 and Cl. The Cl atom stays on top of Si and the SiCl 2 migrates to the nearest Si 0 site and forms SiCl 3 . Standard transition state theory 39 gives an attempt frequency of ω A = k B T / = 6 × 10 12 sec −1 at room temperature. Hence the time required to cross the uphill barrier is 10 15 sec at room temperature.\n\nIn order to asses the possibility and reaction time at higher temperature, we estimated the Boltzmann probabilities as a function of temperature for the 10 lowest energy structures of [Cl@Si 32 Cl 44 ] − and [Br@Si 32 Br 44 ] − . The details of the calculation of the Boltzmann probability plot and the figure (Fig. 1 in appendix) is provided in appendix. The Boltzmann probabilities show that the ground state structure of [Br@Si 32 Br 44 ] − is dominant until ∼1200 K and for [Cl@Si 32 Cl 44 ] − until ∼800 K. At higher temperatures, other low energy structures start to emerge.\n\nHence, considering 800 K as the upper limit, the time required for transition at 800 K is around 0.2 msec. Since, the experimental synthesis was carried out in a solvent medium the actual barrier height could be considerably lower than our calculated height.  Fig 4(a) where, the yellow colour indicates the presence of extra electronic charge and blue electron deficiency. The plot shows that when an electron is added, it doesn't reside on the central Cl atom. Rather, the Si as well as Cl atoms of the Si 0 decoration on the cage gain some electronic charge at the expense of losing electronic charge from Si atoms with Si 1 decoration. There is no significant difference in the charge density of the Cl in the SiCl 3 groups in Si 1 decoration.",

Obviously, the melting temperature at zero pressure and at the pressure of one bar differ somewhat. In fact, for real water the difference is about 0.01 K (i.e. 273.16 K for essentially zero pressure at the triple point versus 273.15 K for p ¼ 1 bar). For water models, the difference between the melting pressure at zero pressure and at p ¼ 1 bar is expected to be of the order of 1=ðdp=dTÞ. By using the values of dp=dT reported in our previous work [48] it can be seen that also for water models the difference between the melting temperatures at normal pressure and zero pressure should be of the order of about 0.01 K (i.e. quite small). In view of that, it is reasonable to identify T m with T s . Still another comment is required with respect to our simulations of the ice-vacuum interface. In principle, when ice is exposed to vacuum at temperatures below the melting point there should be a solid-vapour equilibria. The vapour pressure of water at the triple point is quite low, namely 6 Â 10 À3 bar. The vapour pressure of TIP4P models at the triple point is fifty times smaller [36], about 1:3 Â 10 À4 bar. Although in principle one could determine the vapour pressure of ice by performing NVT runs of ice in contact with vacuum, this is not feasible in practice. In fact, for the lengths of the runs used in this paper we have never observed the sublimation of a single ice molecule into the vacuum (this of course should occur in very long runs, but since it is a rare event it was not observed in the runs of this work which lasted about 10 ns). For this reason we prefer to say that T s was obtained at zero pressure, but it could be more appropriate to say that it was obtained at the sublimation pressure of the ice (which must be quite low anyway).",

Mishima 109,110 determined the course of the melting curve in the range where ice I is metastable. Equation (36) was used to calculate the melting curve in this range by extrapolating both the equation of state of ice and of that of supercooled water. Figure 27 shows that the calculated melting curve agrees fairly well with Mishima's data. Figure 28 shows deviations of the experimental data from values computed from Eq. (36). The data from Henderson and Speedy 106 are the most accurate and differ less than 1 MPa from Eq. (36). The data of Maruyama 108 systematically lie 2 MPa below Eq. (36). The maximum pressure difference in the stable region between Eq. (36) and values from the IAPWS correlation 41 is 0.6%, which is well within the uncertainty of 2% of the IAPWS correlation.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have developed an equation of state for cold and supercooled water, explicit in the Gibbs energy, valid from the homogeneous nucleation temperature to 300 K and for pressures up to 400 MPa. The equation is based on a two-state model of water, combined with empirical background terms. It is the first equation of state that represents the density data of Sotani et al. 35 and Asada et al. 37 as well as the speed-of-sound data of Lin and Trusler 52 in the considered temperature range. In part of the stable region of liquid water, the equation can be connected to the IAPWS-95 formulation with minimal discontinuities in the property values.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of future equations of state, density measurements with an accuracy of 0.02% or better below 250 K up to 400 MPa are desirable. Currently, this area is only covered by Mishima's data. For the speed of sound, there are only a few measurements in the metastable region for pressures higher than atmospheric. Experimental data are needed especially down to 250 K and up to 200 MPa. Also, there are no data for the heat capacity of supercooled water above atmospheric pressure, while such data are highly desirable.",

Enthalpy\n\nAt atmospheric pressure the enthalpy of ice is nearly identical to its internal energy as the term P V results to be vanishingly small. The enthalpy, H, of the three ice phases at atmospheric pressure is presented in Fig. 12 as a function of temperature. For ice Ih we have compared both the classical and quantum limits of the QHA to the corresponding simulation results. At the scale of the figure the agreement is very good. The QHA zero-point energy of ice Ih is 68.9 kJ/mol. The QHA systematically overestimates the enthalpy of the three ice phases at low temperatures. In the case of ice Ih we find that at 50 K the QHA result is 0.7 kJ/mol larger than the PIMD result, while for ice II and III we obtain a larger deviation of about 0.9 kJ/mol. Both QHA and PIMD results show that at 50 K the enthalpy of the ice phases increases in the order Ih<II<III. With respect to the enthalpy of ice II, the relative values found for ice Ih and III at 50 K are -0.3 and 0.5 kJ/mol (PIMD) and -0.4 and 0.5 kJ/mol (QHA), respectively. Interestingly at higher temperature the agreement between the PIMD and QHA data becomes better as a consequence of an error compensation between kinetic and potential energy terms. Thus the error of the QHA enthalpy estimation is lower than that found for the kinetic energy in the previous Subsec. IV D.\n\nThe pressure dependence of the enthalpy at 100 K is represented in Fig. 13. The term P V plays here an important role. We have already seen in Fig. 12 that at 100 K and atmospheric pressure the QHA overestimates the reference enthalpy of PIMD simulations. This behavior results nearly independent of the external pressure. In Fig. 13 the QHA result for the three ice phases lies systematically slightly above the corresponding simulation results, but the overall agreement can be considered as satisfactory in the whole studied pressure range.\n\n\nF.

A \"xed grid structure (21;21) with a staggered grid approach was devised. At grid points near the boundaries, the liquid and solid fractions corresponding to that position were determined by Lagrangian polynomials and string-intersected approximations to derivatives were used (Vemuri and Karplus, 1981;Negiz et al., 1993Negiz et al., , 1995Hastaoglu et al., 1995). A central di!erencing was performed to approximate the spatial derivatives at all interior grid points. The SIMPLER (SIMPLE (semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations) Revised) algorithm developed by Patankar (Patankar, 1980) was followed for the calculation of the pressure and thus the velocity \"eld which was needed for the solution of the energy equation in the liquid phase. The melting enclosure was considered to be tilted 53 anti-clockwise to facilitate a two dimensional phase change process.

H 2 O and D 2 O molecules are represented using the non-rigid q-TIP4P/F model 54 . This model is based on the TIP4P/2005 model for water 55 , commonly used in classical MD simulations. The q-TIP4P/F water model was optimized for path integral computer simulations and has been shown to be able to reproduce remarkably well the properties of liquid water at P = 0.1 MPa 46,54 . Here, we perform PIMD and MD simulations at constant N, P, and T over a wide range of temperatures and pressures, 180 ≤ T ≤ 375 K and −250 ≤ P ≤ 500 MPa; see Supplementary Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Information (SI). The temperature of the system is maintained constant using a stochastic (local) path integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat 56 while the pressure of the system is controlled by using a Monte Carlo Barostat (additional computational details can be found in Ref. 46 ). In the PIMD simulations, the time step dt is set to 0.25 fs and the number of beads per ring-polymer/atom was set to n b = 32 ; in Ref. 46 , it is shown that this value of n b is large enough to obtain well-converged dynamical, thermodynamic, and structural properties of q-TIP4P/F water at P = 0.1 MPa and T ≥ 210 K. In order to ensure that the conclusions in Ref. 46 applied to the pressures we considered in this work, we have also performed additional PIMD simulations using n b = 72 beads per ring-polymer (see SI). Consistent with Ref. 46 , we found that most of the thermodynamic and dynamical properties converged with n b = 32 , with the enthalpy being the only expected exception. Short-range (Lennard-Jones pair potential) interactions are calculated using a cutoff r c = 1.0 nm and long range electrostatic interactions are computed using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method with the same cutoff r c . In the classical MD simulations, we employ a time step dt = 0.50 fs",

Many computer simulations validate the LLPT hypothesis. Specifically, a LLCP has been identified in classical computer simulations using popular models, such as ST2, TIP4P/2005, and TIP4P/ice 7,14,18,38-44 . A recent classical MD simulation using a water model developed from density functional theory combined with machine learning techniques also suggests that water exhibits a LLCP in the supercooled regime 21 . Not surprisingly, the location of the LLCP in computer simulations vary with the water model considered. For example, in the case of the ST2 water model, the LLCP temperature is overestimated ( T c = 237 K, P c = 167 MPa, ρ c = 0.99 g/cm 3 ) 41 ; while in the TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P/Ice water models it is underestimated ( T c = 172 K, P c = 186 MPa, and ρ c = 1.03 g/ cm 3 for TIP4P/2005; T c = 188 K, P c = 175 MPa, ρ c = 1.01 g/cm 3 for TIP4P/Ice)18. In all these cases, the LLCP pressure is overestimated by approximately 100 MPa 6 . The computer simulation studies that find a LLCP in water are based on classical models where the atoms delocalization due to nuclear quantum effects (NQE) are neglected. This can be troublesome because water is a light molecule and delocalization effects of its H atoms occur even at standard temperatures and pressures45,46. For example, the temperature of maximum density and the glass transition temperature (T g ) of H 2 O and D 2 O differ by 7-10 K, a clear sign of",

[22]. They calculated the coexistence pressure at 1074 K and −300 bar. Then, they evaluated the slope of the coexistence curve, dp dT = 30 bar K −1 , and recalculated the melting temperature at 1 bar obtaining 1064(14) K (nonetheless, using their values, we have obtained the NaCl melting temperature at 1084 (14) K, in perfect agreement with our results). Zykova-Timan et al. [25] computed the melting temperature via liquid/solid direct coexistence and obtained a value for T m in good agreement with the one obtained in this work (taking into account that in their NVE runs they obtained the melting temperature for a pressure of about +-500 bar and since the slope of the melting curve is of about 30K/bar the value at p = 1bar could be modified by up to 17K ). In general, the agreement with data in the literature is satisfactory. The TF slightly underestimates the experimental values of the coexistence densities, whereas both SD and JC underestimate them considerably, in agreement with the results of Alejandre and Hansen for the SD model [81].",

As can be seen, once the structure factor falls below a certain value the melting proceeds rapidly and irreversibly. Results for the other ice phases and models are similar. Table 2 presents the first temperature for which spontaneous melting of ices was found (see the column labelled as T stab ). It should be noted that in all cases, simulation runs of up to 2:4 Â 10 5 cycles were performed for a lower temperature (by 5 or 10 K) without success in melting the ice. In table 2, the melting temperatures of the corresponding ice phase for the TIP4P and SPCE models are also shown for comparison (column denoted as T coex ). The latter values are taken from [11] and were calculated by determining the free energies of the fluid and solid phases. ÁT (we shall denote this value as the meta stability range) represents the difference between T stab and T coex and is also given in table 2. For TIP4P ice I the stability range depends only weakly on pressure (for the two pressures considered the range is about ÁT ¼ 68 K). The stability range of different ices for a certain model are slightly different, although these differences are never large. For the TIP4P, we may state that 80 K is the typical range of meta stability for the different ice phases. For the SPC/E model the meta stability range appears to be about 90 K (i.e. 10 K larger than that of the TIP4P). This is not surprising since the internal energies of the solids are always lower in the SPC/E model than in the TIP4P model (the hydrogen bonding is slightly stronger in the SPC/E model when compared with the TIP4P model). In any case, differences in the stability range of both models (SPC/ E and TIP4P) are small. In this respect, the numbers presented here represent the typical values of the stability range that would be expected to be found in simulations of other realistic models of water. Although a systematic study of the system size dependence of T stab has not been performed (see [30]), we have studied the behaviour of",

In these simulations, the initial water configuration that was equilibrated along the zero isobar during the cooling cycle presented above was set to undergo an isothermal compression at five different temperatures by increasing the pressure in steps of 0.1 GPa. At each pressure and isotherm, we run the system until the volume of the system stabilizes during the timescale of our simulations and this process at each isotherm was repeated until the increased pressure reached 1.0 GPa. Fig. 6 shows the response of the density or the volume of water to increased pressure for five different isotherms. As expected, Fig. 6 (a) shows that at low pressure the density of the glass (at T=160 and 180 K) is smaller than the density of the liquid water (at T=270, 300 and 350 K). The density of the liquid water increases monotonically with increase in pressure. For the amorphous ice the density has a modest change for an increment of 0.1 GPa from its initial zero pressure. However, between 0.1 and 0.2 GPa the density has a sudden jump as reflected in the volume vs temperature plot in Fig. 6 (b). This is a reflection of the sudden structural change taking place in the sample that was induced by pressure transforming it from LDA to HDA, a result consistent with earlier studies [22][23][24]. Beyond 0.2 GPa, the density of the amorphous ice increases monotonically with increase in pressure. The corresponding structural changes with pressure for the amorphous ice are discussed in more detail in the next section. Fig. 6 (b) shows the variation of the volume of the sample with pressure where the different colors of the closed circles represent the different isotherms as shown by the same colors in Fig. 6 (a). At a given isotherm, each closed circle represents the volume of the water sample as the pressure is increased from 0, at the top, to 1.0 GPa, at the bottom, (in a vertical direction) in increments of 0.1 GPa. For comparison, the black solid curves are from the isobaric cooling procedure shown in Fig. 1 (d).",

This suggests the importance of the global minimum and its closest energy isomers of a potential/free energy surface. Still, the contributions of entropic effects and temperature decide which isomers contribute to the molecular properties in a temperature range of interest. Notably, neither the helix-type structure reported by Guo et al. [26] nor the putative global minimum found in this study, also reported by Yañez et al. [56] at a high level of theory, is the putative global minimum when we consider the entropy. Our results show that the entropic-temperature effect should be considered.

Figure 3b shows four solid-solid transformation temperature points, T ss1 , T ss2 , T ss3 , and T ss4 , without Grimme's dispersion (D3). For ease of numerical of comparison, they are displayed in parentheses in Table 4 together with the probability of occurrence in bold and square brackets. The T ss1 and T ss2 points shift on the temperature axis to a higher temperature by 10 and 20 K, respectively, whereas the relative population has variations not larger than 1.5%. The T ss3 , T ss4 , and T ss5 shift on the temperature axis to low temperatures. Initially, this suggests that the dispersion of the relative population indicates a shift of the two dominant T ss points from low to higher temperatures, keeping the relative populations near-constant. In contrast with the T ss points, with lower probability occurrence, T ss points shows a small shift from high to lower temperatures with minimal changes in the relative population. The real properties in a molecule are statistical averages over the ensemble of isomers. Thus, it is crucial to, as far as possible, completely sample the potential energy surface to consider all isomers. The search for low-energy structures is not straightforward, and it could often lead to missing some low-energy isomers. In this respect, we ask what would happen if a low-energy structure was missing when computing the relative populations and the effect on the computation of any molecular properties. Figure 4 shows the computed relative population when the two coaxial triple-layered C s and C 2v structures have been removed from the isomers pool database. In the range from 773 to 1500 K, the relative population depicted by the solid yellow line in Figure 4 indicates that the dominant structure is a distorted coaxial triple-layered structure, as depicted in Figure A2(10), located 9.20 kcal/mol above the putative global minimum at the CCSD(T) level of theory. Furthermore, the analysis of the results on the average B-B bond length shown in Figure 2 indicated that the structure with the second-lowest bond length also has the same distorted coaxial triple-layered structure.

However, high vibrational levels will have a negligible population already at 8000 K (only the first 2-3 levels will be populated but the ground will still dominate). Useful formulae for the H 2 cooling in the low-density and LTE conditions can be found in Glover and Abel (2008) and Coppola et al. (2012), respectively. The former reference also contains a thorough discussion of the H 2 ortho/para ratio in the typical conditions of primordial clouds, where it is generally different from the equilibrium value 3:1 expected at high densities and temperatures. At densities above n thick ≈ 10 9 cm −3 , H 2 becomes optically thick to its own radiation, and the emitted rovibrational photons can be efficiently scattered and re-absorbed, decreasing the overall cooling efficiency. However, velocity gradients can Doppler-shift photons outside the optically thick cores of the rovibrational lines, allowing them to leave the cloud (Yoshida et al., 2006;Stacy and Bromm, 2013;Hartwig et al., 2015a).

We have chosen the temperatures from 1600 K to 2500 K due to these temperatures are close to the melting points of boron (2349 K) and beryllium (1560 K). The BOMD's were started from the initial configuration of the coaxial triple-layered structure (the putative global minimum at a temperature of 1500 K), employing a Hoover thermal bath with random initial velocities imposed to the atoms, and for a simulation time of 25 ps with a step size of 1 fs. As the temperature increases, Be 6 B 11 − cluster is subject to dissociation phenomena. Based on the BOMD simulation results, we found the dissociation processes of the Be 6 B 11 − cluster occurs at a temperature of 2000 K, whereas there is no dissociation during the BOMD simulation at 1600 K; the cluster maintains its connectivity at this temperature. At a temperature of 2500 K, the dissociation processes are stronger, and more beryllium atoms are escaped (see the movies in the Supplementary Information). Min Li et al.

Fig. 1 shows the temperature dependence of the hydrogen-bond energy E hb and the radius of gyration R g , along with our two-state fits. Table 1 gives a summary of our two-state fits. In particular, we see that the fitted values of both the energy change ∆E and the midpoint temperature T m are similar for the different quantities. It is also worth noting that the T m values fall close to the folding temperature T f , defined as the maximum of the specific heat. The difference between the highest and lowest values of T m is less than 1%. There is a somewhat larger spread in ∆E, but this parameter has a larger statistical error.",

It can be seen as a measure of how dispersed the electronic polarisation is, both in real space and among the energy states. Thus, a polarisation that leads to a wide electron density reshuffling would exhibit a large entropy. We stress that only static polarisation is considered here, i.e. the case of entropy of electromagnetic polarisation, more tricky, [41][42][43] is not approached in this work. In Section 2, the connection between entropy, heat and temperature was done through the Boltzmann distribution in which the population of an excited state k depends on the ratio between the energy difference and the temperature. Thus, when one raises the temperature, the lowest excited states are populated first. In the problem at hand, the probability of having the level k populated is more intricate since it is given by:\ndp k ¼ kjH pert j0 E 0 À E k 2 :(33)\nShould the numerator of the latter equation be the same for all the excited states, then a simple statistical distribution would be easily found. Indeed, the occupation would be a unique function of the inverse of excitation energies. Unfortunately, the numerator makes the connection between the ground state and the excited state through the perturbation potential. Therefore the numerator can be quite important for high excited states, and the population distribution may not be monotonic. Consequently, high excited states can be much more populated than lower ones. In this situation, a temperature can be hard to define rigorously. However, it will be shown in the next section that as an empirical relation exists between entropy and polarisation energy (heat), a temperature can be calculated. Indeed, one can use the macroscopic definition:\nT ¼ @E @S :(34)",

At 30 K one expects from Boltzmann statistics about 0.1% in the lowest excited vibrational state. Even if the vibrational temperature of the anions were several Kelvin larger than the buffer gas temperature, which may occur due to trap imperfections and radiofrequency heating (see also the discussion in section 3.1) 2 , still no substantial population in any of the excited state is expected. Then at 85 K about 11% of the anions should be found with one of the two torsional modes excited.

This indicates that the gas temperature calculated in §IV A from the ratio of the populations is incorrect, that the vibrational energy of the molecules is not in thermal equilibrium with the temperature of the gas but is more on the order of the temperature of the electrons, which for energies of 0.1 -0.2 eV is roughly 1000 -2000 K. This is not surprising because the molecules are excited to upper levels by electron impact while they are de-excited back to the ground state by collisions with other molecules. In fact, with separate processes, one would be surprised if the excitation and de-excitation rates were equal and thermal equilibrium were achieved.\n\nIn contrast to the very selective population of upper levels by electron impact evident in low pressure spectra, spectra taken at higher pressures show a much more thermal distribution.

For the two-site Holstein model the energy separation (∆E) between two lowest eigen energy levels decreases monotonically with g + and becomes negligibly small at strong coupling 18 . At very low temperatures C v is very small for weak e-ph coupling, as ∆E/k B T is sufficiently large. C v attains a maxima at an intermediate coupling, when ∆E is ∼ 2.58k B T , and becomes very small in the strong coupling region as ∆E → 0. At a higher temperature a higher value of ∆E is required to achieve the maximum value in C v . Since ∆E increases with decreasing g + for the two-site Holstein model, the peak in C v is obtained at a lower value of g + for a higher temperature. With increasing temperature the higher energy states, in addition to the ground and first excited states, have significant contributions to the specific heat. This leads to the absence of the peak and formation of a dip in C v . In Fig. 8 a comparison of the variation of specific heat as a function of g + for the hopping parameters t = 1 and 2.1 is given. In absence of any disorder the energy separation ∆E increases with the increase of the hopping parameter t, hence a shift in the position of the peak in C v is obtained at a higher value of g + .\n\nThe effect of disorder on the specific heat of a polaron is also shown in Fig. 8.

Then, if n 1,1 and n 2,2 are the populations of the (1,1) and (2,2) levels, the collisional balance in the three level system can be written as n 2,2 [C(2, 2; 1, 1) + C(2, 2; 2, 1)] = n 1,1 C(1, 1; 2, 2) (A7)",

For example, the energy difference between the first and second isomers was reduced by 66%, from 1.75 to 0.58 kcal/mol; the energy difference between the second and third isomers increased almost 300%, from 0.1 to 0.27 kcal/mol, as shown in rows one and two of Table 1, respectively. This change (increase/decrease) in energy difference among isomers has an enormous impact on the relative population. Consequently, we deduced that the ZPE inclusion is essential to the isomers' energy ordering and molecular properties. The third row of Table 3 shows the energy order considering the Gibbs free energy computed at 298.15 K; at this temperature, the isomers' energy ordering changes: the second isomers are the putative global minima, and the first isomers have the fifth-lowest energy. Interestingly, this energy ordering occurs at 298.15 K, and it is a function of the temperature, which we discuss later in the relative population section. The fourth row in Table 3 shows the electronic energy considering the ZPE. It follows the same trend in energy ordering when considering the Gibbs free energy, and it is the same putative global minima. The fifth row in Table 3 details the electronic energy. It almost follows the CCSD(T) energies trend, except isomer number 8 takes second place, located at 0.52 kcal/mol above the putative global minima. The sixth, seventh, and eighth rows in Table 3 show the point-group symmetry, electronic ground state, and the lowest vibrational frequency of each isomer, respectively. When we use the Gibbs free energy to energy order the structures, the second isomers change to first place, becoming the lowest-energy structure; the energy ordering changes drastically, whereas the electronic energy follows a similar trend to that of CCSD(T) energy ordering. This shows us that the level of theory and the inclusion of entropy and temperature change the energy ordering and, therefore, the overall molecular properties. Figure 3a shows the most important and dominant T ss1-g point located at 377 K with a relative population of 33%.

Exact stochastic path integral evaluation.As is readily seen, the spectra in Fig. 2a are comprised of two peaks centered around the eigenstates of the total system Hamiltonian. While the intensity of the peak at positive frequencies is nearly independent of temperature, that of the low energy peak steadily decreases and vanishes at the lowest temperature shown of T = 100 K. This is in stark contrast to the behavior expected from an isolated two level system where the emission spectrum can be computed analytically as\nE(ω) = 2 i=1 P i 1 + V ǫ i δ(ω − ǫ i ) ,(32)\nwith the eigenstate energies, ǫ 1,2 = ± √ V 2 + ∆ 2 , V is the electronic coupling, ∆ is the bias, and the eigenstate population, P i = e −βǫ i /Z. As seen from Eq. 32 the spectra are composed of two peaks centered at the eigenfrequencies of the system with intensities that are weighted by the respective Boltzmann populations of the two states. At low temperature the population localizes in the ground state, and the spectrum shifts to the red. In Fig. 2, the opposite occurs and a blue shift is clearly seen with decreasing temperature. This behavior is a result of the strong system bath coupling. To demonstrate this effect more clearly, Fig. 2b displays the reorganization energy dependence of the emission spectra at the lowest temperature shown in Fig. 2a of T = 100\n\nK. Only at very weak coupling, does the spectra resemble that expected for the isolated system from Eq. 32, with the emission dominated by the low energy eigenstate of the system. However, as the coupling increases in Fig. 2b, the weighting of the two peaks is redistributed towards the higher lying eigenstate resulting in a steady shift to the blue. As discussed in papers I and II, the equilibrium state of the total system and bath cannot be written in a factorized form as in Eq. 32, particularly when the temperature is low and the system-bath coupling large, as is the case here. This is the key feature that is responsible for the drastic failure of standard perturbative approximations to the emission spectra as well as the counterintuitive temperature dependence seen in Fig. 2a.\n\n\nB.

Both the 8 Be piece and the 4 He piece of this system have the same binding energies, rms radii, and quadrupole moments as the ground state of 8 Be and the ground state of 4 He respectively. The continuum state solutions show that 12 C has a fission barrier of α emission at around 10 fm separation. The energy of this 8 Be- 4 He system is highest when the separation is about 10 fm and the energy is lowered toward the 8 Be+α threshold as the separation becomes larger. At around 10 fm separation the energy is −57.2 MeV which is 1.3 MeV above the 8 Be+α threshold (−58.5 MeV for L1 parameter). Although the energy is much higher than the empirical value (−84.54 MeV) for the second 0 + state of 12 C, we may relate this continuum region to the 0 + 2 excited state.

This system is an example of a two-state system, i.e., a system within which only two states are significantly populated. At low temperatures, the ground state form predominates. The enthalpy of intramolecular binding is key to this predomination. However, as the temperature rises, the excited state becomes increasingly populated, thereby demonstrating the increasingly important entropic contribution of conformational variety to the system. The statistical thermodynamic description of protein unfolding is far more complex than the four-bead molecular model, but the model does encapsulate one of the reasons as to why proteins unfold upon heating to moderately high temperatures-the large number of excited state conformers. Moreover, just like the model, protein unfolding is, very often, a two-state process. As a consequence, the signal shown in Fig. 1 can be interpreted as showing how the thermal history of the system reflects the changing composition of the aqueous protein system as temperature increases. At low temperatures, the compact native form predominates as the temperature is increased some molecules begin to unfold. The fraction of molecules that have unfolded multiplied by the enthalpy of the unfolding transition provides the basis of the heat signal. Since the enthalpy change is endothermic, the temperature of the sample cell becomes lower than that of the reference cell; and thus, the instrument measures the power needed to raise the temperature to compensate for the temperature difference. This, as we have shown, is easily converted into a molar excess heat capacity.",

Column five of Table 2 shows the percentage at which the energy barrier decreases as a function of temperature and due to the entropic term, considering the energy barrier computed at T = 0 K as the reference. Notably, the composition of the energy barrier is enthalpic and too high in all ranges of temperature. We concluded that the interconversion between enantiomers is thermodynamically unfavorable in all ranges of temperature based on our computations. At high temperatures, the energy barrier is still too high, and the most significant entropic contribution does not exceed 15.53%. The analysis of the results leads to an interesting observation: in Figure 5b, one can see that there is a barrier-barrier temperature point (T bb ) located at 954 K where the energy barriers of both mechanisms are equal. At T bb , the probability that the reaction will take one path or another is 50/50%, which implies that the rates of reaction for both reaction mechanisms are equal to each other.

Our computations showed (with relative population) that the low-symmetry isomers have a higher stability than isomers with high symmetry at high temperatures as a result of the entropic effect.

Finite-size effects in the methane hydrate.and estimate T 3 .For both configurations, with stoichiometric composition, at temperatures below T 3 and with prolonged simulation times, the formation of a methane bubble in the liquid phase can be predicted.The bubble formation condition is always satisfied in stoichiometric systems, regardless of their size.For all runs with a stoichiometric composition of water and methane, the formation of bubbles is expected at the end of the run when few methane molecules remain in the gas phase, as long as the simulation is long enough.Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the formation of the bubble is expected not only in systems satisfying the stoichiometric composition (i.e., when the ratio of molecules of methane in the gas phase to that of water in the liquid phase in the initial configuration is 8/46 , i.e., 0.174) but also in systems with a lower value of this ratio.In fact, in these cases, the formation of the bubble is expected to occur at shorter times.To further investigate this, we have simulated at 290 K direct coexistences of liquid water (1242 molecules) with a gas methane phase with different numbers of methane molecules (i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 400) during 50 ns.The simulations performed applying a pressure of 400 bar in the Np x T ensemble and the interfacial area of the systems was 12.96 nm 2 .We observed the formation of the bubble only in the systems of 50 and 100 methane molecules.Thus, these findings reveal that, in this case, there is a critical thickness of the gas slab of about 0.8 nm (i.e., when the thickness of the gas phase is larger than 0.8 nm no bubble is formed in 50 ns).We have also checked the effect of the interface simulating during 50 ns a system with 5750 water and 1000 methane molecules with an interface of about 35 nm 2 , but we do not observe bubble formation for this simulation time.In any case further work is needed to determine precisely under which conditions the planar water-methane interface is not stable with respect to the formation of a cylindrical or spherical bubble as was done for one component systems in other studies [132][133][134].In fact, in the future, it would also be interesting to study the bubble shape in bigger systems.Table III summarizes the findings for the",

Последний вывод ожидаем, так как следует из характера рассматриваемого явления. Первый, если придерживаться предлагаемой гипотетической модели газонасыщенной нефти, также объясним. Объяснение состоит в том, что при изменении количества растворенного в нефти газа объем оболочки каждой конгломерации также изменяется. При этом изменяется и доля оболочки, подвергающаяся уплотнению со стороны молекул конгломерации. Эта доля по мере насыщения нефти газом уменьшается, так как объеммолекул газа в оболочке возрастает, а радиус действия молекул конгломерации, уплотняющих прилегающие к конгломерации скопления газовых молекул, остается прежним. Это сказывается на способности оболочки сопротивляться действию внешней силы, то есть давления, что влечет за собой изменение коэффициента сжимаемости г в зависимости от газосодержания нефти.",

We take methanol as an example for calculating the ppm (parts-per-million) for each compound. Methanol has a molecular weight MW = 32.04 g/mol and density  = 0.7918 g/cm 3 . The volume of the box is 3,000 cm 3 ; therefore, for example, to get 100 ppm inside the box, from Table 1, we used 0.3 cm 3 of methanol. 3.00 2,000 6.00\n\nThe density of methanol is\nT R MW P    (6)\nWhere:  = the density of the gas of Methanol in g/L, P = the Standard Atmospheric Pressure (in atm) is used as a reference for gas densities and volumes (equal 1 atm), MW = Molecular Weight in g/mol, R = universal gas constant in atm/mol.K (equal 0.0821 atm/mol.K), T = temperature in Kelvin (T K = T C + 273.15). As a result we get d = 1.33 g/L. Mass = v gas *  = v liq *  (7) where v gas is the volume occupied by the gas of methanol which is equal to 0.3*10 -3 l,  is the density of the gas of Methanol as calculated before,  is the constant density of methanol, therefore; v liq = (v gas x ) /   v liq = (0.3 * 10 -3 * 1.33) / 0.7918, the volume (v liq ) is 0.503*10 -6 l which provides 100 ppm of methanol. This means that if we want to get 100 ppm of methanol we must put 0.503 µL of liquid methanol in the box by using the syringe. Table 2 shows different concentrations of Methanol (in ppm) versus its quantities (in µL). \n\n\nResults",

In the literature there are few works devoted to the problem of calculations of molecular excitations of the fullerene [7,8,9,10], but to the best of our knowledge all of them are semiempirical and are based only on singly excited configuration interaction (CI). We reproduce some of their computed levels in Table I. The calculation of Negri et al., Ref. [8], employed a semiempirical (QCFF/π) method, and took into account 196 configuration state functions (CSF). The first excited state (1 3 T 2g ) was found at 2.06 eV, while 1 1 T 1u and 2 1 T 1u levels at 4.08 and 4.53 eV. A PPP-CI (Pariser-Parr-Pople Configuration Interaction) calculation which includes 134 CSF finds first two 1 T 1u levels at 4.00 eV, 4.68 eV and 6.69 eV, with the first excited 3 T 2g level at 2.23 eV. Finally, CNDO/S calculations of Braga et al. based on 808 and 900 configurations predicts that 1 1 T 1u is lowered to 3.4 eV, while the three most intense transitions are at 4.38, 5.24 and 5.78 eV. Unfortunately, all of the CI calculations reported in Refs. [7,8,9,10] are crucially dependent on a number of approximations for matrix elements and therefore cannot be considered as a true ab initio approach.\n\nIn the present study in comparison with Refs. [7,8,9,10] we employ the ab initio treatment, which represents a new level of CI calculations of the fullerene molecule.\n\n\nII. METHOD OF CALCULATION\n\n\nA. Configuration Interaction",

Vibronic spectra\n\nAs a final application, we demonstrate how our hybrid model can be further combined with advanced simulation techniques to obtain accurate yet inexpensive predic-tions of subtle quantum-mechanical effects.We estimate the vibronic spectrum of anthracene via second-order cumulant expansion theory (see Materials and Methods).Within this framework, the vibronic structure of the excitation is encoded by the spectral density.Among the different approaches to compute this quantity [42,43], we rely on the calculation of the autocorrelation function of the excitation energy along an MD trajectory.This dynamical method is typically very accurate [44], and transparently incorporates vibrational information.This is an application where a fast ML model for excited states can make prohibitively-demanding quantum-chemical calculations routine: a single sTDA calculation for anthracene at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP level requires approximately 8 CPU minutes, versus half a second for the hybrid model -a speed-up of three orders of magnitude.",

To generate the input signals for the Fourier transform of the resonances on a flat, nondecaying background, we considered ratios of the results of two consecutive angular levels of π electrons for both the fullerene molecules. Fourier magnitudes of these ratios are calculated by using the fast Fourier transform algorithm after applying an appropriate window function to reduce spurious structures. While such windowing adds some extra width to the \"frequency\" peaks, it practically does not compromise the peak positions. The results are presented in Fig. 5 in reciprocal (radial) coordinates. All the curves in Fig. 5(b) exhibit strong peaks located around the diameter d c for each of C 60 and C 240 , as expected from our model equation, Eq. (28), that includes the function cos(Qd c − ℓ t π + η r π); the transform magnitudes are insensitive to phase-shifts connected to ℓ t and η r . To guide the eye, LDA radial potentials and positron scattering potentials for homo captures are plotted in Fig. 5(a). Notice, the small, systematic offset of the peaks towards lower values with the increasing angular momentum. This is even another signature of the fact that the continuum waves are Coulomb distorted and so are more complicated than simple plane waves used in our model analysis.

Abundances of fullerenes (% of gas-phase carbon locked in species), derived from emission or absorption measurements in star-forming regions and in the diffuse ISM and evolved stars.  Bakes & Tielens (1995) computed the charge distribution for the specific case of C 60 in the diffuse ISM and find that ∼ 30% is anionic, ∼ 60% is neutral, and ∼ 10% is cationic. These numbers are compatible with the absolute abundances summarized in Table 2, which point to a (not very restrictive) C 60 over C + 60 ratio ranging between 0.3 to 6. C − 60 is expected to be abundant in models and hence could be searched for in space. The strongest vibrational bands of C − 60 are around 17.5 and 7.3 µm (Kupser et al. 2008). The 17.5 µm band is difficult to identify because of the presence of PAH emission at 17.4 µm. A band at 7.3 µm seems present in the spectrum of the Chamaeleon line of sight, however this region of the spectrum is quite noisy and higher sensitivity data will be required to confirm this. Observations of diffuse lines of sight with the James Webb Space Telescope, which has the sensitivity to detect C 60 and C + 60 as well as tracers of the diffuse ISM should allow us to conduct more detailed studies on the charge balance of C 60 in the diffuse ISM. Laboratory studies to quantify key molecular parameters involved, such as the electron recombination rate of C + 60 , are also required. Finally, the detection of C 60 IR emission bands in the diffuse ISM suggests that the electronic transitions of this molecules could be identified in absorption. However, given their low oscillator strengths, this will be challenging as we illustrate in Appendix E.\n\n\nConclusion",

[22].Thus, Onoe et al. first observed the geometrical curvature effects on electronic states that have been a big puzzle since 1950s.This is a novel property different from that of fullerenes, CNTs, and graphene.",

The models also roughly represent a gradient of increasing complexity, from simplified models that do not explicitly include long-range electrostatics, to models that have partial charges and moments of inertia informed by first-principles calculations.",

Recent theoretical work indicates that C + 60 undergoes a Jahn-Teller distortion from the D 5d minimum such that the upper 2 E 1g state is split into two components with A g and B g symmetry (in C 2h ), leading to two transitions separated by 41 cm −1 (see Figure 3 in [34]). Transitions from the A u ground electronic state to these components are believed to be responsible for the absorption bands of C + 60 at 10,378 and 10,438 cm −1 .\n\nAn example spectrum from previous experiments on a sublimed sample of C 60 is presented in Figure 2 (top trace). These data are those reported in [35], and show the two strongest absorption bands in the electronic spectrum near 10,438 and 10,378 cm −1 . These 12 C + 60 − He absorptions have widths of approximately 2 cm −1 which is caused by the ∼2 ps lifetime of the excited electronic state. Also shown in Figure 2 (bottom) are data reported here for 12 C + 60 − He following helium tagging of m/z = 720 ions produced by laser vaporisation of graphite. The spectrum was recorded by monitoring the attenuation (1-N i /N 0 ) of ions with m/z = 724. As is evident from inspection of Figure 2, the two sets of data are equivalent, with absorption band profiles that are almost superimposable, aside small differences due to the signal-to-noise ratio.

Even if I assume that the data in Table III are given in atomic units ( for all molecular properties studied for each molecule are also listed (file \"errors.dat\"), these data can be easily imported by the interested Reader into a spreadsheet and analyzed in many ways! Because this first-generation parametrization of the new model is based on the reference data from CCSD calculation with an entry-level basis set, the atomization energies would agree quite poorely with the experimental data, but the more chemically-interesting reaction energies should already be meaningful. I find the reproduction of molecular geometries, especially for weakly-bound intermolecular complexes, to be a greater challenge than even the accurate total energies for typical molecules, so my parametrization functional of Section IIC is constructed to give these properties a greater boost, as discussed in the text.\n\nTo let anyone see how the model works for any molecular system of interest, I have now included the binary executable code of my program into the Supplementary Information, as noted above in the answer to the comments of Reviewer #1.\n\nThe EPAPS material is also essentially inaccessible to me.

Truly accurate positions, oscillator strengths, and band widths have not yet been determined for the electronic absorption bands of neutral C 60 in the gas phase at low temperatures, which could therefore be shifted by several Å with respect to these recommended values. We use the following relation between column density, N, and equivalent width, EW in Å (Wilson & Merrill 1937):\nEW = N f λ 2 1.13 × 10 20 , (E.1)\nwhere λ is the band position (in Å) and f its oscillator strength (cf. For a Gaussian profile the central depth, τ 0 , of the line centre relative to the local continuum, is given as\nτ 0 = EW 1.571 × FWHM . (E.2)",

The 2 B g ← X 2 A u and 2 A g ← X 2 A u electronic band origins near 10,378 and 10,438 cm −1 were detected by messenger spectroscopy, and found to be consistent with results of experiments using a sublimed sample of C 60 , indicating that of the C + 60 ions tagged with helium in the trap (m/z = 724), the (slightly distorted) D 5d /C 2h soccer ball isomer dominates. Although the formation of the Buckminsterfullerene cation C + 60 by laser vaporisation is well established, the presented data demonstrate that this synthesis route provides a sufficient yield of ions to allow spectroscopic characterisation in an ion trap. These proof-of-principle results are a first step toward obtaining the electronic absorptions of other fullerene cations and analogues that are sought after in the context of the enigmatic diffuse interstellar bands. It is thus anticipated that the adopted approach of combining laser vaporisation synthesis with spectroscopic characterisation in a cryogenic trap can enable data on a variety of structures that have not been produced in macroscopic quantities to be recorded at low temperature to enable direct comparison with astronomical observations.

The complete database would be the most useful but a relevant subset covering a wide range of chemical problems should also be sufficient. Mean errors, mean absolute errors and maximal errors would show bias, average accuracy and worst case accuracy of the method and could be compared to some DFT or wavefunction-based methods. Also, it would show how well the method is transferable to systems not used in the training set. The errors in the reaction energies from the Supporting Information are very good indeed, usually below 1 kcal/mol. Of course, some deterioration of the accuracy is inevitable, partly due to rather limited accuracy of the training set, however it would show how useful is the method at this stage. Thanks to the Reviewer for drawing our attention to the GMTKN30 database built up by the outstanding researchers from the Organic Chemistry Institute of the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Germany. I have visualized all 1218 molecular geometries from the GMTKN30 databaseihre Bilder habe ich vor mein geistiges Auge gestellt -and my trained eye tells me that there is likely less diversity in that set than in my own training set of 5581 molecules! Yes, there are some bigger molecules among those 1218, but they are built up from some rather common fragments. As I noted before, the Calculations (Section III) of my work were intended mainly to show the parametrizability of the new model and the more extended tests should be done and reported separately, preferably by a third party.The first-generation parametrization of the model reported in this work is based on the reference data from the CCSD method with an entry-level basis set, so I would expect the atomization energies (and even the bond-breaking reaction energies) to agree rather poorly with any complete-basis-set extrapolated CCSD(T) or experimental thermochemical data.Other molecular",

Quantum mechanically, of course, this system has no bound states, only metastable states, which decay unimolecularly by tunneling through the barriers. Waite and Miller 5 have calculated the energies and lifetimes (the inverse of the unimolecular decay rate) of the individual metastable quantum states of the system, and Figure 1 shows a sample of their results. Because of the C3 symmetry of the system, the calculation is carried out separately for states of A symmetry (solid circles in Figure 1), A2 symmetry (open squares), and E symmetry (open circles). The solid line in Figure 1 is the result given by standard statistical theory, i.e., microcanonical transition state theory, 6\nk(E)= 3 P[E-Vo-(n +1/2)hto*]/[2,rrhp(E)] (2.2)\nHere P is the one-dimensional tunneling probability as a function of the energy along the reaction coordinate, to*= x/g is the frequency of the \"activated complex\", p(E) the density of reactant states, and the factor of 3 is due to the three equivalent transition states. The first thing that one observes in Figure 1 is that the statistical approximation to the rate constants (i.e., Eq. 2.2) is quite good for the A1 and E states, even in the low energy region below --0.11\n\nwhere the classical mechanics is essentially completely quasi-periodic.\n\nOn closer inspection one does see some mode-specificity in the A and E states, i.e., some dispersion about the average curve, but this is more pronounced at higher rather than lower energies. To the extent that there is any trend at all, therefore, it is opposite to what one would predict on the basis of the quasi-periodic/chaotic character of the classical mechanics. The appearance of some degree of modespecificity at high energies is perhaps understandable in that even if the various degrees of freedom are strongly coupled, states with most of the energy in the reaction coordinate will decay essentially instantaneously (i.e., within one vibrational period) while those with most of the energy in inactive modes will require at least a few vibrations for the energy to flow into the reaction coordinate.",
