To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10 keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000 nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions.

The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$. The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

The calculated electronic band structure and the density of states indicate that the Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$ and Li$_{2}$RhSi$_{2}$ compounds are in metallic character. Mechanical properties such as elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature were calculated for these compounds. The calculated results suggest that the compounds are mechanically stable and behave in a ductile manner. The phonon spectra have no imaginary frequency, which proves that these compounds are dynamically stable. Electron--phonon coupling parameters confirm that they are weak--coupling superconductors. Although the influence of spin--orbit coupling in superconductivity is not significant for these compounds, it has a very small influence on electronic structure for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$. The calculated critical temperature ($T_c^{\\mu^{\\star}=0.11}$) values of 3.29 K for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$ and 2.82 K for Li$_{2}$RhSi$_{2}$ agree well with experimental estimates.",

Quantum chemical methods can deliver accurate calculations of UV-visible absorption spectra, but they are computationally expensive, especially for large systems or when one computes line shapes from thermal averages. Here, we present an approach to predict UV-visible absorption spectra of solvated aromatic molecules by quantum chemistry (QC) and machine learning (ML). We show that a ML model, trained on the high-level QC calculation of the excitation energy of a set of aromatic molecules, can accurately predict the line shape of the lowest-energy UV-visible absorption band of several related molecules with less than 0.1 eV deviation with respect to reference experimental spectra. Applying linear decomposition analysis on the excitation energies, we unveil that our ML models probe vertical excitations of these aromatic molecules primarily by learning the atomic environment of their phenyl rings, which align with the physical origin of the π →π* electronic transition. Our study provides an effective workflow that combines ML with quantum chemical methods to accelerate the calculations of UV-visible absorption spectra for various molecular systems.",

The latter has been difficult to determine due to a cancellation in changes of E_{b} and E_{g}, resulting in little change in optical transition energy at different carrier densities. Here, we quantify band-gap renormalization in macroscopic single crystal MoS_{2} monolayers on SiO_{2} using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At an excitation density above the Mott threshold, E_{g} decreases by as much as 360 meV. We compare the carrier density-dependent E_{g} with previous theoretical calculations and show the necessity of knowing both doping and excitation densities in quantifying the band gap.",

It introduces the absorption enhancement parameter ${B}$B, which quantifies the asymmetry of photon path lengths between the solid material and the pores and can be derived from the absorption coefficient $\\mu _a$μ<suba</sub of the material. Hence ${\\Phi}$Φ can be derived from combined measurements of $n_{\\textrm {eff}}$n<subeff</sub and $\\mu _a$μ<suba</sub. The theory is validated against laboratory measurements and numerical experiments, thus solving a long-standing issue in optical porosimetry. This suggests that optical measurements can be used to estimate physical porosity with an accuracy better than 10$\\%$%.",

In the model there are two unknown functions: One is $\\sigma(r,t)$ which is the nutrient concentration at time $t$ and radius $r$, and the other one is $R(t)$ which is the outer tumor radius at time $t$. Since $R(t)$ is unknown and varies with time, this problem has a free boundary. Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$.

Mechanical properties such as elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature were calculated for these compounds. The calculated results suggest that the compounds are mechanically stable and behave in a ductile manner. The phonon spectra have no imaginary frequency, which proves that these compounds are dynamically stable. Electron--phonon coupling parameters confirm that they are weak--coupling superconductors. Although the influence of spin--orbit coupling in superconductivity is not significant for these compounds, it has a very small influence on electronic structure for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$.

An explicit treatment of continuum effects is found to be indispensable.

When the model includes correlation among data, such as phylogenetic models and mixed models, defining an $R^{2}$ faces two conceptual problems. (i) It is unclear how to measure the variance explained by predictor (independent) variables when the model contains covariances. (ii) Researchers may want the $R^{2}$ to include the variance explained by the covariances by asking questions such as \"How much of the data is explained by phylogeny?\" Here, I investigated three $R^{2}$s for phylogenetic and mixed models. $R^{2}_{resid}$ is an extension of the ordinary least-squares $R^{2}$ that weights residuals by variances and covariances estimated by the model; it is closely related to $R^{2}_{glmm}$ presented by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013. A general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear mixed-effects models. Methods Ecol. Evol. 4:133-142). $R^{2}_{pred}$ is based on predicting each residual from the fitted model and computing the variance between observed and predicted values. $R^{2}_{lik}$ is based on the likelihood of fitted models, and therefore, reflects the amount of information that the models contain. These three $R^{2}$s are formulated as partial $R^{2}$s, making it possible to compare the contributions of predictor variables and variance components (phylogenetic signal and random effects) to the fit of models. Because partial $R^{2}$s compare a full model with a reduced model without components of the full model, they are distinct from marginal $R^{2}$s that partition additive components of the variance. I assessed the properties of the $R^{2}$s for phylogenetic models using simulations for continuous and binary response data (phylogenetic generalized least squares and phylogenetic logistic regression). Because the $R^{2}$s are designed broadly for any model for correlated data, I also compared $R^{2}$s for linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models. $R^{2}_{resid}$, $R^{2}_{pred}$, and $R^{2}_{lik}$ all have similar performance in describing the variance explained by different components of models. However, $R^{2}_{pred}$ gives the most direct answer to the question of how much variance in the data is explained by a model. $R^{2}_{resid}$ is most appropriate for comparing models fit to different data sets, because it does not depend on sample sizes. And $R^{2}_{lik}$ is most appropriate to assess the importance of different components within the same model applied to the same data, because it is most closely associated with statistical significance tests.",

In the experiment a particle's path through the slits is determined by measuring the Coulomb field that it produces at large distances; under these conditions the interference pattern must be suppressed. The key is that, as the particle's trajectory is bent in diffraction by the slits, it must radiate and the radiation must carry away phase information. Thus, the radiation field must be a quantized dynamical degree of freedom. However, if one similarly tries to determine the path of a massive particle through an inferometer by measuring the Newtonian gravitational potential the particle produces, the interference pattern would have to be finer than the Planck length and thus indiscernible.

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

Electrons in the valence s, p, d, and f subshells were included in the active space. The resulting electronic potential energy curves are largely repulsive. The chemical bonding is ionic in character with negligible participation of 5f electrons. The molecular f-f spectroscopy of AmCl(+) arises essentially from an in situ Am(2+) core with states slightly redshifted by the presence of chloride ion. Am(+)+Cl asymptotes which give rise to the few attractive potential energy curves can be predicted by analysis of the f-f spectroscopy of isolated Am(+) and Am(2+). The attractive curves have substantial binding energies, on the order of 75-80 kcal/mol, and are noticeably lower than recent indirect measurements on the isovalent EuCl(+). An independent empirical correlation supports the predicted reduction in AmCl(+) binding energy. The energies of the repulsive curves are strongly dependent on the selection of the underlying atomic orbitals while the energies of the attractive curves do not display this sensitivity.

In this manuscript, we report a complementary version for FCCS method to simulate both of the first symmetric and antisymmetric spatial electronic states of two-electron systems. Moreover, the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process is employed to reach the excited states of the system. We apply this FCCS method and the original coupled coherent state method to simulate the energy of different electronic states of H2 and H2+, respectively.

The pair potential is obtained through space integrations for the energy density functions of electron density. We present molecular dynamics simulations for the ion motion on the basis of the calculated pair potentials in a wide regime of density and temperature. As an example, hot and dense Al and Fe plasmas are simulated to give the equation of state and ion-ion pair distribution function. The results are in agreement with those of other theoretical models.",

This dependence was also supported by inspection of profiles of deviation between CBS estimated nuclear shieldings and shieldings obtained with the significantly smaller basis sets pcS-2 and aug-cc-pVTZ-J for the selected set of 37 calculation methods. It was possible to formulate a practical approach of estimating the values of isotropic nuclear magnetic shielding constants at the CCSD(T)/CBS and MP2/CBS levels from affordable CCSD(T)/pcS-2, MP2/pcS-2 and DFT/CBS calculations with pcS-n basis sets.

The optimization problem coincides with that of the complete active space SCF method (CASSCF), while OptOrbFCI is algorithmically quite different. OptOrbFCI effectively finds an optimal rotation matrix via solving a constrained optimization problem directly to compress the orbitals of large basis sets to one with a manageable size, conducts FCI calculations only on rotated orbital sets, and produces a variational ground-state energy and its wave function. Coupled with coordinate descent full configuration interaction (CDFCI), we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method on the carbon dimer and nitrogen dimer under basis sets up to cc-pV5Z. We also benchmark the binding curve of the nitrogen dimer under the cc-pVQZ basis set with 28 selected orbitals, which provide consistently lower ground-state energies than the FCI results under the cc-pVDZ basis set.

CIC counts were correlated weakly with the number of CD34+ cells per L of blood processed in the apheresis product (Pearson rank correlation analysis; r=0.357, p&lt;0.0001). When a level of 1.7 x 10(9) CICs per L was selected as a cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity for collecting more than 20 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per L of blood processed were 63.6 and 77.5 percent, respectively. The present study suggests that the number of CICs in PB may estimate the number of CD34+ cells collected. The data indicate that CIC counts above 1.7 x 10(9) per L can be used as a good predictor for PBPC collections containing more than 20 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per L of blood processed in a single apheresis procedure.",

Within the polarization and correlation-consistent basis set series, triple-ζ basis sets are the smallest that can reliably capture Estat. The cc-pVTZ basis set performs particularly well, recovering Estat to chemical accuracy for all atoms and molecules in our data set.

Basis sets without polarization functions are incapable of accurately recovering Estat. Basis sets with a near-complete set of s, p, and d functions can approach chemical accuracy in maximum absolute error.

Our initial implementation is based on a multiheaded Shavitt graph approach that allows for the efficient simultaneous computation of entire blocks of Hamiltonian matrix elements. Two algorithms are implemented. The SO-GCF method expands the spin-orbit wave function in the basis of GCFs and results in a Hamiltonian matrix of dimension N(dim)=N(alpha)((S(max) + 1)(2) - S(min)(2)). N(alpha) is the number of sets of nonlinear arc factor parameters, and S(min) and S(max) are respectively the minimum and maximum values of an allowed spin range in the wave function expansion. The SO-SCGCF (SO spin contracted GCF) method expands the wave function in a basis of spin contracted functions and results in a Hamiltonian matrix of dimension N(dim) = N(alpha). For a given N(alpha) and spin range, the number of parameters defining the wave function is the same in the two methods after accounting for normalization. The full Hamiltonian matrix construction with both approaches scales formally as O(N(alpha)(2)omegan(4)) for n molecular orbitals. The omega factor depends on the complexity of the Shavitt graph and includes factors such as the number of electrons, N, and the number of interacting spin states. Timings are given for Hamiltonian matrix construction for both algorithms for a range of wave functions with up to N = n = 128 and that correspond to an underlying linear full-CI CSF expansion dimension of over 10(75) CSFs, many orders of magnitude larger than can be considered using traditional CSF-based spin-orbit CI approaches. For Hamiltonian matrix construction, the SO-SCGCF method is slightly faster than the SO-GCF method for a given N(alpha) and spin range. The SO-GCF method may be more suitable for describing multiple states, whereas the SO-SCGCF method may be more suitable for describing single states.",

The fundamentals of halogen bonding have been studied extensively with high-accuracy computational methods. Due to its non-covalency, the use of triple-zeta (or larger) basis sets is often recommended when studying halogen bonding. However, in the large systems often encountered in supramolecular chemistry and biosciences, large basis sets can make the calculations far too slow. Therefore, small basis sets, which would combine high computational speed and high accuracy, are in great demand. This study focuses on comparing how well density functional theory (DFT) methods employing small, double-zeta basis sets can estimate halogen-bond strengths. Several methods with triple-zeta basis sets are included for comparison. Altogether, 46 DFT methods were tested using two data sets of 18 and 33 halogen-bonded complexes for which the complexation energies have been previously calculated with the high-accuracy CCSD(T)/CBS method. The DGDZVP basis set performed far better than other double-zeta basis sets, and it even outperformed the triple-zeta basis sets.

In the model there are two unknown functions: One is $\\sigma(r,t)$ which is the nutrient concentration at time $t$ and radius $r$, and the other one is $R(t)$ which is the outer tumor radius at time $t$. Since $R(t)$ is unknown and varies with time, this problem has a free boundary. Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$. In the case where $\\alpha$ is a constant, the existence of steady-state solutions is discussed and the stability of the steady-state solutions is proved. In another case where $\\alpha$ depends on time, we show that $R(t)$ will be also bounded if $\\alpha(t)$ is bounded and some sufficient conditions for the disappearance of tumors are given.",

We here derive these hydrodynamic equations with explicit calculation of the diffusion and noise terms in a one-dimensional model.

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector.

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

This frequency shift arises from interaction between the modes, and its value has been used to determine the average coupling between neighboring methanol molecules. We find a rms coupling strength of 46+/-1 cm(-1), larger than can be explained from a transition-dipole coupling mechanism, suggesting that hydrogen-bond mediated interactions also contribute to the coupling. The most important aspect of simultaneous vibrational absorption is that it allows for a quantitative investigation of hydrogen-bond cooperativity. We derive the extent to which the hydrogen-bond strengths of neighboring molecules are correlated by comparing the line shape of the absorption band caused by simultaneous absorption with that of the fundamental transition.

Our analysis employs the state-of-the-art semilocal two-nucleon potentials and takes into account two-body contributions to the charge density operators up to fifth order in the chiral expansion. The strength of the fifth-order short-range two-body contribution to the charge density operator is adjusted to the experimental data on the deuteron charge form factor. A detailed error analysis is performed by propagating the statistical uncertainties of the low-energy constants entering the two-nucleon potentials and by estimating errors from the truncation of the chiral expansion as well as from uncertainties in the nucleon form factors. Using the predicted value for the deuteron structure radius together with the very accurate atomic data for the difference of the deuteron and proton charge radii we, for the first time, extract the charge radius of the neutron from light nuclei. The extracted value reads r_{n}^{2}=-0.106_{-0.005}^{+0.007}  fm^{2} and its magnitude is about 1.7σ smaller than the current value given by the Particle Data Group.

In the model there are two unknown functions: One is $\\sigma(r,t)$ which is the nutrient concentration at time $t$ and radius $r$, and the other one is $R(t)$ which is the outer tumor radius at time $t$. Since $R(t)$ is unknown and varies with time, this problem has a free boundary. Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$. In the case where $\\alpha$ is a constant, the existence of steady-state solutions is discussed and the stability of the steady-state solutions is proved. In another case where $\\alpha$ depends on time, we show that $R(t)$ will be also bounded if $\\alpha(t)$ is bounded and some sufficient conditions for the disappearance of tumors are given.",

We design and simulate two kinds of devices based on air and ${{\\rm Si}_3}{{\\rm N}_4}$ up-claddings to show the feasibility of broadening the bandwidth of chiral silicon photonic circuits by using fork-type inverse tapers. Numerical results show that the bandwidth can approach 70 nm under high directionality of above 0.90. This broadband chiral coupling via the new phase synchronizing technique with fork-type inverse tapers may pave the way to develop on-chip spin photonics or polarization-based photonic integrated devices.",

The metal artifact reduction (MAR) algorithm was used in the last scan $(C{T}_{metal+ MAR})$. The MonoE-CT images of 40 keV and 80 keV were reconstructed. Finally, the single-energy CT method (SECT) and the dual-energy CT method (DECT) were used to calculate the $SP{R}_w$. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the $SP{R}_w$ of the inner layer inserts calculated by the SECT method were 3.19%, 13.88% and 2.71%, corresponding to $C{T}_{no\\ metal}$, $C{T}_{metal}$ and $C{T}_{metal+ MAR}$, respectively. For the outer layer inserts, the MAE of $SP{R}_w$ were 3.43%, 5.42% and 2.99%, respectively. Using the DECT method, the MAE of the $SP{R}_w$ of the inner layer inserts was 1.30%, 3.69% and 1.46% and the MAE of the outer layer inserts- was 1.34%, 1.36% and 1.05%. The studies shows that, compared with the SECT method, the accuracy of the DECT method in predicting the $SP{R}_w$ of a material is more robust to the presence of metal. Using the MAR algorithm when performing CT scans can further improve the accuracy of predicting the SPR of materials in the presence of metal.",

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

The calculated electronic band structure and the density of states indicate that the Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$ and Li$_{2}$RhSi$_{2}$ compounds are in metallic character. Mechanical properties such as elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature were calculated for these compounds. The calculated results suggest that the compounds are mechanically stable and behave in a ductile manner. The phonon spectra have no imaginary frequency, which proves that these compounds are dynamically stable. Electron--phonon coupling parameters confirm that they are weak--coupling superconductors. Although the influence of spin--orbit coupling in superconductivity is not significant for these compounds, it has a very small influence on electronic structure for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$. The calculated critical temperature ($T_c^{\\mu^{\\star}=0.11}$) values of 3.29 K for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$ and 2.82 K for Li$_{2}$RhSi$_{2}$ agree well with experimental estimates.",

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

There is a great need to incorporate asymptomatic transmissions into traditional modeling of infectious diseases and to study how asymptomatic transmissions shift epidemic dynamics. In this work, we propose a compartmental model with asymptomatic transmissions for waterborne infectious diseases. We conduct a detailed analysis and numerical study with shigellosis data. Two parameters, the proportion $p$ of asymptomatic infected individuals and the proportion $k$ of asymptomatic infectious individuals who can asymptomatically transmit diseases, play major rules in the epidemic dynamics. The basic reproduction number $\\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is a decreasing function of parameter $p$ when parameter $k$ is smaller than a critical value while $\\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $p$ when $k$ is greater than the critical value. $\\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $k$ for any value of $p$. When $\\mathscr{R}_{0}$ passes through 1 as $p$ or $k$ varies, the dynamics of epidemics is shifted. If asymptomatic transmissions are not counted, $\\mathscr{R}_{0}$ will be underestimated while the final size may be overestimated or underestimated.

This model suffers two deficiencies: (a) it does not account for experimental entropy differences of +/-2% among elemental liquids and (b) it implies a value of zero for the transit contribution to internal energy. The purpose of this paper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for entropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of +/-0.1% to the available experimental high-temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two nuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution S_{vib}(T/theta_{0}) , where T is temperature and theta_{0} is the vibrational characteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution S_{tr}(T/theta_{tr}) , where theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each liquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the liquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the V-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to internal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived in a single formula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike. An ab initio calculation of theta_{0} , based on density-functional theory, is reported for liquid Na and Cu. Comparison of these calculations with the above analysis of experimental entropy data provides verification of V-T theory. In view of the present results, techniques currently being applied in ab initio simulations of liquid properties can be employed to advantage in the further testing and development of V-T theory.",

Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$. In the case where $\\alpha$ is a constant, the existence of steady-state solutions is discussed and the stability of the steady-state solutions is proved. In another case where $\\alpha$ depends on time, we show that $R(t)$ will be also bounded if $\\alpha(t)$ is bounded and some sufficient conditions for the disappearance of tumors are given.",

This is demonstrated for the low-temperature hydrogen abstraction reaction c-C_{3}H_{2}^{+}+H_{2}, where excitation of the ion into the ν_{7} antisymmetric C-H stretching mode decreased the reaction rate coefficient toward the products c-C_{3}H_{3}^{+}+H.

This discovery enables high-resolution vibrational action spectroscopy for c-C_{3}H_{2}^{+} and other molecular ions with similar reaction pathways.

In particular, they allow for a bias-free calculation of the moment of a nuclear explosion, based solely on a measurement of the produced activity ratio of (95)Zr and (95)Nb in a finite time interval. Also uncertainty propagation factors are presented, which relate the relative uncertainty on the nuclear decay data and activity ratio measurements with the relative uncertainty on the elapsed time. This allows for the calculation of an uncertainty budget, without the need for Monte Carlo simulations. The equations are applied to a set of measurement data and consistency is demonstrated. ",

We test the accuracy of the pair density matrix and analyze the dependence on the system size, on the time step of the path integral, and on the type of nodal surface. We calculate the equation of state and compare with other models for hydrogen valid in this regime. Further, we characterize the state of hydrogen and describe the changes from a plasma to an atomic and molecular liquid by analyzing the pair correlation functions and estimating the number of atoms and molecules present.",

We first show the existence of traveling wave solutions with zero chemical diffusion in $ \\mathbb{R} $. We then show the existence of traveling wave solutions with small chemical diffusion by the geometric singular perturbation theory and establish the zero diffusion limit of traveling wave solutions. Furthermore, we show that the traveling wave solutions are linearly unstable in the Sobolev space $ H^1(\\mathbb{R}) \\times H^2(\\mathbb{R}) $ by the spectral analysis. Finally we use numerical simulations to illustrate the stabilization of traveling wave profiles with fast decay initial data and numerically demonstrate the effect of system parameters on the wave propagation dynamics.",
