Nowadays, this wavelength is called the de Broglie wavelength. For example, the electrons in a CRT display have a De Broglie wavelength of about 10\u221213 m. To prevent the wave function for such a particle being spread over all space, de Broglie proposed using wave packets to represent particles that are localized in space.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

For a critical look on (further) approximations made within the TTM, which we test here, a few details should be mentioned. Notably, the C el,ph in Eqs. (2) and (3) are electron and phonon heat capacities, \u03ba el is the electronic heat conductivity, and g is the electron-phonon-coupling constant. The choice of the latter is described in Appendix B. The phonon heat capacity C ph is calculated using the Debye model [36] for the Cu crystal, also described in Appendix B. The T el dependence of the electronic heat capacity C el is usually approximated in a free-electron, Sommerfeld model as linear,\nC el (T el ) = \u03b3 el T el ,(4)",

Early twentieth century scientists theorized ways of getting around the limitations of the relatively large wavelength of visible light (wavelengths of 400\u2013700 nanometers) by using electrons. Like all matter, electrons have both wave and particle properties (as theorized by Louis-Victor de Broglie), and their wave-like properties mean that a beam of electrons can be focused and diffracted much like light can. The wavelength of electrons is related to their kinetic energy via the de Broglie equation, which says that the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum. Taking into account relativistic effects (as in a TEM an electron's velocity is a substantial fraction of the speed of light, c) the wavelength is",

Anomalies in vibronic structures of the 4 (1)Sigma(+) and 5 (1)Sigma(+) states are understood by comparison with high-level ab initio calculations currently available.

Uniform volume compression through hydrostatic high-pressure applications could decrease the energy gap between the valence and core bands, potentially shifting the CL emission wavelength to the ultraviolet (UV) region from 200 nm (6.2 eV) to 300 nm (4.1 eV). The ability to tune and shift the CL emission to UV wavelengths allows for the detection of the CL emission using UV-sensitive photodetectors in ambient atmosphere instead of highly specialized vacuum UV detectors operating in vacuum while maintaining the intrinsically fast CL decay times, thereby opening up new possibilities for KMgF as a fast-response scintillator.",

Here, to design low work function materials, we perform first-principles calculations on selected materials of transition metal dichalcogenide as substrates and alkali metals as adsorbates. The work function of our selected materials has a dip ubiquitously independent of the true binding distances of the adsorbates and exhibits contrasting behavior between empty d-shell elements (K, Rb, and Cs) and the others (Li and Na). We show that the interaction of empty d-orbitals of alkali metals and lone pair electrons of chalcogen is a key to the behavior of the work function. From calculated key parameters that determine the work function, we find that, regardless of the amount of charge transfer, K on WTe<sub2</sub induces the largest surface dipole moment, which consequently makes the surface work function of as small as 0.8\u2009eV, the smallest reported to date, and that the work function is lowered further to 0.7\u2009eV by lattice strains.

Expressed as a function of E(F), Fermi energy, and varphi, work function of the components of interest, equations of spectral, ( partial differentialdelta/ partial differentialE(k)), and angular, ( partial differentialdelta/ partial differentialalpha) distributions of the emitted SEs permit to evaluate k(alpha) and k(varphi) for Au and Si. It has been established that collected SE spectra, partial differentialdelta(alpha)/ partial differentialE(k), are distorted with respect to the emitted and fraction k(alpha) is material dependent for a solid angle of detection Omega degrees less than 2pi (or maximum semi-apex angle alpha(max)&lt;90 degrees ) In particular, for coaxial detections around the normal incident beam the detected fraction of SEs from Au, k(alpha)(Au), is slightly larger than that for Si, k(alpha)(Si). For simple geometries in the vacuum gap, similar investigations show that parameter k(phi) is also larger for gold than for n-doped Si as well as for p-doped Si with respect to n-doped Si.

The work function changes observed following potassium deposition on a clean Rh(111) surface were reported previously [49]. The work function of Rh decreased linearly with K exposure up to \u0398K ~ 0.15, (\u0394\u03d5 = \u22123.5 eV. Further K deposition led to a slight increase (0.5 eV) in (\u0394\u03d5. The large linear decrease in the work function at low potassium coverages indicates the formation of a species with high dipole moment; the formation of an ionic K. Above \u0398K = 0.15, a strong dipole-dipole depolarization starts to compensate the effect of the increasing K concentration, (formation of metallic potassium). Independently of the potassium coverage the adsorption of FA at 300 K resulted in work function increases ( Figure 5A). The extent of increase is proportional with the K coverage. Heating of the coadsorbed layer resulted in a complex picture ( Figure 5B). A decrease in the work function corresponds to the desorption and decomposition of adsorbed HCOOH species. Above 600 K the work function started to increase slowly. The original value for the clean Rh surface was attained only above 900-1000 K. \n\n\nWork Function (\u2206\u03c6) and UPS Measurements",

In a dark state, the hydroxyl group of the chromophore is deprotonated and forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr42 and Glu46. Either removal of a hydrogen bond with Tyr42 or addition of chaotropes such as thiocyanate produces a blue-shifted species called an intermediate wavelength form, in which absorption maximum ranges from 355 to 400 nm. To examine the structural origin of the intermediate wavelength form, we have performed resonance Raman investigations of wild-type PYP and some mutants (Tyr42 --&gt; Ala, Tyr42 --&gt; Phe, Glu46 --&gt; Gln, and Thr50 --&gt; Val) in the presence or absence of potassium thiocyanate. These studies show that the chromophore of the intermediate wavelength form is protonated, implying an increase in a pK(a) of the chromophore. Hence, the removal of the hydrogen bond between Tyr42 and chromophore or partial protein denaturation in the presence of thiocyanate results in a spectral blue-shift. Quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory further support the idea that the pK(a) of the chromophore is increased by removing a hydrogen bond or by increasing the dielectric constant in the vicinity of the chromophore.",

                    "contents": "Quantitative calculations of the non-radiative rate of phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes.\nIt has recently been proposed that the dominant non-radiative decay mechanism in blue Ir(iii) phosphors at room temperature is due to the low-lying non-radiative metal-centred triplet states. These are populated thermally via an activated transition from the highly radiative metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer states that are initially populated due to intersystem crossing following the radiative or electronic excitation of the phosphor. We apply transition state theory to quantitatively calculate the non-radiative decay rate of a family of Ir(iii) complexes containing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. We compare the, computationally inexpensive, one-dimensional theory with the, more accurate, multi-dimensional theory. Both methods find a non-radiative rate with an Arrhenius form (knr = kae-\u0394E/kBT). The pre-exponential factors, ka, and activation energies, \u0394E, are evaluated via density functional theory (DFT). The multi-dimensional theory shows that there is an order of magnitude variation in ka within this family of materials (between 3 \u00d7 1011 s-1 and 3 \u00d7 1012 s-1). This is not captured by the one-dimensional theory, which predicts very uniform rate constants in the middle of this range (\u223c1012 s-1). Nevertheless, the activated process involved, and the linear relationship between ka and knr, mean that ka plays a subtle role in determining knr. Consistent with this we find that both methods capture the trend observed experimentally in the non-radiative rates. Furthermore, the magnitude of the calculated knr is similar in both methods and in good agreement with experimental values [except for one complex with a very shallow activation barrier (&lt;0.1 eV)]. It has previously been demonstrated that radiative decay rates can be accurately calculated from DFT. Combined with our results for the non-radiative rates, this implies that DFT methods can accurately predict the emission efficiency in Ir(iii) phosphors. Therefore, DFT calculations are both fast and accurate enough to play a significant role in the design of new deep blue Ir(iii) phosphors with high emission efficiency. Even the one-dimensional theory provides reasonable agreement with experiment. This suggests that a funneling approach - where only the best performing molecules, according to the one-dimensional theory, are studied in the more laborious multi-dimensional framework - could be a powerful strategy for designing active materials for phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) from first principles.",

The three complexes showed a wavelength-dependent quantum yield of NO production Phi(NO), as measured with an NO-sensitive electrode, the highest values corresponding to the larger photon energies. For the same excitation wavelength the decrease of Phi(NO) at 20 degrees C in the order Fe &gt; Ru &gt;&gt; Os, is explained by the increasing M-N bond strength and inertness of the heavier metals. Transient absorption data at 420 nm indicate the formation of the [M(III)(CN)5H2O]2- species in less than ca. 1 micros for M = Fe and Ru. The enthalpy content of [Fe(III)(CN)5H2O]2- with respect to the parent [Fe(II)(CN)5NO]2- state is (190 +/- 20) kJ mol(-1), as measured by laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy (LIOAS) upon excitation at 480 nm. The production of [Fe(III)(CN)5H2O]2- is concomitant with an expansion of (8 +/- 3) ml mol(-1) consistent with an expansion of the water bound through hydrogen bonds to the CN ligands plus the difference between NO release into the bulk and water entrance into the first coordination sphere. The activated process, as indicated by the relatively strong temperature dependence of the Phi(NO) values and by the temperature dependence of the appearance of the [Fe(III)(CN)5H2O]2- species, as determined by LIOAS, is attributed to NO detachment in less than ca. 100 ns from the isonitrosyl (ON) ligand (MS1 state).",

Therefore, in the majority of ribosome models derived from conventional data collection used for X-ray structures, metal ions are usually assigned as magnesium-the best-known RNA-stabilizing atom. Consequently, the local chemical environment of the metal ions was interpreted from the point of view of octahedral coordination.\n\nAnomalous X-ray diffraction is a very well established tool to determine and localize ions in three-dimensional structures 48,49 . Every chemical element displays a characteristic set of absorption edges in the X-ray range, corresponding to the binding energies of electrons (K, L, M electron shells corresponding to K-, L-, Medges). The anomalous signal from atoms of the element under investigation changes drastically across its absorption edge. Hence, peaks in the anomalous difference Fourier map from measurements on the high-energy side, which are not present in data on the low-energy side, reveal the atomic positions of the anomalous scatterers. The majority of synchrotron beamlines for macromolecular crystallography are optimized for the 6-17.5 keV X-ray range 50 . However, to detect and measure the anomalous signal from potassium around its K-edge (E = 3.608 keV) access to lower energies is necessary. The long-wavelength beamline I23 at Diamond Light Source is currently the only synchrotron beamline for macromolecular crystallography covering the energy range around the potassium K-edge. Experiments at long wavelengths have a number of obstacles to overcome: mainly large diffraction angles and absorption from air in the beam path, the sample mount, solvent around the crystal and the crystal itself. Beamline I23 has been designed to address these challenges by operating in a vacuum environment with a multi-axis goniometer and a large semi-cylindrical area detector 51 .",

In Fig. 4 the Gaussian curve expresses the distribution of the surface state as a function of the energy (E) and the integration of the Gaussian curve gives the relative density of state (DOS) for the surface state.All of the values of \u03d5, E 0 , and DOS obtained in the present experiment are listed in Table 1.\n\n\nIV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the proposed new analysis method the yield spectrum of photoelectron emission was well interpreted on the basis of the generation of a surface state on the metal surface.From the results in Table 1 the followings are found: (1) the surface state did not appear for scratched and non-scratched (only cleaned in the solvent) samples before increasing temperature; (2) with and without scratching the surface state was found after the temperature increase and subsequent decrease process under the irradiation of 220 nm incident light in flowing Q gas;",

The approach involves solving the corresponding Dirichlet problem H(R)Psi(R)=E(R)Psi(R) on a finite interval [-R,R] by the Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbation theory (RSPT). The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k). The summation of the latter series with large lambda for the octic case is considered as an extremely challenging summation problem, in part, since it was rigorously proven that the Pad\u00e9 approximants cannot converge and the two-point Pad\u00e9 approximants, which combine information of the renormalized weak coupling and strong coupling expansions, give relatively good results. The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Pad\u00e9 approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda. The coefficients E((k))(R) are calculated with the eigenvalue series of an operator H(Rn), whose resolvent converges to that of H(R) as n--&gt; infinity. The Pad\u00e9 approximants of the RSPT eigenfunction series Psi(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)psi((k))(R)lambda(k) also provide accurate results for the octic oscillator.",

At this stage, there may be two adjacent terms of equal numerical value; when the least term of the asymptotic series is spoken of, it is in reference to the first of these two terms. The sum of the initial terms of the asymptotic series up to, and including, the least term often furnishes a fair approximation to the desired value of the function being evaluated. It was early observed by computers that if the terms of the asymptotic series alternate in sign, this approximation was often improved by replacing the least term by its half. The factor by which the least term of the asymptotic series must be multiplied so that the true value of the function being evaluated is obtained by addition of this modified least term to the remaining initial terms of the asymptotic series is known as the converging factor for the asymptotic series. The converging factor for the asymptotic series involved in the calculation of the exponential integral, for large negative values of the argument, was given as a power series in the reciprocal of the argument by Airey; the first term of this series is (1/2). A method for the determination of the coefficients of this series is given.",

The approach involves solving the corresponding Dirichlet problem H(R)Psi(R)=E(R)Psi(R) on a finite interval [-R,R] by the Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbation theory (RSPT). The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k). The summation of the latter series with large lambda for the octic case is considered as an extremely challenging summation problem, in part, since it was rigorously proven that the Pad\u00e9 approximants cannot converge and the two-point Pad\u00e9 approximants, which combine information of the renormalized weak coupling and strong coupling expansions, give relatively good results. The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Pad\u00e9 approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda. The coefficients E((k))(R) are calculated with the eigenvalue series of an operator H(Rn), whose resolvent converges to that of H(R) as n--&gt; infinity. The Pad\u00e9 approximants of the RSPT eigenfunction series Psi(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)psi((k))(R)lambda(k) also provide accurate results for the octic oscillator.",

For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nHeisenberg's principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science. The uncertainty principle can\nbe shown to be a consequence of wave-particle duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory from classical mechanics.",

Having taken for the particle's mass 1g and for its velocity 100 m/s, we obtain for the rate of phase change at reflection, values of the order of 10 23 radians per second. The precise values, coming from the difference function in equation (11) , depend on the distance from the barrier and from the starting point of the particle.\n\nThe acquisition by classical systems of very large phases within a very short time period is likely to be quite general. It is expected that it is rooted in the reciprocal relations between the two quantities (moduli and phases) or, equivalently, in the circumstance that they are parts of the same analytic function. Thus as the logarithm of the modulus increases (numerically), then so does the phase.\n\nWhile it is of a speculative nature, one would imagine a similar phenomenon to occur during a wave-function collapse. It is widely held that the collapse is caused by a (phase-) decoherence process, which takes place while the quantum component is coupled to (entangled with) the classical component (e.g. ref. 11). On the basis of our results that the sudden switching from one (positive mean momentum) state to another (negative mean momentum) state by a macroscopic object causes the sudden acquisition of a large phase, we might expect a similar phase-increase to occur in the macroscopic part of the combined quantum-classical system. A tiny variation in this macro-phase will suffice to cause decoherence in the total wave -function. However, a detailed description of this process requires further work, probably through use of one the proposed models for decoherence 11 .\n\n\nReferences",

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies. For example, for the XY (n=2) version of the present model, such a behavior was observed only near criticality. It is shown also that the (metastable state) maximum Lyapunov exponent decreases with N like lambda(max) approximately N-kappa, where for the initial conditions employed herein (maximal magnetization), kappa=0.225+/-0.030, both above and below the critical point.",

The former property is shared by all physical wave-packets in a time-independent environment, and is due to the lower boundedness of the energy (or frequency) spectrum (which implies that wave functions of a freely moving particles with negative energies are all zero 14,10 . This property is analogous to the principle of causality, which makes the response functions to be zero at negative times and by consequence, ensures the analyticity of response functions in the upper half of the complex frequency plane 15 .

The WP-EQM calculations include all total angular momenta up to J(max) = 50, and therefore the various dynamical observables are converged up to 0.6 eV. It has been found that it is necessary to include all Coriolis couplings to obtain reliable converged results. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods are thoroughly compared as a function of the total energy for a series of J values. Comparisons are also made of total reaction cross sections as function of the collision energy, and rate constants. In addition, opacity functions, integral cross sections (ICS) and differential cross sections (DCS) are presented at 102 meV, 201.3 meV and 524.6 meV collision energy. The agreement between the three sets of results is only qualitative. The QCT calculations fail to describe the overall reactivity and most of the dynamical observables correctly. At low collision energies, the QCT method is plagued by the lack of conservation of zero point energy, whilst at higher collision energies and/or total angular momenta, the appearance of an effective repulsive potential associated with the centrifugal motion \"over\" the well causes a substantial decrease of the reactivity. In turn, the statistical models overestimate the reactivity over the whole range of collision energies as compared with the WP-EQM method. Specifically, at sufficiently high collision energies the reaction cannot be deemed to be statistical and important dynamical effects seem to be present. In general the WP-EQM results lie in between those obtained using the QCT and SQCT methods. One of the main, unexpected, conclusions of this work is that an accurate description of the reaction and of its various dynamical features requires a computationally expensive, accurate quantum mechanical treatment.",

It has been shown that under circumstances that are realizable for an electron, reciprocal relations hold between the phase and the modulus of the scattered particle's wave function. This supplements our previous demonstrations of the existence of reciprocal relations for localized, bound states 8\u221210 . In those publications we have noted some other relations that connect the phase with modulus, in particular, the equation of continuity. However, this equation is a partial differential equation and does not uniquely reconstruct the phase, even when the modulus is completely given. Thus, even for a problem in only one spatial dimension, the addition to the position-derivative of the phase of a quantity \u03c6(t)/|\u03c8(x, t)| 2 , where \u03c6(t) is arbitrary, will satisfy the continuity equation, while in higher dimensions a much larger family of functions will do so. In contrast, the reciprocal relations give the analytic part uniquely from the modulus.\n\nThe physical basis for these relations was elucidated in 14,15 , as being due to the lower-boundedness of the energies. When the analyticity requirements are not fully satisfied, e.g., through there being nodal points in the wave function, the phase is still obtainable from the modulus, the latter being given as function of the complex time. When the analytic properties postulated in this article hold fully, it is sufficient to know the modulus as function of real time, i.e., along the real t-axis.\n\nIn this paper we have obtained threshold relations which delimit the straightforward application of the reciprocal relations. It will be of interest to extend the theory to three dimensional scattering problems, to finiteheight barriers and to other cases.\n\nFor a (rigid) molecule impinging on an infinite barrier, we have found that one should expect zeros of the \"difference function\" in the lower-half of the complex time-plane, such that additional (so called, Blaschke) terms are required to correlate the modulus with the phase changes.\n\nWhen the barrier is not infinite, the algebraic, image wave-function solution used in this work is not applicable.

The simple formulas for the different diffusive regimes are compared quantitatively for the simplest case of the absence of an external field and for an initial position in the middle of the interval. It turns out that the MFPT's for anomalous diffusion can be both larger or smaller than that for normal diffusion depending on the values of the length of the interval and the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the MFPT can show nonmonotonic changes with the degree of departure from normal diffusion.",

It is \"ideal\" in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed\nwith a spectrometer so that the wavelengths and their intensities can be measured. Figure 3.10 shows the resulting curves for some representative temperatures. Each distribution depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, $\\lambda_{\\max }$, shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high temperatures begin to glow a darker red that becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming white hot at very high temperatures as the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable.

The emissivity \u03f5 (\u03bb, T) describes the spectral emittance of a blackbody as a function of wavelength and temperature, whereby the limit \u03f5 (\u03bb, T) = 1 represents the case of an ideal blackbody radiator. Typical blackbody emitters are the Nernst glower and the globar, whereby either a ceramic rod (e.g., SiC) or a tungsten filament, respectively, are resistively heated.\n\nEven though thermal emitters are inexpensive, the emitted radiation-central wavelength and radiant intensitycan only be controlled by the temperature of the emitter element. Figure 1 shows the blackbody radiation of an ideal emitter and the temperature dependence of the emitted radiation in terms of wavelength. This dependence renders thermal emitters for specific applications in the fingerprint region (e.g., 6-15 \u00b5m) of limited utility, as for this spectral regime a thermal emitter would have to be operated at room temperature, and thus would have only low emissivity. To overcome these limits, one may refer to Kirchhoff's law of radiation.

This paper provides absolute intensity measurements, quantum efficiencies and signal-to-blackbody radiation ratios at peak emission wavelengths, at various temperatures (20-1400\u00b0C), for Y(2)O(3):Eu, YAG:Tb and YAG:Tm thermographic phosphors under 266 and 355 nm excitation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These terms are beneficial in a number of ways for engineers wanting to use a phosphor thermometry solution at high temperatures. They may also provide additional insight to the physical luminescence processes of phosphors at high temperatures. The phosphor signal:blackbody radiation ratio is useful because it combines the effects of blackbody radiation and phosphor emission intensities at various temperatures, providing a valuable quantitative evaluation that can be used as a design aid for phosphor selection. A figure of merit is the temperature when the blackbody radiation equals the phosphor emission (ratio = 1); this is the cross-over temperature at which the blackbody radiation rapidly starts to overtake and mask out phosphor emissions. To the best of our knowledge no such work exists previously. The results presented show a variation in phosphor intensity with increasing temperature, and although the intensity and quantum efficiencies for Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb were much greater than YAG:Tm at low temperatures, YAG:Tm was found to be the most efficient phosphor investigated at higher temperatures (&gt;900\u00b0C). With a peak emission wavelength of 458 nm, YAG:Tm experienced the lowest proportion of blackbody radiation therefore its advantage at higher temperatures was further amplified and was found to offer an advantage of approximately +350\u00b0C and +250\u00b0C increased upper temperature capability compared to Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb phosphors, respectively.",

The values of \u03bbmax can be used for determining the spectra (wavelength dependence) of the vibrational temperatures . In the faint nonequilibrium emission bands, the spectral transmission \u03bb \u2192 1 and small values of (1 \u2212 \u03bb ) cannot be observed experimentally. In that case, the vibrational temperatures obtained for the fainter bands can be used to find the spectral absorption coefficients and integral intensities of the faint emission bands whose absolute emission spectra have been recorded by measurement devices. In order to determine the degree of nonequilibrium of the OH group emission, their transmission spectra were measured under the same conditions as those for measuring the emission spectra. The structure of the transmission spectra correlates with the structure of the emission spectra. The resulting spectral variations in \u03bb and \u03bbmax ( fig. 17) are rapidly varying. The degree of variation in the 281-296 nm range is slightly higher than in the 306-328 nm range. The maximum value of \u03bbmax for T=2380 K is 100. In the 306-328 nm band, \u03bbmax reaches 50 ( fig. 17). It should be noted that the spectral dependences of \u03bb for different temperatures are essentially different. From our standpoint, the reason for this is that it is impossible to make the conditions for obtaining the emission and transmission spectra completely identical, since they have were not recorded simultaneously. The existence of a spectral variation in \u03bbmax indicates that the vibrational temperature may depend on the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. In addition, the shape of the spectrum lines may have an effect on the value of \u03bb . Turbulent inhomogeneity during burning of the flame may also have some effect on \u03bb .

The sensitivity of the x-ray emission to the temperature and to impurity transport processes is discussed. This model has been then used to investigate two different plasma scenarios. In the first regime the ECRH heating occurs on axis during the current ramp up phase, when the magnetic shear is evolving from negative to zero up to the half radius. The spectrum is well reproduced with the molybdenum ions in coronal equilibrium and with a central impurity peaking. In the second regime, at the beginning of the current flat top when magnetic shear is monotonic and sawtoothing activity is appearing, the lowest charge states (Mo33+ to Mo30+), populated off axis, are affected by anomalous transport and the total molybdenum profile is found to be flat up to the half radius.

This paper introduces and demonstrates an optical stabilization scheme that uses the drift in peak-emission wavelength of light emitted from an LED as a temperature feedback signal to realize output intensity temperature coefficients below 100\u00a0ppm/K. The control principle relies on a conventional feedback loop but with a specially designed weakly polarizing optical interference coating that exhibits different transmittivity/reflectivity ratio dependence on wavelength for two different polarizations and by using a weighted sum of two polarizations as the output power correcting signal in a feedback loop. The method does not need a thermometer or temperature control stage, and its calibration can be performed electronically, adding to the simplicity of the design and making it also suitable for portable and battery-operated instruments.",

Recently, tungsten filaments are increasingly being replaced by less luminous alternatives, such as barium oxide or lanthanum hexaboride. These materials can emit electrons at temperatures close to 1000\u00a0K lower than tungsten, greatly reducing their blackbody radiations. This results in significant improvement in signal recovery for active spectral diagnostic, such as laser-induced fluorescence.

By fixing the number of moles of gas involved and using the ratio technique, Stimson and his colleagues planned to employ a more advanced form of eq (3) to evaluate the unknown temperature in thermodynamic terms, relative to the first. Initial NBS discussions probed the possibility of using a gas-bulb material made of an alloy whose thermal expansion might be nearly zero over a limited range of temperature. They also considered the relative advantages of utilizing a working gas of known non-ideality, versus the technique of making measurements over such an extended range of filling pressures that an extrapolation to zero pressure might be valid.

The latter series is also divergent, but it is much easier to work with; there are several classical methods that assign it a value, which have been explored since the 18th century. In order to transform the series into , one can subtract 4 from the second term, 8 from the fourth term, 12 from the sixth term, and so on. The total amount to be subtracted is , which is 4 times the original series. These relationships can be expressed using algebra.

Proof As with any infinite series, the sum is defined to mean the limit of the partial sum of the first terms as approaches infinity. By various arguments, one can show that this finite sum is equal to As approaches infinity, the term approaches 0 and so tends to 1. History",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Such problematic issues also exist in physical chemistry. Here are some examples. The analysis of kinetics of various physical and chemical processes shows that in some cases the direct addition of velocities, kinetic or energy characteristics is performed, in others-their reciprocals are added. In particular, such supposition is confirmed by the formula of electron transport possibility due to the overlapping of wave functions 1 and 2 (in steady state) during electron-conformation interactions:\n1 2 1 2 1 2 WW W W W \u221e = +(1)\nEquation (1) is used when evaluating the characteristics of diffusion processes followed by non-radiating transport of electrons in proteins [1].\n\nAnd also: \"From classical mechanics it is known that the relative motion of two particles with the interaction energy U(r) takes place as the motion of material point with the reduced mass \u00b5: 1 2 1 1 1 m m \u00b5 = + (2) in the field of central force U(r), and general translational motion-as a free motion of material point with the mass: 1 2 m m m = + (3) Such things take place in quantum mechanics as well\" [2]. At the same time, the problem of quantum-wave dualism is still not completely solved, though the application of de Broglie equation allows defining the manifestation borders of such phenomena.

In this method, the absolute binding free energy of a ligand is estimated as deltaGbind = alpha&lt;Vel(bound) - Vel(free)&gt; + beta&lt;Vvdw(bound) - Vvdw(free)&gt;, where Vel(bound) and Vvdw(bound) are the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies between the ligand and the solvated protein from an molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory with ligand bound to protein and Vel(free) and Vel(free) and Vvdw(free) are the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies between the ligand and the water from an MD trajectory with the ligand in water. A set of values, alpha = 0.5 and beta = 0.16, was found to give results in good agreement with experimental data. Later, however, different optimal values of beta were found in studies of compounds binding to P450cam and avidin. The present work investigates how the optimal value of beta depends on the nature of binding sites for different protein-ligand interactions. By examining seven ligands interacting with five proteins, we have discovered a linear correlation between the value of beta and the weighted non-polar desolvation ratio (WNDR), with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. We have also examined the ability of this correlation to predict optimal values of beta for different ligands binding to a single protein. We studied twelve neutral compounds bound to avidin. In this case, the WNDR approach gave a better estimate of the absolute binding free energies than results obtained using the fixed value of beta found for biotin-avidin. In terms of reproducing the relative binding free energy to biotin, the fixed-beta value gave better results for compounds similar to biotin, but for compounds less similar to biotin, the WNDR approach led to better relative binding free energies.",

Vibronic coupling parameters were calculated and compared with those of the coordination number (CN) 3. Inspecting the correlation between the chemical hardness and the vibronic coupling energy (hardness rule), it is found that the tendency to distort decreases with increasing CN. While all considered molecules AX(3) (A(III) = P to Bi; X(-) = F to I) undergo lone pair deformations (D(3h)---&gt; C(3v)), only part of the AX(4)(-) and BX(4) species (B(IV) = S to Po) do so (T(d)---&gt; C(2v)-and even less the ones with CN = 5 (D(3h)---&gt; C(2v) (congruent with C(4v)), AX(5)(2-), BX(5)(-), and CF(5) (C(V); Cl to I). The distorted polyhedra of minimum energy possess usually the butterfly C(2v) shape (CN = 4, tau(2)(zeta) displacement path) and a C(2v) = C(4v)geometry (CN = 5, epsilon' (epsilon) distortion path). A further symmetry lowering to C(s) occurs, if the central ion becomes too small with respect to the ligands (ionic size influence, PCl(Br)(4)(-), PCl(5)(2-)), with the tendency to reduce the CN toward 3 + 1 and 4 + 1, respectively. For CN = 4 the various stationary points of, for example, compressed and elongated C(3v), C(4v), etc. in the multidimensional ground-state potential surface have been characterized. Though of higher energy than the absolute C(2v) minimum, they are shown to govern the dynamics and reactivity of the CN = 4 species to a large extent. To simulate the chemical environment (positively charged counterions, polar solvents), the DFT calculations were performed using the polarizable continuum model COSMO (conductor-like screening model). Though the electronic energy gain upon distortion is not significantly affected by the solvent, the total stabilization energy is distinctly enhanced, frequently leading to lone pair deformations of otherwise electronically stable species. All results obtained by the combined vibronic/DFT approach are well in accord with available experimental data.",

This applies for VIF pictures as one-electron Hamiltonian operators as well as VIF pictures as one-electron density operators that constitute a new implementation of the VIF method simpler in its application and more accurate in its results than previous approaches. A procedure for estimating elements of the effective charge density-bond order matrix, Pmunu, from electron configurations in atoms is presented, and it is shown how these lead to loop and line constants in the VIF picture. From these structural formulas, one finds the number of singly, doubly, and unoccupied molecular orbitals, as well as the number of molecular orbitals with energy lower, equal, and higher than -1/2Eh, the negative of the hydrogen atom's ionization energy. The VIF results for water are in qualitative agreement with MP2/6311++G3df3pd, MO energy levels where the simple VIF for water presented in the earlier literature does not agree with computed energy levels. The method presented here gives the simplest accurate VIF pictures for hydrocarbons. It is shown how VIF can be used to predict thermal barriers to chemical reactions. Insertion of singlet carbene into H2 is given as an example. VIF pictures as one-electron density operators describe the ground-state multiplicities of B2, N2, and O2 molecules and as one-electron Hamiltonian operators give the correct electronegativity trend across period two. Previous implementations of VIF do not indicate singly occupied molecular orbitals directly from the pictorial VIF rules for these examples. The direct comparison between structural formulas that represent electron density and those that represent energy is supported by comparison of a simple electronegativity scale, chiD=N/n2, with well-known electronegativity scales of Pauling, Mulliken, and Allen. This scale comes from the method used to calculate Pmumu for sp3 hybridized period-two elements and is comparable to electronegativity because it has the same form as &lt;1/r&gt; for hydrogenic orbitals. It therefore provides a physical basis for the representation of one electron density and Hamiltonian operators by the same VIF picture.",

The A--&gt;X fluorescence spectrum, which was observed for the first time, as well as the excitation spectra were recorded using a pulsed supersonic molecular beam crossed with a pulsed dye laser beam. An analysis of the A(v')&lt;--X(v\"), B(v')&lt;--X(v\"), and A(v'=8)--&gt;X(v\") bound-bound bands indicates that a Morse function combined with a long-range approximation represents the interatomic potential energy curve of the A, B, and X states below the dissociation limit. In the simulation of the A(v'=8)--&gt;X bound-free spectrum the Morse, Lennard-Jones (n-6), and Maitland-Smith (n(0), n(1)) functions were tested, and the Maitland-Smith (11.39, 10.50) potential was found to be a good representation of the repulsive part of the X-state PE curve above the dissociation limit, over the internuclear separation range R=2.85-3.55 \u00c5. The spectroscopic characteristics for the A, B, and X states obtained in this work are compared with other available experimental and theoretical results. Copyright 2001 Academic Press. ",

The X(1)\u03a3(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 \u00c5), whereas the A(1)\u03a0 state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 \u00c5). The X(1)\u03a3(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;\u03bc&gt;(\u03c5), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)\u03a0. For the level (X(1)\u03a3(+)), &lt;\u03bc&gt;(0) = 0.213 D. The \u03c5(\") = 7 and 8 X(1)\u03a3(+) vibrational levels are found to have the highest probability to be reached via emission from the lowest lying vibrational levels of A(1)\u03a0. The work had a dual outcome: First, it explored consequences of different choices of the state-specific reference \"Fermi-sea\" space (\"active\" space), which is required for the construction and execution of the multiconfigurational \"complete active space self-consistent field\" calculations and the subsequent multi-reference CI calculations. In this context, comparisons with results on the weakly bound ground states of the homonuclear Be(2) and Mg(2) molecules were made. Second, it produced reliable data for the short- as well as the long-range parts of the potential energy curve (PEC). Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)\u03a3(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 \u00b1 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 \u00b1 500 a.u., respectively. The result for C(6) is in excellent agreement with that of Derevianko et al. [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 96, 323 (2010)], (364 \u00b1 4 a.u.), that was obtained in the framework of the theory of long-range interactions and many-body calculations on the constituent atoms. On the other hand, our result for C(8) differs from that of Standard and Certain [J. Chem. Phys. 83, 3002 (1985)] by about 7000 a.u.",

The addition of steepest descents to the initial steps and to the subspace neglected by Newton's method with SVD seems to be advantageous for the molecular systems we investigated.\n\nWe could calculate accurate harmonic vibrational frequencies and anharmonicity constants of diatomic molecules by fitting QMC results to the Morse potential, achieving excellent agreement between QMC calculations and experiment for these vibrational parameters. \n\n\nai )r n ka ij .\n\nFIG. 2 :\n2The energy of BH at rexp at various stages of parameter optimization.

When the Morse potential (8) is expanded in powers of the vibrational coordinate Q up to the fifth order we obtain the Dunham model of the anharmonic oscillator [7]:\nH V = P 2 Q 2\u03bc + 1 2 \u03bc\u03c9 2 h Q 2 + 5 j=3 f j Q j ,(12)\nwhere\nf 3 = \u2212Da 3 , f 4 = 7Da 4 12 , f 5 = \u2212 Da 5 4 .(13)\nIn order to relating more easily the perturbation coefficient f j with the vibrational spectroscopy constants \u03c9 h and \u03c7 e , we rearrange the expressions ((10), (11)) as [7]\nDa 2 = \u03bc\u03c9 2 h 2 , a 2 = 2\u03bc\u03c9 h x e D .(14)",

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface. Rate constants calculated with the CVBMM surface agree with the MPW54 rate constants within 12% for 534-2000 K and within 23% for 200-491 K. The full CVBMM potential-energy surface is now available for use in variety of dynamics calculations, and it provides a prototype for developing CVBMM potential-energy surfaces for other reactions.",

For each pair and each solvent a series of umbrella-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with the AMBER force field, explicit solvent, and counterions added to maintain a zero net charge of a system were carried out and the PMF was calculated by using the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). Subsequently, homoconjugation-equilibrium constants were calculated by numerical integration of the respective PMF profiles. In all cases but imidazole stable homocomplexes were found to form in solution, which was manifested as the presence of contact minima corresponding to hydrogen-bonded species in the PMF curves. The calculated homoconjugation constants were found to be greater for complexes with the OHO bridge (acetic acid and phenol) than with the NHN bridge and they were found to decrease with increasing polarity and hydrogen-bonding propensity of the solvent (i.e., in the series AN &gt; DMSO &gt; H(2)O), both facts being in agreement with the available experimental data. It was also found that interactions with counterions are manifested as the broadening of the contact minimum or appearance of additional minima in the PMF profiles of the acetic acid-acetate, phenol/phenolate system in acetonitrile, and the 4(5)-methylimidazole/4(5)-methylimidzole cation conjugated base system in dimethyl sulfoxide.",

Since it takes nearly as much energy to excite the hydrogen atom's electron from n = 1 to n = 3 (12.1 eV, via the Rydberg formula) as it does to ionize the hydrogen atom (13.6 eV), ionization is far more probable than excitation to the n = 3 level.

In the new atom, the electron may begin in any energy level, and subsequently cascades to the ground state (n = 1), emitting photons with each transition.

I t seems very doubtful, however, if this arrangement is correct. The final vibrational differences of the Q (1) lines of the present bands are identical with the corresponding terms for the initial states of the Lyman bands (Dieke and Hopfield's B states) to the accuracy of the ultra-violet measurements. The ultra-violet data for lines other than Q (1) are not available at present, so that it is not certain the states are the same. However, the identity of the final states with Dieke and Hopfield's B states is confirmed by the values got for the heats of dissociation. If the states are the same, the present final electronic term 33727-12 should be equal to the differ ence between the ionisation potential of H 2 = 128800 and Dieke and Hopfield's electronic term B -A = 91562.

A photon in this energy range, with a frequency that coincides with that of one of the lines in the Lyman or Werner bands, can be absorbed by H2, placing the molecule in an excited electronic state. Radiative decay (that is, decay into photons) from this excited state occurs rapidly, with roughly 15% of these decays occurring into the vibrational continuum of the molecule, resulting in its dissociation. This two-step photodissociation process, known as the Solomon process, is one of the main mechanisms by which molecular hydrogen is destroyed in the interstellar medium.",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

The estimates in this and previous papers from the electron terms all come con sistently low, and I wonder if the value of the heat of dissociation of normal H 2 may not be a little higher than the value found by Langmuir, or, alterna tively, the spectroscopic value of the ionisation potential of H2 might be a little under the experimental value 15-9 volts. Even so, the utmost that could be allowed in this way is probably about 5000 wave-numbers, which would still be insufficient to bridge the discrepancy. This brings us back to the difficulty that the calculated 2S term 33727 is too low to agree with the apparent identity of the final states with Dieke and Hopfield's B states. If their corresponding electronic term 37238 is used instead of 33727, the values in brackets inTable VIII are obtained. The value of the heat of dissociation 24746 is now just about as much below the value estimated from the vibration term data as these estimates from the electronic term data generally seem to run. These difficulties can be avoided by the following re-arrangement of the bands, which, however, can only be regarded as provisional at this stage. I still take the strong A band system as a 3 -> 2 electron transition, but I take out the 0B0, 0Bj, 0B2 and 0B3 bands and the C fragment and assume the jB0, jB,, -jB2 and jB3 lines to be respectively the 0B0, qBj, 0B2 and 0B3 lines of the 4 -> 2 electron transition bands. The electron levels now proposed are shown diagrammatically, but not to scale, in Diagram II. The three lowest levels are the A, B and C levels of Dieke and Hopfield, and the others give the surface of the molecule corresponding to the ionisation potential of normal H 2 and the levels for the new 0B0 Q (1) (jBq Q (1) ofTable VI) and the 0A0 Q (1) lines. The higher levels are getting near the ionisation potential limit, and it is not surprising if they are not found.In what follows the experimental value 128800 of",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions.

This case means that an electron with momentumk has an equal probability of changing momentum top after going through the delta-function point contact. On the other hand, for the planar tunnel junction (large contact regime), we assume that the matrix elements of electrons tunneling throughout the entire interface are the same; that is, V \u00f0r\u00de = V for r z = 0. In this case, because the uncertainty in the position of the interface is infinite, the uncertainty in the in-plane momentum is zero.

As mentioned above, we have investigated the possibility that the interaction with the laser light affects the velocity distribution of the circulating ions and hence the measured threshold value. We only used measurements with laser powers in a region where no power dependence was found.

The number of ions in the excited level present in the ion beam is smaller than the number of ions in the ground state. This, in combination with a smaller photodetachment crosssection 42 , gives a very small photodetachment signal close to the threshold. Therefore, a slightly higher laser power of 215 mW is used to obtain enough signal. The measurement procedure is simpler than for the ground state since no depletion with the high-power laser is needed. Instead, the photon energy scan is started 10 s into the storage cycle and three scans over the threshold are performed before changing to the other laser propagation direction. Ten However, these calculations are more than 10 years old and, since then, much development regarding theoretical models and computing power has taken place.",

This gives an excited state binding energy of 1.439,157,53(29) eV. The fine structure splitting is the difference between this binding energy and the electron affinity, and the result is 0.021,955,44(30) eV.DiscussionIn this work, we present a method for high-precision measurements of photodetachment threshold energies of negative ions. The method is demonstrated with a measurement of the electron affinity of oxygen, resulting in a statistical uncertainty of 11 MHz and a final electron affinity uncertainty of 21 MHz. The results are compared to previous experimental electron affinity measurements inFig. 5. The most recent, previous measurements agree with our measured value of 1.461,112,972(87) eV22,40 . However, the present result has a significantly reduced uncertainty. The value reported by ref.39, obtained by the laser photodetachment threshold spectroscopy technique, differs by about 3.4 \u03bceV, which is significantly more than expected from their stated uncertainty.Negative ions have the remarkable property of being weakly bound systems largely dominated by electron correlation. Therefore, electron-affinity calculations represent one of the most challenging situations for atomic structure theory. For example, variational approaches such as configuration-interaction or multiconfigurational Hartree-Fock (MCHF) methods typically require convergence of the absolute energies of the involved atomic eigenstates, something which is rarely achievable in practice. Instead, one has to rely on the relative convergence between the neutral atom and the negative ion. Balancing the complex correlation model of the negative ion with that of the neutral atom poses a major theoretical undertaking and the model can easily converge to the wrong results. Several computations of the oxygen electron affinity, based on various theoretical approaches are available in the literature, e.g., refs. 44-48.

The semiclassical function from mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and frozen Gaussian wave packets is computed for the electronic transition of an excited state excess electron to the ground state in liquid methanol. The decoherence function decays on a 10 fs time scale that is qualitatively similar to the aqueous case. We demonstrate that it is the motion of the hydrogen atom, and, in particular, the hydrogen rotation around the oxygen-methyl bond which is predominantly responsible for destroying the quantum correlations between alternative states. Multiple time scales due to the slower diffusive nuclear modes, which dominate the solvation response of methanol, do not contribute to the coherence loss. The choice of the coordinate representation is investigated in detail and concluded to be irrelevant to the decay. Changes in both nuclear momenta and positions on the two alternative potential surfaces are found to contribute to decoherence, the former dominating at short times (t &lt; 5 fs), the latter controlling the decay at longer times. Various short-time approximations to the full dynamics for the decoherence function are tested for the first time. The present treatment rigorously develops the short-time description and establishes its range of validity. Whereas the lowest-order short-time approximation proves to be a very good approximation up to about 5 fs, we also find that it bounds the decay of the decoherence function. After 5 fs, the coherence decay in fact becomes faster than the single Gaussian predicted in the lowest-order short-time limit. This decay is well reflected by an enhanced low-order approximation, which is also easily computed from equilibrium classical forces.",

A 103, 042809 (2021)PLRAAN2469-992610.1103/PhysRevA.103.042809] have performed the first complete calculation of the Lamb shift of the helium 2\u2009^{3}S_{1} and 2\u2009^{3}P_{J} triplet states up to the term in \u03b1^{7}m. Whereas their theoretical result of the frequency of the 2\u2009^{3}P\u21902\u2009^{3}S transition perfectly agrees with the experimental value, a more than 10\u03c3 discrepancy was identified for the 3\u2009^{3}D\u21902\u2009^{3}S and 3\u2009^{3}D\u21902\u2009^{3}P transitions, which hinders the determination of the He^{2+} charge radius from atomic spectroscopy. We present here a new measurement of the ionization energy of the 2\u2009^{1}S_{0} state of He [960\u2009332\u2009040.491(32)\u00a0MHz] which we use in combination with the 2\u2009^{3}S_{1}\u21902\u2009^{1}S_{0} interval measured by Rengelink et\u00a0al.

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

The first-order interaction energy and the bulk of the second-order contribution were obtained using Gaussian geminal basis sets and are converged to about 0.1 mK near the minimum and for larger R. The remaining second-order contributions available in the SAPT suite of codes were computed using very large orbital basis sets, up to septuple-zeta quality, augmented by diffuse and midbond functions. The accuracy reached at this level was better than 1 mK in the same region. All the remaining components of the interaction energy were computed using the full configuration interaction method in bases up to sextuple-zeta quality. The latter components, although contributing only 1% near the minimum, have the largest uncertainty of about 10 mK in this region. The total interaction energy at R=5.6 bohrs is -11.000+/-0.011 K. For R&lt; or =6.5 bohrs, the supermolecular (SM) interaction energies computed by us recently turned out to be slightly more accurate. Therefore, we have combined the SM results for R&lt; or =6.5 bohrs with the SAPT results from 7.0 to 12 bohrs to fit analytic functions for the potential and for its error bars. The potential fit uses the best available van der Waals constants C(6) through C(16), including C(11), C(13), and C(15), and is believed to be the best current representation of the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential for helium. Using these fits, we found that the BO potential for the helium dimer exhibits the well depth D(e)=11.006+/-0.004 K, the equilibrium distance R(e)=5.608+/-0.012 bohrs, and supports one bound state for (4)He(2) with the dissociation energy D(0)=1.73+/-0.04 mK, and the average interatomic separation R=45.6+/-0.5 A.",

However, our proposed equation has no firm theoretical basis, only that we consider our potential energy approach a logical alternative to the usual kinetic relativistic/quantum mechanical methodology. The results calculated from the equation give excellent agreement with literature values and differ by less than 1 eV and less than 0.02% in all cases from hydrogen up to atomic number 20. This paper provides an updated version of the two-electron equation adapted to calculate the ionization energies of three and four electron ions. Our equation also gives fairly good estimates of first electron affinities. Comparisons are made with another published equation, sources of data are described, and the calculated results are discussed.",

This allowed us to increase the number of pseudo-states to 1,254 and thereby also consider ionization with excitation to the n = 3 states of He + . Figures 1 and 2 show a comparison of our predictions with directly measured cross-section ratios [5] for ionization without excitation and ionization with excitation to He + (3s+3p+3d). The agreement with the experimental data is excellent for both symmetric (Fig. 1) and asymmetric (Fig. 2) sharing of the excess energy between the two outgoing electrons. Normalizing to the well-known results for ionization without excitation will then allow for the determination of absolute cross sections for this process [6].     \n\n\nThis work was supported by the United States National Science Foundation under grants PHY-1212450 and PHY-1430245, and the XSEDE allocation PHY-090031.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1TDCS ratio for electron impact ionization of helium with the residual ion left in either the 1s ground state or the excited n = 3 states.

During the experiments, the cell temperature was kept constant at 420K. The buffer gas pressure was varied over the range from 40 to 250 Pa, Kz molecules were irradiated with pulses of radiation from an OPO laser, populating K2[1(1) sigmau+ (nu'=2)] by photon absorption. The resulting fluorescence included the direct component emitted in the decay of the optically excited state and the sensitized components arising from collisionally populated states. The decay signal of time-resolved fluorescence from 1(1) sigmau+ (nu'=2)]--&gt;1(1) sigmag+(nu\"=0) transition was monitored. In the early period after excitation, only very little population in states v'= 1 or 3 had yet accumulated, the rate of collisional activation to the state nu'=2 was negligible. The decay curve of the nu' = 2--&gt;nu\" = 0 was treated as a single exponential function. From the measurement of the time-resolved fluorescence, the semilog plot was shown. The slope yielded the effective lifetime of the nu' = 2--&gt; nu' = 0 transition. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, the radiative lifetime (36 +/- 7) ns was obtained. The total cross sections for deactivation of 1(1) sigmau1 (nu'=2) state by means of collisions with He and H2 are (3.0 +/- 0.5) x 10(-16) cm2 and (6.4 +/- 1.2) x 10(-15) cm2, respectively. The radiative lifetimes of 1(1) sigmau+(nu' = 1,3) states can also be determined through time-resolved fluorescence in pure K vapor. The time-integrated intensities of 1(1)sigmau+(nu' = 1,2,3)--&gt;1(1) sigmag+(nu\"=0) transition at different He or Hz pressure were measured. The ratio of fluorescence intensities versus 1/P(He, H2) can be fitted by a straight line.

In the bottom-right panel, we compare the results of AMD and AMD-QL (g0 = 0.5) with the Cascade results starting from pure compound nucleus formation 13 N * (dotted line). The maximum impact parameter is taken to be 6.5 fm, which corresponds to a cross section of 1300 mb. The error bars indicate the experimental values. 36) seems that the experimental data 36) is reasonably reproduced. However, in the preequilibrium dynamical stage, which is described by AMD, the fragmentation hardly occurs. One nucleon emission from 12 C, inelastic excitation of 12 C, and formation of the compound nucleus 13 N * are dominant, and most of the intermediate-mass fragments are formed at the statistical decay stage, as already discussed by Takemoto et al. 38) This description may not be reasonable by the following two reasons. First, the survival probability of the compound nucleus 13 N * at the end of dynamical simulation seems too large. The life time of the compound nucleus 13 N * at E * = 43.5 MeV is around \u03c4 \u223c 65 fm/c in Cascade, and the compound-nucleus formation cross section is at most 300 mb, assuming that the grazing impact parameter of around 3 fm. Therefore, at the time t = 200 fm/c when the dynamical calculation ends, around 5% of the compound nuclei 13 N * can survive, which corresponds to 15 mb by using the above estimate and well below the calculated value with AMD (\u223c 50 mb). The second is the lack of the preequilibrium emissions. Basically Cascade describes low-energy statistical decay of equilibrated excited nuclei and the angular distribution of the ejectiles is isotropic, or at least forward-backward symmetric. However, at these incident energies the fragment angular distribution shows strong forwardbackward anisotropy, as shown in the 9 Be/ 11 B + p experimental data, 39) caused by direct-like fragment production.",

The cross sections for deactivation of K(6S) and K(4D) by collisions with H2 were measured. The temperature of the cell body was controlled at 413 K, and H2 pressure was varied between 4 and 40 Pa. The effects of K(6S, 4D)-K collisions could be neglected in our experimental condition. On excitation of K(6S) state, the decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 6S--&gt;4P transition was monitored. The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state. Upon excitation to the K(6S) state, the dependence on H2 pressure of integrated fluorescence in the transition 4D--&gt;4P was measured. The cross section (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the transition 6S--&gt;4D was obtained.

Uncertainties in using detectors to measure or utilizing Monte Carlo methods to estimate brachytherapy dose distributions are provided with discussion of the components intrinsic to the overall dosimetric assessment. Uncertainties provided are based on published observations and cited when available. The uncertainty propagation from the primary calibration standard through transfer to the clinic for air-kerma strength is covered first. Uncertainties in each of the brachytherapy dosimetry parameters of the TG-43 formalism are then explored, ending with transfer to the clinic and recommended approaches. Dosimetric uncertainties during treatment delivery are considered briefly but are not included in the detailed analysis. For low- and high-energy brachytherapy sources of low dose rate and high dose rate, a combined dosimetric uncertainty &lt;5% (k=1) is estimated, which is consistent with prior literature estimates. Recommendations are provided for clinical medical physicists, dosimetry investigators, and source and treatment planning system manufacturers. These recommendations include the use of the GUM and NIST reports, a requirement of constancy of manufacturer source design, dosimetry investigator guidelines, provision of the lowest uncertainty for patient treatment dosimetry, and the establishment of an action level based on dosimetric uncertainty.

The objective of that evaluation was to develop subjective probability distributions of an uncertain quantity, denoted by \u03c1, to represent ranges of credible values of the effectiveness of five groups of low-energy radiations (L): photons at about 1.5 keV; 15 to 30 keV photons; 40 to 60 keV photons; &gt;60 to 150 keV photons; and electrons from beta decay of tritium (H). Probability distributions of \u03c1L for all low-energy groups were derived based on an evaluation of uncertainties in data on biological effectiveness from five areas of research and use of an elicitation process and decomposition method to combine probability distributions to represent those uncertainties. In this paper, we argue that uncertainties in \u03c1Ls for all low-energy groups are too small compared with uncertainties in biological effectiveness from the different areas of research, especially that upper confidence limits of all \u03c1Ls are too low. These deflations of uncertainty in all \u03c1Ls apparently are due, at least in part, to an invalid assumption in the decomposition method that probability distributions of biological effectiveness from the different areas of research are representations of random uncertainty that arises from repeated measurements of the same quantity under the same conditions using well-calibrated instruments. However, those distributions essentially are representations of systematic uncertainty in different estimates of biological effectiveness from each area of research, which means that a deflation of uncertainty in \u03c1Ls is not a credible result. We then use the same probability distributions of biological effectiveness from the different areas of research in an alternative analysis to derive wider probability distributions of \u03c1L that we believe provide a better representation of the state of knowledge of the effectiveness of low-energy photons and electrons in inducing cancer in humans. Our analysis is based on the notion that each probability distribution of biological effectiveness from an area of research represents a distinctly different model of a \u03c1L and use of the concept of model averaging to combine those distributions.",

Ultimately, the measurement depended on our detecting the \u03b3 ray from a 19% branch of the decay of 38 Ca in the presence of thirty times as many 511-keV positron-annihilation photons from the decays of both 38 Ca and its daughter 38m K. In order to keep dead-time and other corrections to a manageable size, we had to limit our counting rate, which naturally limited the number of decay \u03b3-ray events we could collect in a week-long measurement. The next largest uncertainty arises from contaminants in the collected samples. It is a measure of the precision we have achieved with this measurement, that the quantification of impurities, which totaled no more than 0.35% of each sample (see Sec. III D 1), was the second largest source of uncertainty. Following this in importance, were the uncertainties attributed to the determination of \u03b3-ray intensities relative to that of the well-determined 1567-keV peak, and the correction to account for coincidence summing with annihilation radiation. Both were dependent on our necessarily constrained counting rate.\n\nAll four of these contributions to the uncertainty budget depend on conditions that specifically apply to our measurement conditions and can be regarded as statistical.

The predissociation was monitored by the atomic potassium emission at the 3D --&gt; 4P (1.7 microm) or the S --&gt; 4P (1.24 microm), while bound state radiative processes were monitored by total fluorescence from the upper state to the various levels, all studied as a function of H2 density. The values for predissociation, collisional dissociation and collisional depopulation rate coefficients were obtained. The decay signal of the time resolved fluorescence from the 6(1)sigma+ --&gt; 2(1)sigma+, 6(1)sigma+ --&gt;1(1)sigma+ or 2(1)sigma+ --&gt; 1(1)sigma+ transition was monitored. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, the radiative lifetimes were monitored for 6(1)sigma+ --&gt; 2(1)sigma+ and 2(1)sigma+ --&gt; 1(1)sigma+ transition. The rate coefficients for deactivation of collisions with H2 were monitored for 6(1)sigma+ --&gt; 2(1)sigma+, 6(1)sigma+ --&gt; 1(1)sigma+ and 2(1)sigma+ --&gt;1(1)sigma+. When the density of H2 was 10(19) cm(-3), the total collisional transfer energy (15 426 cm(-1)) and radiative energy (10 215 cm(-1)) were obtained. The relative fraction ((f(v)), (f(R)), (f(T)) of average energy disposal was derived as (0.58, 0.03, 0.39); (f(v)), (f(R)), (f(T)) represent separately the relative fraction of average energy disposal among vibration, rotation and translation. The major vibrational and translational energy release supports the assumption that the 6(1)sigma(+) -H2 collision occurs primarily in a collisional energy transfer mechanism. In this experiment, alkali molecules relative energy population ratio was determined through using the time integrated intensity, so we can get the total transfer energy. That the NaK (6(1)sigma+) energy transfers to the H2 vibrational, rotational and translational energy was quantitatively given for the first time, which illustrates the collisional mechanism.",

In contrast to previous studies, the authors find that the predissociation dynamics is not well described by a single exponential decay. Biexponential modeling of the authors' data reveals a rapid decay pathway (tau&lt;50 fs), in addition to a longer lived channel (tau approximately 350-650 fs) that displays a marked change in apparent lifetime when the polarization of the pump laser is rotated with respect to that of the probe. Since the initially populated (1)B(2)((1)Sigma(u) (+)) state may decay to form either S((1)D) or S((3)P) products (the latter produced via a spin-orbit induced crossing from a singlet to a triplet electronic surface), this lifetime observation may be rationalized in terms of changes in the relative ionization cross section of these singlet and triplet states of CS(2) as a function of laser polarization geometry. The experimentally observed lifetime of the longer lived channel is therefore a superposition of these two pathways, both of which decay on very similar time scales.",

For the first time, electric dipole moments are also computed in the approach, including SO coupling for transitions to the states responsible for the first absorption continuum (A-band) of ArH(+). On this basis, the partial and total absorption spectra in this energy range are obtained. It is shown that absorption in the A-band is dominated by the parallel A(1)Sigma(+)&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) transition. In the low-energy part of the band (&lt;95 x 10(3) cm(-1)) the absorption is caused by the perpendicular B(1)Pi&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) excitation, but transitions to the b(3)Pi(0(+),1) states are also not negligible. The branching ratio Gamma for the final photodissociation products is calculated and it is shown to increase smoothly from 0 in the red tail of the band to 1 at E&gt;or= 10(5) cm(-1). The latter value corresponds to the exclusive formation of the spin-excited Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)) ions, and thus leads to the inverse population of the Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)-(2)P(3/2)) ion states.",

To distinguish the two states, the lower energy state is commonly designated as , and the higher energy state is designated as . The energy of an emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between the two states. Because the energy of each state is fixed, the energy difference between them is fixed, and the transition will always produce a photon with the same energy. The spectral lines are grouped into series according to . Lines are named sequentially starting from the longest wavelength/lowest frequency of the series, using Greek letters within each series.

For a typical excited state energy of 2 eV and width 100 meV , the onset is about 50 meV from the peak, leading to a fractional error of 2.5 %. For functions that vary as the fifth power of the energy, this contributes an error of less than 15 %the low end for the experimental uncertainty of the more accurate nonlinear-optical measurements. So, in using the peak values to obtain the energies, our calculations have an uncertainty of about 15 %; and, the positions of the peaks in our dispersion plots could be off by about 50 meV .\n\n\nA. Influence of the number of electrons\n\nA simple consequence of the Thomas-Khun sum-rules is that the two-photon cross-section of a molecule depends quadratically on the effective number of electrons.

The data follow an approximately linear relationship, indicating that even though the performance of a molecule is dictated by many factors, it correlates with the square of the effective electrons.

The cross sections for deactivation of K(6S) and K(4D) by collisions with H2 were measured. The temperature of the cell body was controlled at 413 K, and H2 pressure was varied between 4 and 40 Pa. The effects of K(6S, 4D)-K collisions could be neglected in our experimental condition. On excitation of K(6S) state, the decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the 6S--&gt;4P transition was monitored. The logarithmic plot for the time-resolved fluorescence of K(6S) atom was shown and the slope yielded an effective lifetime. When the pressure of H2 was successively increased, the time-resolved spectrum obviously had contributions from two components. At the beginning of the decay, the population of K(6S) was simply determined by the two-photon excitation and the decay curve provided the information on the effective lifetime of the K(6S) state under H2 collisions. After a prolonged period, the additional contribution of the K(6S) population from K(4D) state became important. The population of the K(4D) state increased with increasing the pressure of H2, which leading to more intense emission of the 4D--&gt;4P transition by comparison with the case in the absence of H2. The effective lifetime for depopulation of the 4D state by collisions with He can be treated analogously to the 6S state. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, radiation lifetimes are (97 +/- 15) ns for the 6S state and (300 +/- 45) ns for the 4D state. The radiation lifetimes in the absence of H2 collisions agree with those previously reported. The total cross sections for deactivation of excited K atoms by means of collisions with H2 are (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 6S state and (40 +/- 6) x 10(-14) cm2 for the 4D state. Upon excitation to the K(6S) state, the dependence on H2 pressure of integrated fluorescence in the transition 4D--&gt;4P was measured. The cross section (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(-14) cm2 for the transition 6S--&gt;4D was obtained. The authors conclude that the channel for energy depletion from the 6S state is predominantly through the physical quenching to the 4D state, although the KH product has been observed in the chemical reaction",

Thus, it might be possible to get a first answer, if mass scaling is applicable in the case of potassium at the present level of accuracy. At a first glance the obtained standard deviations are below 1.0, see section IV. Thus the evaluation is within the reported experimental accuracies. However, looking more closely to the deviations of the highly precise Feshbach resonances, where a magnetic field uncertainty of 0.05 G relates to an uncertainty in the order of 100 kHz in the frequency scale, the fit for 40 K 2 is excellent, but the scatter between the deviations for 39 K 2 is fairly large and for such small set of data too often at the limit of the experimental accuracy. This is not so obvious in the published fit of Ref. [13], because they used the less precise data of 40 K from Ref. [9] in their fit. We also would like to note, that the standard deviation, given as reduced \u03c7 2 with the value 0.52 is probably in error, we obtained with their data 1.04. Also for some data of the few photoassociation measurements on the isotope 39 K the deviations come close to the reported experimental uncertainties. Thus we would like to recommend new experiments for getting improved results from twocolor photoassociation, which are presently reported with a 40 MHz uncertainty limit, and to extend the measurements of Feshbach resonances, for which we will make predictions below (Fig. 3). In the same spirit we prepare presently high precision molecular beam studies on potassium as we performed in the case of Na 2 [28,29] some years ago. All this together might give the proper limit for mass scaling, i.e. of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, for the ground states of potassium atom pairs. For the excited asymptote s + p we already reported an experimental evidence of necessary corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [31].",

Good agreement is found between the current calculations and experiment for the lowest two (6)Sigma(+) states, the only states for which spectroscopic data are available.

The calculated lifetimes for pyrimidine nucleosides are 10-25% lower than the lifetimes measured in femtosecond transient absorption experiments. For the purine nucleosides, guanosine and adenosine, consideration of just the lowest 1pi --&gt; pi* transition led to predicted lifetimes that are three times greater than experimental ones. On the other hand, inclusion of both of the lowest energy 1pi --&gt; pi* absorption bands in the SB equation resulted in much better agreement with the experimental values. This suggests that both 1pi pi* states of the purine nucleosides contribute to their emission. Decay by the bright 1pi pi* state (or states, in the case of the purines) is believed to be responsible for the experimentally observed lifetimes.",

The importance of including the CC quantum scattering calculation has been revealed by the comparison between the CC calculation and the previous coupled state (CS) calculation. The CC total cross sections for the v = 2, 4, and 6 states show collision energy-dependent behaviors different from those based on the CS calculation. Furthermore, the collision energy dependence of the total cross sections obtained in the present CC calculation only exhibits minor oscillations, indicating that the chance is slim for reactive resonances in total cross sections to survive through the partial-wave averaging. The magnitude and profile of the CC total cross sections for v = 0-2 in the collision energy range of 0.0-2.5 eV are found to be consistent with experimental cross sections obtained recently by Tang et al.

The molecules were studied in solution in water and in dioxane. Fluorescence-time profiles were recorded in the wide wavelength range of 290 &lt;or= lambda(fl) &lt;or= 650 nm. The excitation wavelengths in the region of the first UV absorption band were tuned from close to the electronic origin (lambda(pump) = 294 nm) to excess energies of approximately 5400 cm(-1) above (lambda(pump) = 258 nm). Global fits to the measured curves turned out to reflect distinctive molecular relaxation processes on five well-defined time scales. Sub-100 fs and 0.52(3) ps lifetimes were found to predominate at the shortest UV and blue emission wavelengths in water, 1.5(1) and 3.0(2) ps components at intermediate wavelengths and a 62(1) ps value in the red region of the spectrum (2sigma error limits of the last digits in parentheses). In dioxane, these lifetimes changed to &lt;or=0.27 and 0.63(4) ps in the UV, 1.5(1) and 10.9(10) ps in a wide range of intermediate, and 1.40(4) ns at the longest wavelengths. However, little dependence of the respective time constants on lambda(pump) was observed, indicating that the ensuing relaxation processes proceed via practically barrierless pathways through conical intersections. Building on the knowledge for the parent molecule adenine (Ade), the observations were rationalized with the help of a modified four-state model for the electronic dynamics in DMAde with the pipi*(L(a)), pipi*(L(b)), and npi* states similar to those in Ade and an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state, which has no counterpart in Ade, responsible for the long-wavelength fluorescence.",

It is well known that each coefficient c(k)(t) separates into an adiabatic term a(k)(t) that reflects the adjustment of the ground state to the perturbation--without actual transitions--and a nonadiabatic term b(k)(t) that yields the probability amplitude for a transition to the excited state. In this work, we prove that the energy at any time t also separates completely into adiabatic and nonadiabatic components, after accounting for the secular and normalization terms that appear in the solution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation via Dirac's method of variation of constants. This result is derived explicitly through third order in the perturbation. We prove that the cross-terms between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts of c(k)(t) vanish, when the energy at time t is determined as an expectation value. The adiabatic term in the energy is identical to the total energy obtained from static perturbation theory, for a system exposed to the instantaneous perturbation \u03bbH'(t).

By evaluating the probabilities of transition to the excited eigenstates \u2223k'(t)&gt; of the instantaneous Hamiltonian H(t), we provide a physically transparent explanation of the result for E(t).

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

During the experiments, the cell temperature was kept constant at 420K.

The slope yielded the effective lifetime of the nu' = 2--&gt; nu' = 0 transition. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, the radiative lifetime (36 +/- 7) ns was obtained. The total cross sections for deactivation of 1(1) sigmau1 (nu'=2) state by means of collisions with He and H2 are (3.0 +/- 0.5) x 10(-16) cm2 and (6.4 +/- 1.2) x 10(-15) cm2, respectively.

Here we choose the simplest possible operator, whose matrix elements are [21]\n\u01eb i |V |\u01eb j = 1/ \u221a \u03c4 t d if i = 0, and 0 < j < M 0 otherwise,(5)\nwhere |\u01eb i is an eigenstate of the ground-state KS Hamiltonian in the absence of the interaction with the bath, \u01eb i is the corresponding eigenvalue, and the upper limit M is a given integer representing the number of states we keep in the simulation. (In the present case we have kept M = 15 states.) The parameter t d gives the timescale over which the decay will occur, with larger values of t d leading to longer decay times [22]. In the following we have chosen t d = 1 fs. The operatorV defined this way ensures that the stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation (4) is independent of the magnitude of \u03c4 . Clearly, the above operator reduces the projection of a wave-function from the states {|\u01eb 1 , |\u01eb 2 . . . |\u01eb M\u22121 }, and increases the projection onto the ground state |\u01eb 0 . Physically, it describes energy relaxation and dephasing.",

Contrary to what is usually assumed, the 3Q0+(A1), 3Q1(E), and 1Q(E)&lt;--X A1 transition moments are found to be strongly dependent on the C-I fragmentation coordinate. The sign of this dependence is opposite for the parallel and perpendicular transitions, which opens an opportunity for vibrational state control of the photodissociation product yields. The computed absorption intensity distribution and the I* quantum yield as a function of excitation energy are analyzed in comparison with existing experimental data, and good agreement between theory and experiment is found. It is predicted that significantly higher I* quantum yield values (&gt;0.9) may be achieved when vibrationally hot CH3I molecules are excited in the appropriate spectral range. It is shown that vibrational state control of the I*/I branching ratio in the alkyl (hydrogen) iodide photodissociation has an electronic rather than a dynamic nature: Due to a different electron density distribution at various molecular geometries, one achieves a more efficient excitation of a particular fragmentation channel rather than influences the dynamics of the decay process.",

Total energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit applying the focal point analysis. Zero-point vibrational energies are computed using fundamental (anharmonic) frequencies obtained from a quartic force field. Relativistic and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections are also taken into account. The quantum mechanical barrier with these corrections is predicted to be 6.4+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1) and the reaction exothermicity to be 8.8+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1). The importance of these parameters for the thermal NO(x) decomposition (De-NO(x)) process is discussed. The unimolecular rate constant for dissociation of the HN(2) molecule and its lifetime are estimated by canonical transition-state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory. The lifetime of the HN(2) molecule is here estimated to be 2.8x10(-10) s at room temperature. Our result is in marginal agreement with the latest experimental kinetic modeling studies (tau=1.5x10(-8) s), albeit consistent with the very rough experimental upper limit (tau&lt;0.5 mus). For the dissociation reaction, kinetic isotope effects are investigated. Our analysis demonstrates that the DN(2) molecule has a longer lifetime than the HN(2) molecule. Thus, DN(2) might be more readily identified experimentally. The ionization potential of the HN(2) molecule is determined by analogous high level ab initio methods and focal point analysis. The adiabatic IP of HN(2) is predicted to be 8.19+/-0.05 eV, in only fair agreement with the experimental upper limit of 7.92 eV deduced from sychrothon-radiation-based photoionization mass spectrometry.",

By applying the same spectroscopic method but improving the detection scheme, increasing the signal averaging time and selecting appropriate excited rovibrational levels to reach the long range regime we were able to observe levels with v \u2032\u2032 up to 60, while v \u2032\u2032 = 62 would be the last existing one for low J \u2032\u2032 .

By taking the C 8 coefficient from theory [12,13], which has in our modeling a larger uncertainty than the theoretically calculated C 8 coefficient, we derived an internally consistent set of the remaining two coefficients C 6 and C 10 . This leads to a further reduction of the uncertainties in the calculation of the scattering lengths for all combinations of natural abundant isotopes of Strontium. We were also able to give a reliable value for the dissociation energy D 0 of the X state.",

In this work, we present new experimental data on the E(v = 3, J = 52, 53) state lifetime of the diatomic iodine. Our experimental lifetime value is slightly lower than the measured lifetime of the higher vibrational E(v = 49) state [31]. However, within the errors, we conclude that the lifetime is not significantly affected by the ion pair potential. Lifetimes or decay rates as well as Doppler free linewidths may reveal the nature of the states involved by the scale of these quantities in relation to the long range interatomic interactions. For instance, in strontium ultracold homonuclear molecules, the short lifetime of the 1 u state implies that the state is equivalent to a two body superradiant state [47]. On the other hand, measurements of a long sequence of lifetimes as a function of (v, J) can reveal scaling laws in these quantities. Recently published articles reported a strong dependence of molecular lifetime on rovibrational level's wavefunctions [33,34]. This work will be followed by making series of lifetime measurements as a function of vibrational or rotational quantum numbers in diatomic molecules.\n\nFigure 1 :\n1(Color online) Partial potential energy curves of molecular iodine and doubleresonance excitation scheme are shown.

For the purposes of this discussion we do not distinguish between and an ion and a molecule, and we may therefore use the terms interchangeably. The RMS energy uncertainty is given by:\n\u2206E = kT 2 C v(1)\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C v is heat capacity [1,2,3]. One can estimate the heat capacity using the equipartition theorem. By analogy to the Debye theory of heat capacity of crystals, at room temperature we can assume that most of the vibrational degrees of freedom of a large protein molecule are low frequency modes and can therefore be considered to be fully thermally active. Each oscillator will contribute to the heat capacity, and there are three oscillators per atom. If the molecule contains vibrationally active atoms the equipartition theorem [3] predicts a heat capacity of C v = 3kN . Since we are dealing with large ions we ignore the fact that there are three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, which would effectively reduce by a count of six. After some substitutions and algebra we have:\n\u2206E = \u221a 3N kT(2)\nConsider an averagine molecule with chemical formula C 9877 H 15517 N 2715 O 2955 S 83 . In counting atoms to generate a value for N we exclude hydrogen atoms, because they are associated with high frequency modes which, generally speaking, are not thermally activated at ambient temperatures. We therefore calculate by counting the number of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms in the molecule, giving a value of N = 15, 630.\n\nSubstituting this into the Eq. (2) and assuming T = 300 we estimate the thermal energy uncertainty for a single ion to be \u2206E = 8.97 \u00d7 10 \u221219 J. Using the relationship between mass and energy from special relativity E = mc 2 we calculate the energy uncertainty to be equivalent to a mass uncertainty of \u2206m = 9.98 \u00d7 10 \u221236 kg or \u2206m = 6.00 \u00d7 10 \u22129 Da.",

In addition, neutron diffraction data can be collected from a single crystal at room temperature without radiation damage issues.

In the last ca. 5 years, new beamlines have come online at reactor neutron sources, such as BIODIFF at Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum and IMAGINE at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and at spallation neutron sources, such as MaNDi at ORNL and iBIX at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex. In addition, significant improvements have been made to existing beamlines, such as LADI-III at the Institut Laue-Langevin.

The geometries and frequencies of the stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES) are optimized at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory, and the energies are refined at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df) (single-point) level of theory.

A model PES is developed and used in quasi-classical trajectory calculations to obtain the capture rate constant and nascent energy distributions of ClOOCl* produced via the chaperon mechanism. A range of VDW binding energies from 1.5 to 9.0 kcal mol(-1) are investigated. The anisotropic PES for the ClO.N(2) complex and a separable anharmonic oscillator approximation are used to estimate the equilibrium constant for formation of the VDW complex. Rate constants, branching ratios to produce ClOOCl, and nascent energy distributions of excited ClOOCl* are discussed with respect to the VDW binding energy and temperature. Interestingly, even for weak VDW binding energies, the N(2) usually carries away enough energy to stabilize the nascent ClOOCl*, although the VDW equilibrium constant is small. For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant. For the calculated ClO.N(2) binding energy of 1.5 kcal mol(-1), the VDW equilibrium constant is small, and the chaperon mechanism is only important at very high pressures.",

To account for the continuous increase in the value of the specific heat with rise of temperature at high temperatures, the diatomic gas molecule must be imagined to be elastic. In order to deduce theoretical expressions for the temperature variation of the specific heat, assumptions have to be made and arbitrary constants have to be chosen to obtain as satisfactory an agreement as is possible between the results calculated from the proposed theory and those experimentally obtained, and a reasonable criticism of all theoretical developments would be that the resulting expression for the temperature variation of specific heat becomes more and more empirical in character as the number of assumptions made in its deduction is increased.

For high radical concentrations (\u223c100 mM) the leakage factor is approximately 1 and, provided sufficient microwave power is available, the saturation factor is also approximately 1. In this situation the DNP enhancement is solely a product of the ratio of the electron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios and the coupling factor enabling the latter to be directly determined. Although the use of high microwave power levels needed to ensure saturation causes rapid heating of the sample, this does not prevent maximum DNP enhancements, \u03b5(0), being obtained since T(1I) is very much less than the characteristic heating time at these concentrations. It is necessary, however, to know the temperature variation of T(1I) to allow accurate modelling of the behaviour. The DNP enhancement is found to vary linearly with temperature with \u03b5(0)(T) = -2 \u00b1 2 - (1.35 \u00b1 0.02)T for 6 \u00b0C \u2264 T \u2264 100 \u00b0C. The value determined for the coupling factor, 0.055 \u00b1 0.003 at 25 \u00b0C, agrees very well with the molecular dynamics simulations of Sezer et al. (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2009, 11, 6626) who calculated 0.0534, however the experimental values increase much more rapidly with increasing temperature than predicted by these simulations. Large DNP enhancements (|\u03b5(0)| &gt; 100) are reported at high temperatures but it is also shown that significant enhancements (e.g.\u223c40) can be achieved whilst maintaining the sample temperature at 40 \u00b0C by adjusting the microwave power and irradiation time. In addition, short polarisation times enable rapid data acquisition which permits further enhancement of the signal, such that useful liquid state DNP-NMR experiments could be carried out on very small samples.",

We have characterized the energetic and structural properties of unsupported neutral Aln (2 &lt;or= n &lt;or= 65) particles (clusters and nanoparticles) via molecular dynamics quenching simulations with a recently validated many-body analytic potential. For each particle size (n), the global minimum-energy structure, the distribution of the local energy minima, and the finite-temperature thermodynamics have been calculated, the latter by evaluating approximately 100,000 rovibrational partition functions for the low-energy isomers of the various particles. This analysis demonstrates that the dominant structures of clusters and nanoparticles depend on temperature as well as particle size and that one must consider statistical mechanics as well as electronic structure in determining the dominant structures, stabilities, and properties of nanoparticles. As a particularly dramatic example, although the electronic magic numbers of Aln are n = 13, 19, 23, 38, and 55 when thermal energy is neglected, the n = 38 magic number is found to become unstable relative to its neighbors (n = 37 and 39) at temperatures of 500 K and above due to vibrational energy and entropy effects. Furthermore, an energy-landscape analysis based on the probability of finding an isomer demonstrates that for many particle sizes, the global-minimum-energy structure on the potential energy surface is not the dominant structure at moderate temperatures, and other low-energy isomers may be dominant at temperatures as low as room temperature. For example, the four lowest-energy structures account for less than 50% of the population for n = 17, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41-43, 50, 56, 58, and 63-65 at 300 K and for n = 10, 11, and 17-65 at 1500 K. At 1500 K, even the 64 lowest-energy structures account for less than half the population for n = 23, 27-55, and 57-65. The increased importance of higher-energy structures at finite temperatures has important implications for understanding the size-selective reactivity and catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles. The isomeric energy (EIso), which is the difference between the thermal average energy of the particle and that of the corresponding global minimum structure in the ground electronic state, is introduced as an indicator of how well the thermochemical properties of a multi-isomer particle can be represented by those of the global minimum structure.

Levitation techniques have an increasing interest in recent years as important tools for scattering experiments. The main reasons for this interest are the low background signal, the purity of the sample and the possibility of performing experiments with small amounts of samples. In particular, we have shown that diffraction experiments are possible on D4, D1B and D22 with samples of only a few tens of mg. Among the different containerless methods, aerodynamic levitation combined with laser heating has proved to be a powerful and versatile technique for studying the structure, dynamics, and macroscopic properties of high-temperature liquids including insulating compounds (glasses, ceramics, and oxides) and metallic materials. The use this techniques is mainly adapted for studies of materials above the melting point and in the supercooled state condition maintaining a high degree of control in temperature. In particular, the atomic structure of liquid materials can be determined by measurements of the structure factor S(Q) and calculation of the corresponding pair correlation function g(r), as reported in this paper. The acoustic levitation is originally designed for the investigation of supercooled liquids and aqueous solutions in the temperature range from about \u221240 C to +40 C. This temperature range covers the supercooled region for water and many salt and biological solutions. By eliminating contact with container walls, sources of heterogeneous nucleation are avoided and it often becomes possible to cool liquids substantially below their equilibrium melting point. Here we show that this technique can be also adopted for powder diffraction with a small amount of sample in the beam obtaining good data quality necessary to make the data refinement. In particular, we have shown that diffraction experiments are possible on D4, D1B and D22 with samples of only a few tens of mg. The high adaptability on different neutron instruments of the levitation devices presented in this article offers the possibility to combine different neutron techniques. This is a very important point for an exhaustive analysis of materials based on multi-techniques and multi-scale approach.\n\n\nthis work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

Full scrambling of all five nuclei during the collision is assumed for the calculations and alternatively partial dynamical restrictions are considered. The ergodic principle of the collision is employed in two limiting cases, neglecting (weak ergodic limit) or accounting for explicit degeneracies of the reaction mechanisms (strong ergodic limit).

A critical discussion of the dependence of structural and thermal parameters on resolution for these compounds is presented. Results of refinements against X-ray data, cut off to different resolutions from the high-resolution data files, are compared to structural models derived from neutron diffraction experiments. The Independent Atom Model (IAM) and the Transferable Aspherical Atom Model (TAAM) are tested. The average differences between the X-ray and neutron structural parameters (with the exception of valence angles defined by H atoms) decrease with the increasing 2\u03b8max angle. The scale of differences between X-ray and neutron geometrical parameters can be significantly reduced when data are collected to the higher, than commonly used, 2\u03b8max diffraction angles (for Mo\u2005K\u03b1 2\u03b8max\u2005&gt;\u200565\u00b0). The final structural and thermal parameters obtained for the studied compounds using TAAM refinement are in better agreement with the neutron values than the IAM results for all resolutions and all compounds. By using TAAM, it is still possible to obtain accurate results even from low-resolution X-ray data. This is particularly important as TAAM is easy to apply and can routinely be used to improve the quality of structural investigations [Dominiak (2015 \u25b8). LSDB from UBDB. University of Buffalo, USA].

The first term in the phonon expansion (14) corresponds to recoil-less scattering from a rigid sD 2 lattice. When \u2206E = 0, such a scattering cannot change the neutron kinetic energy because of a very large mass of the sD 2 target. The next terms describe neutron scattering and possible rotational-vibrational transitions in D 2 with simultaneous creation (\u03c9 > 0) or annihilation (\u03c9 < 0) of phonons. In particular, the second term in Eq. (14) is connected with one-phonon processes. Equations (15) have been derived assuming\nthat Z(\u2212\u03c9) \u2261 Z(\u03c9).\nEvaluation of the incoherent cross section has been performed using the isotropic Debye model, characterized by the following density of vibrational states\nZ(\u03c9) = \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 3 \u03c9 2 /\u03c9 3 D if \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c9 D 0 if \u03c9 > \u03c9 D ,(17)\nwhere \u03c9 D = k B \u0398 D denotes the Debye energy corresponding to the Debye temperature \u0398 D .

For the calculation of cross sections at various temperatures, the following estimation of the Debye temperature\n\u0398 D = 2 1/2 (3\u03c0 2 ) 1/3 \u03b2 c s a hcp k B ,(18)\nhas been used. The sound velocity c s and the molar volume of sD 2 for calculation of the lattice constant a hcp have been taken from Ref. [16]. A constant correction factor \u03b2 = 1.085 in Eq.

Collected reflections were integrated using the latest version of the program VIIPP which uses separate K\u03b1(1)/K\u03b1(2) contributions to the profile fitting during integration. For each temperature both anharmonic and harmonic descriptions of the atomic thermal motion were utilized in the model refinements along with the multipole expansion of the electron density. H atoms were refined anisotropically and agree well with a previous neutron study. Topological analysis [Bader (1990). Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory.

For 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (HMX), old data collected at 20 and 120 K were re-integrated with the new version of VIIPP and refined in the same manner as for RDX. In both cases theoretical structure factors were also calculated based on the 20 K structures, and employed in comparison multipole refinements for the atoms at rest. Limiting the refinement to a harmonic model of the atomic displacements may result in a biased and erroneous electron density, especially when atomic vibrations are significant (as in RDX) and at temperatures higher than obtained by using liquid helium. Given the similarity of the two compounds the effects of anharmonic motion are strikingly more severe in the case of RDX. Our study reinforces the conclusion of Meindl et al. [Acta Cryst. (2010), A66, 362-371] that in certain cases it is necessary to include anharmonic term(s) of the probability density function (or temperature factor) in order to obtain a meaningful electron density suitable for topological analysis, even for compact (high-density) light-atom structures. For RDX it was observed that the oxygen lone-pair concentrations of electrons are located close to perpendicular to the N-O bond vectors, which is typical for explosive materials. Conjugation of the electron density in the -N-NO(2) fragment has been established based on the topological bond orders. Nine moderately strong hydrogen bonds and nine N-N, O-N and O-O bonding interactions were found and described. The RDX molecular electronic energy per mole is 4.02-4.04 a.u., very close to the reported value for HMX.",

This has been compounded by observations of specific X-ray damage to the crystallized protein (for an early example, see Helliwell, 1988). Conducting crystallography at physiological temperatures has then become an objective, but what about radiation damage being much greater at room temperature? Neutron macromolecular crystallography (nMX), whilst pursuing protein structures with experimentally determined protonation states, has also automatically yielded room-temperature structures. Given also that projects succeed in obtaining neutron beam time only when all other methods (X-ray, electron or NMR based) have failed, it is clear that in structural biology there is an improved strategic importance of the nMX method. Indeed, nMX has seen a sustained growth in the number and scope of instruments, and of the software and methods employed, at neutron sources (see, for example, Blakeley & Podjarny, 2018). Furthermore, the new X-ray lasers yield X-ray diffraction data at room temperature and before radiation damage can kick in: the 'diffract before the sample is destroyed' approach (Neutze et al., 2000). Synchrotron facilities are now also adopting the X-ray laser method of 'serial femtosecond crystallography' for the delivery of streams of micrometre-sized samples and thereby are also yielding results at physiological temperatures, albeit not free of radiation damage as at X-ray lasers (see, for example, Schlichting, 2015). An amazing accomplishment, to my mind, is the room-temperature crystal structure of the 30S ribosome using the Stanford Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS; Dao et al., 2018). However, the use of streams of micrometre-sized crystals raises the question of variations in these samples of the biological molecules.",

The sample was cooled using a closed-cycle He refrigerator, and data collected at 50 K, 100 K, 150 K, 200 K and 290 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at X7A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The sample was carefully packed between Kapton foils to avoid texture formation, and mounted within a closed cycle helium refrigerator. Data were collected at 50 K and 300 K in symmetric transmission geometry using 29.08 keV synchrotron radiation (\u03bb = 0.4257\u00c5). Scattered radiation was collected with an intrinsic germanium detector connected to a multichannel analyzer. Several runs were conducted and the resulting X-ray diffraction patterns were averaged to improve the statistical accuracy and reduce any systematic effect due to instabilities in the experimental setup. The raw data were background-subtracted, corrected for flux and experimental effects such as sample absorption and multiple scattering, and normalized. 14 From the normalized data the total scattering structure function, S(Q), 12 is obtained, where Q = |Q| = |k \u2212 k 0 | represents momentum transfer (magnitude of the scattering vector). The PDF function, G(r), is then obtained by a Fourier transformation according to\nG(r) = 2 \u03c0 \u221e 0 Q[S(Q) \u2212 1] sin(Qr) dQ.(1)",

In contrast to previous interpretation of the R&lt;--&gt;T transition in some CPs as cation ordering, T-distortion is regarded here as a particular case of general adaptation of the framework to cation insertion, which includes the deformations of the coordination polyhedra and their tilting. The research is based on a combination of experimental studies (in-situ neutron diffraction at different temperatures) for one model compound, MgMo6Se8, and structural analysis for a variety of known CPs. This analysis shows that the structure flexibility is fundamentally different for the R and T forms. As a result of the lower flexibility, in the R form, a strict correlation exists between the compression of the framework along the -3 symmetry axis and the cation position in the structure (the so-called 'delocalization'). The decreasing delocalization in the R-CPs, which occurs on cooling, leads to excessive repulsion within the cations pairs (R-Cu1.8Mo6S8 case) or undesirable asymmetry in the cation polyhedra (R-MgMo6Se8 case). The higher flexibility of the T framework allows for relaxation of these structural strains by increasing the cation-cation distances and forming a more symmetric cation environment, sometimes with higher coordination number (CN), like CN=5 in the T-Fe2Mo6S8 type. Thus, this work also proposes possible driving forces for T-distortion in CPs.",

The entire sample environment was under vacuum. To prevent evaporation, the capillaries were sealed with Torrseal. After the seal has become sufficiently dry, samples were set in a triple sample holder made from copper and connected directly to the cold head of a closed circle refrigerator (CCR).Temperature was controlled by a LakeShore 331 temperature controller and the measurement software of the beamline was modified to set and register temperatures. The temperature was measured on the surface of the triple sample holder.

Accurate gas-phase heats of formation were obtained using coupled cluster with single and double excitations and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) valence electron calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit with additional corrections including core/valence, scalar relativistic, and spin-orbit corrections to predict the atomization energies and scaled harmonic frequencies to correct for zero point and thermal energies and estimate entropies. Computationally cheaper calculations were also performed using the G3MP2 and G3B3 variants of the Gaussian 03 method, as well as density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional. The G3MP2 heats of formation are too positive by up to approximately 6 kcal/mol as compared with CCSD(T)/CBS values. The more expensive G3B3 method predicts heats of formation that are too negative as compared with the CCSD(T)/CBS values by up to 3-4 kcal/mol. DFT using the B3LYP functional and 6-311+G** basis set predict isodesmic reaction energies to within a few kcal/mol compared with the CCSD(T)/CBS method so isodesmic reactions involving BN compounds and the analogous hydrocarbons can be used to estimate heats of formation. Heats of formation of c-B3N3H12 and c-B3N3H6 are -95.5 and -115.5 kcal/mol at 298 K, respectively, using our best calculated CCSD(T)/CBS approach. The experimental value for c-B3N3H6 appears to be approximately 7 kcal/mol too negative. Enthalpies, entropies, and free energies are calculated for many dehydrocoupling and dehydrogenation reactions that convert BNH6 to alicyclic and cyclic oligomers and H2(g). Generally, the reactions are highly exothermic and exergonic as well because of the release of 1 or more equivalents of H2(g). For c-B3N3H12 and c-B3N3H6, available experimental data for sublimation and vaporization lead to estimates of their condensed phase 298 K heats of formation: DeltaHf degrees [c-B3N3H12(s)] = -124 kcal/mol and DeltaHf degrees [c-B3N3H6(l)] = -123 kcal/mol. The reaction thermochemistries for the dehydrocoupling of BNH6(s) to c-B3N3H12(s) and the dehydrogenation of c-B3N3H12(s) to c-B3N3H6(l) are much less exothermic compared with the gas-phase reactions due to intermolecular forces which decrease in the order BNH6 &gt; cyclo-B3N3H12 &gt; cyclo-B3N3H6.

NCN concentration-time profiles were measured by sensitive narrow-line-width laser absorption at a wavelength of \u03bb = 329.1302 nm.

The blackbody spectrum matches the solar spectrum quite well. A blackbody is a convenient, ideal emitter that approximates the behavior of many materials when heated. It is \"ideal\" in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed\nwith a spectrometer so that the wavelengths and their intensities can be measured. Figure 3.10 shows the resulting curves for some representative temperatures. Each distribution depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, $\\lambda_{\\max }$, shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high temperatures begin to glow a darker red that becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming white hot at very high temperatures as the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable.

The values of \u03bbmax can be used for determining the spectra (wavelength dependence) of the vibrational temperatures . In the faint nonequilibrium emission bands, the spectral transmission \u03bb \u2192 1 and small values of (1 \u2212 \u03bb ) cannot be observed experimentally. In that case, the vibrational temperatures obtained for the fainter bands can be used to find the spectral absorption coefficients and integral intensities of the faint emission bands whose absolute emission spectra have been recorded by measurement devices. In order to determine the degree of nonequilibrium of the OH group emission, their transmission spectra were measured under the same conditions as those for measuring the emission spectra. The structure of the transmission spectra correlates with the structure of the emission spectra. The resulting spectral variations in \u03bb and \u03bbmax ( fig. 17) are rapidly varying. The degree of variation in the 281-296 nm range is slightly higher than in the 306-328 nm range. The maximum value of \u03bbmax for T=2380 K is 100. In the 306-328 nm band, \u03bbmax reaches 50 ( fig. 17). It should be noted that the spectral dependences of \u03bb for different temperatures are essentially different. From our standpoint, the reason for this is that it is impossible to make the conditions for obtaining the emission and transmission spectra completely identical, since they have were not recorded simultaneously. The existence of a spectral variation in \u03bbmax indicates that the vibrational temperature may depend on the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. In addition, the shape of the spectrum lines may have an effect on the value of \u03bb . Turbulent inhomogeneity during burning of the flame may also have some effect on \u03bb . For practical calculations it is appropriate to introduce the average degree of nonequilibricity max and the absolute spectral intensities of the nonequilibrium emission from the hydroxyl group have been used to determine the spectral absorption coefficients and the integrated absorption intensity of the OH for the",

The classical barrier height (10.6+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1)) and exothermicity (3.6+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1)) for the HN(2)--&gt;N(2)+H reaction are predicted by high level ab initio quantum mechanical methods [up to CCSDT(Q)]. Total energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit applying the focal point analysis. Zero-point vibrational energies are computed using fundamental (anharmonic) frequencies obtained from a quartic force field. Relativistic and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections are also taken into account. The quantum mechanical barrier with these corrections is predicted to be 6.4+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1) and the reaction exothermicity to be 8.8+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1). The importance of these parameters for the thermal NO(x) decomposition (De-NO(x)) process is discussed. The unimolecular rate constant for dissociation of the HN(2) molecule and its lifetime are estimated by canonical transition-state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory. The lifetime of the HN(2) molecule is here estimated to be 2.8x10(-10) s at room temperature. Our result is in marginal agreement with the latest experimental kinetic modeling studies (tau=1.5x10(-8) s), albeit consistent with the very rough experimental upper limit (tau&lt;0.5 mus). For the dissociation reaction, kinetic isotope effects are investigated. Our analysis demonstrates that the DN(2) molecule has a longer lifetime than the HN(2) molecule. Thus, DN(2) might be more readily identified experimentally. The ionization potential of the HN(2) molecule is determined by analogous high level ab initio methods and focal point analysis. The adiabatic IP of HN(2) is predicted to be 8.19+/-0.05 eV, in only fair agreement with the experimental upper limit of 7.92 eV deduced from sychrothon-radiation-based photoionization mass spectrometry.",

Starting from the elastic limit, lim \u2206 * \u2192\u221e T max = 198T (0), the maximum temperature decreases as \u2206 * decreases as would be expected since lower values mean that more atoms can participate in inelastic collisions. A minimum is reached near \u2206 * = 40 where T max \u223c 47T (0). It is interesting that at this minimum in T max (\u2206 * ), one has \u2206/T max \u223c 1 so that the cooling that occurs is maximal according to eq. (19). For smaller values of \u2206 * , the maximum temperature increases until at \u2206 * = 1 the maximum temperature is 284T (0) or about 50% higher than in the elastic, \u2206 * = 0, case.

The extensively used Spitzer model for thermal conduction in ideal plasmas breaks down for high-density, low-temperature shells that are compressed by shocks and spherical convergence in imploding targets. A variety of thermal-conductivity models have been proposed for ICF hydrodynamic simulations of such coupled and degenerate plasmas. The accuracy of these \u03ba models for DT plasmas has recently been tested against first-principles calculations using the quantum molecular-dynamics (QMD) method; although mainly for high densities (\u03c1 &gt; 100 g/cm3), large discrepancies in \u03ba have been identified for the peak-compression conditions in ICF. To cover the wide range of density-temperature conditions undergone by ICF imploding fuel shells, we have performed QMD calculations of \u03ba for a variety of deuterium densities of \u03c1 = 1.0 to 673.518 g/cm3, at temperatures varying from T = 5 \u00d7 103 K to T = 8 \u00d7 106 K.

Compared with the \"hybrid\" Spitzer-Lee-More model currently adopted in our hydrocode lilac, the hydrosimulations using the fitted \u03baQMD have shown up to \u223c20% variations in predicting target performance for different ICF implosions on OMEGA and direct-drive-ignition designs for the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The lower the adiabat of an imploding shell, the more variations in predicting target performance using \u03baQMD. Moreover, the use of \u03baQMD also modifies the shock conditions and the density-temperature profiles of the imploding shell at early implosion stage, which predominantly affects the final target performance. This is in contrast to the previous speculation that \u03baQMD changes mainly the inside ablation process during the hot-spot formation of an ICF implosion. ",

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies. For example, for the XY (n=2) version of the present model, such a behavior was observed only near criticality. It is shown also that the (metastable state) maximum Lyapunov exponent decreases with N like lambda(max) approximately N-kappa, where for the initial conditions employed herein (maximal magnetization), kappa=0.225+/-0.030, both above and below the critical point.",

The only information that this calculation gives us is that electrons are projected from the dark space into the gas in the remainder of the tube, with energies of this order and greater energies. In the experiments carried On the Evolution out the conditions lay between the limits indicated in the following The average energy with which the electrons are projected through the gas probably corresponds to considerably higher temperatures than these. The upper limit to this energy is fixed by the total voltage drop. This would correspond to temperatures of 6,700,000\u00b0 and 21,000,000\u00b0 respectively.\n\nThe changes which give rise to the large evolution of energy in giant stars certainly take place in those of type M. For these, according to Eddington's theory of the internal constitution of stars,* the maximum temperature at the centre is 1,400,000\u00b0. For giant stars of type F, in which the changes still occur, the maximum temperature is 6,590,000\u00b0. These figures show that the energies of the electrons in the discharge tube were such that the effect might have been expected to take place.\n\nThe order of effect to be expected cannot be estimated. The energy radiated by a giant star amounts to roughly 200 ergs per second per gramme mass of star. We do not know how much of this mass is hydrogen. The mass of hydrogen present in the discharge tube of volume 70 c.c. would be 00000042 grin, at a pressure of 0-5 mm. of mercury. Assuming that the star consists wholly of hydrogen, and that the same figure, namely, 200 ergs per second per gramme, which applies to all giant stars, also applies to the discharge tube, the energy evolved by these changes would be 8 x 10~4 ergs per second. This would be about 10\"11 of the heat evolved by the passage of the discharge. We see, therefore, that the negative result of this experi ment does not in any way affect the hypothesis put forward by Eddington as to the origin of stellar energy.\n\nAnother point that should be mentioned is that, if the close combination of an electron and a hydrogen nucleus did occur, the energy evolved might not appear directly as heat, but might come out in the form of a very penetrating 7-ray, which would escape detection in ordinary experiments.",

We can naturally perform a calculation for this quantity, as we will do below. However the necessary ingredients to obtain numerical results, namely band structure informations and mostly renormalization due to the interactions, are not precisely known. Moreover \u03bb i (0) is found by performing an averaging over the whole Fermi surface. Hence its physical content is essentially unrelated to the other ingredients of Eq. (12) for which only the vicinity of the nodes is relevant : they give a very local information while \u03bb i (0) contains a global one. Therefore we might just take \u03bb i (0) from experiment itself, which gives [9] the currently accepted values of \u03bb a (0) = 1600\u00c5 and \u03bb b (0) = 1000\u00c5.

We have characterized the energetic and structural properties of unsupported neutral Aln (2 &lt;or= n &lt;or= 65) particles (clusters and nanoparticles) via molecular dynamics quenching simulations with a recently validated many-body analytic potential. For each particle size (n), the global minimum-energy structure, the distribution of the local energy minima, and the finite-temperature thermodynamics have been calculated, the latter by evaluating approximately 100,000 rovibrational partition functions for the low-energy isomers of the various particles. This analysis demonstrates that the dominant structures of clusters and nanoparticles depend on temperature as well as particle size and that one must consider statistical mechanics as well as electronic structure in determining the dominant structures, stabilities, and properties of nanoparticles. As a particularly dramatic example, although the electronic magic numbers of Aln are n = 13, 19, 23, 38, and 55 when thermal energy is neglected, the n = 38 magic number is found to become unstable relative to its neighbors (n = 37 and 39) at temperatures of 500 K and above due to vibrational energy and entropy effects. Furthermore, an energy-landscape analysis based on the probability of finding an isomer demonstrates that for many particle sizes, the global-minimum-energy structure on the potential energy surface is not the dominant structure at moderate temperatures, and other low-energy isomers may be dominant at temperatures as low as room temperature. For example, the four lowest-energy structures account for less than 50% of the population for n = 17, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41-43, 50, 56, 58, and 63-65 at 300 K and for n = 10, 11, and 17-65 at 1500 K. At 1500 K, even the 64 lowest-energy structures account for less than half the population for n = 23, 27-55, and 57-65. The increased importance of higher-energy structures at finite temperatures has important implications for understanding the size-selective reactivity and catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles. The isomeric energy (EIso), which is the difference between the thermal average energy of the particle and that of the corresponding global minimum structure in the ground electronic state, is introduced as an indicator of how well the thermochemical properties of a multi-isomer particle can be represented by those of the global minimum structure. Particularly low values for Al12, Al13, Al19, Al48, Al53, Al54, and Al56 have been found in a wide temperature range.",

Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be easily evaluated by substitution. The rule is named after the 17th-century French mathematician Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital. Although the rule is often attributed to L'H\u00f4pital, the theorem was first introduced to him in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli. L'H\u00f4pital's rule states that for functions and which are differentiable on an open interval except possibly at a point contained in , if and for all in with , and exists, then The differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be evaluated directly.

At this stage, there may be two adjacent terms of equal numerical value; when the least term of the asymptotic series is spoken of, it is in reference to the first of these two terms. The sum of the initial terms of the asymptotic series up to, and including, the least term often furnishes a fair approximation to the desired value of the function being evaluated. It was early observed by computers that if the terms of the asymptotic series alternate in sign, this approximation was often improved by replacing the least term by its half. The factor by which the least term of the asymptotic series must be multiplied so that the true value of the function being evaluated is obtained by addition of this modified least term to the remaining initial terms of the asymptotic series is known as the converging factor for the asymptotic series. The converging factor for the asymptotic series involved in the calculation of the exponential integral, for large negative values of the argument, was given as a power series in the reciprocal of the argument by Airey; the first term of this series is (1/2). A method for the determination of the coefficients of this series is given.",

The approach involves solving the corresponding Dirichlet problem H(R)Psi(R)=E(R)Psi(R) on a finite interval [-R,R] by the Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbation theory (RSPT). The method is based on the fact that E(R),Psi(R) converge to E,Psi as R--&gt; infinity. The model problems to study the summability properties of the RSPT series E(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))(R)lambda(k) are the anharmonic oscillators H=p(2)+x(2)+lambda(x)(2M), with M=2,3,4 for which the RSPT produces strongly divergent series E= sum(infinity)(k=0)E((k))lambda(k). The summation of the latter series with large lambda for the octic case is considered as an extremely challenging summation problem, in part, since it was rigorously proven that the Pad\u00e9 approximants cannot converge and the two-point Pad\u00e9 approximants, which combine information of the renormalized weak coupling and strong coupling expansions, give relatively good results. The calculations of this work show that the ordinary Pad\u00e9 approximants from the sole un-normalized E(R) series for the octic oscillator give accurate results with small or large lambda. The coefficients E((k))(R) are calculated with the eigenvalue series of an operator H(Rn), whose resolvent converges to that of H(R) as n--&gt; infinity. The Pad\u00e9 approximants of the RSPT eigenfunction series Psi(R)= sum(infinity)(k=0)psi((k))(R)lambda(k) also provide accurate results for the octic oscillator.",

We also see that the errors aren't affected by the choice of solar normalization, since the solar terms are no longer part of the equation. Meaning, if we say that we have [Q/H] = 0.0 \u00b1 0.05 dex, that is the same as saying A(Q) = 7.46 \u00b1 0.05. Therefore, the errors would be the same for [Q/H] and A(Q). Taking this a step further, we propagate the errors for two elements in dex-abundance-notation, namely Eq. 15. The standard method for propagating errors is to convert the total uncertainty to fractional uncertainty for both elements in the numerator (num) and denominator (denom) and then add those fractional uncertainties in quadrature: (\u03b4 num /num) 2 + (\u03b4 denom /denom) 2 , per Taylor (1997, their Eq. 3.47). We therefore add the error in quadrature in order to get the fractional error of the molar ratio Q/R: (10) \n\u03b4 Q * R * = \u03b4Q * |Q * | 2 + \u03b4R * |R * | 2 = ln\nWe note that while Eq. 20 is nearly identical to Eq. 6 presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018, since ln(10) \u2248 2.303), the results from Eq. 6 were treated as full uncertainties in moles when in reality the equation calculates fractional or percentage errors. As a result, the error values provided in Table 5 of Hinkel & Unterborn (2018) were all overreported. Therefore, it is our intention that the detailed walk-through presented here that resulted in Eq. 20 will supersede what was presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018).\n\n\nEXAMPLE CASE",

Thus, to calculate the stoichiometry by mass, the number of molecules required for each reactant is expressed in moles and multiplied by the molar mass of each to give the mass of each reactant per mole of reaction. The mass ratios can be calculated by dividing each by the total in the whole reaction. Elements in their natural state are mixtures of isotopes of differing mass, thus atomic masses and thus molar masses are not exactly integers. For instance, instead of an exact 14:3 proportion, 17.04 kg of ammonia consists of 14.01 kg of nitrogen and 3 \u00d7 1.01 kg of hydrogen, because natural nitrogen includes a small amount of nitrogen-15, and natural hydrogen includes hydrogen-2 (deuterium).",

Elemental nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions, constituting 78.08% by volume of Earth's atmosphere. The element nitrogen was discovered as a separable component of air, by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford, in 1772. It occurs naturally in form of two isotopes: nitrogen-14 and nitrogen-15. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong bond in elemental nitrogen dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in breaking the bond to convert the molecule into useful compounds, but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn, explode, or decay back into nitrogen gas.",

Assuming an initial elemental 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the local ISM equal to 441, for a typical cloud age around 3-6\uf0b410 5 years and a total density of N(H2) = 2\uf0b410 4 cm -3 , the model leads to some nitrogen fractionation, with 14 N/ 15 N ratios around 400 for most of the species (N2H + , NH3, HCN, CN, \u2026) and 360 for HNC. This depletion induced fractionation effect for nitrogen is only efficient because atomic nitrogen is relatively unreactive in the gas-phase (Daranlot et al. 2013, Daranlot et al. 2012, Daranlot et al. 2011, so that sticking onto grains is the dominant loss process. Although the difference of the accretion rate between 14 N and 15 N is small, the effect is large enough to remove a few tens of percent more 14 N atoms from the gas-phase when the accretion time reaches 4 \uf0b4 10 5 years. As the remaining atomic nitrogen in the gas-phase is depleted in 14 N, all nitrogen bearing species formed through gasphase chemistry will reflect these higher 15 N levels with various values depending on the individual formation mechanisms (such as N + CH \u2192 CN + H for example). Although the calculated 14 N/ 15 N values for NH3, HCN, HNC, CN and HC3N are lower than those obtained in earlier models they are still above the observed values shown in Table 1. The effect is not very large for evolved clouds because for cloud chemical ages in the range 3-6\uf0b410 5 years, most of the nitrogen has already been removed from the gas-phase. So even if the gas-phase is depleted in 14 N, the 14 N/ 15 N fraction for species formed on grains is close to or slightly above the elemental 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the local ISM. Desorption mechanisms will release 14 N-bearing molecules back into the gas-phase resulting in a reduction in the gas-phase fractionation levels for",

The element nitrogen is the active ingredient for agricultural purposes, so the mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and economic concern for consumers choosing among these fertilizers.

Models of interstellar chemistry are unable to induce nitrogen fraction in cold molecular clouds as exchange reactions for 15 N are mostly inefficient. Here, we developed a new gas-grain model for nitrogen fractionation including a thorough search for new nitrogen fractionation reactions and a realistic description of atom depletion onto interstellar dust particles. We show that, while dense molecular cloud gas-phase chemistry alone leads to very low fractionation, 14 N atoms are preferentially depleted from the gas-phase due to a mass dependent grain surface sticking rate for atomic nitrogen. However, assuming an elementary 14 N/ 15 N ratio of 441 (equal to the solar wind value), our model leads to only low 15 N enrichment for all Ncontaining species synthesized in the gas-phase with predicted 14 N/ 15 N ratios in the range 360-400. Higher enrichment levels can neither be explained by this mechanism, nor through chemistry, with two possible explanations. (I) The elementary 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the local ISM is smaller, as suggested by the recent work of Romano et al, with an hypothetic 15 NNH + and 15 NNH + depletion due to variation of the electronic recombination rate constant variation with the isotopes. (II) N2 photodissociation leads to variable nitrogen fractionation in diffuse molecular clouds where photons play an important role, which is conserved during dense molecular cloud formation as suggested by the work of Furuya & Aikawa.\n\nINTRODUCTION",

They obtained some 15 N fractionation due essentially to the isotope selective photodissociation of N2, whereas chemistry is inefficient. As we consider Av = 10 in our study we cannot reproduce such effects. In their work, they consider the difference in the adsorption rates for 14 N and 15 N. However, in their model this effect is likely to be significantly smaller than the 15 N atomic enrichment in the gas phase due to the photodissociation of N 15 N. This is because N is depleted onto grains when Av is in the 0-2 range where isotope selective photodissociation of N2 is at work and very efficient. However, Lawson et al. (2011) showed that the DR of N2H + , 15 N2H + and N2D + have notable differences (more than 20%) between 300 K and 500 K, the DR reaction of N2H + being more efficient that the DR reactions of 15 N2H + and N2D + . However, that result does not necessarily mean that the DR reactions of N 15 NH + and 15 NNH + are less efficient than N2H + at low temperature due to their complexity. Indeed, the difference in ZPE may favor intercrossing curves between the ions and the neutral for 15 NNH + and N 15 NH + leading to an unexpected increase at low temperature. Experimental measurements of the DR rates of 15 NNH + and N 15 NH + are clearly needed but higher DR rate constants for N 15 NH + and 15 NNH + than the equivalent N2H + one could be possible. If the DR reactions of N 15 NH + and N 15 NH + are more efficient than the N2H + one, the N2H + /N 15 NH + and N2H + /N 15 NH + ratios will increase above and beyond the input nitrogen isotope ratio value. When gas-phase CO is low, the main loss for N2H + is DR. Then, if the rate constants for the DR of 15 NNH + and N 15 NH + are more efficient than the",

(2022).It is conceivable that for different combinations of H 2 and N 2 column density, we might find different trends in the CN, HCN, and HNC 14 N/ 15 N ratios.Similar arguments apply to the analysis of the 12 C/ 13 C ratios.More detailed modeling is required to quantify this and to reach robust conclusions as regards the comparison to the observations.Also, we note that the observed spatial variations in the 14 N/ 15 N ratios may be due not only to selective self-shielding, but also to local variations in the 12 C/ 13 C ratio in the molecules.Based on the present simulation results, the latter effect might be dominant.(Spezzano et al. 2022 assumed a constant 12 C/ 13 C ratio of 68 for all molecules in their sample.)We will investigate this topic in more detail in a future work, which will include detailed prestellar core simulations that allow for a quantitative assessment of the effects of localized variations in the 12 C/ 13 C ratio.In that work, we will also investigate the abundance gradients of other molecules that are implied by the results of simulations S1 to S3.\n\n\nEffect of H 2 OPR",

The dominant form of nitrogen in diffuse clouds is the atomic form with a small fraction of the molecular form (Viala et al. 1986;Knauth et al. 2004). In dense molecular clouds, atomic N is (at least in part) converted into gaseous and icy molecules (e.g., Herbst & Klemperer 1973;Hily-Blant et al. 2010), but the primary form of nitrogen is not well constrained. Gas-ice astrochemical models often predict most nitrogen is present as NH 3 ice and N 2 gas and ice (e.g., Daranlot et al. 2012;Chang & Herbst 2014).\n\nObservations have revealed that N-bearing molecules in prestellar cores are enriched in or depleted in 15 N depending on molecules. Figure 5 shows the observationally derived N/ 15 N ratio taken from literature.

However, the PAMPRE nitrogen isotopic data may give new constraints for nitrogen isotopic modeling in Titan's atmosphere, knowing that nitrogen isotopic composition of Titan's aerosols has not been measured yet. N 2 photodissociation and self-shielding isotopic effects calculated by Liang et al., 2007 resulted in a factor of ~ 2.4 too large 15 N/ 14 N ratio for HCN ( 15 N/ 14 N = 4.35 10 -2 , Liang et al. 2007) compared to the observations ( 15 N/ 14 N = 1.79 \u00b1 0.26 10 -2 , Vinatier et al. 2007). These authors thus suggested that an additional source of unfractionated atomic nitrogen, produced by ion/electron-impact induced N 2 dissociation was required to counterbalance the too large effect of self-shielding. Isotopic effects described in the present study may contribute to counterbalance the calculated self-shielding 15 N-enrichment. We can roughly quantify by a simple mass balance calculation the importance of KIF for nitrogen isotopes in Titan's atmosphere. Assuming a -20\u2030 isotopic kinetic effect with 10 % of electron-impact dissociated N 2 on the dayside (Lavvas et al. 2011) and 100% of electronimpact dissociated N 2 on the nightside, such a calculation provides a final 15 N/ 14 N ratio of 2.25 10 -2 . Hence, the discrepancy between the HCN isotopic ratio calculated by the selfshielding model and the measured one is reduced by factor 2. This demonstrates that KIF may play a role in the nitrogen isotopes balance in Titan's atmosphere; yet, such a calculation stays a rough quantification and should be taken carefully. Besides, as first pointed out by Croteau et al., 2011, photoionization,",

We also include the reactions discussed in Loison et al. (2014) in their study of HCN/HNC chemistry. We explicitly include deuterium, 13 C, and 15 N molecular compounds in our chemical network. The reactions displayed in Table 1, have been included, which allows us to test the hypothesis of a constant 12 C/ 13 C isotopic ratio to derive the 14 N/ 15 N ratio in C 15 N containing molecules. We take the role of the ortho/para ratio of molecular H 2 into account in the H 2 D + + H 2 and 14 N + ( 15 N + ) + H 2 chemical reactions in an approximate way: we did not compute the full ortho/para equilibrium as in the models of Flower et al. (2006), Pagani et al. (2011), Faure et al. (2013) and instead introduce it as a model parameter, which can be varied. Faure et al. (2013) have found a value of 10 \u22123 for temperatures below 15 K. Apart from exchange reactions, reactions involving isotopic molecules are assumed to have the same total rate constant as those involving the main isotope except for the reaction of 15 N + with H 2 /HD/D 2 . The various reaction channels are obtained from statistical considerations, in the absence of experimental information. We restrict carbon-containing molecules to three carbon atoms, nitrogen-containing molecules to two nitrogen atoms, and consider full deuteration as in our previous studies (Roueff et al. 2005). Within these constraints, the number of species considered in the model is 307 linked through more than 5400 chemical reactions. We consider two different models as displayed in Table 4. Model (a) may be considered as a template of TMC1, and it assumes a density of hydrogen nuclei n H = 2 \u00d7 10 4 cm \u22123 .",

The model predicts that at typical NO x concentrations used during the chamber experiments (7.7-62.4 nmol mol \u22121 ), isotopic equilibrium would be reached within 15 min (see Appendix B). Since the sample collection usually started 1 h after NO x was well mixed in the chamber, there was sufficient time to reach full isotope equilibrium.

Photodissociation of N 2 is subject to self-shielding. Because N 15 N is much less abundant than N 2 , N 15 N needs a higher column density of the ISM gas for self-shielding. As a result, in some regions, N 15 N is selectively photodissociated and then N 2 is depleted in 15 N, while atomic N is enriched in 15 N. Heays et al. (2014) developed a gas-phase astrochemical model of a molecular cloud, considering both isotope selective photodissociation of N 2 and isotope exchange reactions for 15 N fractionation. They found that the isotope selective photodissociation is at work only in the limited regions, where the interstellar UV radiation field is not significantly attenuated and the transition from atomic nitrogen to N 2 occurs. In these regions, N 2 and N 2 H + are depleted in 15 N, while nitriles are enriched in 15 N. Note, however, that prestellar cores typically have higher density (>10 5 cm \u22123 ) and higher A V (>10 mag for a dust continuum peak) compared to their cloud model. Thus it seems difficult to explain the depletion of 15 N in N 2 H + in the framework of the present gas-phase chemical network.",

The profile of this band suggests that it could be made up of two contributions: the more intense seems to be located close to the excitation profile of the (29 1 , 29 1 ) band, while the weaker part extends across the (14 2 , 14 2 ) region; there is only the faintest trace of activity at the 11 1 excitation position. Being so low in wavenumber, there are not too many viable (v, m) = 0 assignments that match both the excitation and emission wavenumbers. To this end we can rule out the following possibilities on the basis of the expected position of the S 1 level, even though the corresponding S 0 level would be at about the correct wavenumber: 20 3 m 3(\u2212) , 20 1 m 8 , and 18 1 m 1 .

The 19 1 m 5 level would have the same symmetry as 29 1 m 1 and so would potentially be a candidate via an interaction with that level.

The associated ZEKE band would be expected at \u223c (222 + 189 = 410 cm \u22121 ), and indeed we suggested this as an assignment of the observed broadish band at \u223c 400 cm \u22121 in Ref. [15], and so 20 2 m 6(+) activity is a viable contributor to the 489 cm \u22121 band. The 20 2 m 6(+) level has the correct symmetry to interact with the 14 2 m 0 level, which would involve a v = 4, m = 6 interaction. Hence, there is a mechanism by which the 20 2 m 6(+) band can gain intensity from 14 2 m 0 that is consistent with the presence of the weak part of this band at the 14 2 excitation position and the ZEKE spectrum of Ref. [15]. We can then assign the brighter part of the band to the (v, m) = 0 transition. We thus suggest an assignment of the 489 cm -1 emission band to 20 2 m 6(+) , with intensity arising from the 14 2 m 0 . . . 20 2 m 6(+) interaction.

The computed equilibrium geometry for the X A1 ground state, as well as vibrational frequencies for the nu2 umbrella and nu3 symmetric stretch modes, are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data.

Model calculations for a trapezoidal wire cross section are in good agreement with the measured efficiencies and allow the wire cross section to be determined.

This sensor operates by transmitting laser light through a single optical port and measuring the backscattered radiation from within the combustion device. Scanned-wavelength-modulation spectroscopy with second-harmonic detection and first-harmonic normalization (scanned-WMS-2f/1f) was used to account for variable signal collection and nonabsorption losses in the harsh environment. Two tunable diode lasers operating near 2551 and 2482 nm were utilized to measure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O concentration and temperature, while an interband cascade laser near 4176 nm and a quantum cascade laser near 4865 nm were used for measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO, respectively. The lasers were modulated at either 90 or 112 kHz and scanned across the peaks of their respective absorption features at 1 kHz, leading to a measurement rate of 2 kHz. A hybrid demultiplexing strategy involving both spectral filtering and frequency-domain demodulation was used to decouple the backscattered radiation into its constituent signals. Demonstration measurements were made in the exhaust of a laboratory-scale laminar methane-air flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure and equivalence ratios ranging from 0.7 to 1.2. A stainless steel reflective plate was placed 0.78 cm away from the sensor head within the combustion exhaust, leading to a total absorption path length of 1.56 cm. Detection limits of 1.4% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 0.6% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 0.4% CO by mole were reported. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of a mid-infrared laser-absorption sensor using a single-ended architecture in combustion flows.",

Although the band at (398,576) cm -1 could be assigned as (14 2 , 20 4 ) or (29 1 m 1 , 20 1 29 1 m 1 ), it seems to be located close to centre of the 14 1 m 6(\u2212) band; additionally, the DF spectrum suggests 14 1 involvement, and so an assignment to (14 2 m 1 , 14 1 20 1 m 2 ) fits best. The 2D-LIF band at 600 cm \u22121 can be assigned to the totally-symmetric level 14 1 20 1 m 3(+) -this must arise from FC activity, which is consistent with its similar profile and excitation position to the 14 2 and 14 1 m 6(\u2212) bands.\n\nThere are various assignments for the emission band at 703 cm \u22121 . A number of these can be excluded on the grounds that they do not fit the position of an expected (v, m) = 0 band, or are not expected to have significant FC activity: 20 3 m 7 , 18 1 m 6(\u00b1) , 20 4 m 5 , 30 2 m 5 and 17 1 m 2 . Our favoured candidates for the emission are 14 1 20 2 m 1 and 14 1 20 2 m 2 . Although the former is the best fit on the grounds of expected wavenumber, we cannot exclude the latter since there is significant lowering of some of the m = 2 levels in the S 1 state arising from vibtor interactions [16].",

In experiment 1, five Clouclip devices were utilised. An infrared camera was used to visualise and measure infrared beam size and angle. Repeatability for distance tracking was assessed from 5 to 120\u00a0cm in 5\u00a0cm increments. Accuracy of distance tracking was investigated for paper and iPad targets, spatial integration was calculated, effects of target tilt were determined and light measurements were compared to a lux meter. In experiment 2, viewing behaviour was assessed in 41 subjects (21 non-myopic, 20 myopic) during four 15-min near tasks; (1) passive reading of printed material, (2) active writing on printed material, (3) passive viewing on an electronic device and (4) active engagement on an electronic device. Working distance was compared between tasks and refractive error groups. Clouclip distance tracking showed good repeatability, with a mean difference of 0.34\u00a0cm and limits of agreement of \u00b12.0\u00a0cm. Clouclip-measured and actual distances were highly correlated for paper and electronic targets from 5 to 120\u00a0cm, with mean differences and limits of agreement of 3.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.78\u00a0cm and 4.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.92\u00a0cm, respectively; variability increased for distances &gt;100\u00a0cm. Tracking ability increased with larger target sizes; tracking was accurate when the target occupied 1.5%-20.3% of tracking beam area, depending on distance and with target tilt up to \u00b160 degrees. Clouclip- and lux meter-measured ambient illumination were highly correlated for a wide range of intensities (r\u00a0=\u00a00.96, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001), but with greater variability for intensities &gt;20\u00a0000 lux. The Clouclip infrared beam was measured to have a diameter of 25.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00b0 and a downward angle of 10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00b0. For subject testing, viewing distance was significantly closer for active and passive printed tasks (29.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0cm and 33.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0cm, respectively) than for active and passive electronic tasks (35.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0\u00a0cm and 40.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.4\u00a0cm, respectively), with no differences between refractive error groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.88). The Clouclip performed well in measuring near and intermediate distances and could distinguish between indoor (&lt;1000 lux) and outdoor (&gt;1000 lux) illumination. A closer working distance was observed for printed tasks compared to those on an iPad, with no difference in viewing distance between non-myopic and myopic adults.",

Now, we discuss the steady-state emission spectra of the three samples.To begin with, 1 shows a red emission, while 2 and 3 give a yellow one (Table S1, Supporting Information).Figure 5B shows that the emission spectrum of 1, independent of the excitation wavelength, consists of a single band with the maximum emission intensity at 660 nm, while those of 2 and 3 exhibit a dual emission with intensity maxima at 522 and 660 nm.The red emission bands of the three samples are very similar in position and shape.Interestingly, while the dual emission of 2 does not depend on the excitation wavelength, that of 3 does, thus providing the possibility to get both green and red bands or only the red one.Although the excitation of 3 at 460 nm yields the same dual-band emission spectrum as the one observed for 2 (note that the intensity of the green band is lower for 3), its excitation at 530 nm produces an emission spectrum like the one obtained for 1.The green and red bands in the dual emission of 2 (and 3) have different full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of their intensities: 1700 and 2200 cm \u22121 for the green and red bands, respectively, suggesting larger spectral relaxation of the red emitters or the presence of more than one emitting population.Finally, we recorded the emission spectrum of 4 (excitation at 460 nm), which corresponds to 1:1 ratio (by mass) mechanical mixture of 1 and 2 (Figure 5B).The resulting emission spectrum closely resembles the one recorded for 3 under the same excitation and recording conditions with the notable difference being that for 4, the intensity of the band at 520 nm is slightly higher than the one for 3.This difference suggests that the initial ratio of 1:1 of the organic and inorganic salts used for the synthesis of 3 does not necessarily produce 1:1 ratio of cis and trans isomers.",

The (399, 1091) cm -1 band can be straightforwardly assigned as (29 1 , 11 1 28 1 ), but since we do not see a significant (11 1 , 28 1 ) band and also as the (11 1 , 11 1 29 1 ) bands were weak, this suggests that the (409, 1091) cm -1 band is unlikely to be (11 1 , 11 1 28 1 ). Our favoured assignment is to 11 1 18 1 20 1 . Particularly as the band profiles look to be different, and the centres of the bands are at slightly different emission wavenumbers.

The spectra were analyzed by evaluating the temperature dependence (a) of the total bandwidth and (b) of the sub-bands obtained by numerical decomposition in terms of double Gaussians. The thermal broadening of the bands are interpreted, in both cases, as a homogeneous component, due to the presence of linear electron-phonon coupling, plus an inhomogeneous component, due to both statistical energy fluctuations at each pigment site and heterogeneity of the sample itself. Sub-bands analysis, in which eight major components are identified, yields a reorganization energy 9 cm(-1) &lt; or = Svm &lt; or = 14 cm(-1) and an inhomogeneous contribution in the range 120-170 cm(-1). In all cases the bands are substantially symmetrical in the 70-300 K temperature range. This observation gains theoretical support from an analysis of the band moments, when the influence of a low-frequency vibrational mode is considered. Analysis of the total absorption band yields Svm approximately 70 cm(-1); however, this high value is reduced to Svm approximately 11-20 cm(-1) when the red-most sub-band, with maximum at 684 nm, is eliminated at all temperatures. These data are discussed in terms of the underlying transitions, giving strong support to the presence of extreme red absorption bands in LHCII. The presence of another low-frequency mode with vm &gt; 20-30 cm(-1) is also proposed.",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

The present resolution of this instrument approaches 0.01 ppb [10 ppt (parts per trillion)] and is limited primarily by the effective stability (&lt;5 ppt/h) of the magnet over hundreds of hours of observation. The leading systematic shift [at -202(9) ppt] is due to the image charge located in the trap electrodes. The new value for the atomic mass of the alpha particle is 4 001 506 179.147(64) nu and the corresponding value for the mass of 4He is 4 002 603 254.153(64) nu (nu=10(-9) u).

According to Kasha's rule, \u03c6 1 does not depend on the method of excitation (one-or two-photon). To evaluate a 2 , we therefore can use the values of \u03c6 1 previously determined in one-photon bleaching experiments, 31 as well as the known \u03c3 2 values 35 and laser parameters. We then calculated the a 2 P 2 contribution and subtracted it from the total rate K to obtain the power dependences of the higher order (three-or four-photon) processes. Although K (2) turns out to be several times smaller than K in the whole power range, this correction still provides more careful evaluations of K (3) and K (4) or of their combination. The results are shown in Figure 6, where the insets present the same plots on a double-logarithmic scale. For DsRed2, \u03b1 = 2.84, from which we conclude that, in total, three photons are involved in photobleaching and the third-photon absorption is slightly saturated. (The first, simultaneous 2PA transition is not saturated because the initial fluorescence depends quadratically on power.) For mFruits, the analysis shows that a combination of the nonsaturated third and fourth power terms in eq 13 cannot explain the observed power dependence (coefficient a 4 turns negative), and we conclude that four photons are involved and at least one of the subsequent excited-state transitions is moderately strongly saturated.",

The concentrations of cage, intermediates and products in the femtolitre focal volume depend on reaction rates and diffusional exchange with the external volume. This problem of reaction with diffusion was analysed with analytical and numerical methods to determine simple relations between parameters useful in the design and interpretation of experiments. The diffraction-limited laser spot is approximated well by a sphere, radius A, in diffusional exchange with either an infinite uniform medium, representing extracellular photolysis, or within a non-permeable sphere, a \"cell\" of radius B, representing intracellular photolysis. Photolysis is modelled as sequential irreversible reactions, with either the excitation step alone, rate constant k(e), or with a subsequent \"dark\" reaction, rate constant k(p). For extracellular photolysis, steady-state depletion of a cage averaged in a spherical spot increases hyperbolically with k(e) with half-maximum depletion at k(e) = K0.5 = 2.5 D/A2, where D is the diffusion coefficient. With measured parameters for spot size A = 0.3 microm and diffusion D = 800 microm2/s, K0.5 = 22,200 s(-1). The optimal exposure for localized photolysis is the characteristic diffusion time tau = A2/D, 113 micros in this example, and is the time taken to reach 57% of steady state in the diffusion-limited case. In the two-step model, with excitation and \"dark\" reaction steps, rate constants both exceeding K0.5 are necessary to generate 50% of maximal product concentration in the illuminated volume. High concentrations of photolysis products depend particularly on a high excitation rate constant (k(e) &gt; K0.5), and localization of the products requires fast dark reactions (k(p) &gt; K0.5). If products diffuse faster than the cage, their steady-state concentrations are decreased, and concentration transients may occur. For localized intracellular photolysis, the duration of exposure that generates product concentration at the cell boundary, B, less than 10% of the spot concentration should be shorter than 0.043(B/A)3tau, and is determined by diffusion.",

The off-diagonal terms in the quantum master equation now include the decoherence of excited states and electronic dephasing between ground and excited states by exploiting the relation 1/T 2 = 1/2T 1 + 1/T * 2 to estimate the different contributions to the dephasing rate, where T 2 is the transverse relaxation time and T 1 , T * 2 are the longitudinal relaxation time and pure dephasing time, respectively. While working out the details with the results reported in this paper, this extended quantum master equation has also been independently put forward very recently in Ref. [28] and has been named the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT). To avoid confusion, we use to this nomenclature also here.\n\nFor calculating 2D photon-echo spectra, essentially two different approaches are available. On the one hand, the response to the sequence of applied laser pulses can be calculated by evaluating the third-order optical response function [29]. Modified Redfield theory was successfully applied to simulate the 2D spectra of the double-ring LH2 aggregate of purple bacteria including both the B800 and the B850 ring [30]. Comparing experimentally measured and theoretically calculated results of 2D spectra revealed that excitation energy transfer through the LHCII happens on three time scales: sub-100fs relaxation through spatially overlapping states, several hundred femtosecond transfer between nearby chlorophylls, and picosecond energy transfer steps between layers of pigments [31]. More recently, 2D spectra of the reaction center in the Photosystem II were calculated with MRT at low temperature, and the charge separation process was investigated by MRT including charge transfer states in the model [20,32].",

Fluorescence was collected at a right angle to the incident beam with a PMT. Power dependence was measured at each wavelength with a stepper motor-controlled variable neutral density filter wheel (Thorlabs) that measured the fluorescence intensity for 20 steps over the full range of the wheel (OD 2). The intercept corresponding to the linear fit to the loglog plot of the fluorescence vs. incident power data was used to determine the relative value of the 2PA cross section at each wavelength. Only those points were used where the slope of the power dependence was verified to be in the range 2.00 \u00b1 0.05. Correction for the beam shape was determined by imaging the beam at each wavelength with a CCD camera (Stingray, Basler). Pulse durations were measured using a home-built second harmonic generation autocorrelator using BBO as the doubling material, and were in the range 90-120 fs. The pulse repetition rate of the laser is 80 Mhz, and was chopped down to 70 Hz using a mechanical chopper wheel to alleviate thermal effects in the sample. Excitation power values were adjusted for the solvent absorption based on the linear spectroscopic measurements of each respective mixture. Absolute cross section values were measured for PRODAN (C153) at 750 nm relative to BDPAS (Fluorescein) using the reference method as described in detail earlier [1] .\n\n\n2-Level Model Description",

Illustrative (37)Cl MAS NMR spectra are obtained and analyzed for some of the samples. For perchlorate anions with quadrupolar couplings less than about 1 MHz, the (35)Cl/(37)Cl NMR parameters are most precisely determined from the full manifold of spinning sidebands observed for the satellite transitions while line-shape analysis of the central transition is employed for the somewhat larger quadrupolar couplings. The environments for the individual perchlorate anions are best characterized by the quadrupole coupling parameters (e.g., C(Q) ranges from 0.3 to 3.0 MHz), while the dispersion in the isotropic (35)Cl chemical shifts is small (1029 ppm &lt; delta(iso) &lt; 1049 ppm) for the perchlorates studied. Due to the variation in quadrupole coupling parameters, (35)Cl MAS NMR may conveniently be employed for identification of anhydrous and hydrated phases of perchlorates, in studies of phase transitions, hydration reactions, and the composition of mixed phases. The perchlorates studied include anhydrous KClO(4), RbClO(4), CsClO(4), (CH(3))(4)NClO(4), and the anhydrous and/or hydrated forms of LiClO(4), NaClO(4), Mg(ClO(4))(2), Ba(ClO(4))(2), and Cd(ClO(4))(2). The (35)Cl MAS NMR spectra of LiClO(4), Mg(ClO(4))(2), and Ba(ClO(4))(2), for which the crystal structures are unknown, reveal that each of these salts possesses a single perchlorate site in the asymmetric unit. The (35)Cl NMR data for Mg(ClO(4))(2) and Ba(ClO(4))(2) suggest that these two samples are isostructural. Relationships between the (35)Cl NMR parameters and crystal symmetries are discussed for the other perchlorates where crystal structure data have been reported.",

The amide group is planar, and an intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed between the chlorine atom and the nearest hydrogen atom of the amide group.

The CC torsional fundamental vibration has a frequency of 62(10) cm(-1), and the bending vibration has a frequency of 204(30) cm(-1). The rotational constants of the ground and of the six excited states of the CC torsion were fitted to the potential function Vz = 16.1(&lt;z4&gt; + 2.3&lt;z2&gt;) cm(-1), where z is a dimensionless parameter. This function indicates that the equilibrium conformation has Cs symmetry.

New measurements extend the observed rotational lines to J=7&lt;--6 for LiOH and J=8&lt;--7 for LiOD for all bending vibrational states up to (03(3)0). Rotation-vibration energy levels, geometric expectation values, and dipole moments are calculated using extensive high-level ab initio three-dimensional potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. Agreement between calculation and experiment is superb, with predicted Bv values typically within 0.3%, D values within 0.2%, ql values within 0.7%, and dipole moments within 0.9% of experiment. Shifts in Bv values with vibration and isotopic substitution are also well predicted. A combined theoretical and experimental structural analysis establishes the linear equilibrium structure with re(Li-O)=1.5776(4) A and re(O-H)=0.949(2) A. Predicted fundamental vibrational frequencies are v1=923.2, v2=318.3, and v3=3829.8 cm(-1) for LiOH and v1=912.9, v2=245.8, and v3=2824.2 cm(-1) for LiOD. The molecule is extremely nonrigid with respect to angular deformation; the calculated deviation from linearity for the vibrationally averaged structure is 19.0 degrees in the (000) state and 41.9 degrees in the (03(3)0) state. The calculation not only predicts, in agreement with previous work [P. R. Bunker, P. Jensen, A. Karpfen, and H. Lischka, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 135, 89 (1989)], a change from a linear to a bent minimum energy configuration at elongated Li-O distances, but also a similar change from linear to bent at elongated O-H distances.",

Transitions involving a large range of quantum numbers have been observed, so that precise rotational and quartic centrifugal distortion constants could be determined for each of the spectra investigated. The complete set of sextic distortion constants was also obtained for the most abundant isotopomer in its ground vibrational state. The newly determined rotational constants of (34)S(35)Cl(2) and (32)S(37)Cl(2) allowed us to calculate the complete r(s) structure of sulfur dichloride using both single- and double-isotopic substitution methods.

For the J = 1-0 transitions of the two HCl isotopomers, the hyperfine splitting due to the hydrogen nuclear spin-rotation interaction is resolved. Furthermore Doppler-limited lines of the DCl J = 3 &lt;-- 2 transition around 965 GHz as well as hyperfine-resolved rotational transitions in the first excited vibrational state were recorded up to 1.22 THz. The new frequencies were analyzed in a global fit together with FIR data yielding a set of mass-invariant rotational parameters. Isotopically invariant hyperfine parameters were obtained also from the global fit. Inclusion of the precise results from molecular beam electric resonance measurements allowed the determination of higher orders of the vibrational and rotational expansion coefficients of the chlorine and hydrogen hyperfine interactions. The precise transition frequencies reported here should be useful as secondary calibration standards in the submillimeter-wave and terahertz region. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

The rotational, centrifugal, spin-rotation coupling, and hyperfine coupling constants have been determined by least-squares fits of the observed transition frequencies. The molecular constants indicate that the electronic ground state is 2A\". The r(0) structure is determined to be r(0)(ClO)=2.075 A, r(0)(OO)=1.227 A, and theta;(0)(ClOO)=116.4 degrees . Several highly accurate ab initio calculations have also been performed. Some of them turned out to be inaccurate because it is necessary to take into account both static and dynamic electronic correlations. Only multireference (single and double) configuration interaction calculations with large basis sets reproduce the present experimental results. The anharmonic force constants obtained by the ab initio calculations are used to determine the r(e) structure, r(e)(ClO)=2.084(1) A, r(e)(OO)=1.206(2) A, and theta;(e)(ClOO)=115.4(1) degrees . Unique features of the ClOO radical have become clear by the present experiment and the ab initio calculations.",

Theory and spectroscopic properties.\nThe excitation of a fluorescent molecule by a beta-decay electron (radioluminescence) depends upon the electron energy, the distance between radioactive 'donor' and fluorescent 'acceptor', and the excitation characteristics and solvent environment of the fluorophore. The theory for calculation of single photon radioluminescence (SPR) signals is developed here; in the accompanying paper, measurement methods and biological applications are presented. To calculate the three-dimensional spatial profile for electron energy deposition in an aqueous environment, a Monte Carlo calculation was performed incorporating theories of electron energy distributions, energy loss due to interactions with matter, and deflections in electron motion due to collisions. For low energy beta emitters, 50% of energy deposition occurs within 0.63 micron (3H, 18.5 keV), 22 microns (14C, 156 keV), 25 microns (35S, 167 keV), and 260 microns (36Cl, 712 keV) of the radioisotope. In close proximity to the beta emitter (100 nm, 3H; 10 microns, 14C) the probability for fluorophore excitation is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the beta emitter and fluorophore. To investigate the other factors that determine the probability for fluorophore excitation, SPR measurements were carried out in solutions containing 3H and a series of fluorophores in different solvents. In water, the probability of fluorescence excitation was nearly proportional to the integrated absorbance over a &gt; 1,000-fold variation in absorbances. The probability of fluorescence excitation was enhanced up to 2,600-fold when the fluorophore was in a \"scintillant\" aromatic or hydrocarbon solvent. SPR emission spectra were similar to fluorescence emission spectra obtained with photon excitation. The single photon signal due to Bremsstrahlung increased with wavelength in agreement with theory. The distance dependence for the SPR signal predicted by the model was in good agreement with measurements in which a 14C donor was separated by known thicknesses of water from a fluorescently-coated coverglass. Quantitative predictions for radioluminescence signal as a function of donor-acceptor distance were developed for specific radioisotope-fluorophore geometries in biological samples.",

The probabilities for the initial interaction are from the current photon interaction cross-section database at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The calculations then take into account (1) electron binding effects on the Compton-scattered photon distribution; (2) the complete cascade of fluorescence emission after ionization events in any atomic subshell, including those associated with incoherent scattering and triplet production; and (3) the radiative energy losses of the secondary electrons and positrons slowing down in the medium, including the emission of bremsstrahlung, characteristic X rays from impact ionization, and positron in-flight as well as at-rest annihilation quanta. Consideration of the processes in (3) goes beyond the continuous-slowing-down approximation and includes the effects of energy-loss straggling. Results for the mass energy-absorption coefficient are compared with those from recent tabulations.",

Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons.

This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms.

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists.

In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)\u03a3(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects.

Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)\u03a3(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)\u03a3(u)(-) state.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)\u03a3(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 \u00b1 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 \u00b1 500 a.u., respectively. The result for C(6) is in excellent agreement with that of Derevianko et al. [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 96, 323 (2010)], (364 \u00b1 4 a.u.), that was obtained in the framework of the theory of long-range interactions and many-body calculations on the constituent atoms. On the other hand, our result for C(8) differs from that of Standard and Certain [J. Chem. Phys. 83, 3002 (1985)] by about 7000 a.u.",

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies. For example, for the XY (n=2) version of the present model, such a behavior was observed only near criticality. It is shown also that the (metastable state) maximum Lyapunov exponent decreases with N like lambda(max) approximately N-kappa, where for the initial conditions employed herein (maximal magnetization), kappa=0.225+/-0.030, both above and below the critical point.",

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study.

The experimental relaxation rates reveal an unusual signature, in being dominated by the electron spin-rotation interaction in the MuCO radical that is formed in the addition step. In N2 moderator, k0 = 1.2+/-0.1 x 10(-34) cm(6) s(-1), only about 30% higher than found in Ar or He. The experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations carried out on the Werner-Keller-Schinke (WKS) surface [Keller et al., J. Chem. Phys. 105, 4983 (1996)], within the framework of the isolated resonance model (IRM). The positions and lifetimes of resonance states are obtained by solving the complex Hamiltonian for the nonrotating MuCO system, using an L2 method, with an absorbing potential in the asymptotic region. Accurate values of the vibrational bound and resonance states of MuCO reveal unprecedented isotope effects in comparisons with HCO, due to the remarkable effect of replacing H by the very light Mu atom (m(Mu) approximately (1/9)m(H)). Due to its pronounced zero-point energy shift, there are only two (J = 0) bound states in MuCO. Contributions from nonzero J states to the termolecular rate constants are evaluated through the J-shifting approximation, with rotational constants evaluated at the potential minimum. The value of the important A constant (181 cm(-1)) used in this approximation was supported by accurate J = K = 1 calculations, from which A = 180 cm(-1) was obtained by numerical evaluation. The calculations presented here, with a \"weak collision factor\" beta c = 0.001, indicative of the very sparse density of MuCO states, give a very good account of both the magnitude and pressure dependence of the experimental rates, but only when the fact that the two initially bound (J = 0) states become resonances for J &gt; 0 is taken into account. This is the first time in IRM calculations of atom-molecule recombination reactions where J not equal to 0 states have proven to be so important, thus providing a truly unique test of quantum rate theory.",

Total energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit applying the focal point analysis. Zero-point vibrational energies are computed using fundamental (anharmonic) frequencies obtained from a quartic force field. Relativistic and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections are also taken into account. The quantum mechanical barrier with these corrections is predicted to be 6.4+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1) and the reaction exothermicity to be 8.8+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1). The importance of these parameters for the thermal NO(x) decomposition (De-NO(x)) process is discussed. The unimolecular rate constant for dissociation of the HN(2) molecule and its lifetime are estimated by canonical transition-state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory. The lifetime of the HN(2) molecule is here estimated to be 2.8x10(-10) s at room temperature. Our result is in marginal agreement with the latest experimental kinetic modeling studies (tau=1.5x10(-8) s), albeit consistent with the very rough experimental upper limit (tau&lt;0.5 mus).

Thus, DN(2) might be more readily identified experimentally. The ionization potential of the HN(2) molecule is determined by analogous high level ab initio methods and focal point analysis.

The rate coefficients for Deltav = 0 processes decline monotonically with increasing |Deltaj|. The Deltav = 1 rate coefficients are also peaked near Deltaj = 0 but show a broad shoulder extending to approximately Deltaj = 30. Classical trajectory calculations and accurate quantum mechanical close-coupled calculations were used to compute theoretical rate constants from an ab initio potential surface. The agreement between the classical and quantum calculations is very good. The calculations slightly overestimate the measured rate constants for Deltav = 0, Deltaj &lt;or= 6 processes but underestimate those for Deltav = 0, Deltaj &gt;or= 20, implying that the anisotropy of the ab initio surface is too small at short range and too large at long range. For Deltav = 1 collisions, the calculations agree well with experiment for Deltaj &lt;or= 0 and show the correct qualitative behavior for positive Deltaj, including both the peaking at Deltaj = 0 and the shoulder extending to positive Deltaj. However, they underestimate rate constants for Deltav = 1, Deltaj &gt; 0 collisions, disagreeing with experiment by a factor of 2 for Deltaj approximately 20 but agreeing better at higher and lower Deltaj. Analysis of classical trajectories indicates that the vibrationally inelastic collisions fall into two groups corresponding to equatorial and near-end impacts; the former generally produce small Deltaj while the latter produce large Deltaj.

Waite and Miller 5 have calculated the energies and lifetimes (the inverse of the unimolecular decay rate) of the individual metastable quantum states of the system, and Figure 1 shows a sample of their results. Because of the C3 symmetry of the system, the calculation is carried out separately for states of A symmetry (solid circles in Figure 1), A2 symmetry (open squares), and E symmetry (open circles). The solid line in Figure 1 is the result given by standard statistical theory, i.e., microcanonical transition state theory, 6\nk(E)= 3 P[E-Vo-(n +1/2)hto*]/[2,rrhp(E)] (2.2)\nHere P is the one-dimensional tunneling probability as a function of the energy along the reaction coordinate, to*= x/g is the frequency of the \"activated complex\", p(E) the density of reactant states, and the factor of 3 is due to the three equivalent transition states.

To the extent that there is any trend at all, therefore, it is opposite to what one would predict on the basis of the quasi-periodic/chaotic character of the classical mechanics. The appearance of some degree of modespecificity at high energies is perhaps understandable in that even if the various degrees of freedom are strongly coupled, states with most of the energy in the reaction coordinate will decay essentially instantaneously (i.e., within one vibrational period) while those with most of the energy in inactive modes will require at least a few vibrations for the energy to flow into the reaction coordinate.",

Lett. 248, 409), which was determined by fits to vibrational term values alone and was claimed to be more accurate than other published spectroscopically determined potentials for this system, actually gives unacceptably poor results for rotationally excited water. Reasons for this failure are discussed and the dangers of relying on vibrational term values alone are emphasized. Previous spectroscopic potentials for ground state NO2 are all found to have problems with unphysical minima (\"holes\"). Starting from the potential energy surface for the ground (&amp;Xtilde;2A1) electronic state of NO2 constructed by S. A. Tashkun and P. Jensen (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 173) using the approximate MORBID approach a suitable starting point for fits using an exact kinetic energy operator approach was constructed. Least-squares fits to 17 potential parameters gives a potential which reproduces 173 vibrational term values with a standard deviation of only 2.8 cm-1 in the low-energy region (&lt;10 000 cm-1). For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state. We were unable to fit these levels. Tests show that the resulting effective potential surface has no problems with unphysical holes and gives a reasonable representation of the rotational structure of the low-lying vibrational states of NO2.

Besides, the reaction probabilities are quite large [0.78-0.98 (1(2)A'') and 0.78-0.93 (1(2)A')], and the decreasing trend of both cross-sections as Ecol increases arises from the barrierless character of both PESs.

If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another.

The total mass of these six subatomic particles may be calculated as:\n\n$$\n(2 \\times \\underset{\\text { protons }}{1.0073 \\mathrm{amu}})+\\underset{\\text { neutrons }}{(2 \\times 1.0087 \\mathrm{amu})}+\\underset{\\text { electrons }}{1 \\times 0.00055 \\mathrm{amu})}=4.0 \\begin{aligned}\n& 4.0331 \\mathrm{amu} \\\\\n& (2 \\times 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHowever, mass spectrometric measurements reveal that the mass of an ${ }_{2}^{4} \\mathrm{He}$ atom is 4.0026 amu , less than the combined masses of its six constituent subatomic particles. This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

The VV ET probability is computed for three mechanisms: (1) The charge on NO(+) acting on the average polarizability of N(2) induces a dipole moment in N(2) which then interacts with the permanent dipole moment of NO(+) to mediate the energy transfer. (2) The charge on NO(+) acting on the anisotropic polarizability of N(2) induces a dipole moment in N(2) which then interacts with the permanent dipole moment of NO(+) to mediate the energy transfer. (3) The dipole moment of NO(+) interacts with the quadrupole moment of N(2) to mediate the energy transfer. Because the probability amplitudes of the second and third mechanisms add coherently the ET probability for these two mechanisms is given as a single number. The probability of energy transfer per collision is in the 5 x 10(-3) range. The results of this calculation are compared with the available experimental data. This calculation should help quantify the role of NO(+) in the energy budget of the upper atmosphere.",

In the present paper we calculate a new ab initio potential energy surface for the X3B1 state, and we calculate ab initio the potential energy surfaces of the a1A1 and b1B1 excited singlet electronic states (which become degenerate as a 1Delta state at linearity). We use the multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI) level of theory with molecular orbital bases that are optimized separately for each state by complete-active-space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. For the X state we use the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program to obtain the rotation-vibration energies. For the a and b excited singlet electronic states we calculate the rovibronic energy levels using the RENNER Hamiltonian and computer program. We also calculate ab initio the dipole moment surfaces for the X, a, and b electronic states, and the out-of-plane transition moment surface for the b &lt;-- a electronic transition. We use this information to simulate absorption spectra within X3B1 and a1A1 state and of the b1B1 &lt;-- a1A1 transition in order to aid in the search for them. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

The electron kinetic-energy spectra, which directly reflect the ionizing transition region, show resolved peaks assignable to v' = 0-4 of H2+. The vibrational populations deviate systematically from Franck-Condon behavior, suggesting that the discrete-continuum coupling increases with H2 bond stretching. Each peak displays both increasing breadth and increasing blueshift with increasing E, and the blueshift also increases with increasing v'. The first two properties are consistent with a predominantly repulsive excited-state potential-energy surface, while the last is speculated to be a reflection of the rHH dependence of the ionic surface. Quantum scattering calculations based on ab initio potential surfaces for the excited and ionic states in spherical and infinite-order-sudden rigid rotor approximations are in semiquantitative agreement with the measurements.

Key concepts, such as the phase space dividing surface separating reactants from products, the average gap time, and the volume of phase space associated with reactive trajectories, are both rigorously defined and readily computed within the phase space approach. We analyze in detail the gap time distribution and associated reactant lifetime distribution for the isomerization reaction HCN &lt;==&gt; CNH, previously studied using the methods of phase space transition state theory. Both algebraic (power law) and exponential decay regimes have been identified. Statistical estimates of the isomerization rate are compared with the numerically determined decay rate. Correcting the RRKM estimate to account for the measure of the reactant phase space region occupied by trapped trajectories results in a drastic overestimate of the isomerization rate. Compensating but as yet not fully understood trapping mechanisms in the reactant region serve to slow the escape rate sufficiently that the uncorrected RRKM estimate turns out to be reasonably accurate, at least at the particular energy studied. Examination of the decay properties of subensembles of trajectories that exit the HCN well through either of two available symmetry related product channels shows that the complete trajectory ensemble effectively attains the full symmetry of the system phase space on a short time scale t approximately &lt; 0.5 ps, after which the product branching ratio is 1:1, the \"statistical\" value. At intermediate times, this statistical product ratio is accompanied by nonexponential (nonstatistical) decay. We point out close parallels between the dynamical behavior inferred from the gap time distribution for HCN and nonstatistical behavior recently identified in reactions of some organic molecules.",

The vibrational energy levels were selected by using a semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) quantization procedure while the relative translational energy was sampled from a Boltzmann weighted distribution. The rate coefficient for the formation of the OH + O products is seen to increase monotonically with quantum number and nearly monotonically with temperature. On the MB PES, at T = 1000 K, the total rate coefficient increases by a factor of 5.2 as the initial vibrational quantum number of the O(2) diatom increases from v = 6 to v = 10. For T = 2000 K, this factor drops to 3.3, to 2.9 for T = 3000 K, and to 2.5 for T = 4000 K. On the DMBE IV PES, at T = 1000 K the total rate coefficient increases by a factor of 4.1 as the initial vibrational quantum number of the O(2) diatom increases from v = 6 to v = 10.

The less-direct group (defined below) of trajectories is sensitive to the initial O(2) vibrational excitation in several different temperature ranges, apparently retaining the effect of reagent vibrational excitation. The more-direct group (defined below) of trajectories does not exhibit this behavior. Reagent vibrational excitation does not increase the total rate coefficients for the title reaction more than the increase due to a simple temperature increase. The less-direct and more-direct groups of trajectories differ in their contribution to the rate coefficient for the title reaction. In particular, at T = 4000 K, the two PESs used in this work differ dramatically in the roles of the less-direct and more-direct trajectories. The behavior of the more-direct and less-direct groups of trajectories can be understood in terms of the efficiency of intramolecular vibrational energy transfer. This work utilizes the recently introduced PES Library, POTLIB 2001, which made the comparisons between the two PESs discussed in this work possible in a very straightforward way.",

Although the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the alpha-helix and beta-pleated sheet are well defined, there remains some ambiguity concerning the pure component CD spectra of the different types of beta-turns. Recently, it has been reported (Holl\u00f3si, M., K\u00f6v\u00e9r, K.E., Holly, S., Radics, L., &amp; Fasman, G.D., 1987, Biopolymers 26, 1527-1572; Perczel, A., Holl\u00f3si, M., Foxman, B.M., &amp; Fasman, G.D., 1991a, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 9772-9784) that some pseudohexapeptides (e.g., the cyclo[(delta)Ava-Gly-Pro-Aaa-Gly] where Aaa = Ser, Ser(OtBu), or Gly) in many solvents adopt a conformational mixture of type I and the type II beta-turns, although the X-ray-determined conformation was an ideal type I beta-turn. In addition to these pseudohexapeptides, conformational analysis was also carried out on three pseudotetrapeptides and three pseudooctapeptides. The target of the conformation analysis reported herein was to determine whether the ring stress of the above beta-turn models has an influence on their conformational properties. Quantitative nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements yielded interproton distances. The conformational average distances so obtained were interpreted utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to yield the conformational percentages. These conformational ratios were correlated with the conformational weights obtained by quantitative CD analysis of the same compounds. The pure component CD curves of type I and type II beta-turns were also obtained, using a recently developed algorithm (Perczel, A., Tusn\u00e1dy, G., Holl\u00f3si, M., &amp; Fasman, G.D., 1991b, Protein Eng. 4(6), 669-679). For the first time the results of a CD deconvolution, based on the CD spectra of 14 beta-turn models, were assigned by quantitative NOE results. The NOE experiments confirmed the ratios of the component curves found for the two major beta-turns by CD analysis. These results can now be used to enhance the conformational determination of globular proteins on the basis of their CD spectra.",

Our sensitivity is similar to the most recent previous measurement, by Anderson et al.[20], but our results show some significant discrepancies with theirs. The most egregious is for the intensity of the 2883-keV \u03b3 transition, which we determine to be an order of magnitude less than their result. It seems very likely that the value quoted by Anderson et al. is simply a misprint since it does not seem to be supported by their own \u03b3-ray spectrum (see Figure 5 in Ref. [20]), in which the 2883-keV peak is clearly not one-half the intensity of the nearby peak at 3211 keV as their tabulated intensity would lead one to believe. There are two other smaller, but still significant, discrepancies between our results and those of Anderson et al. for the peaks at 1643 and 3726 keV. These discrepancies give us good reason to use our results exclusively in all subsequent determinations of the Gamow-Teller \u03b2-branching ratios from 38 Ca.\n\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\n\nA.

In principle, a cylindrical detector with a height-diameter ratio of \u03c0/4 (H/D\u00a0=\u00a00.785) exhibits the lowest angular dependency (41% at low energies for a tilting angle of 45\u00b0 as compared with the orientation of the detector end cap relative to the beam). However, Monte Carlo simulations of a germanium detector showed that this variability can be greatly improved by slightly increasing H/D (0.84) and introducing a copper cladding around the detector (1.1\u00a0mm). The counting efficiency of such a detector is almost independent of the direction of photons arriving to the detector. The maximum deviation of 10% takes place at 200\u00a0keV.",

The difference between them is depicted in Fig. (2), where we clearly see the break of symmetry due to torsion and a tiny deviation in the size of the first peaks. There, the free parameters were chosen as follows: the slits are separated by 10 nm, their apertures are 0.1 nm each (which coincide with the wave packet width a), and the screen of detection is at 20 nm from the plane x 1 = 0. Also, (k 1 ) 0 = 50 nm \u22121 , (k 2 ) 0 = 0 and the instant time as t = mx 1 /(k 1 ) 0 , such that the peak of the packet in the x 1 -direction is depicted.

Using the 1mm slit instead of the 2mm slit for both the entrance and the exit of the monochromator, the width of the 400nm hyper-Rayleigh narrows from 16nm to 9nm, which is the band width of the 800nm femtosecond pulse. However, the widths of the 448nm and 500nm bands are broad and remain unchanged. This indicates that the broadening mechanism for these two new and broad spectral features is quite different from that of the hyper-rayleigh processes, [16] even though they follow the same polarization dependence. If the widths of these two peaks are due to any fast molecular dynamic interactions, the time scale of these interactions must be in the range of 30 to 15 femtosecond, respectively. The angle resolved measurements of the 400nm, 448nm and 500nm peaks in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2. The angular dependence of the 400nm peak is again distinctively different from the 448nm and 500nm peaks. As expected for the hyper-Rayleigh process, the angular dependence here for the 400nm peaks follows the cos 2 \u03b8 function centering at the forward direction. Therefore, no additional information can be gained by looking in directions other than the classic 90 o angle for the hyperrayleigh process. [12,13] On the other hand, the angular dependence of the 448nm and 500nm peaks is distinctively very narrow and centered at the forward direction. The two curves may have small difference, but they certainly imply a very different mechanism from that of the hyper-Rayleigh or hyper-Raman processes, where no such strong angular anisotropy has ever been observed, except for processes such the stimulated Raman or superbroadening.",

If diffraction blurs the image of a point object into an Airy disk with a root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) size of s = 0.44lambda/2NA (approximately 90 nm for light with a wavelength of lambda = 600 nm and an objective lens with a numerical aperture of NA = 1.49), limiting the resolution of the far-field microscope in use to d = 2.4s approximately = 200 nm, additional knowledge about the specimen can be used to great advantage. For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images. In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) &gt; or = 1% (&gt; or = 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF). Moreover, the error in co-localizing two or more single emitters is notably worse, remaining greater than 5-10% (5-10 nm) of the PSF size. Here we report a distance resolution of s(reg) = 0.50 nm (1sigma) and an absolute accuracy of s(distance) = 0.77 nm (1sigma) in a measurement of the separation between differently coloured fluorescent molecules using conventional far-field fluorescence imaging in physiological buffer conditions. The statistical uncertainty in the mean for an ensemble of identical single-molecule samples is limited only by the total number of collected photons, to s(loc) approximately 0.3 nm, which is approximately 3 x 10(-3) times the size of the optical PSF. Our method may also be used to improve the resolution of many subwavelength, far-field imaging methods such as those based on co-localization of molecules that are stochastically switched on in space.

At grazing angles, the positions are calculated using the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), whereas for larger angles where the diffracted beams are transmitted though the substrate, the Born approximation (BA) is used. This method has been incorporated into simulation code (called NANOCELL) and may be used to overlay simulated spot patterns directly onto two-dimensional (2D) grazing angle of incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) patterns and 2D SAXS patterns. The GISAXS simulations are limited to the case where the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle (alpha(i) &gt; alpha(c)) and the diffraction occurs above the critical angle (alpha(f) &gt; alpha(c)). For cases of surfactant self-assembled films, the limitations are not restrictive because, typically, the critical angle is around 0.2 degrees but the largest d spacings occur around 0.8 degrees 2theta. For these materials, one finds that the DWBA predicts that the spot positions from the transmitted main beam deviate only slightly from the BA and only for diffraction peaks close the critical angle. Additional diffraction peaks from the reflected main beam are observed in GISAXS geometry but are much less intense. Using these simulations, 2D spot patterns may be used to identify space group, identify the orientation, and quantitatively fit the lattice constants for SAXS data from any angle of incidence. Characteristic patterns for 2D GISAXS and 2D low-angle transmission SAXS patterns are generated for the most common thin film structures, and as a result, GISAXS and SAXS patterns that were previously difficult to interpret are now relatively straightforward. The simulation code (NANOCELL) is written in Mathematica and is available from the author upon request.",

The comparison between the black and red curves in each subpannel of Fig. 1 shows that the harmonic spectra have a broad region within the HHG plateau with highly suppressed harmonic emission rate. The center of the suppressed region shifts to higher harmonic order as the orientation angle \u03b8 increases. The broad suppressed regions arise from the two-center interference effect in the molecular HHG [2,20]. But the locations of the minima in the broad suppressed regions are difficult to identify in some cases. For example, for \u03b8 = 50 0 , in Fig. 1(c), the minimum is clear at the 67th order. Fig. 1(b) is not as clear as Fig. 1(c). It has been revealed in Ref. [22] that the interference minima in the molecular HHG spectra may shift as the laser intensity changes. In particular, according to the simple point-emitter model proposed in Ref [3], for H + 2 with R = 2 a.u. and \u03b8 = 50 0 , the predicted interference minimum is at the 51st order. Compared to the observation of the 67th order in Fig. 1(c), a large shift of about 16 orders occurs here. Based on the above analyses and discussions, we expect that probing molecular structure using the pronounced interference-related minimum can not be applicable in some cases.",

We find that optimal bisection thresholds, and hyperacuity tasks in general, are no better than might be expected from simple contrast detection and discrimination performance. The three-line bisection task can be described in terms of the test-pedestal paradigm where the test pattern is a horizontal dipole and the pedestal is a horizontal three-line pattern with equal spacing between the lines. When the dipole test is added to the center line, the line shifts up or down, depending on the test polarity. For low contrast pedestal lines at the optimal separation, the bisection threshold falls between the observer's own dipole contrast detection threshold and the bottom of the dipole contrast discrimination dipper function. At higher pedestal strengths performance degrades with a slope of about 0.5-0.7, similar to that found in contrast discrimination tasks. Therefore, bisection performance is compatible with expectations based on contrast discrimination data. At large pedestal line separations (&gt; 10 min) bisection thresholds in min are about 1/60 the separation and relatively independent of pedestal strength. These findings are consistent with the idea that two processes are involved in limiting bisection performance; the first limit is based on contrast sensitivity of the system and the second limit to performance is based on a local sign or position tag processing. Finally, when bisection is compared with Vernier acuity and blur resolution tasks, where the test is also a dipole, bisection performance falls roughly midway, better than Vernier acuity but worse than blur resolution.",

The calculation results show that a large local enhancement of electric field (61 times) and simultaneously high absorption is due to combination of the resonance absorption of Au triangle disks, plasmonic couplings between the Au triangle disks and the Au film, and the high-density packing of triangle disks. The absorption peaks were not detuned when the gap between neighboring tips of the triangles varied from 10 to 50\u00a0nm. When the thickness of SiO<sub2</sub layer increased from 10 to 50\u00a0nm, the absorption peak shifted to longer wavelengths and the amplitude rises quickly signaling the dominance of the gap mode resonance between the two Au layers. As the thickness of the top Au layer varies from 10 to 50\u00a0nm, the absorption peak is also red shifted and the peak amplitude increases. The full width at half maximum of the peaks for high absorption (&gt;\u200990%) is about 5\u00a0nm. When fixing the gap, the thicknesses of Au/SiO<sub2</sub triangle layer, and increasing the surrounding refractive index from 1.33 to 1.36, the absorption peaks shifted quickly, with a refractive index sensitivity and figure of merit as high as 660\u00a0nm per refractive index unit and 132, respectively. Such arrays can be easily fabricated by using microsphere array as projection masks and find application in refractive index monitoring of liquid and identification of gas and liquid phases.",

Collimator backscatter and obscuring of the source in the target contribute to this variation, but the main component is photon scatter in structures in the accelerator head. To determine the scatter-to-primary ratio, SPR, between the air kerma from such scattered photons and from those that originate directly from the source, it is essential to know the shape of this function SPR(c) of the square collimator opening c, especially for small c. To determine this, simulated head scatter was generated in lead blocks inside the head. By taking the ratio of the output factors for two such blocks of slightly different thickness, the effects of source obscuring and collimator backscatter were eliminated. Using the measured difference in transmission through the two lead blocks, the limiting value for c--&gt;0 could be determined and hence the scatter-to-primary ratios SPR(c). The results could be fitted well with an error function, which then was applied to data measured for clinical beams of 6 and 25 MV.

The diodes had a very small detection volume and one was a specially designed double diode using two parallel opposed active volumes with compensating interface perturbations. The characteristics of the detectors were investigated both for dose distribution measurements, such as depth-dose curves and lateral beam profiles, and for output factors. The dose rate and angular dependence of the diamond and the two diodes were also studied separately. The depth-dose distributions for small fields agree well for the diamond, the scintillator and the single diode, while the measured dose maximum for the double diode is about 1% higher and for the liquid chamber about 1% lower than the mean of the others when normalized at a depth of 10 cm. The plastic scintillator and the liquid ionization chamber detect a penumbra width that is slightly broadened due to the influence of their finite size, while the double diode may even underestimate the penumbra width due to its small size and high density. When corrected for the extension of the detector volume a good agreement with Monte Carlo calculated beam profiles was obtained for the plastic scintillator and the liquid ionization chamber. Profiles measured with the diamond show an asymmetry when positioned with the smallest dimension facing the beam, while the double diode, the scintillator and the liquid chamber measure symmetric profiles irrespective of positioning. Significant differences in the output factors were obtained with the different detectors. The natural diamond detector measures output factors close to those with an ionization chamber (less than 1% difference) for field sizes between 3 x 3 and 15 x 15 cm2, but overestimates the output factors for large fields and underestimates the output factors for the smallest field sizes. The single and double diodes overestimated the output factor for large field sizes by up to 7 and 12% respectively due to the high content of low-energy photons. The double diode, and to some extent the single diode, also showed a relative increase in response compared with the more water equivalent liquid chamber and plastic scintillator at the smallest fields where there is a lack of lateral electron equilibrium. Both the plastic scintillator and the liquid chamber also show responses that deviate from the ionization chamber for larger field sizes.

Since the rho{0} decays before the production amplitudes from the two sources can overlap, the two-pion system can only be described with an entangled nonlocal wave function, and is thus an example of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. We observe this suppression in 200 GeV per nucleon-pair gold-gold collisions. The interference is 87%+/-5%(stat.)+/-8%(syst.) of the expected level. This translates into a limit on decoherence due to wave function collapse or other factors of 23% at the 90% confidence level.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions.

Despite the various approximations involved in the different methods and PESs, an excellent agreement is obtained in a subset of three models: the ACCSA method with PME-SO or ab initio PESs and the QCT method with the latter PES. This suggests that the reaction takes place once the system enters the deep valley of products. In that case, the errors due to these approximate methods and PESs are small and, consequently, the rate constants are accurately calculated.

Using the quantum uncertainty relation and electron mean free path, the magnitudes of uncertainties on electron position and momentum are calculated for different kinetic energies; a validity bound on the classical simulation of electron transport is derived. In order to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, uncertainties of 5% must be assigned to position and momentum for 1 keV electrons in water; at 100 eV, these uncertainties are 17 to 20% and are even larger at lower energies. In gaseous media such as air, these uncertainties are much smaller (less than 1% for electrons with energy 20 eV or greater). The classical Monte Carlo transport treatment is questionable for sub-1 keV electrons in condensed water as uncertainties on position and momentum must be large (relative to electron momentum and mean free path) to satisfy the quantum uncertainty principle. Simulations which do not account for these uncertainties are not faithful representations of the physical processes, calling into question the results of MC track structure codes simulating sub-1 keV electron transport. Further, the large difference in the scale at which quantum effects are important in gaseous and condensed media suggests that track structure measurements in gases are not necessarily representative of track structure in condensed materials on a micrometer or a nanometer scale.",

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

This, in combination with a smaller photodetachment crosssection 42 , gives a very small photodetachment signal close to the threshold. Therefore, a slightly higher laser power of 215 mW is used to obtain enough signal. The measurement procedure is simpler than for the ground state since no depletion with the high-power laser is needed. Instead, the photon energy scan is started 10 s into the storage cycle and three scans over the threshold are performed before changing to the other laser propagation direction.

Now there is a problem here because in Bohr theory when an electron comes in from infinity it has to radiate half its energy to enter into orbit.There was no evidence for any such radiation and the electron would have needed to have twice the energy to start with.However, there were some theorists including Sommerfeld who had an explanation that the electron could be captured if it had a velocity equal to what it was going to have in orbit.\n\nThere were other disturbing facts.The peaks were 0.01 V wide; the fields in the tube were not that accurate.In addition, scanning the entire voltage range in such small steps would take a long time.Well, Davis and Barnes explained, they didn't quite do it that way: they found by some preliminary work that they did check with the Bohr orbit velocities, so they knew where to look.Sometimes they weren't quite in the right place, so they explored around and found them.Their precision was so good they were sure they could get a better value for the Rydberg constant (known then to 1 part in 10 8 ).\n\nThen Langmuir visited Columbia.The way the experiment was done was that an assistant named Hull sat opposite to Barnes in front of a voltmeter, that had a scale that went from 1 to a thousand volts and on that scale he was reading 0.01 V.The room was dark, to see the scintillations, and there was a light on the voltmeter and on the dial of the clock that Barnes used to time his measurements.",

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

The uncertainty in our experiment is dominated by the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz, corresponding to 50 \u00b5eV 49 . In addition, there are several minor effects contributing to the uncertainty: for an LaB 6 surface ionizer, as used in this experiment, the energy spread has been determined to be of the order of 0.55 eV 51 . This implies a velocity spread of the ions which is compressed due to the acceleration over a high potential in the subsequent ion beam extraction process 52 . The compressed velocity spread of the ions is given by the expression \u2206v = \u2206W / \u221a 2mW , where m is the ion mass, \u2206W the energy spread of the ions and W the kinetic energy of the ion beam 53 . The velocity spread of the ion beam can be converted to a spread of the frequency of the laser light of \u2206\u03bd = \u2206v/\u03bb seen by the ions. This results in a frequency Doppler broadening of only a few MHz in the fast ion beam. The divergence of the ion and laser beams and the interaction time will also contribute to the broadening. However, this accumulates to uncertainties of less than 10 MHz. Consequently, the uncertainties arising from these minor effects could be ignored and only the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz needs to be considered. In addition to these statistical errors, some systematic uncertainties arise: the Doppler shift due to the velocity difference of ions and photons is very large but it can, as described above, be eliminated to all orders by performing the experiment with both co-and counter-propagating laser and ion beams and calculating the geometrical mean to determine the Doppler-free threshold. Hence, the Doppler shift does not contribute to the uncertainty of the result, barring slight potential angle misalignment of maximum 24 mrad as defined by the apertures. However, uncertainties of the ion beam energy and the wavelength calibration could potentially affect the results. Such drifts were estimated to be smaller than 20 \u00b5eV by comparing two reference scans on stable 127 I which were performed with the same setup before and after the measurements on astatine.",

From the uncertainty principle, if the electron wave function were to be squeezed into a small area described by Eq. 3, the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron would increase. In other words, as the electron goes through the contact, it could change momentum due to the uncertainty principle. As a result, Vk ;\u03b1;p is nonzero in general fork \u2260p. Furthermore, if the contact size were to increase (larger uncertainty in position), the uncertainty in momentum would decrease.

The semiclassical function from mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and frozen Gaussian wave packets is computed for the electronic transition of an excited state excess electron to the ground state in liquid methanol. The decoherence function decays on a 10 fs time scale that is qualitatively similar to the aqueous case. We demonstrate that it is the motion of the hydrogen atom, and, in particular, the hydrogen rotation around the oxygen-methyl bond which is predominantly responsible for destroying the quantum correlations between alternative states. Multiple time scales due to the slower diffusive nuclear modes, which dominate the solvation response of methanol, do not contribute to the coherence loss. The choice of the coordinate representation is investigated in detail and concluded to be irrelevant to the decay. Changes in both nuclear momenta and positions on the two alternative potential surfaces are found to contribute to decoherence, the former dominating at short times (t &lt; 5 fs), the latter controlling the decay at longer times. Various short-time approximations to the full dynamics for the decoherence function are tested for the first time. The present treatment rigorously develops the short-time description and establishes its range of validity. Whereas the lowest-order short-time approximation proves to be a very good approximation up to about 5 fs, we also find that it bounds the decay of the decoherence function. After 5 fs, the coherence decay in fact becomes faster than the single Gaussian predicted in the lowest-order short-time limit. This decay is well reflected by an enhanced low-order approximation, which is also easily computed from equilibrium classical forces.",

Therefore, a system at 300 K radiates thermal centered blackbody energy, which disperses into the atmosphere, whose thermal radiation energy is clearly a linear function of temperature.\n\nSimilarly, the kinematic energies of the atmospheric gases are influenced by their absorption of the surrounding atmosphere's thermal radiation. This occurs even though they are not necessarily in a fully enclosed system, as is used to calculate their heat capacities and their relations to kinetic theory. This applies whether it be the traditional, or the more exacting kinetic theory developed by this author [11,12].\n\nInterestingly, at T=3 K, the blackbody radiation is dominated by microwave radiation, which is not exactly what one considers, as being true/pure thermal energy. It becomes increasingly obvious that as T\u21920, any clear relationship between temperature and thermal energy density will be lost.\n\nOf interest, the traditional assertion is that the heat capacities are not constant for all temperature regimes, e.g., heat capacity falters as T\u21920. One can now consider that it is not the notion of heat capacity that falters, rather it is our concept of temperature that collapses. Of course, this raises the question of, \"when is a system's temperature no longer directly proportional to its thermal energy density?\" At this time, the answer is really a guess, 10 K, 100 K, 250 K. Clearly, the relationships between the thermal energy density, and blackbody radiation is not the same for all temperature regimes.\n\n\nXIII.

This paper provides absolute intensity measurements, quantum efficiencies and signal-to-blackbody radiation ratios at peak emission wavelengths, at various temperatures (20-1400\u00b0C), for Y(2)O(3):Eu, YAG:Tb and YAG:Tm thermographic phosphors under 266 and 355 nm excitation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These terms are beneficial in a number of ways for engineers wanting to use a phosphor thermometry solution at high temperatures. They may also provide additional insight to the physical luminescence processes of phosphors at high temperatures. The phosphor signal:blackbody radiation ratio is useful because it combines the effects of blackbody radiation and phosphor emission intensities at various temperatures, providing a valuable quantitative evaluation that can be used as a design aid for phosphor selection. A figure of merit is the temperature when the blackbody radiation equals the phosphor emission (ratio = 1); this is the cross-over temperature at which the blackbody radiation rapidly starts to overtake and mask out phosphor emissions. To the best of our knowledge no such work exists previously. The results presented show a variation in phosphor intensity with increasing temperature, and although the intensity and quantum efficiencies for Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb were much greater than YAG:Tm at low temperatures, YAG:Tm was found to be the most efficient phosphor investigated at higher temperatures (&gt;900\u00b0C). With a peak emission wavelength of 458 nm, YAG:Tm experienced the lowest proportion of blackbody radiation therefore its advantage at higher temperatures was further amplified and was found to offer an advantage of approximately +350\u00b0C and +250\u00b0C increased upper temperature capability compared to Y(2)O(3):Eu and YAG:Tb phosphors, respectively.",

[9] for strongly radiating jet flames, and by Suo-Anttila et al. [10] for ethanol, ethanol/toluene, JP8, and heptane pool fires.The maximum emission observed in Figure 4 is between the blackbody emission curves at 1400 and 1600 K and corresponds to the emission of a blackbody at a temperature of 1522 K.This temperature may be interpreted as the gas temperature.\n\nA similar experimental study was carried out using KO as fuel.Figure 5 shows the maximum emission spectra obtained from the burning of KO fuel beds with a length ranging from 0.5 to 3 m.Data for fresh and dry KO are reported for the same load and same flame length.The comparison between Figures 4 and 5 indicates that the change in fuel type significantly affects flame emission.As previously observed for WS fuel beds, the trend of an increasing emission with fuel bed length is also seen, but with lower emission levels.The emission from soot is also undoubtedly observed.The emission at around 2300 cm \u22121 is still very high, close to that of a blackbody at 1600 K. Emission spectra obtained using fresh KO as fuel gave lower intensities from both inflame soot particles and gas species, as a consequence of different thermal degradation processes.\n\n\nSpectral Radiative Properties",

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ joule seconds ( J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.",

The thermal broadening of the bands are interpreted, in both cases, as a homogeneous component, due to the presence of linear electron-phonon coupling, plus an inhomogeneous component, due to both statistical energy fluctuations at each pigment site and heterogeneity of the sample itself. Sub-bands analysis, in which eight major components are identified, yields a reorganization energy 9 cm(-1) &lt; or = Svm &lt; or = 14 cm(-1) and an inhomogeneous contribution in the range 120-170 cm(-1).

Known as a natural Greenhouse Effect (GE), this near-surface Atmospheric Thermal Enhancement (ATE) as named herein is presently entirely attributed to the absorption of up-welling long-wave radiation by greenhouse gases. Often quoted as 33 K for Earth, GE is estimated as a difference between planet's observed mean surface temperature and an effective radiating temperature calculated from the globally averaged absorbed solar flux using the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) radiation law. This approach equates a planet's average temperature in the absence of greenhouse gases or atmosphere to an effective emission temperature assuming ATE\u2009\u2261\u2009GE. The SB law is also routinely employed to estimating the mean temperatures of airless bodies. We demonstrate that this formula as applied to spherical objects is mathematically incorrect owing to H\u00f6lder's inequality between integrals and leads to biased results such as a significant underestimation of Earth's ATE. We derive a new expression for the mean physical temperature of airless bodies based on an analytic integration of the SB law over a sphere that accounts for effects of regolith heat storage and cosmic background radiation on nighttime temperatures. Upon verifying our model against Moon surface temperature data provided by the NASA Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we propose it as a new analytic standard for evaluating the thermal environment of airless bodies. Physical evidence is presented that Earth's ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth's total ATE is ~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE\u2009=\u2009GE\u2009+\u2009TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE\u2009&gt;\u200915 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth's ATE defined as GE\u2009=\u2009ATE - TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.

From the spectral shape of flame emissions (Figure 4), it may be stated that the flame emissivity is stronger for large wavenumbers (in this range, emission spectra are closer to blackbody spectra) and that the emission level decreases for small wavenumbers.This is in agreement with the expectation that the absorption coefficient of soot strongly rises with wavenumber, as it will be discussed below.If the assumption of opaque flame holds for large wavenumbers, one can observe that the 4 m long flame emission starts from that of a blackbody at 1400 K, defining an effective flame temperature.However, this assumption is questionable for at least two reasons.First, the emission intensities still vary for the 3 m-and 4 m long flames.Second, a higher emission level is reached in the range attributed to CO 2 emission.This shows that the so-called effective temperature is overwhelmed (emissivity cannot be greater than unity) and that the gas temperature should be close to 1600 K.",

Several emission features were detected, including interplanetary He I 584 angstroms emission and geocoronal He II 304 angstroms emission.  Other features observed may originate in a hot ionized interstellar gas, but if this interpretation is correct, gas at several different temperatures is present.

Compared to the usually employed E//c-axis, the a-axis of Yb:YLF provides a much broader and smooth gain profile, but this comes at the expense of reduced gain product. We have shown that, despite the lower gain, which (i) increases susceptibility to cavity losses, (ii) raises lasing threshold, and (iii) inflates thermal load, efficient and high-power lasing could be achieved in the E//a axis as well. A record continuous-wave (cw) powers above 300 W, cw slope efficiencies of 73%, and a tuning range covering the 995-1020.5 nm region were demonstrated. In quasi-cw lasing experiments, via minimization of thermal effects, slope efficiencies can be scaled up to 85%.

This concept is used in radio astronomy, planetary science and materials science. The brightness temperature of a surface is typically determined by an optical measurement, for example using a pyrometer, with the intention of determining the real temperature. As detailed below, the real temperature of a surface can in some cases be calculated by dividing the brightness temperature by the emissivity of the surface. Since the emissivity is a value between 0 and 1, the real temperature will be greater than or equal to the brightness temperature. At high frequencies (short wavelengths) and low temperatures, the conversion must proceed through Planck's law.",

The sky radiance, although not recorded directly, could be determined from the simultaneously obtained high-precision wavelength-dependent sky polarization data near Sirius. This was done by fitting the polarization data with the doubling-adding KNMI (DAK) radiative transfer model, which provided the values of the surface albedo and of the aerosol optical thickness required for determining the absolute sky radiance. Our analysis implies that Sirius, when positioned overhead, can be a daytime naked eye object from sea level even if its culmination occurs at solar noon.

The lower limit of T eff was set to 400 K to avoid nonnegligible contributions of the interior temperature (all models have T int \uf0a0=\uf0a0200 K) into the atmospheric properties, and the upper limit was chosen to be 2600 K to avoid highly irradiated regions where the heat redistribution becomes inefficient and the planetary average irradiation treatment might become invalid. The surface gravity spans from 2.0 to 5.0 to broadly cover possible surface gravity values. Metallicity ranges from \u22121.0 to 2.0 with an increment of 0.5. The stellar spectral types were chosen to be M5, K5, G5, and F5. For C/O, we selected irregular parameter steps ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 with smaller steps around unity to capture possible transitions from water-to methane-dominated atmospheres as predicted by Madhusudhan (2012), reported by Molli\u00e8re et al. (2015), and discussed in detail in Molaverdikhani et al. (2019). We then add K zz as a new dimension to be explored; more discussion and results are in Section 3. Planetary spectra are calculated with petitRADTRANS (Molli\u00e8re et al. 2019).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nCase Study: HD 189733b\n\nOne of the most-studied exoplanets so far (e.g., Moses et al. 2011), HD 189733b represents a proper case for benchmarking. Moses et al. (2011) provided the thermal structure and K zz profile for this planet, which has been used by several studies to perform benchmark calculations (e.g., Moses 2014;Drummond et al. 2016;Tsai et al. 2017). Thus, we use the same set of inputs to compare the outcome of our HD 189733b model with previously published results.",

When the star's or planet's net emissivity in the relevant wavelength band is less than unity (less than that of a black body), the actual temperature of the body will be higher than the effective temperature.

It was flown on a sounding rocket, and data were obtained on the diffuse background between 80 and 650 angstroms.  These are the first spectral measurements of this background below 520 angstroms.  Several emission features were detected, including interplanetary He I 584 angstroms emission and geocoronal He II 304 angstroms emission.  Other features observed may originate in a hot ionized interstellar gas, but if this interpretation is correct, gas at several different temperatures is present.  The strongest of these features is consistent with O V emission at 630 angstroms.  This emission, when combined with upper limits for other lines, restricts the temperature of this component to 5.5 &lt; log T &lt; 5.7, in agreement with temperatures derived from O VI absorption studies.  A power-law distribution of temperatures is consistent with this feature only if the power-law coefficient is negative, as is predicted for saturated evaporation of clouds in a hot medium.  In this case, the O VI absorption data confine the filling factor of the emission of f &lt; or = 4% and the pressure to more than 3.7 x 10(4) cm-3 K, substantially above ambient interstellar pressure.  Such a pressure enhancement has been predicted for clouds undergoing saturated evaporation.  Alternatively, if the O V emission covers a considerable fraction of the sky, it would be a major source of ionization.  A feature centered at about 99 angstroms is well fitted by a cluster of Fe XVIII and Fe XIX lines from gas at log T = 6.6-6.8.  These results are consistent with previous soft X-ray observations with low-resolution detectors.  A feature found near 178 angstroms is consistent with Fe X and Fe XI emission from gas at log T = 6; this result is consistent with results from experiments employing broad-band soft X-ray detectors.",

Accurate calibrations are available for the temperatures of class-O stars, although these are slightly different for SMC metallicity and for stars of different luminosity classes. The temperatures for WR spectral classes are less precisely defined, especially for the SMC and especially for the hottest classes. AB7 completely ionises the surrounding interstellar material to a distance of 20 parsecs and this can be used to derive the temperature and luminosity of the ionising star. This level of ionisation cannot be achieved by an O6 star, so will be almost entirely due to the WR component. Unfortunately, the ionisation is beyond what would be caused by the hottest model, a 120,000K star. An earlier attempt at the same calculation gave a blackbody temperature of 80,000K.

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

This is known as an orbital. The further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the more they gain potential energy associated to a determined orbital. Quantum Mechanics explains that orbitals have quantized energy levels and for moving an electron to another level, it has to receive or emit the exact amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the two electronic levels (\u0394E = E 1 -E 0 ). The amount of energy required to move and electron from energy level E 0 to energy level E 1 can be provided by heat due to a collision with other particles or absorb the energy of a photon. In this case, the energy of a Photon (E = h = hc/ ) should be equal to the difference between the orbitals (\u0394E), this is, only a Photon of a particular wavelength is absorbed and can promote that transition. This phenomenon is known as atomic absorption. A more stable electron configuration of an atom is the one with less energy, also known as ground state configuration. The difference of energy between the last full orbital and the next empty orbital of the atom in a ground state is of the same order of magnitude of photons with wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm, this means, photons in ultraviolet regions and visible light of electromagnetic spectrum. Sodium atom in ground state, e.g., has an electronic configuration of 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 1 . The 3s electron can receive a photon with energy of 589.0 nm (E=2.2 eV) and passes to 3p orbital, which is an unstable state known as excited state.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

Two distinct spectral signatures are identified, suggesting competition between dissociation pathways involving the X (1)A1 and the a (3)A2 potential energy surfaces.

In contrast to the ground state its lowest rotational level is a strong level, the next weak and so on. This means that -Xx -f-l2 -X2, the suffixes referring to the individual atoms of the molecule, is now an odd number (X is the component of l along the internuclear axis). This is necessary to satisfy the rule that the complete proper function of the molecule must be antisymmetric in both the qjectrons and the protons.

This exploration showed that there are no specific features that will lead to reaction on the excited-state surfaces for excitations that are relevant to the troposphere and stratosphere. The calculations did however lead to the localization of a conical intersection point through which a specific loss of H2 could take place. However, the conical intersection lies at 5.4 eV relative to the ground state molecule at equilibrium and is thus inaccessible via single photon excitation at tropospheric and stratospheric wavelengths. In addition to the ab initio investigation we have carried out a femtosecond pump-probe experiment using a 266/400 nm excitation. The results show that the timescale for the internal conversion from the initially prepared high-lying Rydberg states is on the order of a picosecond.

N-H bond fission via the low lying (1)pi sigma(*) electronic state of aniline is experimentally demonstrated. The (1)pi sigma(*) potential energy surface (PES) of this prototypical aromatic amine is essentially repulsive along the N-H stretch coordinate, but possesses a shallow potential well in the vertical Franck-Condon region, supporting quasibound vibrational levels. Photoexcitation at wavelengths (lambda(phot)) in the range 293.859 nm &gt; or = lambda(phot) &gt; or = 193.3 nm yields H atom loss via a range of mechanisms. With lambda(phot) resonant with the 1(1)pi pi(*) &lt;-- S(0) origin (293.859 nm), H atom loss proceeds via, predominantly, multiphoton excitation processes, resonantly enhanced at the one photon energy by the first (1)pi pi(*) excited state (the 1(1)pi pi(*) state). Direct excitation to the first few quasibound vibrational levels of the (1)pi sigma(*) state (at wavelengths in the range 269.513 nm &gt; or = lambda(phot) &gt; or = 260 nm) induces N-H bond fission via H atom tunneling through an exit barrier into the repulsive region of the (1)pi sigma(*) PES, forming anilino (C(6)H(5)NH) radical products in their ground electronic state, and with very limited vibrational excitation; the photo-prepared vibrational mode in the (1)pi sigma(*) state generally evolves adiabatically into the corresponding mode of the anilino radical upon dissociation. However, as the excitation wavelength is reduced (lambda(phot) &lt; 260 nm), N-H bond fission yields fragments with substantially greater vibrational excitation, rationalized in terms of direct excitation to 1(1)pi pi(*) levels, followed by coupling to the (1)pi sigma(*) PES via a 1(1)pi pi(*)/(1)pi sigma(*) conical intersection. Changes in product kinetic energy disposal once lambda(phot) approaches approximately 230 nm likely indicate that the photodissociation pathways of aniline proceed via direct excitation to the (higher) 2(1)pi pi(*) state. Analysis of the anilino fragment vibrational energy disposal-and thus the concomitant dynamics of (1)pi sigma(*) state mediated photodissociation-provides a particularly interesting study of competing sigma(*) &lt;-- pi and pi(*) &lt;-- pi absorption processes and develops our appreciation of the photochemistry of aromatic amines. It also allows revealing comparisons with simple amines (such as ammonia and methylamine) as well as the isoelectronic species, phenol. This study yields a value for the N-H bond strength in aniline, D(0)(H-anilino) = 31630+/-40 cm(-1).",

These transitions could be unequivocally assigned since there was residual orthohydrogen at low temperatures (slow conversion to the ground state) resulting in an observable J=1--&gt;0 transition at 5 K (kT=0.48 meV). A doublet in neutron energy loss at approximately 28.5 meV is interpreted as J=1--&gt;2 transitions. In addition to the transitions between rotational states, there are a series of peaks that arise from transitions between center-of-mass translational quantum states of the confined hydrogen molecule. A band at approximately 9 meV can be unequivocally interpreted as a transition between translational states, while broad features at 20, 25, 35, and 50-60 meV are also interpreted to as transitions between translational quantum states. A detailed comparison is made with a recent five-dimensional quantum treatment of hydrogen in the smaller dodecahedral cage in the SII ice-clathrate structure. Although there is broad agreement regarding the features such as the splitting of the J=1 degeneracy, the magnitude of the external potential is overestimated. The numerous transitions between translational states predicted by this model are in poor agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons are also made with three simple exactly solved models, namely, a particle in a box, a particle in a sphere, and a particle on the surface of a sphere. Again, there are too many predicted features by the first two models, but there is reasonable agreement with the particle on a sphere model. This is consistent with published quantum chemistry results for hydrogen in the dodecahedral 5(12) cage, where the center of the cage is found to be energetically unfavorable, resulting in a shell-like confinement for the hydrogen molecule wave function. These results demonstrate that translational quantum effects are very significant and a classical treatment of the hydrogen molecule dynamics is inappropriate under such conditions.",

Spectrosc. 181, 207-214), rotation-vibration energy levels for the electronic ground state X3B1 of the amidogen ion, NH2+, were predicted using the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program with an ab initio potential energy surface. In the present paper we calculate a new ab initio potential energy surface for the X3B1 state, and we calculate ab initio the potential energy surfaces of the a1A1 and b1B1 excited singlet electronic states (which become degenerate as a 1Delta state at linearity). We use the multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI) level of theory with molecular orbital bases that are optimized separately for each state by complete-active-space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. For the X state we use the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program to obtain the rotation-vibration energies. For the a and b excited singlet electronic states we calculate the rovibronic energy levels using the RENNER Hamiltonian and computer program. We also calculate ab initio the dipole moment surfaces for the X, a, and b electronic states, and the out-of-plane transition moment surface for the b &lt;-- a electronic transition. We use this information to simulate absorption spectra within X3B1 and a1A1 state and of the b1B1 &lt;-- a1A1 transition in order to aid in the search for them. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

The Schr\u00f6dinger solution always puts the states at slightly higher energies than the more accurate Dirac equation.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

The selected rotational levels of the B (1)Sigma(u) (+) and C (1)Pi(u) states are prepared by three-photon excitation from the ground state. The absorption of fourth photon results in photoionization to produce H(2)(+) X (2)Sigma(g)(+) or photodissociation to produce a ground-state H(1s) atom and an excited H atom with n &gt;or= 2. The H(2) (+) ion can be photodissociated by absorption of a fifth photon. The resulting H(+) or D(+) ion images provide information on the vibrational state dependence of the photodissociation angular distribution of the molecular ion. The excited H(n &gt;or= 2) atoms produced by the neutral dissociation process can also be ionized by the absorption of a fifth photon. The resulting ion images provide insight into the excited state branching ratios and angular distributions of the neutral photodissociation process. While the experimental ion images contain information on both the ionic and neutral processes, these can be separated based on constraints imposed on the fragment translational energies. The angular distribution of the rings in the ion images indicates that the neutral dissociation of molecular hydrogen and its isotopes is quite complex, and involves coupling to both doubly excited electronic states and the dissociation continua of singly excited Rydberg states.",

Morse, is a convenient interatomic interaction model for the potential energy of a diatomic molecule. It is a better approximation for the vibrational structure of the molecule than the quantum harmonic oscillator because it explicitly includes the effects of bond breaking, such as the existence of unbound states. It also accounts for the anharmonicity of real bonds and the non-zero transition probability for overtone and combination bands. The Morse potential can also be used to model other interactions such as the interaction between an atom and a surface. Due to its simplicity (only three fitting parameters), it is not used in modern spectroscopy. However, its mathematical form inspired the MLR (Morse/Long-range) potential, which is the most popular potential energy function used for fitting spectroscopic data.

On the one hand, it is a very valuable ingredient since it constitutes a reliable reference and calibration tool to test the accuracy of our numerical approach. On the other hand, it brings out an alternative three-parameter model based on a generalized Morse potential that has a definite advantage over the standard two-parameter model.

Bound statesConclusion\n\nThis work is the first in a series of articles in which we study the rotating Morse potential model for diatomic molecules in the tridiagonal J-matrix representation. Here, we provided an alternative method for obtaining the bound-state energies for four different types of diatomic molecules: H 2 , LiH, HCl and CO. Our numerical results have been compared favourably with those obtained using other approximation schemes such as the variational method using the Pekeris approximation, supersymmetry, hypervirial perturbation, the shifted 1/N expansion, the modified shifted 1/N expansion, the asymptotic iteration method and the two-point quasirational approximation technique. Furthermore, since realistic diatomic potentials are more accurately modelled by the perturbed or deformed Morse potentials, we are confident that our approach will produce much more accurate information about the structure and dynamics of such molecules if we use these deformed potential models. This will be the subject of investigation in one of our future articles in the series. We believe that our approach has the advantage of combining analytic and numerical powers making it very stable, rapidly converging and highly accurate. Of course, the real advantage of our method will be exhibited when we address the issue of energy resonances while taking into account the full contribution of the reference Hamiltonian H 0 (even if it were to include long-range solvable potentials such as the Coulomb potential). As such, our method is systematic, highly accurate, and could easily be extended to other short-range potentials of which the Morse is only an example. Now, the only remaining quantity that is needed to perform the calculation is the matrix elements of the potential V(r). This is obtained by evaluating the following integral: Using Gauss quadrature integral approximation [21], we obtain\nV nm \u223c = N\u22121 k=0 nk mk [V ( \u221a \u03b5 k /\u03bb)], (A.7)\nwhere N is a large enough integer. \u03b5 k and { nk } N\u22121 n=0 are the respective N eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the N \u00d7 N tridiagonal symmetric matrix, whose elements are J n,n = 2n + \u03bd + 1, J n,n+1 = \u2212 (n + 1)(n + \u03bd + 1).\n\n(A.8)",

In this research, a derivation of an analytical formula of equation of state of Morse oscillator is considered by employing the approximations used in the simple fluids theory. The compressibility formula of the pressure and the virial expansion formula of the pressure using the solutions of the main equation of the simple fluids theory with one of the approximations of the theory are employed for the purpose of the derivation. The virial coefficients of the total Morse oscillator pressure (the first order one, and the second order one) are found for Morse oscillator with respect to the fractional volume of the components, where we conclude that the first order term is proportional to the absolute temperature directly and depends on the diameter of the particles, while we concluded that the second order coefficient term is more complicated than the first order one with temperature, and also, depends on the three Morse oscillator parameters and the diameter of the particles. Besides, we conclude that the total pressure of Morse oscillator, generally, depends on the minimum energy of the well of Morse oscillator, the width parameter of Morse oscillator, and the equilibrium bond distance of the oscillator, in addition to their dependence on the absolute temperature of the components, and the diameter of the particles. The formula of the Morse oscillator equation of state which is found in this research can be applied to multiple materials described using Morse oscillator such as lots of dimers in the vibrations spectroscopy.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nImportance of the exponentially varying Morse potential [1] in context of vibrationrotation states of diatomic molecules has been realized in an enormous amount of work ever since its inception about 85 years ago. The celebrated empirical potential has witnessed many important applications in various branches, such as molecular physics, solidstate physics, chemical physics, etc [2,3]. This potential has been studied also in several other contexts. For example, its generalized and photon-added coherent states are discussed [4,5]; series solution for D-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation with More potential presented [6]; controllability with a compact group SU(2) put forth [7]; a series expansion solution of position-dependent mass is given [8]; a proper quantization rule where the energy spectra is determined only from its ground-state energy has been proposed [9]; also its momentum representation by hypergeometric function is suggested [10]. It is well known that, exact analytical results are available only for \u2113 = 0 states, while the rotational Morse oscillator states must be approximated. Thus over the years, a large number of attractive efficient methodologies have been developed for better understanding of this model potential employing a multitude of approximations.",

Bound statesIn this section, we will consider the Morse potential with non-vanishing angular momentum and use our numerical procedure presented in section 2 to evaluate the corresponding boundstate energy spectrum. The stability and the accuracy of our results depend mainly on two parameters, \u03bb and N. N represents the number of basis elements that we used (dimension of our tridiagonal matrix) and \u03bb is the length scale parameter of the basis. The Morse potential with = 0 is not exactly solvable and hence our numerical results cannot be checked against  exact ones. However many numerical and perturbative results have been published in recent years [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. The most widely used approximation was devised by Pekeris [4] which is based on the expansion of the centrifugal ( + 1)/r 2 barrier in a series of exponential terms around the equilibrium inter-nuclear position r e of the Morse potential by keeping terms up to second order in r/r e (i.e., at low excitation energy, where r \u2248 r e ). Other approximations have also been devised but they require the numerical solution of transcendental equations [7,10,13]. In table 3 we show the bound-state energy of the H 2 molecule for different values of the angular momentum generated by using the Laguerre basis with \u03bb = 40, N = 100 and the model parameters in table 1. We also list analogous results obtained by other approximations such as the hyper-virial perturbation method (HV) [11], the super-symmetric method (SUSY) [9], the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) [16], the results of Duff (Duff) [6], the modified shifted 1/N expansion (MSE) [13], the two-point quasi-rational approximation technique (TQA) [17] and the variational method using the Pekeris approximation [8]. In table 4, we give the boundstate energies generated by our method for different values of the angular momentum for LiH in the Laguerre basis using the parameters N = 100, \u03bb = 60 and the corresponding model parameters in table 1. Table 5 shows the numerically generated bound-state energies for HCl using the oscillator basis with N = 100, \u03bb = 6 and the model parameters in table 1. Table 6 gives",

The QHO can be used to describe almost any system in which a certain entity makes small vibrations with respect to an equilibrium point.\n\nIn Figure 1a, we show a one-dimensional potential that is described with a solid line. This potential has a minimum point, for which it is possible to approximate a parabolic function V( ) represented by the dashed line. (a) A \"realistic\" continuous potential is described by the solid gray line. At the minimum, the \"realistic\" potential can be very well approximated by a quadratic potential (dashed black line).

As it has been described before [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37], here we provide only the essential steps; details could be found in the references above.\n\nThe desired radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the following operator form,\nH(r) \u03c8(r) = E \u03c8(r),(1)\nwhere the Hamiltonian operator includes usual kinetic and potential energy operators,\nH(r) = \u2212h 2 2\u00b5 d 2 dr 2 + v(r), with v(r) = \u2113(\u2113 + 1)h 2 2\u00b5r 2 + D e e \u22122\u03b1x \u2212 2e \u2212\u03b1x .(2)\nHere \u2113 denotes the usual angular momentum quantum number identifying rotational states.\n\nLast term in Eq. (2) represents the Morse potential. Potential strength D e > 0, x = (r \u2212 r e )/r e , and \u03b1, r e are two positive parameters.\n\nA large number of numerical schemes for solution of above radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation employ finite-difference discretization. These often require a significant number of spatial grid points chiefly because of their uniform distributional nature. In the GPS method, however, a nonuniform optimal spatial discretization could be achieved efficiently as detailed below, maintaining similar kind of good accuracy at both small and large r regions. Therefore it requires much lesser grid points to reach convergence, compared to many other methods in the literature. One can have a denser mesh at smaller r while a coarser mesh at large r regions. A primary feature of this scheme is that a function f (x) in the interval x \u2208 [\u22121, 1]",

Three potential energy surfaces (PES) are studied, namely, those of Bradley and Schatz (BS), Yu, Muckerman, and Sears (YMS), and Lakin, Troya, Schatz, and Harding (LTSH). 6-D calculations are performed only for the BS PES, while 5-D results are reported for all three PES'. The 6-D results obtained in the present work improve on those previously reported, since a larger vibrational basis and a better representation of the OH and CO bonds has been introduced. In particular, we now employ a generalized Lanczos-Morse discrete variable representation for both the OH and CO vibrations. In a further improvement, the generalized discrete variable representation of the CO vibration is based on different CO intramolecular potentials for the asymptotic and product grids employed in our projection formalism. This new treatment of the vibrational bases allows for a large reduction in computation time with respect to our previous implementation of the wave packet method, for a given level of accuracy. As a result, we have been able to extend the range of collision energies for which we can obtain converged 6-D results to a higher energy (0.8 eV) than was possible before (0.5 eV). The comparison of the new 6-D and previous 5-D results for the BS PES shows good agreement of the general trend in the reaction probabilities over all collision energies considered (0.1-0.8 eV), while our previous 6-D calculation showed reaction probabilities that differed from the 5-D results by up to 10% between 0.5 and 0.8 eV. The 5-D reaction probabilities reveal interesting trends for the different PES'. In particular, at low energies (&lt; 0.2 eV) the LTSH PES gives rise to much larger reactivity than the other PES', while at high energies (&gt; 0.3 eV) its reaction probability decreases with respect to the BS and YMS PES', being more than a factor of 2 smaller at 0.8 eV. A 5-D calculation on a modified version of the LTSH surface shows that the van der Waals interaction in the entrance channel, which is not correctly described in the other PES' is largely responsible for its larger reactivity at low energies. The large difference between the 5-D reaction probabilities for the YMS and LTSH PES' serves to emphasize the importance of the van der Waals interaction for the reactivity at low energies, because most of the stationary point energies on the YMS and LTSH PES are rather similar, being in line with high-level ab initio information.",

The origin of the HF intermolecular bending combination band, (3001(1)0)&lt;--(00000), is 11 548.45(3) cm(-1), 328.2 cm(-1) higher than that of the (30000)&lt;--(00000) transition with an origin at 11 220.250(1) cm(-1). The average rotational constant of the (3001(1)0) level is 0.103 63(1) cm(-1), a 4.8% reduction from B(30000)=0.109 21(1) cm(-1). Perturbations are observed as line splittings, increased line widths, and reduced peak intensities of a number of lines of the e and f components of (3001(1)0). In addition, the centrifugal distortion coefficients of both components are large, negative, and different. The N2 intermolecular bend transition (30001(1))&lt;--(00000) has an origin at 11 288.706(1) cm(-1), 68.456(2) cm(-1) above that of the (30000)&lt;--(00000) transition. This is the lowest combination state at v(HF)=3 level. It is unperturbed, yielding B(30001(1))=0.110.10(1) cm(-1). The transition to the intermolecular stretching state, (30100)&lt;--(00000), has an origin at 11 318.858(1) cm(-1) with B(30100)=0.105 84(1) cm(-1). Both the (30100) and (30000) levels show an isolated perturbation at J=4. The Lorentzian component of the line widths, which show considerable variation with soft mode, are GammaL(30000)=490(30) MHz, GammaL(30100)=630(30) MHz, GammaL(3001(1)0)=250(30) MHz, and GammaL(30001(1))=500(50) MHz.",

For this, laboratory spectra are obtained at 0.006 and 0.011 cm(-1) unapodized resolution and with 4% precisions for the intensities using Fourier transform spectrometers located at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The observed data contain transitions of the nu(4) fundamental band near 1626.276(1) and 1627.375(2) cm(-1) (for s and a inversion upper states, respectively) and the 2nu(2) overtone band near 1597.470(3) and 1882.179(5) cm(-1) (for s and a inversion states, respectively). A total of 2345 lines with J' &lt;/= 15 is assigned from which 2114 line positions with J' &lt;/= 15 are fitted using an effective rotation-inversion-rotation Hamiltonian to achieve an rms of 0.003 cm(-1) with 57 molecular parameters. Over 1200 intensity measurements are modeled to +/-4.7% using 16 terms of the dipole moment expansion. A dyad model is used in order to model all the interactions expected within the 2nu(2)/nu(4) system. The bandstrengths of 2nu(2) (s &lt;-- a), 2nu(2) (a &lt;-- s), and nu(4) (s &lt;-- s and a &lt;-- a) are estimated to be 6.68(24), 0.201(5), and 116(3) cm(-2) atm(-1), respectively, at 296 K.

In addition to these fundamentals, an overtone band 2nu05 and a PAPE band nu3 + nu-/+15 + nu&amp;plusmn;16 have been identified in the region. The excited states of these four bands, together with 2nu2 + nu3, nu2 + 2nu-/+26, nu2 + nu&amp;plusmn;15, nu2 + nu3 + nu&amp;plusmn;16, 2nu-/+25, nu3 + nu-/+15 + nu-/+16, 2nu3 + 2nu0,-/+26, and 3nu3 + nu&amp;plusmn;15, form a complicated level system with a number of resonances coupling the levels. Accordingly the bands have been analyzed by diagonalizing the complete energy matrices with all the interactions simultaneously taken into account. Special care has been paid to eliminate the effects of the near-lying vibrational levels on the constants of the fundamentals. Especially the influence of the strong Fermi resonance nu1/2nu05 has been studied. The model with 60 free parameters could reproduce the 4610 experimental transitions with only fairly modest standard deviation of 4.3 x 10(-3) cm-1. The physically reasonable values for the parameters were considered more important than just the final standard deviation of the least squares fit. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.",

High-resolution (0.0015 cm-1) spectra of the nu12 and nu13 parallel bands of perfluorocyclobutane (c-C4F8) were recorded for the first time by expanding a 10% c-C4F8 in helium mixture in a supersonic jet. Both bands are observed to be rotationally resolved in a jet with a rotational temperature of 15 K. The nu12 mode has b2 symmetry under D2d that correlates to a2u symmetry under D4h and consequently has +/- &lt;-- +/- ring-puckering selection rules. A rigid rotor fit of the nu12 band yields the origin at 1292.56031(2) cm-1 with B' = 0.0354137(3) cm-1 and B' ' = 0.0354363(3) cm-1. The nu13 mode is of b2 symmetry under D2d that correlates to b2g under D4h, and in this case, the ring-puckering selection rules are +/- &lt;-- -/+ . Rotational transitions from the ground and first excited torsional states will be separated by the torsional splitting in the ground and excited vibrational states, and indeed, we observe a splitting of each transition into strong and weak intensity components with a separation of approximately 0.0018 cm-1. The strong and weak sets of transitions were fit separately again using a rigid rotor model to give nu13(strong) = 1240.34858(4) cm-1, B' = 0.0354192(7) cm-1, and B' ' = 0.0354355(7) cm-1 and nu13(weak) = 1240.34674(5) cm-1, B' = 0.0354188(9) cm-1, and B' ' = 0.0354360(7) cm-1. High-level electronic structure calculations at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels of theory with the family of correlation consistent basis sets of quadruple-zeta quality, developed by Dunning and co-workers, yield best estimates for the vibrationally averaged structural parameters r(C-C) = 1.568 A, r(C-F)alpha = 1.340 A, r(C-F)beta = 1.329 A, alpha(F-C-F) = 110.3 degrees , thetaz(C-C-C) = 89.1 degrees , and delta(C-C-C-C) = 14.6 degrees and rotational constants of A = B = 0.03543 cm-1 and C = 0.02898 cm-1, the latter within 0.00002 cm-1 from the experimentally determined values. Anharmonic vibrational frequencies computed using higher energy derivatives at the MP2 level of theory are all within &lt;27 cm-1 (in most cases &lt;5 cm-1) from the experimentally measured fundamentals. Our best estimate for the ring-puckering barrier at the CCSD(T)/CBS (complete basis set) limit is 132 cm-1. Analysis of the C4F8 electron density suggests that the puckering barrier arises principally from the sigmaCC--&gt;sigmaCF hyperconjugative interactions that are more strongly stabilizing in the puckered than in the planar form. These interactions are, however, somewhat weaker in C4F8 than in C4H8, a fact that is consistent with the smaller barrier in the former (132 cm-1) with respect to the latter (498 cm-1).",

The observed line intensities were analyzed to derive the vibrational band intensity and F-factor coefficients. To obtain a good fit to the data, it was necessary to include terms in the expression for the F factor, which account for Coriolis-type and Fermi-type interactions and centrifugal distortion effects.",

The vibrational predissociation linewidths of both (30000) and (3001(1)0) states exceed 5 GHz; thus, the measured spectra are not rotationally resolvable. Under the assumption that these levels are not strongly perturbed, the rotational constants of the two levels are determined to be 0.1100(1) cm(-1) for (30000), 0.1081(1), and 0.1065(1) cm(-1) for f and e sublevels of (3001(1)0), respectively, through band contour fitting. The (30000)&lt;--(00000) band origin is at 10,894.46(1) cm(-1), showing a HF wave number redshift of 478.3 cm(-1). The 4.07 redshift ratio of v(HF)=3 to that of v(HF)=1 indicates a significantly nonlinear increase of the intermolecular interaction energy through HF valence excitation. An ab initio interaction potential surface for HF valence coordinates varying from 0.8 to 1.25 A is used to examine vibrational dynamics. The HF valence vibration v(1) is treated perturbatively, showing that the vibrational redshifts are determined essentially in first order with only a very small second-order contribution. The (3001(1)0)&lt;--(00000) combination transition is observed with the band origin at 11,432.66(1) cm(-1), giving the HF intermolecular bending mode to be 538.2 cm(-1). The high frequency of this vibration, compared to that in similar HF complexes, shows the strong angular anisotropy of the intermolecular interaction potential of OC-HF with respect to the HF subunit. The lifetime of the (3001(1)0) level increases to 28 ps from 14 ps for (30000).",

The fourth column gives the corresponding values of tm, the thickness of aluminium necessary to cut down the radiation through the fixed aperture to one-half. According to either of the equations A or B, the quotient mv2l e f t m should be constant. The values of this quantity are given in* the last column of the table, and it will be seen that there is again a satisfactory agreement between the theory and the experimental results. Though the actual range of velocities is not great, yet owing to the rapid change in mass with change of velocity which occurs for these fast moving particles, the value of mv2, which is what we are really concerned with, increases more than threefold in the course of the series. This is a sufficient proportional increase to afford a reasonable test of the theory.\n\nHaving now obtained satisfactory evidence that, in the three directions where it lends itself to experimental verification, the theory of Prof. Thomson does express the experimental facts concerning the scattering of homogeneous /3-rays, we may now proceed to apply it to the determination of the number of electrons contained in an atom of the various elements concerned.\n\n\nOn the Number of Electrons in an Atom.",

The electromagnetic fields and the complex power generated by the current sources are evaluated. For the fundamental Gaussian beam, the reactive power vanishes, and the normalization is chosen such that the real power is 2 W. The various full Gaussian waves are identified by the length parameter b(t) that lies in the range 0 &lt; or = b(t) &lt; or = b, where b is the Rayleigh distance.

It was assumed that in the predicted continuum excited and emitting molecules go to the nearest quantum state, and that the relative number of transitions taking place when the nucleus is in any small portion of the oscillatory orbit is proportional to the time of stay of an harmonic oscillator in that portion. The values obtained for the com plete intensities of the second positive bands 0 -> 2, 1 -> 3, and 2 -> 4 were 100, 48, and 19. The agreement with experiment is quite good (cf . Table IV) considering the roughness of the method. On the other hand, while the classical method and wave mechanics predict complete intensities, which are in rough agreement, they differ in the predicted excitation and emission prob abilities. The classical probabilities are 100, 51, and 38 in excitation, and 100, 94, and 50 in emission.\n\nAn interesting part of the curves of fig. 2 lies below an accelerating potential of 30 volts.

The energy separation of the 0, 1 and 1, 2 initial emission levels is 0 \u2022 25 volts.

This correction is sufficient to make the band intensity ratios approximately independent of the exciting voltage in this region.",

An improved set of standard results accompanied by irreducible representation assignments has been produced indirectly with coupled-cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples, i.e., CCSD(T), total energy differences at initial-state geometries reoptimized (in 28 cases) with the largest applicable point groups. The best compromises of accuracy and efficiency belong to a new generation of EP self-energies, several members of which may be derived from an intermediately normalized, Hermitized super-operator metric. The following diagonal self-energy methods are optimal: opposite-spin non-Dyson second order (os-nD-D2), approximately renormalized partial third order (P3+), approximately renormalized quasiparticle third order (Q3+), and non-Dyson approximately renormalized linear third order version B (nD-L3+B). Their mean absolute errors (MAEs) in electron volts and arithmetic scaling factors expressed in terms of occupied (O) and virtual (V) orbital dimensions are, respectively, (0.18, OV<sup2</sup), (0.14, O<sup2</supV<sup3</sup), (0.15, O<sup2</supV<sup3</sup), and (0.11, OV<sup4</sup). The 0.06 eV MAE for the non-diagonal, sixth-power (O<sup2</supV<sup4</sup) Brueckner doubles, triple-field operator (BD-T1) EP method is exceeded by the 0.1 eV MAE with respect to experiments in seventh-power, \u0394CCSD(T) calculations and indicates that BD-T1 may serve as a direct, spin-symmetry-conserving alternative in the generation of standard results for VIEs of larger, closed-shell molecules.",

If the electron beam interacts with a pulse of FWHM duration 45 fs, the required peak a 0 to generate this energy loss is 10 AE 2 for a quantum model, and 9 AE 1 for a classical model based on the Landau-Lifshitz equation. For \u03b5 initial \u2248 550 MeV and a 0 \u2248 10, \u03b7 \u2248 0.07 and in the quantum model the electron loses energy at a rate \u22480.75 that of the classical model [38]. In the classical model a slightly lower a 0 is therefore able to generate the same electron energy loss, though due to the relatively low value of \u03b7 the difference in a 0 between the models is small compared to the experimental uncertainties when considering the electron beam energy loss alone. Additionally, the peak a 0 of the f=2 focal spot was calculated to be greater than 20 from measured pulse parameters, which is much larger than that inferred from the electron energy shift.",
