The incident energy is considered in a range of 20 to 2000 keV/amu. Our goal is to establish the relative importance of the intermediate ionization continua of the active electron and the electron-electron correlations. The calculations are based on the independent electron model. The description of initial ground state molecular orbitals of water are described by a complete-neglect-of-differential-overlap method based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals. Numerical results for the total cross sections are compared with other results and found to be in good agreement with the available experimental findings. Differentiation between the reactions of single-electron ionization and single-electron capture in electron removal process as a function of impact energies is also analyzed. Finally, the dependence of cross sections regarding electron removal on different descriptions of molecular orbitals as well as the simplest additivity rule are discussed.",

The first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the first electron, and generally the nth ionization energy is the energy required to remove the atom's nth electron, after the (n\u22121) electrons before it has been removed. Trend-wise, ionization energy tends to increase while one progresses across a period because the greater number of protons (higher nuclear charge) attracts the orbiting electrons more strongly, thereby increasing the energy required to remove one of the electrons. Ionization energy and ionization potentials are completely different. The potential is an intensive property and it is measured by \"volt\"; whereas the energy is an extensive property expressed by \"eV\" or \"kJ/mol\".",

However, our proposed equation has no firm theoretical basis, only that we consider our potential energy approach a logical alternative to the usual kinetic relativistic/quantum mechanical methodology. The results calculated from the equation give excellent agreement with literature values and differ by less than 1 eV and less than 0.02% in all cases from hydrogen up to atomic number 20. This paper provides an updated version of the two-electron equation adapted to calculate the ionization energies of three and four electron ions. Our equation also gives fairly good estimates of first electron affinities. Comparisons are made with another published equation, sources of data are described, and the calculated results are discussed.",

Variation in Ionization Energies - \nThe amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a gaseous atom in its ground state is called its first ionization energy ( $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ ).

Energy is always required to remove electrons from atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are always positive. For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the nucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, the ionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learned about radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and to increase across a period.",

For calibration of the kinetic energy scale, a value of IE(C(7)H(8) (+))=(15.7+/-0.2) eV derived from the appearance energy of the toluene dication upon electron ionization has been accepted generally. Triggered by some recent discrepancies between CS measurements on the one hand and different experimental methods as well as theoretical predictions on the other, we have reinvestigated the photon-induced double ionization of toluene using synchrotron radiation. These photoionization measurements yield phenomenological appearance energies of AE(C(7)H(8) (+))=(8.81+/-0.03) eV for the monocation and AE(C(7)H(8) (2+))=(23.81+/-0.06) eV for the dication. The former is in good agreement with a much more precise spectroscopic value, IE(C(7)H(8))=(8.8276+/-0.0006) eV. Explicit consideration of the Franck-Condon envelopes associated with photoionization to the dication in conjunction with the application of the Wannier law leads to an adiabatic ionization energy IE(a)(C(7)H(8) (+))=(14.8+/-0.1) eV, which is as much as 0.9 eV lower than the previous value derived from electron ionization.

Comparing with values derived from other systems one can test the underlying theories, such as QED. Although the ro-vibrational structures of H + 2 and HD + have been systematically calculated in previous works [1,2,3], which show a good agreement with the most precise measurements, there is scarce theoretical calculation about D + 2 except for the nonrelativistic ro-vibrational energy levels. Experimentally no precision measurements have been reported in recent years.\n\nIn this conference, we will present a systematic calculation of ro-vibrational and hyperfine structure of D + 2 , including the leading-order relativistic and QED corrections, for the states of (v, L), where v = 0\u22124 and L = 0\u22122.",

It is quantitatively expressed as X(g) + energy \u27f6 X+(g) + e\u2212 where X is any atom or molecule, X+ is the resultant ion when the original atom was stripped of a single electron, and e\u2212 is the removed electron. Ionization energy is positive for neutral atoms, meaning that the ionization is an endothermic process. Roughly speaking, the closer the outermost electrons are to the nucleus of the atom, the higher the atom's ionization energy. In physics, ionization energy is usually expressed in electronvolts (eV) or joules (J). In chemistry, it is expressed as the energy to ionize a mole of atoms or molecules, usually as kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol).",

These branching ratios and errors (plus/minus one standard deviation) are estimated by simultaneously fitting each feature in Fig. 4 with separate 2-D Gaussian distributions. Following this fitting procedure, we integrate the fit for each dication state to estimate its contribution to the total NH + 2 + H + yield, while the errors of the fits (determined from the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the fit) are used to determine the uncertainty in each branching ratio.\n\nFrom the PES cuts shown in Fig. 1(a) and the energetics presented in Fig. 4 and Table II, we conclude that the (3a \u22122 1 ) 1 A 1 state dissociates to the NH + 2 ( 3 B 1 ) + H + limit, the (3a \u22121 1 , 1e \u22121 ) 3 E state directly dissociates to this very same limit, and the (3a \n(3a 2 1 ) 1 A 1 (1e 1 , 3a 1 1 ) 3 E (1e 1 , 3a 1 1 ) 1 E FIG. 5.\nThe NH + 2 + H + yield as a function of the kinetic energy sum of the photoelectron pair after PDI of NH3 at 61.5 eV (shown in blue).

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

There is a considerable degree of scatter in the values around 301 nm and 310 nm, including two points with values (including ltr errors) of qbo, D which exceed 1.

It is abbreviated \"kcal/mol\" or \"kcal mol\u22121\". As typically measured, one kcal/mol represents a temperature increase of one degree Celsius in one liter of water (with a mass of 1kg) resulting from the reaction of one mole of reagents. In SI units, one kilocalorie per mole is equal to 4.184 kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol), or joules per molecule, or 0.043 eV per molecule.

This work uses relativistic effects together with other quantum chromodynamic properties and explains how they boil down to an overall spatial angular momentum that is consistent with the experimental data. A 2013 work shows how to calculate the gluon helicity contribution using lattice QCD. Recent Monte Carlo calculation shows that 50% of the proton spin come from gluon polarization. 2016 results from the RHIC indicate that gluons may carry even more of protons' spin than quarks do. However, recent (2018) lattice QCD calculations indicate that it is the quark orbital angular momentum that is the dominant contribution to the nucleon spin.

Additionally, it has been assumed that \u03c9 1,15N /2\u03c0 = 15 kHz and \u03c9 MAS /2\u03c0 = 39.5 kHz, in line with our experimental setup. The calculations were conducted using the formula by Kurbanov et al., which accounts for the entry of \u03c9 1,15N and \u03c9 MAS frequencies into spectral densities. 8 This formula shows an appreciable difference from the standard solution-type expression for the correlation times \u03c4 exceeding ca. 1\u03bcs. Dashed lines in the plot show the relaxation rate constants close to the detection limit (determined by the maximum duration of the spin-lock period that is dictated by hardware limitations) and thus delineate the range of motional parameters to which R 1\u03c1 measurements are sensitive.\n\nOne should bear in mind that the formula by Kurbanov, as well as other similar results, 9 are derived from the Redfield theory. In principle, the range of validity of this formula is given by the following relationship, 2\u03c0(1-S)d NH \u03c4 < 0.1, where d NH is the strength of the proton-nitrogen dipolar coupling (11.5 kHz). The region where this condition is violated is shown as a grey hatched area in the plot. However, our numeric simulations suggest that Kurbanov's results remain sufficiently accurate over the broad (S 2 , \u03c4) region, see Figure 5. To explain this observation, one needs to re-analyze the conditions of validity of the Redfield treatment in the rotating frame under fast MAS conditions, as appropriate for the spin-lock experiment under consideration. Such analysis is beyond the scope of this work.",

The potential function yields an accurate representation of spectroscopic data that span 99.24% of the well depth and the number of fitted parameters is significantly less than half the number of parameters determined in conventional Dunham analyses. A novel variant of the Morse/long-range potential model has been employed in the representation of the ground state potential, and a critical comparison has been made with an extended modified Lennard-Jones potential model. Proper account has been taken of the known long-range van der Waals form of the potential, and our final potential function is determined with constrained literature values of the C(8) and C(10) dispersion energy coefficients, along with a fitted value of C(6)=3.31(5) x 10(7) cm(-1) A(6)=6870(100) a.u. The fitted dissociation energy (D(e)) is compared with the precisely known value based on the recent analysis of data from a two-photon transfer process (STIRAP) in ultracold Cs atoms. It is concluded that hyperfine effects in the X (1)Sigma(g)(+) state are not negligible, and that the estimate of D(e)=3649.84(7) cm(-1) obtained in this work represents an effective dissociation limit lying between the two lowest hyperfine limits. Precise rotational and centrifugal distortion constants for the ground electronic state have also been calculated through conventional perturbation theory. These estimates are fully consistent with the derived potential function and the experimental spectroscopic information.",

The X(1)\u03a3(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 \u00c5), whereas the A(1)\u03a0 state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 \u00c5). The X(1)\u03a3(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;\u03bc&gt;(\u03c5), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)\u03a0. For the level (X(1)\u03a3(+)), &lt;\u03bc&gt;(0) = 0.213 D. The \u03c5(\") = 7 and 8 X(1)\u03a3(+) vibrational levels are found to have the highest probability to be reached via emission from the lowest lying vibrational levels of A(1)\u03a0. The work had a dual outcome: First, it explored consequences of different choices of the state-specific reference \"Fermi-sea\" space (\"active\" space), which is required for the construction and execution of the multiconfigurational \"complete active space self-consistent field\" calculations and the subsequent multi-reference CI calculations. In this context, comparisons with results on the weakly bound ground states of the homonuclear Be(2) and Mg(2) molecules were made. Second, it produced reliable data for the short- as well as the long-range parts of the potential energy curve (PEC). Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)\u03a3(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 \u00b1 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 \u00b1 500 a.u., respectively. The result for C(6) is in excellent agreement with that of Derevianko et al. [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 96, 323 (2010)], (364 \u00b1 4 a.u.), that was obtained in the framework of the theory of long-range interactions and many-body calculations on the constituent atoms. On the other hand, our result for C(8) differs from that of Standard and Certain [J. Chem. Phys. 83, 3002 (1985)] by about 7000 a.u.",

The origins of the X 1A1--&gt;X+ 2A1 and X 1A1--&gt;A+ 2B2 transitions could be determined from the rotational structure of the bands, the photoionization selection rules, the photoionization efficiency curve, and comparison with ab initio calculations. The first adiabatic ionization energy of O3 was measured to be 101,020.5(5) cm(-1) [12.524 95(6) eV] and the energy difference between the X+ 2A1 (0,0,0) and A+ 2B2 (0,0,0) states was determined to be DeltaT0=1089.7(4) cm(-1). Whereas the X--&gt;X+ band consists of an intense and regular progression in the bending (nu2) mode observed up to v2+=4, only the origin of the X--&gt;A+ band was observed. The analysis of the rotational structure in each band led to the derivation of the r0 structure of O3+ in the X+ [C2v,r0=1.25(2) A,alpha0=131.5(9) degrees ] and A+[C2v,r0=1.37(5) A,alpha0=111.3(38) degrees ] states. The appearance of the spectrum, which is regular up to 102,300 cm(-1), changes abruptly at approximately 102,500 cm(-1), a position above which the spectral density increases markedly and the rotational structure of the bands collapses. On the basis of ab initio calculations, this behavior is attributed to the onset of large-amplitude motions spreading through several local minima all the way to large internuclear distances. The ab initio calculations are consistent with earlier results in predicting a seam of conical intersections between the X+ and A+ states approximately 2600 cm(-1) above the cationic ground state and demonstrate the existence of potential minima at large internuclear distances that are connected to the main minima of the X+ and A+ states through low-lying barriers.",

The vibration-rotation energy levels of the perturbed A 2Pi and B' 2Sigma+ states were fitted as individual term values, while those of the X 2Sigma+ ground state were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach.

The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The equilibrium dissociation energy for the X 2Sigma+ ground state of 24MgH has been determined to be De=11104.7+/-0.5 cm(-1) (1.37681+/-0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v''=0) is 739.11+/-0.01 cm(-1).

The ET dependencies of the integral cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v=0-4)+He collisions in the ET range of 0-3 eV have also been measured using the VUV photoionization guided ion beam mass spectrometric technique, in which vibrationally selected HD+(v) reactant ions were prepared via excitation of selected autoionization resonances of HD. At low total energies, a pronounced isotope effect is observed in absolute integral cross sections for the HeH++D and HeD++H channels with significant favoring of the deuteron transfer channel. As v is increased in the range of v=0-9, the integral cross sections of the HeH++D channel are found to approach those of HeD++H. The observed velocity distributions of products HeD+ and HeH+ are consistent with an impulsive or spectator-stripping mechanism. Detailed quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations are also presented for HD+(v,j=1)+He collisions at the same energies of the experiment. The QCT calculations were performed on the most accurate ab initio potential energy surface available. If the zero-point energy of the reaction products is taken into account, the QCT cross sections for products HeH+ and HeD+ from HD+(v)+He are found to be significantly lower than the experimental results at ET values near the reaction thresholds. The agreement between the experimental and QCT cross sections improves with translational energy. Except for prethreshold reactivity, QCT calculations ignoring the zero-point energy in the products are generally in good agreement with experimental absolute cross sections. The experimental HeH+/HeD+ branching ratios for the HD+(v=0-9)+He collisions are generally consistent with QCT predictions.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

Lett. 248, 409), which was determined by fits to vibrational term values alone and was claimed to be more accurate than other published spectroscopically determined potentials for this system, actually gives unacceptably poor results for rotationally excited water. Reasons for this failure are discussed and the dangers of relying on vibrational term values alone are emphasized. Previous spectroscopic potentials for ground state NO2 are all found to have problems with unphysical minima (\"holes\"). Starting from the potential energy surface for the ground (&amp;Xtilde;2A1) electronic state of NO2 constructed by S. A. Tashkun and P. Jensen (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 173) using the approximate MORBID approach a suitable starting point for fits using an exact kinetic energy operator approach was constructed. Least-squares fits to 17 potential parameters gives a potential which reproduces 173 vibrational term values with a standard deviation of only 2.8 cm-1 in the low-energy region (&lt;10 000 cm-1). For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state. We were unable to fit these levels. Tests show that the resulting effective potential surface has no problems with unphysical holes and gives a reasonable representation of the rotational structure of the low-lying vibrational states of NO2.

The emissions were observed from a fast flow system in which tellurium vapor in argon carrier gas was passed through a microwave discharge and mixed with lithium vapor in an observation tube. Two systems of blue-degraded bands were measured at high spectral resolution in the ranges 8000-9000 and 5700-6700 cm(-1) and vibrational and rotational analyses were performed. In order to aid in the analysis of the experimental data, a series of relativistic configuration interaction calculations has been carried out to obtain potential curves for the low-lying states of TeLi and the isovalent TeH and also electric dipole transition moments connecting them. As in the TeH system, the ground state of TeLi is found to be X(2)Pi(i), but with a remarkably smaller spin-orbit splitting. The TeLi calculations indicate a strongly bound A(2)Sigma(+) state, while in TeH the analogous state is computed to lie significantly higher at approximately 32 000 cm(-1), and it is strongly predissociated. Based on the theoretical analysis, the observed TeLi band systems are assigned to the transitions A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(1)(2)Pi(3/2)(X(1)3/2) and A(2)Sigma(+)(A1/2)--&gt;X(2)(2)Pi(1/2)(X(2)1/2).

Their ground-state counterparts--third-order corrections to coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) in the space of triples [CCSD(3)T] or in the space of triples and quadruples [CCSD(3)TQ]--have also been implemented and assessed. It has been shown that a straightforward application of the Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory leads to perturbation corrections to total energies of excited states that lack the correct size dependence. Approximations have been introduced to the perturbation corrections to arrive at EOM-CCSD(2)T, (3)T, and (2)TQ that provide size-intensive excitation energies at a noniterative O(n(7)), O(n(8)), and O(n(9)) cost (n is the number of orbitals) and CCSD(3)T and (3)TQ size-extensive total energies at a noniterative O(n(8)) and O(n(10)) cost.

In other cases, however, the corrections tend to overestimate the triples and quadruples effects, the origin of which is discussed. For ground states, the third-order corrections lead to a rather small improvement over the highly effective second-order corrections [CCSD(2)T and (2)TQ], which is a manifestation of the staircase convergence of perturbation series.",

The expressions are based on a solution to the Boltzmann equation that is exact when the electric field is weak, the electron-Fermi-degeneracy parameter Theta&gt;&gt;1, and the electron-ion Coulomb-coupling parameter Gamma/Z&lt;&lt;1. (Gamma is the ion-ion coupling parameter and Z is the ion charge state.) Assuming a screened 1/r electron-ion scattering potential, we calculate the Coulomb logarithm in the second Born approximation. The ratio of the term obtained in the second approximation to that obtained in the first is used to define the parameter regime over which the calculation is valid. We find that the accuracy of the approximation is determined by Gamma/Z and not simply the temperature, and that a quantum-mechanical description can be required at temperatures orders of magnitude less than assumed by Spitzer [Physics of Fully Ionized Gases (Wiley, New York, 1962)]. When the magnetic field B=0, the conductivity is identical to the Spitzer result except the Coulomb logarithm ln Lambda(1)=(ln chi(1)-1 / 2)+[(2Ze(2)/lambdam(e)v(2)(e1))(ln chi(1)-ln 2(4/3))], where chi(1) identical with 2m(e)v(e1)lambda/ variant Planck's over 2pi, m(e) is the electron mass, v(e1) identical with (7k(B)T/m(e))(1/2), k(B) is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, lambda is the screening length, variant Planck's over 2pi is Planck's constant divided by 2pi, and e is the absolute value of the electron charge. When the plasma Debye length lambda(D) is greater than the ion-sphere radius a, we assume lambda=lambda(D); otherwise we set lambda=a. The B=0 conductivity is consistent with measurements when Z greater, similar 1, Theta greater, similar 2, and Gamma/Z less, similar 1, and in this parameter regime appears to be more accurate than previous analytic models. The minimum value of ln Lambda(1) when Z&gt; or =1, Theta&gt; or =2, and Gamma/Z&lt; or =1 is 1.9. The expression obtained for the resistivity tensor (B not equal 0) predicts that eta( perpendicular )/eta( parallel ) (where eta( perpendicular ) and eta( parallel ) are the resistivities perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field) can be as much as 40% less than previous analytic calculations.

Comparison with the high resolution experiments of Davis and co-workers (Science, 2000, 290, 958) shows that the structures (peaks) found in the relative translational energy distributions of products could not be satisfactorily reproduced in the calculations, probably due to the classical nature of the QCT method and the importance of quantum effects. The calculations, however, worked quite well for other properties. Overall, both surfaces led to similar results, although the YZCL2 surface is more accurate to describe the H(3)O PES, as derived from comparison with high level ab initio results. The differences observed in the QCT calculations were interpreted considering the somewhat larger anisotropy of the YZCL2 PES when compared with the WSLFH PES.",

Based on multireference configuration interaction (MRCISD+Q) results with a correlation-consistent polarized valence quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) basis set, appended with core correlation and relativistic corrections, we propose the relative energies: T(e)(FeNC), (6)Delta(0)&lt;(6)Pi (2300 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Delta (2700 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Pi (4200 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Sigma(-); and T(e)(FeCN), (6)Delta(0)&lt;(6)Pi (1800 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Delta (2500 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Pi (2900 cm(-1))&lt;(4)Sigma(-). The (4)Delta and (4)Pi states have massive multireference character, arising mostly from 11sigma--&gt;12sigma promotions, whereas the sextet states are dominated by single electronic configurations. The single-reference CCSDT-3 (coupled cluster singles and doubles with iterative partial triples) method appears to significantly overshoot the stabilization of the quartet states provided by both static and dynamical correlation. The (4,6)Delta and (4,6)Pi states of both isomers are rather ionic, and all have dipole moments near 5 D. On the ground (6)Delta surface, FeNC is predicted to lie 0.6 kcal mol(-1) below FeCN, and the classical barrier for isocyanide/cyanide isomerization is about 6.5 kcal mol(-1). Our data support the recent spectroscopic characterization by Lei and Dagdigian [J. Chem. Phys. 114, 2137 (2000)] of linear (6)Delta FeNC as the first experimentally observed transition-metal monoisocyanide. Their assignments for the ground term symbol, isotopomeric rotational constants, and the Fe-N omega(3) stretching frequency are confirmed; however, we find rather different structural parameters for (6)Delta FeNC:r(e)(Fe-N)=1.940 A and r(N-C)=1.182 A at the cc-pVQZ MRCISD+Q level. Our results also reveal that the observed band of FeNC originating at 27 236 cm(-1) should have an analog in FeCN near 23 800 cm(-1) of almost equal intensity. Therefore, both thermodynamic stability and absorption intensity factors favor the eventual observation of FeCN via a (6)Pi&lt;--(6)Delta transition in the near-UV.",

For this system b R = 1.10. The results for g ij and Dg = g + \u00c0 \u00c0 g \u00c0 \u00c0 are presented in Fig. 7, where they are compared to MC simulations results of Zwanikken and coworkers. 61 As seen in the figure, the MDE-DH approximation gives excellent results that nearly coincide with the MC ones. Note that the resolution of the ordinate scale in frame (d) of the figure is an order of magnitude larger than in frame (a). It is noteworthy that quite intricate details of the pair distribution functions are obtained in agreement with simulations. Our results are, in fact, slightly better than those of both the HNC approximation and Zwanikken's DHEMSA approximation, 61 which is quite remarkable considering the simplicity of the present Ansatz.\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of core-core correlations in this system, the pair distribution g hs (r) of the hard sphere fluid is plotted in Fig. 7a and it is seen that the main oscillation of g ij (r) with a wave length Ea is caused by these correlations. It is also seen in frames (a) and (b) of the figure that there is another oscillatory component with longer wave length superimposed on the main oscillation. This component is equal to the term 8bw el (r) in eqn (56), which is oscillatory here.*** It makes the g +\u00c0 and g \u00c0\u00c0 curves to repeatedly intersect with one another and has a wave length 2p/k I = 2.06a.

Optimum molecular structures, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and dipole moments of the ground electronic states (X1Sigma+), triplet excited states, and open shell singlet excited states of CuCN and CuNC were determined using different levels of nonrelativistic and scalar relativistic (Douglas-Kroll) [Ann. Phys. 82, 89 (1979)] coupled cluster theory in conjunction with atomic natural orbital basis sets and correlation consistent basis sets. For the relativistic computations the specially contracted correlation consistent Douglas-Kroll (DK) basis sets were used. Moreover, barriers to isomerization from CuCN to CuNC were computed. The predicted structures of the X1Sigma+ state for CuCN are re(Cu-C)=1.826 A and re(C-N)=1.167 A, at the most sophisticated level of theory, the scalar relativistic DK-CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ(DK) method. These results are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined Cu-C bond length of 1.829 A and C-N bond distance of 1.162 A. At the same level of theory, the zero-point corrected barrier to isomerization from CuCN to CuNC is estimated to be 14.7 kcal mol(-1), and the cyanide is more stable than the isocyanide by 11.5 kcal mol(-1). For both CuCN and CuNC the 3Sigma+ state is the lowest lying excited electronic state. At the DK-CCSD/cc-pVQZ(DK) level of theory, the energetic ordering of excited states of CuCN and CuNC is X1Sigma+&lt;a3Sigma+&lt;b3Pi&lt;2(1)Sigma+ approximately 3Delta&lt;1Pi&lt;1Delta. The variations of CN bond lengths in the optimized structures for the different electronic states and the CN stretching frequencies of the ground state and the excited states suggest that metal dpi to ligand pi charge transfer is insignificant, in contrast to previous results for isoelectronic NiCO.",

For the ground state, geometries of the two linear stationary points have been optimized and physical properties have been predicted utilizing restricted self-consistent field theory, coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD), CCSD with perturbative triple corrections [CCSD(T)], and CCSD with partial iterative triple excitations (CCSDT-3 and CC3). Physical properties computed for the global minimum ((approximate)X(1)Sigma+HCP) include harmonic vibrational frequencies with the cc-pV5Z CCSD(T) method of omega1=3344 cm(-1), omega2=689 cm(-1), and omega3=1298 cm(-1).

EFGs obtained at the DC-DFT level vary considerably with the functional; DC-CAMB3LYP and DC-BH&amp;H reproduce DC-CCSD-T results within 0.08-0.24 a.u. (1%-3%) for Hg(CH(3))(2) and Hg-halides, respectively. An updated value of the nuclear quadrupole moment of the I = 5/2 excited state of (199)Hg, Q((199)Hg) = 0.675(12) b is derived from the literature. This value compares well with that derived from our calculated EFG at the DC-CCSD-T level and the experimental data for Hg(CH(3))(2); Q((199)Hg) = 0.650 b.",

The WP-EQM calculations include all total angular momenta up to J(max) = 50, and therefore the various dynamical observables are converged up to 0.6 eV. It has been found that it is necessary to include all Coriolis couplings to obtain reliable converged results. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods are thoroughly compared as a function of the total energy for a series of J values. Comparisons are also made of total reaction cross sections as function of the collision energy, and rate constants. In addition, opacity functions, integral cross sections (ICS) and differential cross sections (DCS) are presented at 102 meV, 201.3 meV and 524.6 meV collision energy. The agreement between the three sets of results is only qualitative. The QCT calculations fail to describe the overall reactivity and most of the dynamical observables correctly. At low collision energies, the QCT method is plagued by the lack of conservation of zero point energy, whilst at higher collision energies and/or total angular momenta, the appearance of an effective repulsive potential associated with the centrifugal motion \"over\" the well causes a substantial decrease of the reactivity. In turn, the statistical models overestimate the reactivity over the whole range of collision energies as compared with the WP-EQM method. Specifically, at sufficiently high collision energies the reaction cannot be deemed to be statistical and important dynamical effects seem to be present. In general the WP-EQM results lie in between those obtained using the QCT and SQCT methods. One of the main, unexpected, conclusions of this work is that an accurate description of the reaction and of its various dynamical features requires a computationally expensive, accurate quantum mechanical treatment.",

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists. As yet, the complete set of bound vibrational energy levels is far from being known, experimentally as well as theoretically. In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)\u03a3(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128]. Theory agrees with experiment within 4.5 cm(-1) on average for the four vibrational level spacings that are so far known empirically. In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)\u03a3(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)\u03a3(u)(-) state.

We suspect that the strong polarizability of the heavy elements makes the simple potential averaging, as assumed in the WS model, insufficient to fit the measurements without also making use of pseudo-potentials.

All physical properties could then be calculated using the physical space part of the orbitals, with multiplicative factors of two in the right places to account for the double occupancy of each physical space orbital. The triplet state of H2 is not, of course, a closed-shell system, but it is completely spin-polarized, meaning the azimuthal component of spin is at its maximum, that is m s = S. For spin-polarized as for closed-shell systems, just one Slater determinant is needed, and all physical properties can be found from the physical space orbitals. However, each single-particle orbital is singly instead of doubly occupied, because the spins of the electrons are parallel. For a locally uniform electron gas this means that at a particular point, with local potential V(r) and local Fermi energy ~F(r), the total spin-polarized electron gas density p~ (r) = 89 where p(r) is the total electron density when each physical space orbital is doubly occupied. To convert the results of our previous work to those appropriate to a spin-polarized electron gas, we need to insert factors of two in appropriate places. For example, from the ordinary field-free Thomas-Fermi-Dirac energy functional [12] V TED [p(r)], which gives the local potential from the local density, we can find VT TFD, the local potential for a spin-polarized electron gas, as a function of the spin-polarized density:\nVT T~D[pT(r)] = v ~~ T(r)] _ 22/3 h 2 [ 3n2pt(r)] 2/3-(1)\nCarrying through the procedure logically consistent with this on the kinetic and exchange energy densities given in (37) \n+ 4(3napr) he r 2 xE ]} r2 B)Xel(21/3a) + 1 a\" BXe2(2U3a) ,\nwhere the variable a is defined as\na =-[3rt2pt(r)]W3r",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

This quotient would be unitless if you were to view the 'e' as being in an energy unit, such as electron volts (eV ). . . then, 'k B T ' (or 'RT ' for the molar quantity) works out to be 2.48 kJ (per mole) at room temperature, and 1 eV = 1.602 * 10 19 J (per particle). So, in that way you could (wrongly) view the units as 'cancelling', but this really is not the meaning of k B T /e -rather, it is energy (in fact the fundamental scale for thermal energy, 'k B T '), normalized by charge ('e'), and that quotient (energy per unit charge) is the definition of voltage. Also, as another way of thinking about it, the above development is akin to the relationship between an electrostatic force at some point in space ( F el ) and the magnitude of the electric field at that point ( E): E = F el /q for charge 'q'. In other words, one can think of the electrostatic field [2] as being the electrostatic force normalized by an elementary unit of test-charge (. . . and so k B T /e can be viewed as an energy density).\n \u00a9 2014 Cameron Mura, Creative Commons \"Attribution+ShareAlike\" license (by-sa) c b a\nAcknowledgementsThis work in the Mura lab at UVa was partly supported by UVa start-up funds, the Jeffress Memorial Trust (J-971), and an NSF Career award (MCB-1350957).",

The potential function yields an accurate representation of spectroscopic data that span 99.24% of the well depth and the number of fitted parameters is significantly less than half the number of parameters determined in conventional Dunham analyses. A novel variant of the Morse/long-range potential model has been employed in the representation of the ground state potential, and a critical comparison has been made with an extended modified Lennard-Jones potential model. Proper account has been taken of the known long-range van der Waals form of the potential, and our final potential function is determined with constrained literature values of the C(8) and C(10) dispersion energy coefficients, along with a fitted value of C(6)=3.31(5) x 10(7) cm(-1) A(6)=6870(100) a.u. The fitted dissociation energy (D(e)) is compared with the precisely known value based on the recent analysis of data from a two-photon transfer process (STIRAP) in ultracold Cs atoms. It is concluded that hyperfine effects in the X (1)Sigma(g)(+) state are not negligible, and that the estimate of D(e)=3649.84(7) cm(-1) obtained in this work represents an effective dissociation limit lying between the two lowest hyperfine limits. Precise rotational and centrifugal distortion constants for the ground electronic state have also been calculated through conventional perturbation theory. These estimates are fully consistent with the derived potential function and the experimental spectroscopic information.",

When applied to non-interacting fermions, an approximation n S [v S ](r) yields an approximation T S [v S ], where v S (r) is the potential in this non-interacting case. Now we introduce a direct approximation to the XC energy, E XC [v S ], as a functional of the KS potential, and ask: How can these two approximations be used to find the ground-state energy of interacting fermions? This question differs from that of deducing the KS equations in DFT, because here the approximation is a potential functional, not a density (or orbital-dependent) functional.",

Thus the entire set of (G)KS orbital energies from a DFA with minimal delocalization error can be used to obtain the photoemission spectrum with good agreement to the experimental reference, suggesting these orbital energies are good approximations to the quasiparticle energies.

( 28) are computed with the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method where the mean field energy of the molecule is minimized to get the Hartree-Fock state and the coefficients of the orbitals [12,21].Basically, the orbital wave functions are written as a linear combination of the basis set as follows:\n\u03be p (r) = \u03b1c c p\u03b1 d \u03b1c \u03c3 c (r).(32)\nHowever, since electrons are spin 1/2 particles, their wave function should include a spin factor \u03b1(r) or \u03b2(r) for a spin up or down, respectively.Therefore, the final form of the spin molecular orbitals is:\n\u03c8 p (x) = \u03c8 p (r, s) = \u03be p (r)\u03b1(r) s=\u2191 \u03be p (r)\u03b2(r) s=\u2193(33)\nTaking into consideration the fermionic statistics of electrons, the Hartree-Fock method gives the wave function of the electronic ground state \u03a8(x 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , x N ) as the Slater determinant of the spin molecular orbitals\n{\u03c8 p (x i )|p = 1, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , 2M ; i = 1, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , N } for N electrons and M molecular orbitals such as 2M > N .\nChoosing a basis set is crucial to get an accurate estimation of the ground state energy [25].The most accurate results can be achieved by considering all combinations of interactions between electrons in different molecular orbitals, all possible Slater determinants, and large basis set expansions [1,12].However, this leads to more Hamiltonian terms and requires vast computational resources.There exists a diversity of basis sets in quantum chemistry literature, each offering advantages and disadvantages that depend on the nature of the molecule to be studied.We cite three examples here which are suitable for small, medium, and large molecules :",

Acta Cryst. A34, 909-921]. They are based on the expansion of |r' - r|(-1) in spherical harmonics and the incomplete gamma function for a Slater-type function of the form R(l)(r) = r(n) exp(-alpha ). The formulae are valid for 0 &lt; or = r &lt; or = infinity and are easily extended to higher values of l. Special treatment of integrals is needed only for functions with n = l and n = l + 1 at r = 0. The method is tested using theoretical pseudoatom parameters of the formamide molecule obtained via reciprocal-space fitting of PBE/6-31G** densities and experimental X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5). The ESP, EF and EFG values at the nuclear positions in formamide are in very good agreement with those directly evaluated from density-functional PBE calculations with 6-31G**, aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The small observed discrepancies are attributed to the different behavior of Gaussian- and Slater-type functions near the nuclei and to imperfections of the reciprocal-space fit. An EF map is displayed which allows useful visualization of the lattice EF effects in the crystal structure of formamide. Analysis of experimental 100 K X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5) yields the value of the nuclear quadrupole moment Q((57)Fe(m)) = 0.12 x 10(-28) m(2) after taking into account Sternheimer shielding/antishielding effects of the core. This value is in excellent agreement with that reported by Su &amp; Coppens [Acta Cryst. (1996), A52, 748-756] but slightly smaller than the generally accepted value of 0.16 +/- 5% x 10(-28) m(2) obtained from combined theoretical/spectroscopic studies [Dufek, Blaha &amp; Schwarz (1995).

Based on the plasma, radiation of the plasma was recorded with time- and space-resolved technology, so Al characteristic radiation spectra were obtained. According to the spectra, the coupling of aluminum 3p electronic angular momentums was simplified as quasi-hydrogen particle. At the same time, the main quantum and orbit angular quantum shielding coefficients of aluminum nucleus, signed as alpha and s respectively, were carefully figured out with related theories of quantum mechanics. With our experiment, the resonance double lines of aluminum were scaled up at 396.15 and 394.40 nm respectively. As a result of our calculation, the main quantum shielding coefficient of aluminum nucleus was sigma = 10.850359, and the orbit angular quantum one was s = 7.332875. Their values were reasonable in terms of the order of magnitude.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

For electronic singlet states the rovibronic angular momentum is denoted J rather than N.

These allotropes are energetically more favorable than most of the previously predicted 120 carbon allotropes. By fitting the HSE06 band structures of six old structures, we optimize the parameters for a general and transferable tight-binding model for high-throughput band structure calculations. We identified that there are 190 Dirac semimetals, 241 semiconductors, and 683 normal metals among the new allotropes. Interestingly, several stable low-energy carbon systems with exotic electronic properties are proposed, such as type III, type I/II mixed, and type I/III mixed semimetals, which are very rare in planar carbon systems. In particular, one nodal-line semimetal has been discovered among these thousands of allotropes, which is the first nodal-line semimetal in sp<sup2</sup carbon systems.

As the  band center region at about 2057.2cm \u22121 is not free of spectroscopic signal and hence the first R-and P -branch lines, R(0) and P (2), were not detectable in a straightforward fashion, the initial assignment was performed by manually adjusting the band origin (while keeping B 0 and B 3 fixed at their calculated values) until good visual agreement between experiment and simulation was reached. In a second step, the band origin as well as B 0 and B 3 were then released in the fitting procedure and quantum number assignment to the experimental lines was adjusted such to best reproduce the calculated bestestimate rotational constants (Table 2). Overall, 118 rotational-vibrational transitions -ranging from P(112) to R(110) -were assigned to this isotopologue. The experimental transition wavenumbers were fit to within experimental accuracy by varying only three parameters using a standard linear rotor Hamiltonian: the vibrational band center, the ground-state rotational constant B 0 , and the upper-state rotational constant B 3 , or, alternatively, the corresponding rotation-vibration interaction parameter \u03b1 3 . All spectroscopic data were analyzed using Pickett's SPFIT/SPCAT [59] as well as the Pgopher program [60] (see also the supplementary electronic material). In the following, despite a considerable number of (partially) overlapping lines and the resulting spectral complexity, five additional isotopic species were identified in the spectrum. Based on isotopic abundance and spin statistical considerations, the \u03bd 3 band of the 78-80 species is about half as intense as that of the 80-80 species (Table 2), followed by the 78-78 species at about one fourth and the 82-80, 76-80 and 77-80 species whose bands are expected to be weaker by factors of five to seven. Spectroscopic assignment of these species was performed based on their calculated band centers and lower and upper state rotational constants, B 0 and B 3 , all of which were scaled further using correction factors derived from a comparison of the calculated and experimental parameters of the parent 80-80 species (see Table",

This strongly hints that the 2 1 A g state is in some sense composed of two triplets, as suggested also by the work of Tavan and Schulten [10]. From Fig. 3 we see that the 1 3 B u state has the lattice distortion appropriate to two neutral solitons, and the 2 1 A g prefers a 4soliton configuration at N =12. Does this mean that one should view the 2 1 A g state as composed of four solitons? Such an interpretation was proposed in the renormalization group studies of Hayden and Mele [11] but is explicitly contradicted in the configuration interaction studies [10] and (at least apparently) in combined experimental/theoretical studies on octatetraene [12]. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine a definitive answer to this question (see Ref.s [3] and [6] for a more thorough discussion). At present, our data on the fully relaxed geometry and energy of the 2 1 A g state on the largest systems (N = 12,14) are not sufficient to determine the resolution of this question unambiguously. This difficulty arises in part because the 2 1 A g state is not the lowest singlet state of A g symmetry and thus must be extracted from the Lancz\u00f6s data with considerable care. However, to date our Lancz\u00f6s results are most consistent with the \"4-soliton\" viewpoint for long polyenes, and not inconsistent with the experiment showing a different geometry for octatetraene.

There are four sets of functions sA, sB, sC, and pA, where the s and p notation indicates that the functions in these sets are eigenvalues of the square of total angular momentum with quantum number l = 0 (s) and l = 1 (p). The letters A, B, C denote different radial dependence, and for each radial dependence and total orbital angular momentum there is one function for each possible combination of the eigenvalues of L z and S z . Because these are atomic orbitals (single electron eigenfunctions) the total spin eigenvalue is 1/2. Writing out the elements of each set we obtain: sA = {sA(0, \u22121/2), sA(0, 1/2)} sB = {sB(0, \u22121/2), sB(0, 1/2)} sC = {sC(0, \u22121/2), sC(0, 1/2)} pA = {pA(\u22121, \u22121/2), pA(\u22121, 1/2), pA(0, \u22121/2), pA(0, 1/2), pA(1, \u22121/2), pA(1, 1/2)} (42) Hence there are 12 atomic orbitals here.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe multiple covalent bonding in terms of atomic orbital overlap\n- Relate the concept of resonance to $\\pi$-bonding and electron delocalization\n\nThe hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, $\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{4}$, shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.\n\n\nThe three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the $\\sigma$ bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the $2 p$ orbitals and the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 5.22). These orbitals form the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ single bonds and the $\\sigma$ bond in the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ double bond (Figure 5.23). The $\\pi$ bond in the $\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{C}$ double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) $2 p$ orbital on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized $p$ orbital (lobes shown in red and blue in Figure 5.23) is perpendicular to the plane of the $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized $2 p$ orbitals overlap in a side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis (Figure 5.23) and form a $\\pi$ bond.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.22 In ethene, each carbon atom is $s p^{2}$ hybridized, and the $s p^{2}$ orbitals and the $p$ orbital are singly occupied. The hybrid orbitals overlap to form $\\sigma$ bonds, while the $p$ orbitals on each carbon atom overlap to form $a \\pi$ bond.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

All the initial clusters experience fast structure rearrangement during the first 40 ps because the chemical environment is significantly changed when they are separated from the detonation product system. Numerous small molecular fragments are produced with part of the cluster disaggregation (see the snapshots at 40 ps in Figure 1), which can easily collide and react with each other to form the products of CO2, N2, and H2O. As the gas molecules liberate, the large carbon-branched chains are constructed through translational motion, rotation, and the twisting of remaining molecular fragments. Some single molecular rings are generated in this process (see Figure S3 for supporting information), and even a few irregular polycyclics are formed under 50 and 60 GPa. This is similar to the graphene formation process reported by Wen et al. [34]. Further collision and aggregation can directly produce more polycyclic structures, resulting in the formation of small quasi-plane configurations (see the snapshots at 115 ps for 40 and 50 GPa, and 70 ps for 60 GPa in Figures 1 and S3 in supporting information). Up to 190 ps, the initial plane structure is almost completed under 50 GPa, which is really ambiguous for the condition of 40 GPa. It illustrates that it is preferable for the initial carbon layers to be formed under higher pressure. Moreover, the higher pressure can promote the formation of quadruple-coordinated carbon atoms, with the bonding of dangling C atoms between adjacent molecular layers (such as the snapshots of 280 ps under 50 GPa, and 160 ps under 60 GPa). More significantly, we observe the obvious rearrangement phenomenon of the initial layer configuration from 70 to 160 ps under 60 GPa, and the disorder cluster configuration is generated temporarily (see the snapshot of 115 ps in Figure 1c). It illustrates that the carbon layer structure is not stable under such high temperatures and pressure.  Figure 2 shows the bonded features of carbon atoms during the structure deformation. The average coordination numbers of carbon increase gradually as the reaction proceeds, with the ranges from 1.925 to 2.893, 2.333 to 2.950, and 2.650 to 3.230 for the conditions of 40 GPa, 50 GPa, and 60 GPa,",

By the 2D nature, there is a mirror plane symmetry (the basal plane) in each of the 2D systems. The p z orbital is odd with respect to the basal plane, while s, p x , p y orbitals are even. Therefore, there is no mixing between out-of-plane p z \u03c0 states and in-plane s+p x +p y \u03c3 states. The representative PDOSs for BC 2 -I, BC-I, and B 2 C-I are shown in Fig. 10. As mentioned above, the p z \u03c0 states are partially occupied. We can clearly see that the separation between bonding \u03c3 states and anitibonding \u03c3* states. For BC 2 -I [ Fig. 10(a)], the C \u03c3 states end at -1.7 eV and the C \u03c3* states start at 7.0 eV; while the B \u03c3 states extend up to 6 eV. For BC 2 -I [ Fig. 10(c)], the hybridized C-B \u03c3 states are hole-doped with the Fermi level 0.8 eV below the top of the \u03c3 bonding states. Interestingly, in BC-I, the \u03c3 bonding states are fully occupied, while the anitibonding \u03c3* states are empty [see Fig. 10(a)]. The large energy separation (4.2 eV) between \u03c3 and \u03c3* states and the full occupation of the \u03c3 bonding states are responsible for the peculiar stability of BC-I. Previously, it was found 11 that boron \u03b1-sheet is most stable due to the optimal filling of \u03c3 bonding states:\n\nElectrons fill all \u03c3 bonding states while leaving all antibonding \u03c3* states empty, and any remaining electrons partially fill out-of-plane \u03c0 states. The reason why best boron 2D structures are determined by the optimal filling of the in-plane manifold is that \u03c3 bonds are stronger than \u03c0 bonds. In this study, we find that the most stable 2D structures of BC and BC 3 (PDOS for the semiconducting BC 3 -I not shown here) have such an optimal filling of \u03c3 bonding states, while the other 2D B-C compounds do not.",

The calculations were performed at the second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) and the coupled cluster including singles, doubles, and a perturbative estimate of triples replacement [CCSD(T)] levels of electronic structure theory. At both levels of theory, by including results corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), we have estimated the complete basis set (CBS) limit by employing the family of Dunning's correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets. The largest MP2 calculation was performed with the cc-pV6Z basis set (2772 basis functions), whereas the largest CCSD(T) calculation was with the cc-pV5Z basis set (1752 basis functions). The cluster geometries were optimized with basis sets up to quadruple-\u03b6 quality, observing that both its intra- and intermolecular parts have practically converged with the triple-\u03b6 quality sets. The use of converged geometries was found to play an important role for obtaining accurate estimates for the CBS limits. Our results demonstrate that the binding energies with the families of the plain (cc-pVnZ) and augmented (aug-cc-pVnZ) sets converge [within &lt;0.01 kcal/mol for MP2 and &lt;0.15 kcal/mol for CCSD(T)] to the same CBS limit. In addition, the average of the uncorrected and BSSE-corrected binding energies was found to converge to the same CBS limit much faster than either of the two constituents (uncorrected or BSSE-corrected binding energies). Due to the fact that the family of augmented basis sets (especially for the larger sets) causes serious linear dependency problems, the plain basis sets (for which no linear dependencies were found) are deemed as a more efficient and straightforward path for obtaining an accurate CBS limit. We considered extrapolations of the uncorrected (\u0394E) and BSSE-corrected (\u0394Ecp) binding energies, their average value (\u0394Eave), as well as the average of the latter over the plain and augmented sets (\u0394\u1ebcave) with the cardinal number of the basis set n. Our best estimate of the CCSD(T)/CBS limit for the \u03c0-\u03c0 binding energy in the PD benzene dimer is De = -2.65 \u00b1 0.02 kcal/mol. The best CCSD(T)/cc-pV5Z calculated value is -2.62 kcal/mol, just 0.03 kcal/mol away from the CBS limit. For comparison, the MP2/CBS limit estimate is -5.00 \u00b1 0.01 kcal/mol, demonstrating a 90% overbinding with respect to CCSD(T). The spin-component-scaled (SCS) MP2 variant was found to closely reproduce the CCSD(T) results for each basis set, while scaled opposite spin (SOS) MP2 yielded results that are too low when compared to CCSD(T).

The computed rate coefficients obtained at different ab initio, DFT and TST levels are compared with experimental values available in the 1000-1200 K temperature range. Based on the rate coefficients computed at the ICVT/SCT level, the highest TST level used in this study, the BH&amp;HLYP functional performs best among all the functionals used, while the RCCSD(T)/CBS//MP2/6-31++G** level is the best among all the ab initio levels used. Comparing computed reaction rate coefficients obtained at different levels of theory shows that, the computed barrier height has the strongest effect on the computed reaction rate coefficients as expected. Variational effects on the computed rate coefficients are found to be negligibly small. Although tunneling effects are relatively small at high temperatures (~1500 K), SCT corrections are significant at low temperatures (~300 K), and both barrier heights and the magnitudes of the imaginary frequencies affect SCT corrections.",

Methyl radicals were generated by laser flash photolysis of azomethane or acetone. Methylperoxy radicals were monitored by UV absorption at 240 nm. The falloff curves of the rate constants are represented by the simplified expression k/k(infinity) approximately [x/(1 + x)]F(cent)(1/{1+[(log)(x)/)(N)(]2}) with x = k(0)/k(infinity) F(cent) approximately 0.33, and N approximately 1.47, where k(0) and k(infinity) denote the limiting low and high-pressure rate constants, respectively. At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed. This effect is attributed to a contribution from the radical complex mechanism as was also observed in other recombination reactions of larger radicals. Equal limiting low-pressure rate constants k(0) = [M]7 x 10(-31)(T/300 K)(-3.0) cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1) were fitted for M = Ar and N(2) whereas limiting high-pressure rate constants k(infinity) = 2.2 x 10(-12)(T/300 K)(0.9) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) were approached. These values are discussed in terms of unimolecular rate theory. It is concluded that a theoretical interpretation of the derived rate constants has to be postponed until better information of the potential energy surface is available. Preliminary theoretical evaluation suggests that there is an \"anisotropy bottleneck\" in the otherwise barrierless interaction potential between CH(3) and O(2).",

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface. Rate constants calculated with the CVBMM surface agree with the MPW54 rate constants within 12% for 534-2000 K and within 23% for 200-491 K. The full CVBMM potential-energy surface is now available for use in variety of dynamics calculations, and it provides a prototype for developing CVBMM potential-energy surfaces for other reactions.",

The branching ratio for CH2O*- + CH3Cl on improved potential energy surfaces.\nThe reaction of formaldehyde radical anion with methyl chloride, CH2O*- + CH3Cl, is an example in which a single transition state leads to two products: substitution at carbon (Sub(C), CH3CH2O* + Cl-) and electron transfer (ET, CH2O + CH3* + Cl-). The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study. This difference can be attributed to a better value for the calculated energy release from the initial transition state and to an improved Sub(C) --&gt; ET barrier height with the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods.",

This surface is completely symmetric with respect to the permutation of the four chlorine atoms and is calibrated with respect to experimental thermal rate constants available over the temperature range 297-904 K. On this surface, the thermal rate constants were calculated using variational transition-state theory with semiclassical transmission coefficients over a wider temperature range 300-2500 K, therefore obtaining kinetics information at higher temperatures than are experimentally available. This surface was also used to analyze dynamical features, such as tunneling and reaction-path curvature. In the first case, the influence of the tunneling factor is very small since a heavy chlorine atom has to pass through the barrier. In the second, it was found that vibrational excitation of the Cl-H stretching mode can be expected in the exit channel.",

The force associated with this potential is discontinuous at angles close to 180\u00b0, which can lead to numeric instabilities. Angle bending of linear groups, such as alkynes or nitriles, or linear molecules, such as carbon dioxide, can be treated by a simple harmonic potential if we describe the fluctuations as a deviation from a reference position of the central atom, the position of which is determined by the flanking atoms. The force constant for the linear angle potential can be derived analytically from the corresponding force constant in the traditional potential. The new potential is tested on the properties of alkynes, nitriles, and carbon dioxide. We find that the angles of the linear groups remain about 2\u00b0 closer to 180\u00b0 using the new potential. The bond and angle force constants for carbon dioxide were tuned to reproduce the experimentally determined frequencies. An interesting finding was that simulations of liquid carbon dioxide under pressure with the new flexible model were stable only when explicitly modeling the long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions due to the very long-range nature of the LJ interactions (&gt;1.7 nm). In the other tested liquids, we find that a Lennard-Jones cutoff of 1.1 nm yields similar results as the particle mesh Ewald algorithm for LJ interactions. Algorithmic factors influencing the stability of liquid simulations are discussed as well. Finally, we demonstrate that the linear angle potential can be used in free energy perturbation calculations.",

The analytical potential energy surface for this reaction was constructed with suitable functional forms to represent vibrational modes, and both channels were independently fitted to reproduce experimental and theoretical information only at the stationary points. The rate constants for the Cl- and H-channels and the overall reaction were calculated using variational transition-state theory with multidimensional tunneling effect over a wide temperature range, 298-3000 K. The Cl-abstraction reaction is preferred until 2100 K, while above this temperature the H-abstraction channel is favored. The theoretical overall rate constants agree with the experimental data in the common temperature range, 500-800 K, with a small curvature of the Arrhenius plot due mainly to the role of the tunneling in the H-abstraction channel. This surface was then used to analyze dynamical features, such as reaction-path curvature, and coupling between the reaction-coordinate and vibrational modes. It was found qualitatively that excitation of the C-Cl and C-H stretching reactive modes enhances the forward rate constants for the Cl- and H-abstraction channels, respectively, and only the Cl-H and H-H stretching modes in the products of the Cl- and H-abstraction reactions, respectively, appear vibrationally excited.",

Carbazole has 3 fused rings and yet it has a high triplet energy. In order to illuminate the reason behind this, we synthesized a range of carbazole derivatives with substitution at the 3,6-positions. All carbazoles with phenyl moieties substituted at the 3,6-positions exhibit a lower triplet energy than that of carbazole itself. We also quantified the aromaticity of carbazole using the nucleus-independent chemical shift tensor. We discovered that the five-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring in carbazole has reduced aromaticity. This results in a reduced conjugation effect between the five-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring and the neighboring benzene rings. Inspired by this finding, the triplet energies of compounds with up to seven benzene units separated by heterocycles (furan, pyrrole, thiophene, silole, and phosphole) and cyclopentadiene were calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. A high triplet energy (&gt;3 eV) can be obtained by alternating high aromaticity and reduced aromaticity in highly extended fused \u03c0 systems containing furan and pyrrole. In tricyclic aromatic compounds (dibenzofuran, carbazole, fluorene, dibenzothiophene, 5<iH</i-benzo[<ib</i]phosphinedole and 9<iH</i-9-silafluorene) and their extended fused \u03c0 systems that we have examined so far, the triplet energy is related to the electronegativity of the oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorous and silicon atoms. These findings provide new intuitive insight related to the structures of molecules and the triplet energies, which could be useful in organic optoelectronics.",

We prepare the mid |110&gt;|0&gt;(A1,E), mid |200&gt;|&gt;0(E), and mid |100&gt;|0&gt; +nu3 +nu5 eigenstates by direct midinfrared absorption near 6000 cm(-1). The vibrationally excited molecules react with photolytic Cl atoms, and we monitor the vibrational states of the CH2D or CH3 radical products by 2+1 resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization. Initial excitation of the |200&gt;|0&gt;(E) state leads to a twofold increase in CH2D products in the vibrational ground state compared to|100&gt;|0&gt; +nu3 +nu5 excitation, indicating mode-selective chemistry in which the C-H stretch motion couples more effectively to the H-atom abstraction coordinate than bend motion. For two eigenstates that differ only in the symmetry of the vibrational wave function, |110&gt;|0&gt;(A1) and |110&gt;|0&gt;(E), the ratio of reaction cross sections is 1.00 +/- 0.05, showing that there is no difference in enhancement of the H-atom abstraction reaction. Molecules with excited local modes corresponding to one quantum of C-H stretch in each of two distinct oscillators react exclusively to form C-H stretch excited CH2D products. Conversely, eigenstates containing stretch excitation in a single C-H oscillator form predominantly ground vibrational state CH2D products. Analyzing the product state yields for reaction of the |110&gt;|0&gt;(A1) state of CH3D yields an enhancement of 20 +/- 4 over the thermal reaction. A local mode description of the vibrational motion along with a spectator model for the reactivity accounts for all of the observed dynamics.",

We employ the hybrid density functional theoretical method (B3LYP) at the 6-311+G * * level. The standard scaling is applied to the frequencies by employing a scale factor of \u223c 0.9688 (Borowski 2012). Yang et al. (2013) have carried out computations for seven methylated PAH molecules with the B3LYP method in conjunction with a variety of basis sets. These basis sets, in order of increasing computational demand and accuracy, are 6-31G * , 6-31+G * , 6-311+G * , 6-311G * * , 6-31+G * * , 6-31++G * * , 6-311+G * * , 6-311++G * * , 6-311+G(3df,3pd), and 6-311++G(3df,3pd). The second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is widely considered to be more accurate than B3LYP in computing band intensities (see Cramer et al. 2004). To examine the accuracy of the B3LYP method, Yang et al. (2013) have performed calculations with B3LYP and MP2, using the most extensive basis set 6-311++G(3df,3pd) for both methods. It is found that the results computed from B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) closely agree with that from MP2/6-311++G(3df,3pd). On the other hand, Yang et al.

On the other hand, presenting strong vibration-rotation bands in the 9 \u03bcm atmospheric window, it is a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. In the present work, the vibrational and ro-vibrational properties of CH(2)F(2), providing basic data for its atmospheric modeling, are studied in detail by coupling medium resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to high-level electronic structure ab initio calculations. Experimentally a full quantum assignment and accurate integrated absorption cross sections are obtained up to 5000 cm(-1). Ab initio calculations are carried out by using CCSD(T) theory and large basis sets of either the correlation consistent or atomic natural orbital hierarchies. By using vibrational perturbation theory to second order a complete set of vibrational and ro-vibrational parameters is derived from the ab initio quartic anharmonic force fields, which well compares with the spectroscopic constants retrieved experimentally. An excellent agreement between theory and experiment is achieved for vibrational energy levels and integrated absorption cross sections: transition frequencies up to four quanta of vibrational excitation are reproduced with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 7 cm(-1) while intensities are predicted within few km mol(-1) from the experiment. Basis set performances and core correlation effects are discussed throughout the paper. Particular attention is focused in the understanding of the anharmonic couplings which rule the vibrational dynamics of the |\u03bd(1)&gt;, |2\u03bd(8)&gt;, |2\u03bd(2)&gt; three levels interacting system. The reliability of the potential energy and dipole moment surfaces in reproducing the vibrational eigenvalues and intensities as well as in modeling the vibrational and ro-vibrational mixings over the whole 400-5000 cm(-1) region is also demonstrated by spectacular spectral simulations carried out by using the ro-vibrational Hamiltonian constants, and the relevant coupling terms, obtained from the perturbation treatment of the ab initio anharmonic force field. The present results suggest CH(2)F(2) as a prototype molecule to test ab initio calculations and theoretical models.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group.

The Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) and Einstein's B coefficients were computed by quantum vibrational calculations using the three-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the SiH(2)(X(1)A(1),A(1)B(1),B(1)A(1)) electronic states and the electronic transition moments for the X-A, X-B, and A-B system. The global PESs were determined by the multireference configuration interaction calculations with the Davidson correction and the interpolant moving least-squares method combined with the Shepard interpolation. The obtained FCFs for the X-A and A-B systems exhibit that the bending mode is strongly enhanced in the excitation since the equilibrium bond angle greatly varies with the three states; the barrier to linearity is evaluated to be 21,900 cm(-1) for the X state, 6400 cm(-1) for the A state, and 230-240 cm(-1) for the B state. The theoretical lifetimes for the pure bending levels of the A and B states were calculated from the fluorescence decay rates for the A-X, B-A, and B-X emissions.",

S is the entropy, h is the Planck constant, \u03bd is the computed vibrational frequencies, \u0398 is the characteristic temperature of vibration, k is the Boltzmann constant, and R is the molar gas constant.T is the temperature and is taken as 298.15K.The entropy of other adsorbed states (T\u0394S) is calculated from the vibrational frequencies associated with the standard modes in the harmonic approximation [15].The contributions are listed (Tables S8 and S9).For adsorbates, E ZPE and S are obtained from vibrational frequency calculations with harmonic approximation, and contributions from the slabs are neglected.In contrast, for molecules, these values are taken from NIST-JANAF thermochemical Tables [16].\n\n\nResult and Discussion",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

In this sense, it is quite dangerous to call the number k a wavenumber, since it is not related to momentum like \"wavenumber\" usually is. The rationale for calling k the wavenumber is that it enumerates the number of crests that the wavefunction has inside the box, and in this sense it is a wavenumber.

The magnitude of the momentum is given by where h is Planck's constant and L is the length of a side of the box. Each possible state of a particle can be thought of as a point on a 3-dimensional grid of positive integers. The distance from the origin to any point will be Suppose each set of quantum numbers specify f states where f is the number of internal degrees of freedom of the particle that can be altered by collision. For example, a spin particle would have f=2, one for each spin state. For large values of n, the number of states with magnitude of momentum less than or equal to p from the above equation is approximately which is just f times the volume of a sphere of radius n divided by eight since only the octant with positive ni is considered. Using a continuum approximation, the number of states with magnitude of momentum between p and p+dp is therefore",

Quantum reaction probabilities P and reaction cross sections sigma are compared with corresponding quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) results.

When moving from v=0 to v=1 there is a large increase in P and sigma, as expected for a late barrier system. For v=2 the reaction becomes exoergic and P approximately 0.95 (with the exception of large total angular momenta where centrifugal barriers play a role).

We show that a plot of the exact return probability brings out the quantal images of the classical periodic orbits. Then we compare the exact return probability with its semiclassical approximation for a soft chaotic system with two degrees of freedom. We find two situations where classical trajectories satisfying the correct boundary conditions must be excluded from the semiclassical formula. The first occurs when the contribution of the trajectory to the propagator becomes exponentially large as Planck's over 2 pi goes to zero. The second occurs when the contributing trajectories undergo bifurcations. Close to the bifurcation the semiclassical formula diverges. More interestingly, in the example studied, after the bifurcation, where more than one trajectory satisfying the boundary conditions exist, only one of them in fact contributes to the semiclassical formula, a phenomenon closely related to Stokes lines. When the contributions of these trajectories are filtered out, the semiclassical results show excellent agreement with the exact calculations.",

For the potential describing a finite motion (double-well) one has always a regular behavior. For Lambda&lt;&lt;1, there are well defined resonance pairs of levels and the survival probability has coherent oscillations related to resonance splitting. However, for Lambda&gt;&gt;1 there are no oscillations at all for the survival probability, and there is almost an exponential decay with the characteristic time determined by Fermi golden rule.

The key hypothesis is that the random class of potential energy valleys dominates the statistical mechanics of the liquid at temperatures above melting T approximately greater than Tm and that these valleys are macroscopically uniform in the thermodynamic limit. This allows us to use a single random valley to calculate the vibrational contribution to liquid properties, exactly in the thermodynamic limit, and as an approximation at finite number of particles N . This approximation is tested here for liquid Na with a physically realistic potential based on electronic structure theory. Steepest descent quenches were made from the molecular dynamics equilibrium liquid (N=500) at temperatures from 0.90Tm to 3.31Tm, and six potential parameters were calculated for each structure, namely, the potential energy and five principal moments of the vibrational frequency distribution. The results show temperature-independent means and small standard deviations for all potential parameters, consistent with random valley uniformity at N--&gt;infinity, and with finite- N broadening at N=500. The expected error in the single random valley approximation for Na at N=500 and T approximately greater than Tm is 0.1% for the entropy and 0.5% for the internal energy, negligible in the current development of liquid dynamics theory. In related quench studies of recent years, the common finding of nearly temperature-independent means of structural potential energy properties at T approximately greater than Tm suggests that the single random valley approximation might also apply to systems more complicated than the elemental liquids.",

In this work we apply the FH formulation to the study of NeN-coronene clusters (N = 1-4, 14) in the 2-14 K temperature range. Quadratic (FH2) and quartic (FH4) contributions to the effective potentials are built upon Ne-Ne and Ne-coronene analytical potentials. In particular, a new corrected expression for the FH4 effective potential is reported. FH2 and FH4 cluster energies and structures-obtained from energy optimization through a basin-hopping algorithm as well as classical Monte Carlo simulations-are reported and compared with reference path integral Monte Carlo calculations. For temperatures T &gt; 4 K, both FH2 and FH4 potentials are able to correct the purely classical calculations in a consistent way. However, the FH approach fails at lower temperatures, especially the quartic correction. It is thus crucial to assess the range of applicability of this formulation and, in particular, to apply the FH4 potentials with great caution. A simple model of N isotropic harmonic oscillators allows us to propose a means of estimating the cutoff temperature for the validity of the method, which is found to increase with the number of atoms adsorbed on the coronene molecule.

The usual canonical-ensemble mean-field solution of the inertial classical n-vector ferromagnet (for which n=3 recovers the particular Heisenberg model considered herein) is briefly reviewed, showing the well-known second-order phase transition. This Heisenberg model is studied numerically within the microcanonical ensemble through molecular dynamics. In what concerns the caloric curve, it is shown that, far from criticality, the kinetic temperature obtained at the long-time-limit microcanonical-ensemble simulation recovers well the equilibrium canonical-ensemble estimate, whereas, close to criticality, a discrepancy (presumably due to finite-size effects) is found. The time evolution of the kinetic temperature indicates that a basin of attraction exists for the initial conditions for which the system evolves into a metastable state, whose duration diverges as N--&gt; infinity, before attaining the terminal thermal equilibrium. Such a metastable state is observed for a whole range of energies, which starts right below criticality and extends up to very high energies (in fact, the gap between the kinetic temperatures associated with the metastable and the terminal-equilibrium states is expected to disappear only as one approaches infinite energy). To the best our knowledge, this has never before been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, in a noticeable way, for such a large range of energies. For example, for the XY (n=2) version of the present model, such a behavior was observed only near criticality.

The product distribution of the ortho-para conversion reaction can be given by ratios of cumulative reaction probabilities (CRP) calculated by microcanonical statistical theory with conservation of energy, motional angular momentum, nuclear spin, and parity. A statistical method to calculate the state-to-state reaction probabilities for given initial nuclear spin species, rotational states, and collision energies is developed using a simple semiclassical approximation of tunneling and above-barrier reflection. A new calculation method of branching ratios for given total nuclear spins and scrambling mechanisms is also developed. The anisotropic long-range electrostatic interaction potential of H(2) in the Coulomb field of H(3) (+) is taken into account using the first-order perturbation theory in forming the complex. The CRPs and the product distribution of the ortho-para conversion reaction at very low energies with reactants in their ground vibronic and lowest rotational states for given initial nuclear spin species are presented as a function of collision energy assuming complete proton scrambling or incomplete proton scrambling. The authors show that the product distribution at very low energies (or very low temperatures) differs substantially from the high energy (or high temperature) limit branching ratios.",

Reaction probabilities and integral cross sections (ICSs) between a collisional energy of 10(-4) eV and 0.1 eV have been calculated and compared with previously reported results of a time independent quantum mechanical (TIQM) approach. The TIQM results exhibit a dense profile with numerous narrow resonances down to Ec ~ 10(-2) eV and for the case of H2(v = 0, j = 0) a prominent peak is found at ~2.5 \u00d7 10(-4) eV. The analysis at the state-to-state level reveals that this feature is originated in those processes which yield the formation of rotationally excited HD(v' = 0, j' &gt; 0). The statistical predictions reproduce reasonably well the overall behaviour of the TIQM ICSs at the larger energy range (Ec \u2265 10(-3) eV). Thermal rate constants are in qualitative agreement for the whole range of temperatures investigated in this work, 10-100 K, although the SQM values remain above the TIQM results for both initial H2 rotational states, j = 0 and 1. The enlargement of the asymptotic region for the statistical approach is crucial for a proper description at low energies. In particular, we find that the SQM method leads to rate coefficients in terms of the energy in perfect agreement with previously reported measurements if the maximum distance at which the calculation is performed increases noticeably with respect to the value employed to reproduce the TIQM results.",

Five mixed quantum/classical methods are tested: one mean-field approach (the coherent switching with decay of mixing method), two surface-hopping methods [the fewest switches with time uncertainty (FSTU) and FSTU with stochastic decay (FSTU/SD) methods], and two surface-hopping methods with zero-point energy (ZPE) maintenance [the FSTUSD+trajectory projection onto ZPE orbit (TRAPZ) and FSTUSD+minimal TRAPZ (mTRAPZ) methods]. We found a qualitative difference between final NH(2) internal energy distributions obtained for n(2)=0 and n(2)&gt;1, as observed in experiments. Distributions obtained for n(2)=1 present an intermediate behavior between distributions obtained for smaller and larger n(2) values. The dynamics is found to be highly electronically nonadiabatic with all these methods. NH(2) internal energy distributions may have a negative energy tail when the ZPE is not maintained throughout the dynamics. The original TRAPZ method was designed to maintain ZPE in classical trajectories, but we find that it leads to unphysically high internal vibrational energies. The mTRAPZ method, which is new in this work and provides a general method for maintaining ZPE in either single-surface or multisurface trajectories, does not lead to unphysical results and is much less time consuming. The effect of maintaining ZPE in mixed quantum/classical dynamics is discussed in terms of agreement with experimental findings. The dynamics for n(2)=0 and n(2)=6 are also analyzed to reveal details not available from experiment, in particular, the time required for quenching of electronic excitation and the adiabatic energy gap and geometry at the time of quenching.",

(5.1) can be written in the form\nln \u039e 0 = N v (M 0 \u2212 a 0 + E 0 (\u00b5)) + N v E(\u03c1 0 ), (5.3)\nhere \u039e 0 denotes the GPF expressed by Eq. (4.5) in the mean-field approximation In order to provide further calculations the critical temperature T c should be defined. Since we are limited to the mean-field approximation, the equation for T c is determined from the following conditio\u00f1\nE(\u03c1 0 ) = M\u03c1 0 \u2212 1 2d (0)\u03c1 2 0 \u2212 a 4 24\u03c1d(0) T =Tc = 0.

The resulting NM are consistent with the vibrational density of states (DOS) (every feature of the DOS can be attributed to one or few NMs). At low temperatures they coincide with the ones obtained from the Hessian matrix. We define the NMs (rho(i)) by imposing the condition that their velocities be uncorrelated to each other: rho(i)(t)rho(j)(t) proportional, variant delta(ij), where denotes time average and delta(ij) is Kronecker's delta. With this definition the modes are the eigenvectors of the matrix K(ij)(v)=1/2&lt;square root of (m(i)m(j))v(i)v(j)&gt; [i, j=1,...,3N (N being the number of atoms); m are masses and v atomic velocities].

This electronic channel is forbidden owing to inversion symmetry selection rules, but it can be accessed when a nonsymmetric vibration is excited, such as bending or antisymmetric stretching. Photoelectron spectra are acquired for photon energies 17&lt;/=hnu&lt;/=72 eV, and it is observed that the forbidden vibrational transitions are selectively enhanced in the region of a symmetry-forbidden continuum shape resonance centered at hnu approximately 42 eV. Schwinger variational calculations are performed to analyze the data, and the theoretical analysis demonstrates that the observed forbidden transitions are due to photoelectron-mediated vibronic coupling, rather than interchannel Herzberg-Teller mixing. We observe and explain the counterintuitive result that some vibrational branching ratios vary strongly with energy in the region of the resonance, even though the resonance position and width are not appreciably influenced by geometry changes that correspond to the affected vibrations. In addition, we find that another resonant channel, 5sigma(u)--&gt;kpi(g), influences the symmetric stretch branching ratio.

The method is illustrated on the example of three states. We show that the problem depends on the phases of the complex inner products only through an invariant combination, the Berry phase \u03c6, and present complete analytical results for \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03c0. The optimal solution exhibits full permutational symmetry and is single valued for a large range of parameters. However, for \u03c6 = 0 it can be bivalued: beyond a critical value of the parameters a second, less symmetric solution becomes optimal. The bifurcation is analogous to a second-order symmetry-breaking phase transition. We conclude with a discussion of the unambiguous discrimination of N &gt; 3 states.",

The importance of including the CC quantum scattering calculation has been revealed by the comparison between the CC calculation and the previous coupled state (CS) calculation. The CC total cross sections for the v = 2, 4, and 6 states show collision energy-dependent behaviors different from those based on the CS calculation. Furthermore, the collision energy dependence of the total cross sections obtained in the present CC calculation only exhibits minor oscillations, indicating that the chance is slim for reactive resonances in total cross sections to survive through the partial-wave averaging. The magnitude and profile of the CC total cross sections for v = 0-2 in the collision energy range of 0.0-2.5 eV are found to be consistent with experimental cross sections obtained recently by Tang et al.

He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom\n- Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms\n\nFollowing the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \"solar system\" with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron's orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable.\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism's prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck's ideas of quantization and Einstein's finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:\n\n$$\n|\\Delta E|=\\left|E_{\\mathrm{f}}-E_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|=h \\nu=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $h$ is Planck's constant and $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:",

A similar representation can be made for the states \u03c8 \u03bd s , where, for simplicity, we omit the labels\u00f1 and \u03b6. The influence of SOC and TRS on the states on the Bloch sphere for\u00f1 = 1 and \u03b6 = +1 is illustrated in Figure 1c-f. In the simplest case, when SOC is zero and TRS is preserved (Fig. 1c), the angle of inclination \u03b8 of the spinors \u03c8 \u03bd s with respect to the vertical z-axis is equal to zero.\n\nEach of these states represents a pure state in the direction of |0\u27e9, resulting in \u03a8 being in the direction of (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9)/ \u221a 2. The degree of polarization can be defined as P = P 2\nx + P 2 y + P 2 z ,\nwhere P \u0131 represent the expectation values of |\u03a8\u27e9 [62]. Hence, in this case, P = 1, since P x = 1, and P y = P z = 0. The effect of SOC is depicted in Figure 1d. The SO-induced magnetic field B SO causes all the states \u03c8 \u03bd,\u03b6 n,s to rotate by an angle \u03b8, and the spinor \u03a8 \u03b6 n to tilt by an angle \u03b8 \u2032 with respect to the molecular axis, allowing us to interpret the impact of SOC as a relaxation of the state vector along the direction of the SO field. This rotation results in a decrease in P x and an increase in P z , causing P to be less than 1. and therefore is also reflected in \u03b8 \u2032 . In other words, breaking TRS by a change of the amplitudes in the wavefunction acts as an additional contribution to the magnitude of the SO interaction, causing the angle \u03b8 of certain states to increase (or decrease) due to this effect.\n\n\nTime Reversal Symmetry, Voltage Probes and Decoherence Effects",

Here we only consider the 40 ns continuous trajectory for which the binding domain is stable for CTPOL, since these geometric quantities would not make sense for the 40 \u00d7 1ns trajectory where the binding domain destabilizes. Figure 13 shows the distribution of most of the angles that the coordinating atoms make with Zn 2+ . Additionally, Figure 14 (a) shows the distributions of angles between the planes shown in Figure 12, and Figure 14 (b) shows the distributions of the angles between the bisectors, also defined in Figure 12. It is quite clear that opt-CTPOL reproduces the NMR distributions of angles as well or better than CTPOL. The distribution of the S4-Zn-S7 angle appears to agree particularly well with NMR, as does the angle between the bisectors.",

Equation (1) was derived taking into account the fact that in a bulk unstrained GaAs-type crystal the mean electron spin in the moment of creation, S 0 , is parallel to the exciting beam, and the degree of PL polarization is equal to the projection of S on the direction of detection: \u03c1 = Sn 1 , where n 1 is the unit vector along the direction of registration [19,28]. At \u03b1 = 0, the Hanle curve is a symmetrical function on magnetic field as, for example, one can see in Fig. 2. For \u03b1 = 0, the \u03c1(B) plot is not symmetrical with respect to the B = 0 point. The value of \u03c1 is larger for the magnetic field direction at which the electron spin precesses toward the luminescence observation axis. Note, that for measuring the g-sign it is sufficient to record the asymmetry in the dependence of the absolute value of \u03c1 on B.\n\nThe above method acquires distinctive features [27] if the heavy and light hole subbands are split due to the uniaxial deformation in a bulk crystal or due to quantumsize effect in a nanostructure.",

The method was developed by Timothy Clark and co-workers (in Computer-Chemie-Centrum, Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg) and published first in 2003. Indeed, AM1* is an extension of AM1 molecular orbital theory and uses AM1 parameters and theory unchanged for the elements H, C, N, O and F. But, other elements have been parameterized using an additional set of d-orbitals in the basis set and with two-center core\u2013core parameters, rather than the Gaussian functions used to modify the core\u2013core potential in AM1. Additionally, for transition metal-hydrogen interactions, a distance dependent term is used to calculate core-core potentials rather than the constant term. AM1* parameters are now available for H, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Zr, Mo, Pd, Ag, I and Au.

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface. Rate constants calculated with the CVBMM surface agree with the MPW54 rate constants within 12% for 534-2000 K and within 23% for 200-491 K. The full CVBMM potential-energy surface is now available for use in variety of dynamics calculations, and it provides a prototype for developing CVBMM potential-energy surfaces for other reactions.",

Effect of the Weighting Coefficients. The present calculations were carried out while varying the weighting coefficients, and Figure 1 shows the primary configurations of  the electronic states obtained for the H 2 O molecule. The calculated electronic state energies, eigenvalues, and imposed penalties are provided in Table 3. Table 4 summarizes the calculated energies and the assignments of the first, second, and third electronic states: |\u03c8(\u03b8 0 )\u27e9, |\u03c8(\u03b8 1 )\u27e9, and |\u03c8(\u03b8 2 )\u27e9 The costs of these states are summarized in Table 5. Below, we review the results with respect to each coefficient. With regard to condition (i), the core-ionized state represented by |122\u0305 \u27e9 was obtained as the ansatz state |\u03c8(\u03b8 1 )\u27e9 with \u03b2 \u2265 21.0. In contrast, the state was |\u03c8(\u03b8 2 )\u27e9 and the ground state |11\u0305 2\u27e9 was obtained as both |\u03c8(\u03b8 0 )\u27e9 and |\u03c8(\u03b8 1 )\u27e9 with \u03b2 < 21.0. In the case of \u03b2 < 21.0, |\u03c8(\u03b8 1 )\u27e9 was nonorthogonal to |\u03c8(\u03b8 0 )\u27e9 and the penalty of \u03b2 was imposed on its cost function. However, \u27e811\u0305 2|H\u0302|11\u0305 2\u27e9 + \u03b2 was still less than the cost function for the core-ionized state |122\u0305 \u27e9. Therefore, the ground state |11\u0305 2\u27e9 was obtained again as |\u03c8(\u03b8 1 )\u27e9. If |\u03c8(\u03b8 2 )\u27e9 is also |11\u0305 2\u27e9, its cost function will be \u27e811\u0305 2| H\u0302|11\u0305 2\u27e9 + 2\u03b2 because |\u03c8(\u03b8 2 )\u27e9 is nonorthogonal to both |\u03c8(\u03b8 0 )\u27e9 and |\u03c8(\u03b8 1 )\u27e9, and so the cost function will be greater than that of the core-ionized state |122\u0305 \u27e9. Thus, the core-ionized state | 122\u0305 \u27e9 was obtained as |\u03c8(\u03b8 2 )\u27e9. In the case with \u03b2 \u2265 21.0, the",

This applies for VIF pictures as one-electron Hamiltonian operators as well as VIF pictures as one-electron density operators that constitute a new implementation of the VIF method simpler in its application and more accurate in its results than previous approaches. A procedure for estimating elements of the effective charge density-bond order matrix, Pmunu, from electron configurations in atoms is presented, and it is shown how these lead to loop and line constants in the VIF picture. From these structural formulas, one finds the number of singly, doubly, and unoccupied molecular orbitals, as well as the number of molecular orbitals with energy lower, equal, and higher than -1/2Eh, the negative of the hydrogen atom's ionization energy. The VIF results for water are in qualitative agreement with MP2/6311++G3df3pd, MO energy levels where the simple VIF for water presented in the earlier literature does not agree with computed energy levels. The method presented here gives the simplest accurate VIF pictures for hydrocarbons. It is shown how VIF can be used to predict thermal barriers to chemical reactions. Insertion of singlet carbene into H2 is given as an example. VIF pictures as one-electron density operators describe the ground-state multiplicities of B2, N2, and O2 molecules and as one-electron Hamiltonian operators give the correct electronegativity trend across period two. Previous implementations of VIF do not indicate singly occupied molecular orbitals directly from the pictorial VIF rules for these examples. The direct comparison between structural formulas that represent electron density and those that represent energy is supported by comparison of a simple electronegativity scale, chiD=N/n2, with well-known electronegativity scales of Pauling, Mulliken, and Allen. This scale comes from the method used to calculate Pmumu for sp3 hybridized period-two elements and is comparable to electronegativity because it has the same form as &lt;1/r&gt; for hydrogenic orbitals. It therefore provides a physical basis for the representation of one electron density and Hamiltonian operators by the same VIF picture.",

In the present paper we calculate a new ab initio potential energy surface for the X3B1 state, and we calculate ab initio the potential energy surfaces of the a1A1 and b1B1 excited singlet electronic states (which become degenerate as a 1Delta state at linearity). We use the multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI) level of theory with molecular orbital bases that are optimized separately for each state by complete-active-space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. For the X state we use the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program to obtain the rotation-vibration energies. For the a and b excited singlet electronic states we calculate the rovibronic energy levels using the RENNER Hamiltonian and computer program. We also calculate ab initio the dipole moment surfaces for the X, a, and b electronic states, and the out-of-plane transition moment surface for the b &lt;-- a electronic transition. We use this information to simulate absorption spectra within X3B1 and a1A1 state and of the b1B1 &lt;-- a1A1 transition in order to aid in the search for them. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

In contrast, the other two states, i.e. the 2(2)A' and 1(4)A' states, are energetically not favourable to the reaction as the first state has a potential barrier of 0.2 eV in the entrance channel and the former one presents long range potential wells and repulsive wall for carbon approaches near OH. The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one. Nevertheless, a decreasing behaviour with the temperature remains between 10 and 500 K if we consider the total rate constant of C((3)P) + OH(X(2)Pi), sum of the three reactive states rate constants.",

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists. As yet, the complete set of bound vibrational energy levels is far from being known, experimentally as well as theoretically. In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)\u03a3(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128]. Theory agrees with experiment within 4.5 cm(-1) on average for the four vibrational level spacings that are so far known empirically. In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)\u03a3(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)\u03a3(u)(-) state. The ground state dissociation energy D(0) is predicted to be 23164 cm(-1).",

P. de Lara-Castells, G. Delgado-Barrio, P. Villarreal, and A. O. Mitrushchenkov, J. Chem. Phys. 125, 221101 (2006)]. Additional methodological and computational details of the implementation, which uses an iterative Jacobi-Davidson diagonalization algorithm to properly address the inherent \"hard-core\" He-He interaction problem, are described here. The convergence of total energies, average pair He-He interaction energies, and relevant one- and two-body properties upon increasing the angular part of the one-particle basis set (expanded in spherical harmonics) has been analyzed, considering Cl(2) as the dopant and a semiempirical model (T-shaped) He-Cl(2)(B) potential. Converged results are used to analyze global energetic and structural aspects as well as the configuration makeup of the wave functions, associated with the ground and low-lying \"solvent\" excited states. Our study reveals that besides the fermionic nature of (3)He atoms, key roles in determining total binding energies and wave-function structures are played by the strong repulsive core of the He-He potential as well as its very weak attractive region, the most stable arrangement somehow departing from the one of N He atoms equally spaced on equatorial \"ring\" around the dopant. The present results for N = 4 fermions indicates the structural \"pairing\" of two (3)He atoms at opposite sides on a broad \"belt\" around the dopant, executing a sort of asymmetric umbrella motion. This pairing is a compromise between maximizing the (3)He-(3)He and the He-dopant attractions, and suppressing at the same time the \"hard-core\" repulsion. Although the He-He attractive interaction is rather weak, its contribution to the total energy is found to scale as a power of three and it thus increasingly affects the pair density distributions as the cluster grows in size.",

It is shown that a recent H216O potential energy surface due to D. Xie and G. Yan (1996. Chem. Phys. Lett. 248, 409), which was determined by fits to vibrational term values alone and was claimed to be more accurate than other published spectroscopically determined potentials for this system, actually gives unacceptably poor results for rotationally excited water. Reasons for this failure are discussed and the dangers of relying on vibrational term values alone are emphasized. Previous spectroscopic potentials for ground state NO2 are all found to have problems with unphysical minima (\"holes\"). Starting from the potential energy surface for the ground (&amp;Xtilde;2A1) electronic state of NO2 constructed by S. A. Tashkun and P. Jensen (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 173) using the approximate MORBID approach a suitable starting point for fits using an exact kinetic energy operator approach was constructed. Least-squares fits to 17 potential parameters gives a potential which reproduces 173 vibrational term values with a standard deviation of only 2.8 cm-1 in the low-energy region (&lt;10 000 cm-1). For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state. We were unable to fit these levels. Tests show that the resulting effective potential surface has no problems with unphysical holes and gives a reasonable representation of the rotational structure of the low-lying vibrational states of NO2.

The results are reported in Table 3. Concerning the AuH 2 ground state, the geometry found here matches quite well the one previously calculated by Liu et al. 22 with a bond length of 1.605 \u00c5 and a bond angle of 129.2 degrees. Moreover, the ADE value is very close to the one that was determined experimentally also reported in Table 3. We mention that our theoretical estimate of ADE does not include the 0-0 vibrational correction (the difference in the ZPE of the anion AuH \u2212 2 and of AuH 2 at the respective equilibrium geometries). This contribution is relatively small an estimate at DFT level gives about 0.03 eV (see Table S7 in ESI \u2020). Concerning the excited states, even though we have no experimental reference to validate our results, we find that ADEs have only a slightly smaller values compared to the VDEs values. This is consistent with the small geometrical rearrangements of AuH 2 in these electronic states with respect to the anion. The difference between VDE and ADE (\u2206 V DE\u2212ADE ), can be considered as a stringent test for the ability of our calculations to describe the potential energy surface in a well-balanced and consistent manner. We find that the calculated \u2206 V DE\u2212ADE (0.687 eV) agrees extremely well with the experimental one (0.637 eV). The difference is 0.05 eV, which further demonstrates the consistency of the calculated APESs. All the results reported above witness the accuracy of the X2C-EOM-CCSD computational protocol in describing the features of gold dihydride's electronic states, in close agreement with the experiment. The only discrepancy that still remains concerns the first excited state, which was expected to be characterized by a slightly bent equilibrium geometry. Returning to the experimental work of Liu et al. 22 , we have to observe that the bent structure for the first excited state was drawn on the basis",

Acc. 103, 495, (2000)] combined with multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) to compute the vertical excitation energies and transition dipole moments of the low-energy singlet excitations in the polyenes with 4 \u2264 N \u2264 22\u03c0-electrons. We find that the OM2/MRCI descriptions closely resemble those of Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) \u03c0-electron models [P. Tavan and K. Schulten, Phys. Rev. B 36, 4337, (1987)], if equivalent MRCI procedures and regularly alternating model geometries are used. OM2/MRCI optimized geometries are shown to entail improved descriptions particularly for smaller polyenes (N \u2264 12), for which sizeable deviations from the regular model geometries are found. With configuration interaction active spaces covering also the \u03c3- in addition to the \u03c0-electrons, OM2/MRCI excitation energies turn out to become smaller by at most 0.35 eV for the ionic and 0.15 eV for the covalent excitations. The particle-hole (ph) symmetry, which in Pariser-Parr-Pople models arises from the zero-differential overlap approximation, is demonstrated to be only weakly broken in OM2 such that the oscillator strengths of the covalent 1B(u)(-) states, which artificially vanish in ph-symmetric models, are predicted to be very small. According to OM2/MRCI and experimental data the 1B(u)(-) state is the third excited singlet state for N &lt; 12 and becomes the second for N \u2265 14. By comparisons with results of other theoretical approaches and experimental evidence we argue that deficiencies of the particular MRCI method employed by us, which show up in a poor size consistency of the covalent excitations for N &gt; 12, are caused by its restriction to at most doubly excited references.",

Our best estimate for the adiabatic electron affinity of SiN is 3.002 eV, in very good agreement with the recent, experimentally determined value of 2.949(8) eV. However, the calculated bond length of the SiN- X 1sigma+ state at the same level, r(e) = 1.5904 angstroms, is smaller than the indirectly extracted experimental value of 1.604(5) angstroms, pointing out that the latter value is either a bit overestimated or not as accurate as the +/- 0.005 angstroms error bar indicates.

The classical barrier height (10.6+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1)) and exothermicity (3.6+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1)) for the HN(2)--&gt;N(2)+H reaction are predicted by high level ab initio quantum mechanical methods [up to CCSDT(Q)]. Total energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit applying the focal point analysis. Zero-point vibrational energies are computed using fundamental (anharmonic) frequencies obtained from a quartic force field. Relativistic and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections are also taken into account. The quantum mechanical barrier with these corrections is predicted to be 6.4+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1) and the reaction exothermicity to be 8.8+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1). The importance of these parameters for the thermal NO(x) decomposition (De-NO(x)) process is discussed. The unimolecular rate constant for dissociation of the HN(2) molecule and its lifetime are estimated by canonical transition-state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory. The lifetime of the HN(2) molecule is here estimated to be 2.8x10(-10) s at room temperature. Our result is in marginal agreement with the latest experimental kinetic modeling studies (tau=1.5x10(-8) s), albeit consistent with the very rough experimental upper limit (tau&lt;0.5 mus). For the dissociation reaction, kinetic isotope effects are investigated. Our analysis demonstrates that the DN(2) molecule has a longer lifetime than the HN(2) molecule. Thus, DN(2) might be more readily identified experimentally. The ionization potential of the HN(2) molecule is determined by analogous high level ab initio methods and focal point analysis. The adiabatic IP of HN(2) is predicted to be 8.19+/-0.05 eV, in only fair agreement with the experimental upper limit of 7.92 eV deduced from sychrothon-radiation-based photoionization mass spectrometry.",

Taking the derivative of the expression (70) and putting it to zero predicts a position of minimum for the ground state potential curve E t = \u22122.348942 Ry at R = 1.4012 a.u. while the accurate result is E t = \u22122.3489518628 Ry (rounded) at R = 1.4011 a.u., see [21]. As for the excited state 3 \u03a3 + u , the predicted minimum is E t = \u22122.0000409 Ry at R = 7.8237 a.u. while the accurate result is E t = \u22122.0000392 Ry (rounded) at R = 7.85 a.u. [22].

Finally, taking the analytic expression for potential curve for the excited state 3 \u03a3 + u (73), we confirm the non-existence of any vibrational or rotational bound state associated with this state in agreement with [32]. All that indicates the high quality of approximation of the potential curves for 1 \u03a3 + g and 3 \u03a3 + u which do not lead to any extra rovibrational bound state and do not miss any known rovibrational bound state. This feature is definitely absent in all previous attempts (known to the present authors) to build approximations of potential curves.\n\n\nConclusions",

Time-of-flight distributions of elastically/inelastically scattered H* Rydberg atoms and reactively scattered D* Rydberg atoms have been measured at different laboratory angles. The extracted rovibrationally resolved state distributions of the HD product molecules from reactive collisions resemble closely those reported for the corresponding ion-molecule reaction, H+ + D2 --&gt; HD + D+. This similarity is rationalised using the free electron model which predicts that the Rydberg electron acts as a spectator while the ionic reaction takes place.",

Solving the Schrodinger equation for excited states dominated by single excitations from the ground-state wavefunction requires the ground-state 2- and 3-RDMs. The excited states, however, can be obtained without a knowledge of the ground-state 3-RDM by two methods: (i) cumulant expansion methods which build the 3-RDM from the 2-RDM, and (ii) double commutator methods which eliminate the 3-RDM. Previous work [Mazziotti, Phys. Rev. A 68, 052501 (2003)] examined the accuracy of excited states extracted from ground-state 2-RDMs, which were calculated by full configuration interaction or the variational 2-RDM method. In this work we employ (i) advances in semidefinite programming to treat the excited states of water and hydrogen fluoride and chains of hydrogen atoms, and (ii) the addition of partial three-particle N-representability conditions to compute more accurate ground-state 2-RDMs. With the hydrogen chains we examine the metal-to-insulator transition as measured by the band gap (the difference between the ground-state and the first excited-state energies), which is difficult for excited-state methods to capture.",

The method is expected to be accurate to describe the PJTE 38,69,70 . The CI-like form of the EOM excitation operator enables access to multi-configurational open-shell wave functions, including degenerate and nearly degenerate states, as well as interacting states of different character 38 . The notorius issue of coupledcluster theory to treat conical intersections [74][75][76] between states of the same symmetry is not expected to play a role here. The numerical examples by Kohn et al. 74 showed that this problem arises only very close to the intersection (within an energy range of \u00b10.02 eV). This is clearly not the case in point here, in that the involved electronic states have different symmetry for the high symmetry nuclear configuration and their energy gap is above 0.15 eV. For sake of completeness, we mention that the problem of EOM with treating conical intersections between states of the same symmetry has recently found a solution within the framework of similarity-constrained theory 76 . The selected cut of potential energy surface has been worked out by scanning several distances between the two terminal hydrogen atoms (R H\u2212H ) and by varying the single Au-H bond lengths asymmetrically (the asymmetric displacement with respect to the centrosymmetric  Surprisingly, the results support our hypothesis: the ground state APES of gold dihydride is not centrosymmetric around its linear configuration (as demonstrated by the lower sheet in Figure 3, showing a double-well APES for the ground state), whereas the first excited state is linear and centrosymmetric. We find the minimum equilibrium structure to be at R H\u2212H = 3.3 \u00c5 with the minimum energy asymmetric displacement being \u2206R = 0.06 \u00c5. For a more quantitative perspective on the energies, we also performed calculations with larger basis sets (i.e. vtz, vqz, with n=5 and 6s electrons correlated) and by correlating more electrons (i.e. cvtz, cvqz basis, with n=4, n=5 and 6s electrons correlated) by keeping fixed the overall R H\u2212H distance at 3.3 \u00c5.

Many bands of the A 2Pi--&gt;X 2Sigma+ and B' 2Sigma+--&gt;X 2Sigma+ electronic transitions of 24MgH were analyzed; the new data span the v' = 0-3 levels of the A 2Pi and B'2Sigma+ excited states and the v''=0-11 levels of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state. The vibration-rotation energy levels of the perturbed A 2Pi and B' 2Sigma+ states were fitted as individual term values, while those of the X 2Sigma+ ground state were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach. A new analytic potential energy function that imposes the theoretically correct attractive potential at long-range, and a radial Hamiltonian that includes the spin-rotation interaction were employed, and a significantly improved value for the ground state dissociation energy of MgH was obtained. The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The equilibrium dissociation energy for the X 2Sigma+ ground state of 24MgH has been determined to be De=11104.7+/-0.5 cm(-1) (1.37681+/-0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v''=0) is 739.11+/-0.01 cm(-1). The zero-point dissociation energy is therefore D0=10365.6+/-0.5 cm(-1) (1.28517+/-0.00006 eV). The uncertainty in the new experimental dissociation energy of MgH is more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that for the best value available in the literature. MgH is now the only hydride molecule other than H2 itself for which all bound vibrational levels of the ground electronic state are observed experimentally and for which the dissociation energy is determined with subwavenumber accuracy.",

The experimental trend is qualitatively reproduced for bands B-E, although the calculated VDE values are now shifted at lower energies; nevertheless the 4c-\u2206HF method still fails in providing the correct energy order of the two lowestenergy states (bands X-A). In general, the error in the higher energy states is increased dramatically, probably because the error compensation (between the orbital relaxation and electron correlation contributions), typically expected in the KT framework, is now missing. The 4c-\u2206KS calculations show how including both orbital relaxation and electron correlation significantly improves the agreement with the experimental values. Unfortunately, the energy swap of the lower-energy states still remains and the method fails to reproduce the correct symmetry of the AuH 2 ground state. This finding suggests that a more accurate treatment of electron correlation is needed for reproducing these quantities. The results reported in Figure 1 and Table 1 show that the X2C-EOM-CCSD method works exceptionally well. First of all, the order of the electronic states found here fully supports the assignment reported in Ref. 22, where, as mentioned in the introduction, a multi-step theoretical recipe was specifically applied to include scalar relativistic effects, electronic correlation and spinorbit coupling in a balanced way. Our results unambiguously confirm that the ground state of AuH 2 at the linear centrosymmetric configuration (i.e. at the minimum energy of the anion) is the electronic state 2 \u03a3 + 1/2u (ungerade symmetry). The computed VDEs are in very good agreement with the experimental data; indeed, as it can be seen, the percent errors for calculated VDEs are in the range 2.9-0.3% (Table 1). In addition to this, it must be pointed out that the results displayed in Table 1 can be consistently improved. Indeed, as shown in Table 2, one can increase both the quality of the basis set and the number of active electrons. It is evident from the data how increasing simultaneously both of these factors can lead to an even more stringent agreement with the experimental results. For instance, when electrons of the shell with n=4 of gold are correlated and a core-valence quadruple-zeta (cvqz) quality basis set is used, the error can be further reduced (the",

For internuclear distances in the range 1.2 \u2264 R \u2264 6, our results were compared with the high-precision variational data in [38]. Also, the results obtained by Colin-Rodriguez and Crus [18] are introduced. The results presented in Table 1 clearly indicate that when R increases the role of electrons' interaction becomes less and less, particularly around the nuclei. Each nucleus has an electron and the probability for both being around the same nucleus is small, as one would expect. When R increases, the H 2 molecule tends to separate into two hydrogen atoms in their ground states; therefore, the ground-state energy decreases. A good quantitative agreement is obtained compared to the corresponding accurate values of Ref. [38]. However, one can notice that our results are lower than those computed in [18]. This is due to the fact that in the work of Colin-Rodriguez and Crus, no electronic correlation is included in the wave function. These results validate a good accuracy for the wave function to calculate the ground-state energy of confined H 2 molecule inside a hard prolate spheroidal box.",

Although the 4c-KT method has only to be considered as a first approximation it is noteworthy that, the calculated energy splitting for the C/D and B/E states (numerical values are 1.05 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively) agrees surprisingly well with the experimental values (0.96 eV and 1.59 eV). The inclusion of SO coupling has a positive impact on the results for high energy states (i.e. bands from B to E), nevetheless, the situation is different at lower energies (X and A bands). The highest level calculations from Ref. 22 showed that the band X should be related to the electronic state of the ungerade symmetry, corresponding to the 2 \u03a3 + 1/2u state. In our 4c-HF calculations, the AuH \u2212 2 HOMO is an orbital of symmetry \u03c3 1/2g , whereas the HOMO-1 has a \u03c3 1/2u symmetry, thus the application of KT gives a ground state of the incorrect symmetry ( 2 \u03a3 + 1/2g ).

Evaluation of the properties in an infinite crystal.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and precise evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Nguyen, Macchi &amp; Volkov (2020), Acta Cryst. A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

Electron detachment from SF6(-).\nDetailed statistical rate calculations combined with electron capture theory and kinetic modeling for the electron attachment to SF(6) and detachment from SF(6)(-) [Troe et al., J. Chem. Phys. 127, 244303 (2007)] are used to test thermionic electron emission models. A new method to calculate the specific detachment rate constants k(det)(E) and the electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon) as functions of the total energy E of the anion and the energy epsilon of the emitted electrons is presented, which is computationally simple but neglects fine structures in the detailed k(det)(E). Reduced electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) were found to be of the form (epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;)(n) exp(-epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) with n approximately = 0.15, whose shape corresponds to thermal distributions only to a limited extent. In contrast, the average energies &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; can be roughly estimated within thermionic emission and finite heat bath concepts. An effective temperature T(d)(E) is determined from the relation E - EA = &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; + kT(d), where &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; denotes the thermal internal energy of the detachment product SF(6) at the temperature T(d) and EA is the electron affinity of SF(6). The average electron energy is then approximately given by &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; = kT(d)(E), but dynamical details of the process are not accounted for by this approach. Simplified representations of k(det)(E) in terms of T(d)(E) from the literature are shown to lead to only semiquantitative agreement with the equally simple but more accurate calculations presented here. An effective \"isokinetic\" electron emission temperature T(e)(E) does not appear to be useful for the electron detachment system considered because it neither provides advantages over a representation of k(det)(E) as a function of T(d)(E), nor are recommended relations between T(e)(E) and T(d)(E) of sufficient accuracy.",

For this system b R = 1.10. The results for g ij and Dg = g + \u00c0 \u00c0 g \u00c0 \u00c0 are presented in Fig. 7, where they are compared to MC simulations results of Zwanikken and coworkers. 61 As seen in the figure, the MDE-DH approximation gives excellent results that nearly coincide with the MC ones. Note that the resolution of the ordinate scale in frame (d) of the figure is an order of magnitude larger than in frame (a). It is noteworthy that quite intricate details of the pair distribution functions are obtained in agreement with simulations. Our results are, in fact, slightly better than those of both the HNC approximation and Zwanikken's DHEMSA approximation, 61 which is quite remarkable considering the simplicity of the present Ansatz.\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of core-core correlations in this system, the pair distribution g hs (r) of the hard sphere fluid is plotted in Fig. 7a and it is seen that the main oscillation of g ij (r) with a wave length Ea is caused by these correlations. It is also seen in frames (a) and (b) of the figure that there is another oscillatory component with longer wave length superimposed on the main oscillation. This component is equal to the term 8bw el (r) in eqn (56), which is oscillatory here.*** It makes the g +\u00c0 and g \u00c0\u00c0 curves to repeatedly intersect with one another and has a wave length 2p/k I = 2.06a. In frames (c) and (d) this component gives the contribution Dg el (r) = 2bw el (r), which is the electrostatic part of Dg in the current approximation.

Although ab initio methods have proven capable of handling such electron transfer events when the Rydberg orbital has principal quantum number n = 3, they have proven to be incapable of handling Rydberg states having quantum number n &gt; 3, so having a new tool capable of handling n &gt; 3 Rydberg states is important. The model (i) focuses on each Rydberg orbital's large peak of high amplitude, (ii) approximates the electron density within this peak as constant within a radial shell characterized by a radius &lt;r&gt; and thickness T both of which depend on the quantum number n, and (iii) assumes that strong coupling (either with an orbital of an anion donor or to a disulfide sigma* or a backbone amide pi* orbital) occurs when the valence orbital penetrates fully within the radial shell of the Rydberg orbital. These assumptions permit a derivation of the ratios of rates of electron transfer for n &gt; 3 to those for n = 3. Combining these ratios with ab initio rates for n = 3 allows one to make rate predictions for inter- and intramolecular electron transfer involving Rydberg orbitals appropriate to the electron transfer dissociation process. One important prediction of this model is that the combination of large-penetration and Landau-Zener surface-crossing conditions places very severe limitations on which Rydberg levels can initially be populated in electron transfer dissociation. Another prediction is that a Rydberg orbital of a given principal quantum number n has a limited range of distances over which it can transfer an electron; sigma* or pi* orbitals either too far from or too close to a given Rydberg orbital cannot accept an electron from that orbital.",

Energies of interaction between pairs of charges (DeltaG(ij)) were obtained from the shifts in pK(a) values relative to wild-type values. The data describe the distance dependence and salt sensitivity of pairwise coulombic interactions. Calculations with a continuum electrostatics method captured the experimental DeltaG(ij) when static structures were used and when the protein interior was treated empirically with a dielectric constant of 20. The DeltaG(ij) when r(ij) &lt; or = 10 A were exaggerated slightly in the calculations. Coulomb's law with a dielectric constant near 80 and a Debye-H\u00fcckel term to account for screening by the ionic strength reproduced the salt sensitivity and distance dependence of DeltaG(ij) as well as the structure-based method. In their interactions with each other, surface charges behave as if immersed in water; the Debye length describes realistically the distance where interactions become negligible at a given ionic strength. On average, charges separated by distances (r(ij)) approximately 5 A interacted with DeltaG(ij) approximately 0.6 kcal/mole in 0.01 M KCl, but DeltaG(ij) decayed to &lt; or =0.10 kcal/mole when r(ij) = 20 A. In 0.10 M KCl, DeltaG(ij) approximately 0.10 kcal/mole when r(ij) = 10 A. In 1.5 M KCl, only short-range interactions with r(ij) &lt; or = 5 A persisted.

However, in reality, electrolytes have several decay modes e-\u03bar/r, e-\u03ba'r/r etc. with different decay lengths, 1/\u03ba, 1/\u03ba' etc., that in general are different from the Debye length. As an illustration of the significance of multiple decay modes in electrolytes, the present work uses a very simple extension of the Debye-H\u00fcckel approximation with two decay lengths, which predicts oscillatory modes when appropriate. This approach gives very accurate results for radial distribution functions and thermodynamic properties of aqueous solutions of monovalent electrolytes for all concentrations investigated, including high ones. It is designed to satisfy necessary statistical mechanical conditions for the distributions. The effective dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte plays an important role in the theory and each mode has its own value of this entity. Electrolytes with high electrostatic coupling, like those with multivalent ions and/or with solvent of low dielectric constant, have decay lengths in dilute solutions that substantially deviate from the Debye length. It is shown that this is caused by nonlinear ion-ion correlation effects and the origin of under-screening, i.e., 1/\u03ba &gt; 1/\u03baD, in dilute symmetric electrolytes is analyzed. The under-screening is accompanied by an increase in the effective dielectric permittivity that is also caused by these correlations. The theoretical results for the decay length are successfully compared with recent experimental data for simple electrolytes in various solvents. The paper includes background material on electrolyte theory and screening in order to be accessible for nonexperts in the field.",

The extended version of the kinetic method was used to determine the heterolytic bond dissociation energy (HBDE) of Rb-Cl. The measured value of 480.8 +/- 8.5 kJ/mol, obtained under single collision conditions, agrees with the HBDE value (482.0 +/- 8.0 kJ/mol), calculated from a thermochemical cycle. The observed effective temperature of the collisionally activated salt clusters increases with laboratory-frame collision energy under both single- and multiple-collision conditions. Remarkably, the effective temperatures under multiple collision conditions are lower than those recorded under single-collision conditions at the same collision energy, a consequence of the inability of the triatomic ions to store significant amounts of internal energy. Laboratory-frame kinetic energy to internal energy transfer (T--&gt;V) efficiencies range from 3.8 to 13.5%. For a given cluster ion, the T--&gt;V efficiency decreases with increasing collision energy.

The MC adducts were shown to be comparably stable or more stable than the corresponding trigonal bipyramidal adducts (TB) which equilibrate with the MC in some cases. To clarify the reason for the stability of the MC, the model adducts of H(2)Z(1)X(2)X (MC and TB) (Z = O, S, Se and X = Cl, Br), together with the related species (H(2)Z, X(2), H(2)ZX(+), and H(2)ZX*), were optimized with the 6-311++G(3df,2pd) basis sets at the MP2 and/or B3LYP levels. Calculations were also performed with different distances between (1)Cl and (2)Cl (r((1)Cl,(2)Cl)) in H(2)S-(1)Cl-(2)Cl (MC) and r(S,(2)Cl) in H(2)S(1)Cl(2)Cl (TB), where r = r(o) + 0.1m \u00c5 (r(o): the optimized distance and m = -1, (0), 1, 2, and 3). A charge transfer (CT) occurs from S to (2)Cl in the S-(1)Cl-(2)Cl bond of the MC as r((1)Cl,(2)Cl) becomes larger, assuming a singlet multiplicity in the calculations. The situation is equal to that of (1)Cl-S-(2)Cl in the TB, for which CT occurs from (1)Cl to (2)Cl. A 3c-4e description of the Z-(1)X-(2)X bond in R(2)Z-(1)X-(2)X (MC) is proposed based on the ab initio MO calculations by exhibiting the 10-(1)X-2 character, the N-X-L cording system for hypervalent bonds proposed by Martin, for R(2)Z-(1)X-(2)X (MC) practically. Bond orders for typical TB and MC were calculated from literature data according to Pauling's equation. The bond orders agree with the proposed 3c-4e model for the MC.",

The dielectric relaxation (DR) spectrum of each solution, which deviates slightly from the bulk-water spectrum, is mathematically divided into the bulk-water spectrum and the spectrum of solute particles covered with a water layer using a mixture theory by assuming the existence of continuous bulk-water phase. The solute spectra above 3 GHz are fitted with a linear series of pure water component (\u03b3 dispersion with DR frequency fw), fast Debye component-1 with DR frequency f1 (&gt;fw), and slow Debye component-2 with DR frequency f2 (&lt;fw). Component-2 is only found for the fluorides. The sum of dispersion amplitudes of \u03b3 and components -1 and -2 for NaX and KX are found to be almost irrespective of X and equal to the pure water level, indicating that components -1 and -2 are from the water modified by ions, thus denoted as \"hypermobile water\" and \"constrained water\" (not rigidly bound to ion), respectively. Below 3 GHz, sub-GHz dispersion component is detected and assigned as a relaxation response of counterion cloud. The resulting limiting-molar conductivities of NaX and KX are in good agreement with the literature data measured at much lower frequencies. The estimated number of hypermobile water molecules is found to increase from 9 to 31 for NaX and from 9 to 37 for KX with increasing anion size.

This model defines a librating chain that reduces in appropriate limits to the freely rotating or wormlike chains, it can accommodate local crumpling or extreme stiffness, and it is easy to simulate. A planar-quadratic (pq), analytic approximation is based on an expansion of the electrostatic energy in eigenfunctions of the quadratic form that describes the backbone energy, and on the assumption that the quadratic form not only is positive but also adequately confines the chain in an infinite phase space of dihedral angles to the physically unique part with all |phi(i)| &lt; pi. The pq approximation is available under these weak constraints, but the simulations confirm its quantitative accuracy only under the expected condition that alpha is large, that is, for very stiff chains. Stiff chains can also be simulated with small alpha and small theta and compared to an OSF approximation suitably generalized to chains with finite rather than vanishing theta, and increasing agreement with OSF is found the smaller is theta. The two approximations, one becoming exact as alpha --&gt; infinity with fixed theta, the other as theta --&gt; 0 with fixed alpha, are quantitatively similar in behavior, both giving a persistence length P = P0 + aD2 for stiff chains, where D is the Debye length. However, the coefficient apq is about twice the value of aOSF. Under other conditions the simulations show that P may or not be linear in D2 at small or moderate D, depending on the magnitudes of alpha, beta, theta, and the charge density but always becomes linear at large D. Even at a moderately low charge density, corresponding to fewer than 20% of the beads being charged, and with strong crumpling induced by large beta, increasing D dissolves blobs and recovers a linear dependence of P on D2, although a lower power of D gives an adequate fit at moderate D. For the class of models considered, it is concluded that the only universal feature is the asymptotic linearity of P in D2, regardless of flexibility or stiffness.",

The PES is a precise fit to 36173 coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations of electronic energies done using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The fit uses a polynomial basis that is invariant with respect to permutation of the five H atoms, and thus describes all 120 equivalent minima. The rms fitting error is 78.1 cm(-1) for the entire data set of energies up to 30,000 cm(-1) and a normal-mode analysis of CH(5)(+) also verifies the accuracy of the fit. Two saddle points have been located on the surface as well and compared with previous theoretical work. The PES dissociates correctly to the fragments CH(3)(+) + H(2) and the equilibrium geometry and normal-mode analyses of these fragments are also presented. Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations are done for the zero-point energies of CH(5)(+) (and some isotopologs) as well as for the separated fragments of CH(5)(+), CH(3)(+) + H(2) and those of CH(4)D(+), CH(3)(+) + HD and CH(2)D(+) + H(2). Values of D(0) are reported for these dissociations. A molecular dynamics calculation of CH(4)D(+) dissociation at one total energy is also performed to both validate the applicability of the PES for dynamics studies as well as to test a simple classical statistical prediction of the branching ratio of the dissociation products.",

This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus. Thus, for hydrogen in the ground state $n=1$, the ionization energy would be:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E=E_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}-E_{1}=0+k=k\n$$\n\nWith three extremely puzzling paradoxes now solved (blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the hydrogen atom), and all involving Planck's constant in a fundamental manner, it became clear to most physicists at that time that the classical theories that worked so well in the macroscopic world were fundamentally flawed and could not be extended down into the microscopic domain of atoms and molecules. Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

The values of the ionisation and dissociation energies obtained for H2, and for HD and D2 in similar measurements, are in agreement with the results of the latest ab initio calculations [Piszczatowski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2009, 5, 3039; Pachucki and Komasa, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 9188] within the combined uncertainty limit of 30 MHz (0.001 cm(-1)). We report on a new determination of the electron binding energies of H2 Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers in the range n = 51-64 with a precision of better than 100 kHz using a combination of millimetre-wave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The positions of 33 np (S = 0) Rydberg states of ortho-H2 relative to the position of the reference 51d (N+ = 1, N = 1, G+ = 1/2, G = 1, F = 0) Rydberg state have been determined with a precision and accuracy of 50 kHz. By analysing these positions using MQDT, the electron binding energy of the reference state could be determined to be 42.3009108(14) cm(-1), which represents an improvement by a factor of -7 over the previous value obtained by Osterwalder et al [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 11810]. Because the electron binding energy of the high-n Rydberg states will ultimately be the limiting factor in our method of determining the ionisation and dissociation energies of molecular hydrogen, this result opens up the possibility of carrying out a new determination of these quantities. By evaluating several schemes for the new measurement, the precision limit is estimated to be 50-100 kHz, approaching the fundamental limit for theoretical values of -10 kHz imposed by the current uncertainty of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.",

Acta Cryst. A34, 909-921]. They are based on the expansion of |r' - r|(-1) in spherical harmonics and the incomplete gamma function for a Slater-type function of the form R(l)(r) = r(n) exp(-alpha ). The formulae are valid for 0 &lt; or = r &lt; or = infinity and are easily extended to higher values of l. Special treatment of integrals is needed only for functions with n = l and n = l + 1 at r = 0. The method is tested using theoretical pseudoatom parameters of the formamide molecule obtained via reciprocal-space fitting of PBE/6-31G** densities and experimental X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5). The ESP, EF and EFG values at the nuclear positions in formamide are in very good agreement with those directly evaluated from density-functional PBE calculations with 6-31G**, aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The small observed discrepancies are attributed to the different behavior of Gaussian- and Slater-type functions near the nuclei and to imperfections of the reciprocal-space fit. An EF map is displayed which allows useful visualization of the lattice EF effects in the crystal structure of formamide. Analysis of experimental 100 K X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5) yields the value of the nuclear quadrupole moment Q((57)Fe(m)) = 0.12 x 10(-28) m(2) after taking into account Sternheimer shielding/antishielding effects of the core. This value is in excellent agreement with that reported by Su &amp; Coppens [Acta Cryst. (1996), A52, 748-756] but slightly smaller than the generally accepted value of 0.16 +/- 5% x 10(-28) m(2) obtained from combined theoretical/spectroscopic studies [Dufek, Blaha &amp; Schwarz (1995).

Derived branching ratios (BR) and relative partial photoionization cross sections (RPPICS) are interpreted in the context of a bonding model calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Agreement between calculated and observed ionization energies (IE) is excellent. The 5d character of the orbitals correlates with the 5p --&gt; 5d resonances of the associated RPPICS; these resonances commence around 47 eV. Bands with 5d character also show a RPPICS maximum at 35 eV. The RPPICS associated with the totally symmetric 4a(1) orbital, which has s-like character, shows an additional shape resonance with an onset of 43 eV. The PE spectrum of the inner valence and core region measured with photon energies of 108 and 210 eV shows ionization associated with C 2s, O 2s, and Re 4f and 5p electrons. Absorption spectra measured in the region of the O1s edge showed structure assignable to excitation to the low lying empty \"d\" orbitals of this d(0) molecule. The separation of the absorption bands corresponded with the calculated orbital splitting and their intensity with the calculated O 2p character. Broad bands associated with Re 4d absorption were assigned to (2)D(5/2) and (2)D(3/2) hole states. Structure was observed associated with the C1s edge but instrumental factors prevented firm assignment. At the Re 5p edge, structure was observed on the (2)P(3/2) absorption band resulting from excitation to the empty \"d\" levels. The intensity ratios differed from that of the O 1s edge structure but were in good agreement with the calculated 5d character of these orbitals. An absorption was observed at 45 eV, which, in the light of the resonance in the 4a(1) RPPICS, is assigned to a 4a(1) --&gt; ne, na(2) transition.

Spectra are reported at mass-to-charge ratios of 14(N(+)), 15(NH(+)), 29(N(2)H(+)), 42(N(3)(+)), and 43(HN(3)(+)) in the region of each ionization threshold. The thresholds observed here are all lower than the previously reported ones obtained with electron impact ionization, which were the only ones available in the literature prior to this work. The appearance energies can be used to evaluate four key thermochemical quantities of relevance to HN(3): D(0)(H-N(3)), D(0)(N-N(2)), D(0)(N-H), and IE(NH). We observe the appearance energy of the parent ion (HN(3)(+)) to be 10.56 +/- 0.02 eV, somewhat below the reported ionization energies derived from photoelectron spectroscopy. Great care was taken to evaluate the importance of vibrational hot bands to the photoionization yield spectra. This experiment also provides a lower limit to the proton affinity of N(2) allowing us to bracket this quantity with improved certainty: 119.3 kcal/mol &lt;/= PA(N(2)) &lt;/= 121.4 kcal/mol. We also derive an upper limit to the ionization energy of N(2)H (IE(N(2)H) &lt;/= 7.92 eV), a molecule that has yet to be observed. We hope that knowledge of this ionization energy might help in future attempts to detect this interesting radical. We also take this opportunity to review the status of the thermodynamics of many molecules and ions containing N and H within the context of these new results and make new recommendations. In particular, we recommend a new value for Delta(f)H degrees (0)(HN(3)), nearly 5 kcal/mol larger than prior evaluations.",

In principle, the subspace P has an infinite number of dimensions as there are an infinite number of configurations into which the valence electrons can arrange themselves. Electrons are excited from an appropriate set of valence-electron leading configurations. In order to make the numerical CI treatment of P computationally possible, it is necessary to constrain the number of valence electron configurations and hence CSFs which are included in CI. In our calculations, we limit the configurations to those created by one and two-electron excitations from the leading valence configurations 5d 3 6s 2 , 5d 4 6s, 5d 5 , 5d 3 6s6p and 5d 2 6s 2 6p. We have omitted additional leading configurations such as 5d 3 6p 2 as they had little effect on the resulting energy levels but increased the time taken for the CI calculation significantly. Furthermore we truncate the single-particle basis set. In tantalum, the largest basis set we could use for a standard CI+MBPT calculation was 13spdf . That is, we allow a valence basis with orbitals 6 -13s, 6 -13p, 5 -13d, and 5 -13f (note that the higher energy waves are not spectroscopic since the B splines only extend spatially to 45 Bohr radii). The number of CSFs corresponding to these configurations for a J = 5/2, odd-parity calculation is N = 244752. The Hamiltonian is symmetric, so storing this matrix in memory at double precision requires 240 GB. We solve for the lowest eigenstates using the Davidson method [24] implemented by [25].",

Basis functions were optimized to minimize the energy of the exact CI calculation. A calculation excluding d-type functions is included for comparison. Results are reported in Table 1 for the equilibrium internuclear distance and Fig. 1 shows a graph of the total energy vs R for the SCF and CI solutions and the current method. For both basis sets, 90% of the correlation energy is recovered. Fig. 1 shows the correct behavior on dissociation to atoms both for the CI and the proposed method, in contrast to the restricted SCF solution which dissociates incorrectly. For H2, where the only uncertainty is the validity of a summation over independent excitation contributions, we consider the accuracy satisfactory.\n\nCO Two basis sets for CO are considered: a double -zeta basis and a triple-zeta plus d orbital basis. Results are reported in Table 1. The CI calculation for the small basis accounts for only about 2/3 of the correlation energy compared to the value for the larger basis. The table shows that the present method over estimates the CI correlation energy for this small basis. For the larger basis, the new method gives 78% of the correlation energy compared to the multireference CI calculation using the same basis. A renormalization calculation is included in the table. In this calculation, the density matrix ij w is set zero if a d-type function is involved and the remaining ij w for the s, p basis are renomalized by a common factor to conserve the total charge. The correlation energy recovered increases slightly to 80%. The renormalization calculation reveals what turns out to be a general issue. If d-type functions are added to the basis or if the original basis is uncontracted, the correlation energy from the present method deteriorates. Renormalization helps, but, for an extensively uncontracted basis, the method must be applied to groups of basis functions that resemble physical atomic orbitals. This is handled in the present work by including intact Hartree-Fock atomic orbitals in the basis.",

This involves passing cathode rays through a uniform electric field (E), measuring the radius (r) of the circular path they take, and then using a uniform magnetic field (B) at right angles to annul the deflection of the beam. Under the first conditions, the electric force on each electron (Eq) is equal to the particle's rate of change of momentum (mv 2 /r); under the second, the electric force is balanced by the magnetic force (Bvq). The second relation gives\nv \u00bc E =B\u00f03\u00de\nFrom this and the first relation\nm=q \u00bc B 2 r=E\u00f04\u00de\nExperiments with cathode rays of low energy give m/q = -5.69 9 10 -9 g C -1 . Combining this with the charge on an electron (q = -1.602 9 10 -19 C) gives m = 9.11 9 10 -28 g. However, when experiments like this are repeated with cathode rays of high energy, the values of m are found to increase with speed (calculated from Eq. 3). This was investigated by Kaufmann (1901) before Einstein put forward his theory of relativity (see Miller 1997). His results, along with some of those obtained later by Bucherer (1909), are plotted in Fig. 1 (Shankland 1960: Chap. 2, Sect. 4). These show that m rises increasingly rapidly with v, and apparently approaches a limit equal to the speed of light (c = 2.998 9 10 8 m s -1 ). The limits (m = m 0 at v = 0, m = ? at v = c) suggest changing the variables to a = m/m 0 and b = v/c. The variable a then varies from one to infinity as b varies from zero to one.",

First, the quantum is within the same order of magnitude as the essential bond strengths within water associated with proton movements and with the hydrogen bond which determines the majority of aqueous properties.

The relaxation in the above system is identical to that in D=1 wells when C=0 (since it is then a D=1 system) and C=1. However, for 0&lt;C&lt;1 and for C&gt;&gt;1, the frequencies associated with well dynamics are strongly affected and hence the power spectra are altered as a function of C.

The simplest problem involves quantum particles localized within the 'groove', a quasi-1D region created by two adjacent, identical and parallel nanotubes. At low temperature (T), the transverse motion of the adsorbed gas, in the plane perpendicular to the axes of the tubes, is frozen out. Then, the low T heat capacity C(T) of N particles is that of a 1D classical gas: C(*)(T) = C(T)/(Nk(B)) --&gt; 1/2. The dimensionless heat capacity C(*) increases when T \u2265 0.1T(x, y) (transverse excitation temperatures), asymptoting at C(*) = 2.5. The second problem involves a gas localized between two nearly parallel, co-planar nanotubes, with small divergence half-angle \u03b3. In this case, too, the transverse motion does not contribute to C(T) at low T, leaving a problem of a gas of particles in a 1D harmonic potential (along the z axis, midway between the tubes). Setting \u03c9(z) as the angular frequency of this motion, for T \u2265 \u03c4(z) \u2261 \u03c9(z)\u0127/k(B), the behavior approaches that of a 2D classical gas, C(*) = 1; one might have expected instead C(*) = 1/2, as in the groove problem, since the limit \u03b3 \u2261 0 is 1D. For T &lt;&lt; \u03c4(z), the thermal behavior is exponentially activated, C(*) \u223c (\u03c4(z)/T)(2)e(-\u03c4(z)/T). At higher T (T \u2248 \u03b5(y)/k(B) \u2261 \u03c4(y) &gt;&gt; \u03c4(z)), motion is excited in the y direction, perpendicular to the plane of nanotubes, resulting in thermal behavior (C(*) = 7/4) corresponding to a gas in 7/2 dimensions, while at very high T (T &gt; \u0127\u03c9(x)/k(B) \u2261 \u03c4(x) &gt;&gt; \u03c4(y)), the behavior becomes that of a D = 11/2 system.

The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study. This difference can be attributed to a better value for the calculated energy release from the initial transition state and to an improved Sub(C) --&gt; ET barrier height with the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods.",

For that, we have evaluated the C + OH rate constant using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method, the adiabatic capture centrifugal sudden approximation (ACCSA), and the mean potential capture theory (MPCT) based on a full ab initio potential energy surface fitted with q12,5 kernels or on a perturbative multipolar expansion (MPE) potential including the monomer spin orbit splittings (MPE-SO) or not. Despite the various approximations involved in the different methods and PESs, an excellent agreement is obtained in a subset of three models: the ACCSA method with PME-SO or ab initio PESs and the QCT method with the latter PES. This suggests that the reaction takes place once the system enters the deep valley of products. In that case, the errors due to these approximate methods and PESs are small and, consequently, the rate constants are accurately calculated. Furthermore, these findings provide evidence of preponderance of the entrance channel in the reactivity of this system.",

For example, a 1s electron in a hydrogen atom is in a stationary state, but if the hydrogen atom reacts with another atom, then the electron will of course be disturbed. Spontaneous decay",

The X(1)\u03a3(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 \u00c5), whereas the A(1)\u03a0 state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 \u00c5). The X(1)\u03a3(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;\u03bc&gt;(\u03c5), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)\u03a0. For the level (X(1)\u03a3(+)), &lt;\u03bc&gt;(0) = 0.213 D. The \u03c5(\") = 7 and 8 X(1)\u03a3(+) vibrational levels are found to have the highest probability to be reached via emission from the lowest lying vibrational levels of A(1)\u03a0. The work had a dual outcome: First, it explored consequences of different choices of the state-specific reference \"Fermi-sea\" space (\"active\" space), which is required for the construction and execution of the multiconfigurational \"complete active space self-consistent field\" calculations and the subsequent multi-reference CI calculations. In this context, comparisons with results on the weakly bound ground states of the homonuclear Be(2) and Mg(2) molecules were made. Second, it produced reliable data for the short- as well as the long-range parts of the potential energy curve (PEC). Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)\u03a3(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 \u00b1 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 \u00b1 500 a.u., respectively. The result for C(6) is in excellent agreement with that of Derevianko et al. [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 96, 323 (2010)], (364 \u00b1 4 a.u.), that was obtained in the framework of the theory of long-range interactions and many-body calculations on the constituent atoms. On the other hand, our result for C(8) differs from that of Standard and Certain [J. Chem. Phys. 83, 3002 (1985)] by about 7000 a.u.",

It is not in the general interest, except its M=1 subcase, the H-like atom. The latter is a basic problem in quantum mechanics. Solving it for \uf059 via Eq.2.1.1 is fully described in university textbooks; however, it is interesting with respect to solving it for \uf072 from the nonlinear equation Eq.2.1.23.

The single-particle function bases are usually optimized for a single wavefunction. Here, an approach is studied which utilizes a common single-particle function basis to represent several wavefunctions simultaneously, i.e., the single-particle function basis is constructed to result in an optimized averaged description of a number of wavefunctions. The approach can favorably be used to obtain eigenstates of Hamiltonians or to represent thermal ensembles. Test calculations studying the vibrational states of CH(3) and the thermal rate constant of the H+CH(4)--&gt;H(2)+CH(3) reaction are presented. It is found that the required size of the single-particle functions basis does not increase when the number of wavefunctions described simultaneously is increased. As a consequence, the new approach offers an increased efficiency, e.g., for MCTDH rate constant calculations.",

Four distinct ESTs-continuous canonical, discrete canonical, continuous microcanonical, and discrete microcanonical-are accordingly derived for two-level paramagnetic spin lattices (PSLs) in external magnetic fields. At large N, the four ESTs are intensive, equal to T<subc</sub<supconv</sup, and obey all four laws of thermodynamics. In contrast, for N &lt; 1000, the ESTs of most PSL eigenstates are non-intensive, differ from T<subc</sub<supconv</sup, and violate each of the thermodynamic laws. Hence, in spite of their similarities to T<subc</sub<supconv</sup at large N, the ESTs are not true thermodynamic temperatures. Even so, each of the ESTs manifests a unique functional dependence on energy which clearly specifies the magnitude and direction of their deviation from T<subc</sub<supconv</sup; the ESTs are thus good temperature estimators for small PSLs. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation is obeyed only by the ESTs of small canonical PSLs; it is violated by large canonical PSLs and by microcanonical PSLs of any size. The ESTs of population-inverted eigenstates are negative (positive) when calculated using Boltzmann (Gibbs) entropies; the thermodynamic implications of these entropically induced differences in sign are discussed in light of adiabatic invariance of the entropies. Potential applications of the four ESTs to nanothermometers and to systems with long-range interactions are discussed.",

In contrast, the other two states, i.e. the 2(2)A' and 1(4)A' states, are energetically not favourable to the reaction as the first state has a potential barrier of 0.2 eV in the entrance channel and the former one presents long range potential wells and repulsive wall for carbon approaches near OH. The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one. Nevertheless, a decreasing behaviour with the temperature remains between 10 and 500 K if we consider the total rate constant of C((3)P) + OH(X(2)Pi), sum of the three reactive states rate constants.",

This accounts for the physical mechanism of dissipation in the wells and allows an incoherent rate constant to be defined in a one-dimensional system which would otherwise display coherent dynamics. The substitution is equivalent to truncating the integral of the correlation function to the range t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/\u03c9, \u03c0/\u03c9]. For simplicity, quantummechanical results were computed only for biases at which the reactant and product vibrational states matched exactly, for which the sinc function takes a value of (h\u03c9) \u22121 , whereas it is 0 for any channel which does not exactly conserve energy.\n\nThe quantum-mechanical calculations required a relatively large number of bridge states to converge because the overlap terms oscillate as functions of the bridge level, as shown in figure 5. The small magnitude of the values also makes computing the sum numerically challenging. For this particular model system, standard double-precision floating-point numbers were found to be adequate, but the nature of the sum means that one may require higher precision arithmetic in some cases.",

Sen, R. S. Sinkovits and S. Chakravarti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 4855 (1996); R. S. Sinkovits, S. Sen, J. C. Phillips, and S. Chakravarti, Phys. Rev. E 59, 6497 (1999)]. In the present work, we report a study of relaxation of a particle in symmetric and asymmetric quartic anharmonic potential wells of the form V(x,y)=1 / 2 (x(2)+Cy2)+1 / 4 (x(2)+Cy2)(2) in D=2. The relaxation in the above system is identical to that in D=1 wells when C=0 (since it is then a D=1 system) and C=1. However, for 0&lt;C&lt;1 and for C&gt;&gt;1, the frequencies associated with well dynamics are strongly affected and hence the power spectra are altered as a function of C. Our calculations suggest that the exponents of the long-time tails associated with the relaxation processes are insensitive to D. In closing, we comment on the consequences of our analysis for the study of slow dynamics in interacting many-particle systems that are connected by harmonic springs with the individual particles in anharmonic potential wells.",

The swapping of particles contributes to the higher orders of the cumulants, and swapping positions allows particles to diffuse without destroying the positional order while the normal diffusion destroys it.",

Second, a nonperturbative analytic solution for the on-shell GW;{(0)} self-energy as a function of momentum is presented.

The simplest problem involves quantum particles localized within the 'groove', a quasi-1D region created by two adjacent, identical and parallel nanotubes. At low temperature (T), the transverse motion of the adsorbed gas, in the plane perpendicular to the axes of the tubes, is frozen out. Then, the low T heat capacity C(T) of N particles is that of a 1D classical gas: C(*)(T) = C(T)/(Nk(B)) --&gt; 1/2. The dimensionless heat capacity C(*) increases when T \u2265 0.1T(x, y) (transverse excitation temperatures), asymptoting at C(*) = 2.5. The second problem involves a gas localized between two nearly parallel, co-planar nanotubes, with small divergence half-angle \u03b3. In this case, too, the transverse motion does not contribute to C(T) at low T, leaving a problem of a gas of particles in a 1D harmonic potential (along the z axis, midway between the tubes). Setting \u03c9(z) as the angular frequency of this motion, for T \u2265 \u03c4(z) \u2261 \u03c9(z)\u0127/k(B), the behavior approaches that of a 2D classical gas, C(*) = 1; one might have expected instead C(*) = 1/2, as in the groove problem, since the limit \u03b3 \u2261 0 is 1D. For T &lt;&lt; \u03c4(z), the thermal behavior is exponentially activated, C(*) \u223c (\u03c4(z)/T)(2)e(-\u03c4(z)/T). At higher T (T \u2248 \u03b5(y)/k(B) \u2261 \u03c4(y) &gt;&gt; \u03c4(z)), motion is excited in the y direction, perpendicular to the plane of nanotubes, resulting in thermal behavior (C(*) = 7/4) corresponding to a gas in 7/2 dimensions, while at very high T (T &gt; \u0127\u03c9(x)/k(B) \u2261 \u03c4(x) &gt;&gt; \u03c4(y)), the behavior becomes that of a D = 11/2 system.

The branching ratio for CH2O*- + CH3Cl on improved potential energy surfaces.\nThe reaction of formaldehyde radical anion with methyl chloride, CH2O*- + CH3Cl, is an example in which a single transition state leads to two products: substitution at carbon (Sub(C), CH3CH2O* + Cl-) and electron transfer (ET, CH2O + CH3* + Cl-). The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study. This difference can be attributed to a better value for the calculated energy release from the initial transition state and to an improved Sub(C) --&gt; ET barrier height with the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods.",

For that, we have evaluated the C + OH rate constant using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method, the adiabatic capture centrifugal sudden approximation (ACCSA), and the mean potential capture theory (MPCT) based on a full ab initio potential energy surface fitted with q12,5 kernels or on a perturbative multipolar expansion (MPE) potential including the monomer spin orbit splittings (MPE-SO) or not. Despite the various approximations involved in the different methods and PESs, an excellent agreement is obtained in a subset of three models: the ACCSA method with PME-SO or ab initio PESs and the QCT method with the latter PES. This suggests that the reaction takes place once the system enters the deep valley of products. In that case, the errors due to these approximate methods and PESs are small and, consequently, the rate constants are accurately calculated. Furthermore, these findings provide evidence of preponderance of the entrance channel in the reactivity of this system.",

The work had a dual outcome: First, it explored consequences of different choices of the state-specific reference \"Fermi-sea\" space (\"active\" space), which is required for the construction and execution of the multiconfigurational \"complete active space self-consistent field\" calculations and the subsequent multi-reference CI calculations. In this context, comparisons with results on the weakly bound ground states of the homonuclear Be(2) and Mg(2) molecules were made. Second, it produced reliable data for the short- as well as the long-range parts of the potential energy curve (PEC). Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)\u03a3(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 \u00b1 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 \u00b1 500 a.u., respectively. The result for C(6) is in excellent agreement with that of Derevianko et al. [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 96, 323 (2010)], (364 \u00b1 4 a.u.), that was obtained in the framework of the theory of long-range interactions and many-body calculations on the constituent atoms. On the other hand, our result for C(8) differs from that of Standard and Certain [J. Chem. Phys. 83, 3002 (1985)] by about 7000 a.u.",

A particularly important example is the position basis, which is the basis consisting of eigenstates with eigenvalues of the observable which corresponds to measuring position.

These equations have even been (approximately) extended to larger systems. However, this problem has been treated in the context of the (integral form) of the HK theorems. Below, the aforementioned differential forms are considered with their connection to the integral forms, which -the author thinksis worth to archive in detail. Consider the case N=1, M\uf0b31, Z A \uf0b31 for ground and excited states. This is where one single electron is in the quantum force field of a nuclear frame. It is not in the general interest, except its M=1 subcase, the H-like atom. The latter is a basic problem in quantum mechanics. Solving it for \uf059 via Eq.2.1.1 is fully described in university textbooks; however, it is interesting with respect to solving it for \uf072 from the nonlinear equation Eq.2.1.23. From Eq.2.1.1 with \uf059= \uf061 1 f(r 1 ), multiplying by \uf059 from the left, integrating for spin coordinate and considering f as real function (\uf072(r 1 )= f 2 (r 1 )), Eq.2.1.23 takes the particular form in this case as D[N=1,\uf072(r 1 )] \uf0ba -(1/4)\uf0d1 1 2 \uf072(r 1 ) + (1/8)\uf072(r 1 ) -1 |\uf0d1 1 \uf072(r 1 )| 2 +\uf072(r 1 )v(r 1 ) = E electr \uf072(r 1 ) (Eq.2.1.31) where the first two terms containing the nabla operator are an evaluation of the kinetic part D \uf0d1 [N=1,\uf020\uf072(r 1 )] = -(1/2)f\uf0d1 1 2 f = -(1/2)\uf072 1/2 \uf0d1 1 2 \uf072",

The single-particle function bases are usually optimized for a single wavefunction. Here, an approach is studied which utilizes a common single-particle function basis to represent several wavefunctions simultaneously, i.e., the single-particle function basis is constructed to result in an optimized averaged description of a number of wavefunctions. The approach can favorably be used to obtain eigenstates of Hamiltonians or to represent thermal ensembles. Test calculations studying the vibrational states of CH(3) and the thermal rate constant of the H+CH(4)--&gt;H(2)+CH(3) reaction are presented. It is found that the required size of the single-particle functions basis does not increase when the number of wavefunctions described simultaneously is increased. As a consequence, the new approach offers an increased efficiency, e.g., for MCTDH rate constant calculations.",

Four distinct ESTs-continuous canonical, discrete canonical, continuous microcanonical, and discrete microcanonical-are accordingly derived for two-level paramagnetic spin lattices (PSLs) in external magnetic fields. At large N, the four ESTs are intensive, equal to T<subc</sub<supconv</sup, and obey all four laws of thermodynamics. In contrast, for N &lt; 1000, the ESTs of most PSL eigenstates are non-intensive, differ from T<subc</sub<supconv</sup, and violate each of the thermodynamic laws. Hence, in spite of their similarities to T<subc</sub<supconv</sup at large N, the ESTs are not true thermodynamic temperatures. Even so, each of the ESTs manifests a unique functional dependence on energy which clearly specifies the magnitude and direction of their deviation from T<subc</sub<supconv</sup; the ESTs are thus good temperature estimators for small PSLs. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation is obeyed only by the ESTs of small canonical PSLs; it is violated by large canonical PSLs and by microcanonical PSLs of any size. The ESTs of population-inverted eigenstates are negative (positive) when calculated using Boltzmann (Gibbs) entropies; the thermodynamic implications of these entropically induced differences in sign are discussed in light of adiabatic invariance of the entropies. Potential applications of the four ESTs to nanothermometers and to systems with long-range interactions are discussed.",

In contrast, the other two states, i.e. the 2(2)A' and 1(4)A' states, are energetically not favourable to the reaction as the first state has a potential barrier of 0.2 eV in the entrance channel and the former one presents long range potential wells and repulsive wall for carbon approaches near OH. The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one. Nevertheless, a decreasing behaviour with the temperature remains between 10 and 500 K if we consider the total rate constant of C((3)P) + OH(X(2)Pi), sum of the three reactive states rate constants.",

This accounts for the physical mechanism of dissipation in the wells and allows an incoherent rate constant to be defined in a one-dimensional system which would otherwise display coherent dynamics. The substitution is equivalent to truncating the integral of the correlation function to the range t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/\u03c9, \u03c0/\u03c9]. For simplicity, quantummechanical results were computed only for biases at which the reactant and product vibrational states matched exactly, for which the sinc function takes a value of (h\u03c9) \u22121 , whereas it is 0 for any channel which does not exactly conserve energy.\n\nThe quantum-mechanical calculations required a relatively large number of bridge states to converge because the overlap terms oscillate as functions of the bridge level, as shown in figure 5. The small magnitude of the values also makes computing the sum numerically challenging. For this particular model system, standard double-precision floating-point numbers were found to be adequate, but the nature of the sum means that one may require higher precision arithmetic in some cases.",

The ab initio calculations were carried out for 4644 geometries and the resulting energies were fitted to a many-body expansion. Accurate three-dimensional quantum mechanical scattering calculations have been performed for the C(1D) + H2(v = 0, j = 0) reaction on this ab initio 1 1A\" PES in the collision energy range [0-11.5 kcal mol(-1)].

R-branch (J + 1 &lt;-- J) transitions for J = 0, 1 and Q-branch rotational transitions for the v5 = 1 vibrational state have been measured by waveguide Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy in the range 8-26.5 GHz. The Q-branch transitions include 28 direct l-type doubling transitions (kl = +1, A1) &lt;--&gt; (kl = +1, A2) with J &lt; or = 62, and 108 direct l-type resonance transitions following the selection rule delta k = delta l = +/-2 with J &lt; or = 60 and G = |k - l| &lt; or = 3. A process called \"regional resonance\" was observed in which a cluster of levels interacted strongly over a large range in J. This process led to the observation of 55 perturbation-allowed transitions following the selection rules delta(k - l) = +/-3, +/-6. In particular, (kl = +1, A+) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -2, A-), (kl = +4, A+) &lt;--&gt; (kl = +1, A-), (kl = +2) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -1), (kl = +3) &lt;--&gt; (kl = 0), (kl = +2) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -3), and (kl = +3) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -3). The various aspects of the regional resonances are discussed in detail. An accidental near-degeneracy of the kl = 0 and kl = -4 levels at J = 26/27 led to the observation of perturbation-allowed transitions following the selection rule delta(k-l) = +/-6 with (kl = +2) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -4). A corresponding near-degeneracy between kl = -1 and kl = -3 levels at J = 30/31 led to the detection of similar transitions, but with (kl = +3) &lt;--&gt; (kl = -3). In the range 230-480 GHz, R-branch rotational transitions have been measured by absorption spectroscopy up to J = 49 in the ground-state and up to J = 50 in the v5 = 1 vibrational state. The transition frequencies have been analyzed using various reduced forms of the effective Hamiltonians. The data for the v5 = 1 vibrational state have been fitted successfully using two models up to seventh order with delta k = +/-3 interaction parameters constrained (dt constrained to zero, and epsilon to zero or to the ground-state value). On the other hand, reductions with the (delta k = +/-1, deltal = -/+2) interaction parameter q12 fixed to zero failed to reproduce the experimental data since the parameters defining the reduction transformation do not arise in the correct order of magnitude. The ground-state data have been analyzed including parameters up to fourth order constraining either parameters of the delta k = +/-3 interactions to zero (reduction A), or of the delta k = +/-6 interactions to zero (reduction B). The unitary equivalence of the different parameter sets obtained is demonstrated for both vibrational states.",

With a near pure case (b) coupling model for the upper triplet state, we have assigned a significant portion of the spectrum, mainly the F1 (J = N + 1) and F2 (J = N) spin components, primarily in the lower frequency region of the band. The lines corresponding to the F3 (J = N - 1) component are weak at lower frequencies and heavily congested in the central and higher frequency regions of the spectrum. Perturbations and predissociation phenomena have reduced the effective lifetime of the metastable 3A2 state and have also limited the number of transitions included in the least-squares fit of the band. Approximately 100 lines have been assigned in the range from 9100-9550 cm-1. Three rotational, three centrifugal distortion, three spin-rotation, and one spin-spin constant were varied.

These highly precise measurements cover the transitions from J = 2 &lt;-- 1 to J = 6 &lt;-- 5 with frequencies ranging from 220 to 661 GHz. For each of the five observed rotational transitions, the narrow linewidths of the saturation dips (about 20 kHz) permitted the resolution of the hyperfine splitting for the first time. This splitting is caused by the (13)C-nuclear spin-rotation interaction yielding a value for the nuclear spin-rotation coupling constant of C(I)((13)C(16)O). If combined with the beam measurements (C(I)((13)C(16)O) = 32.63(10) kHz), a slight J-dependence of the spin-rotation coupling constant can be determined (C(J) = 30 +/- 13 Hz). In addition, we have measured in the Doppler-limited mode several higher J rotational line positions of (13)C(16)O up to 991 GHz with an accuracy of 5 kHz.

The latter measurements include 91 transition frequencies for (28)Si(32)S, (28)Si(33)S, (28)Si(34)S, (29)Si(32)S and (30)Si(32)S in upsilon = 0, as well as 5 lines for (28)Si(32)S in upsilon = 1, with rotational quantum numbers J''&lt; or = 52. The centimetre-wave measurements include more than 300 newly recorded lines. Together with previous data they result in almost 600 transitions (J'' = 0 and 1) from all twelve possible isotopic species, including (29)Si(36)S and (30)Si(36)S, which have fractional abundances of about 7 x 10(-6) and 4.5 x 10(-6), respectively. Rotational transitions were observed from upsilon = 0 for the least abundant isotopic species to as high as upsilon = 51 for the main species. Owing to the high spectral resolution of the FTMW spectrometer, hyperfine structure from the nuclear electric quadrupole moment of (33)S was resolved for species containing this isotope, as was much smaller nuclear spin-rotation splitting for isotopic species involving (29)Si. By combining the measurements here with previously published microwave and infrared data in one global fit, an improved set of spectroscopic parameters for SiS has been derived which include several terms describing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. With this parameter set, highly accurate rotational frequencies for this important astronomical molecule can now be predicted well into the terahertz region.",

The energetically rich HNC products were probed by time-resolved infrared laser absorption spectroscopy. This allowed for the spectroscopic analysis of 16 vibrational bands in the wavelength region 2.6 to 3.1 &amp;mgr;m and the identification of 8 new bands for HNC. The dependence of Gv, Bv, and Dv was fit to appropriate polynomials in the vibrational quantum numbers and l. No bands were identified in which the bend, nu2, and CN stretch, nu3, were simultaneously excited so that the spectroscopic constants depending on the interaction between these two vibrations could not be experimentally measured. Nevertheless, the observations of this work allow for an almost complete experimental determination of the quadratic spectroscopic constants of this simple but important molecule.

We combine the high resolution absorption spectra in the 7070-7300 cm(-1) frequency range obtained in liquid nitrogen cooled cryogenic cell (T = 81 K) and in supersonic planar jet expansion (T(R) = 25 K). Empirical lower state energies of 59 transitions are determined from the ratio of the absolute absorption line strengths at 25 and 81 K. The procedure relies on the realistic description of rotational state populations in the supersonic jet expansion where non-equilibrium nuclear spin isomer distributions are generated due to the rapid cooling. The accuracy of the experimental determination of the lower state energies with J &lt; or = 3 is found to considerably improve the results of the same approach applied to spectra at 296 and 81 K. The 59 transitions with determined lower J values provide a good starting point for the theoretical interpretation of the highly congested icosad region of methane. In particular, the centres of nine vibrational bands are estimated from the transitions with J = 0 lower state rotational quantum number.",

A34, 909-921] in experimental X-ray charge-density studies makes use of real spherical harmonics when describing the angular component of aspherical deformations of the atomic electron density in molecules and crystals. The analytical form of the density-normalized Cartesian spherical harmonic functions for up to l \u2264 7 and the corresponding normalization coefficients were reported previously by Paturle &amp; Coppens [Acta Cryst. (1988), A44, 6-7]. It was shown that the analytical form for normalization coefficients is available primarily for l \u2264 4 [Hansen &amp; Coppens, 1978; Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988; Coppens (1992).

In most cases for l &gt; 4 the density normalization coefficients were calculated numerically to within seven significant figures. In this study we review the literature on the density-normalized spherical harmonics, clarify the existing notations, use the Paturle-Coppens (Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988) method in the Wolfram Mathematica software to derive the Cartesian spherical harmonics for l \u2264 20 and determine the density normalization coefficients to 35 significant figures, and computer-generate a Fortran90 code. The article primarily targets researchers who work in the field of experimental X-ray electron density, but may be of some use to all who are interested in Cartesian spherical harmonics. ",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe sizes of the circular orbits for hydrogen-like atoms are given in terms of their radii by the following expression, in which $\\mathrm{a}_{0}$ is a constant called the Bohr radius, with a value of $5.292 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~m}$ :\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{n^{2}}{Z} a_{0}\n$$\n\nThe equation also shows us that as the electron's energy increases (as $n$ increases), the electron is found at greater distances from the nucleus. This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as $n$ gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the limits $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ and $r \\longrightarrow \\infty$ imply that $E=0$ corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is completely removed from the nucleus. Thus, for hydrogen in the ground state $n=1$, the ionization energy would be:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E=E_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}-E_{1}=0+k=k\n$$\n\nWith three extremely puzzling paradoxes now solved (blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the hydrogen atom), and all involving Planck's constant in a fundamental manner, it became clear to most physicists at that time that the classical theories that worked so well in the macroscopic world were fundamentally flawed and could not be extended down into the microscopic domain of atoms and molecules. Unfortunately, despite Bohr's remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr's model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.14 Quantum numbers and energy levels in a hydrogen atom.

Both solutions show a strong repulsion at the distances compared with the dimension of particles.

Calculating the potential energy of a particle inside a certain space in which the others are distributed nearly uniformly we must take into account only the action of particles inside a small sphere surrounding the particle in question. In fact the potential energy u of our a-particle is given by the integral:\nu = -[ f(r) . 47ir2p dr,(2)\n\nJd\n\nwhere d is the smallest distance between the particles and p the density of particles.

In the surface region very strong forces arise, trying to drag the particle inside the liquid (surface tension). Such a collection of a-particles will be very like a minute drop of water where the inside pressure, due to the kinetic energy of quantised motion, is in equilibrium with the forces of surface-tension trying to diminish the drop-radius.",

These transitions could be unequivocally assigned since there was residual orthohydrogen at low temperatures (slow conversion to the ground state) resulting in an observable J=1--&gt;0 transition at 5 K (kT=0.48 meV). A doublet in neutron energy loss at approximately 28.5 meV is interpreted as J=1--&gt;2 transitions. In addition to the transitions between rotational states, there are a series of peaks that arise from transitions between center-of-mass translational quantum states of the confined hydrogen molecule. A band at approximately 9 meV can be unequivocally interpreted as a transition between translational states, while broad features at 20, 25, 35, and 50-60 meV are also interpreted to as transitions between translational quantum states. A detailed comparison is made with a recent five-dimensional quantum treatment of hydrogen in the smaller dodecahedral cage in the SII ice-clathrate structure. Although there is broad agreement regarding the features such as the splitting of the J=1 degeneracy, the magnitude of the external potential is overestimated. The numerous transitions between translational states predicted by this model are in poor agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons are also made with three simple exactly solved models, namely, a particle in a box, a particle in a sphere, and a particle on the surface of a sphere. Again, there are too many predicted features by the first two models, but there is reasonable agreement with the particle on a sphere model. This is consistent with published quantum chemistry results for hydrogen in the dodecahedral 5(12) cage, where the center of the cage is found to be energetically unfavorable, resulting in a shell-like confinement for the hydrogen molecule wave function. These results demonstrate that translational quantum effects are very significant and a classical treatment of the hydrogen molecule dynamics is inappropriate under such conditions.",

Each peak displays both increasing breadth and increasing blueshift with increasing E, and the blueshift also increases with increasing v'. The first two properties are consistent with a predominantly repulsive excited-state potential-energy surface, while the last is speculated to be a reflection of the rHH dependence of the ionic surface. Quantum scattering calculations based on ab initio potential surfaces for the excited and ionic states in spherical and infinite-order-sudden rigid rotor approximations are in semiquantitative agreement with the measurements.

This work focuses on systems with many degrees of freedom, i.e., XH(4) (eight dimensional) and XH(5) (ten dimensional), with corresponding molecular analogs of CH(4) and CH(5) (+) and is applicable to rovibrationally excited states with J&gt; or =0. A pairwise-additive potential fit for CH(5) (+), which yields remarkable agreement with geometries, energies, and barrier heights on the full-dimensional surface of Brown et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 121, 4105 (2004)] is presented. Comparisons with experimental data and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) methods test convergence for the POS model and provide insight into multidimensional quantum rovibrational dynamics. In particular, POS energy-level patterns for a series of scaled CH(5) (+) potentials indicate an absence of strong tunneling behavior, consistent with the highly delocalized wave functions, large zero-point energies, and small interconversion barriers noted in previous DMC studies of Brown et al.",

This evolution is quantified by partitioning the simulation box and defining regional densities belonging to the two nuclei of the system. It is found that the functional form of the time-variations of these regional densities and the extent of ET process depend strongly on the inter-nuclear distance and relative values of the nuclear charges, which define the potential energy surface governing the electron wavepacket evolution. Also, the initial electronic state of the single-electron atom has critical effect on this evolution and its consequent (partial) electron transfer depending on its spreading extent and orientation with respect to the inter-nuclear axis.

Evaluation of the properties in an infinite crystal.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and precise evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Nguyen, Macchi &amp; Volkov (2020), Acta Cryst. A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

The multipole expansion of the dispersion potential between two confined hydrogen atoms is also shown to be absolutely convergent provided the two atoms satisfy R &gt; 2R(0), where R is the inter-nuclear separation.

Acta Cryst. A34, 909-921]. They are based on the expansion of |r' - r|(-1) in spherical harmonics and the incomplete gamma function for a Slater-type function of the form R(l)(r) = r(n) exp(-alpha ). The formulae are valid for 0 &lt; or = r &lt; or = infinity and are easily extended to higher values of l. Special treatment of integrals is needed only for functions with n = l and n = l + 1 at r = 0. The method is tested using theoretical pseudoatom parameters of the formamide molecule obtained via reciprocal-space fitting of PBE/6-31G** densities and experimental X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5). The ESP, EF and EFG values at the nuclear positions in formamide are in very good agreement with those directly evaluated from density-functional PBE calculations with 6-31G**, aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The small observed discrepancies are attributed to the different behavior of Gaussian- and Slater-type functions near the nuclei and to imperfections of the reciprocal-space fit. An EF map is displayed which allows useful visualization of the lattice EF effects in the crystal structure of formamide. Analysis of experimental 100 K X-ray data of Fe(CO)(5) yields the value of the nuclear quadrupole moment Q((57)Fe(m)) = 0.12 x 10(-28) m(2) after taking into account Sternheimer shielding/antishielding effects of the core. This value is in excellent agreement with that reported by Su &amp; Coppens [Acta Cryst.

For the first time, electric dipole moments are also computed in the approach, including SO coupling for transitions to the states responsible for the first absorption continuum (A-band) of ArH(+). On this basis, the partial and total absorption spectra in this energy range are obtained. It is shown that absorption in the A-band is dominated by the parallel A(1)Sigma(+)&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) transition. In the low-energy part of the band (&lt;95 x 10(3) cm(-1)) the absorption is caused by the perpendicular B(1)Pi&lt;--X(1)Sigma(+) excitation, but transitions to the b(3)Pi(0(+),1) states are also not negligible. The branching ratio Gamma for the final photodissociation products is calculated and it is shown to increase smoothly from 0 in the red tail of the band to 1 at E&gt;or= 10(5) cm(-1). The latter value corresponds to the exclusive formation of the spin-excited Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)) ions, and thus leads to the inverse population of the Ar(+)((2)P(1/2)-(2)P(3/2)) ion states.",

We use the CI-R12 method in order to get within reasonable CPU-time a relatively dense grid of energy points. We demonstrate that CI-R12 is good enough to give an accurate surface, i.e., Gaussian Geminals are not absolutely necessary. For different types of potential energy surface fits, we performed variational calculations of all bound vibrational states, including resonances above the dissociation limit, for total angular momentum J = 0. We clarify the differences between different fits of the energy to various functional forms of the potential surface. Small rms-values (&lt;1 cm(-1)) of the fit do not provide precise information about the interpolatory behaviour of the fit functions.",

Branching ratios and average releases of kinetic energy in channels of formation of c-C2H4S+, CH3CS+, and HCS+ were obtained from well-resolved time-of-flight peaks in coincidence mass spectra.

In order to resolve the disagreement, have performed high-precision variational calculations in Hylleraas coordinates. With the double basis set method, we have been able to obtain good convergence for Z very close to Z(c), which together with the Hellmann-Feynman theorem yields the value Z(c) = 0.911,028,224,077,255,73(4), corresponding to 1/Z(c) = 1.097,660,833,738,559,80(5). This value is in agreement with the value obtained by Baker et al. [Phys. Rev. A 41, 1247 (1990)]. A significant feature of the results is that the outer electron remains localized near the nucleus, even at Z = Z(c), and the bound state evidently changes smoothly into a shape resonance for Z&lt;Z(c).

The Rb(5P3/2) state was excited by a diode laser. The direct 5P3/2--&gt;5S1/2 fluorescence and the sensitized 5P1/2--&gt;5S1/2 fluorescence as a function of quenching gas pressure were measured. The 5P3/2 and 5P1/2 states are separated by 238 cm(-1). The closest other states are &gt;6500 cm(-1) or &gt;28 KT. Neglect of these other states should be an excellent approximation. In the experiment the Rb density was 4.5 x 10(11) cm(-3). Using radiation trapping theory the effective radiative rate=Gammae5P3/2--&gt;5S1/2 2.47 x 10(7) s(-1) was obtained. For quenching by He only electronic to translational energy transfer is possible. However, in the N2 case, electronic to vibrational or rotational transfer is important. The Rb(5P3/2) state is 13 cm(-1) lower than the N2[X'Sigmag+ (V= 5, J= 11)]state; this energy gap is near resonant. The authors have not attempted to directly observe this possible E-R quenching channel Using a two-state rate equation model the transfer rate coefficients from Rb(5PJ) were obtained. The rate coefficient (k21He) for 5P3/2--&gt;5P1/2 transfer in collision with He is 2.61 x 10(-12) cm3 x s(-1). By comparing the direct and sensitized fluorescence intensities for He and N2 case, and fitting the experimental results to the rate equation analysis, the authors estimate that the rate coefficient (k21N2) for 5P3/2-5P1/2 transfer in collision with N2 is 2.36 x 10(-11) cm3 x s(-1). The E-V quenching rate coefficient (kN2) of the 5PJ state is 1.44 x 10(-10) cm3 x s(-1). The authors found find that the rate coefficient kN2 is about 6 times larger than the k21N2. The assumption that the Cs-N2 energy transfer occurs primarily in collinear collision geometry is supported. The results are discussed in relation to those of other experiments.",

These were obtained by taking structures approximating the five minima identified previously 29 and optimizing them at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory (shown in Figure 1). In the second set, random starting geometries were used. These optimizations allowed us to check that no unexpected minima are found using the chosen nonbonded potential and to probe the intermolecular PES facilitated by the chosen Lennard-Jones parameters. Optimizations were also performed using a rigid-body force field constructed using permanent multipole moments from an IQA analysis of the B3LYP/aug-cc-pvTZ optimized monomer and the same Lennard-Jones parameters (IQA + LJ).

However, the peak height increased with the number of molecules in each subset. When plotting all molecules, outliers became more frequent, which is likely due to the growing number of atom species. This is expected, as calculations tend to be more complex with heavier atoms; few molecules containing heavy atoms are found in PubChem. As a result, the peak values and coefficients of determination remained relatively stable. In any event, a thorough examination is warranted.

The plot demonstrates an almost linear relationship, suggesting that the number of molecules with substantial differences in HOMO-LUMO energy gap values, depending on the calculation method, as observed in the two-dimensional plots, is minimal.\n\n\nComparison of dipole moments\n\nThe juxtaposition of dipole moment between the B3LYP/6-31G*//PM6 and PM6//PM6 methods is presented in Fig. 8, showcasing a two-dimensional histogram and heatmap that illustrate the correlation of dipole moments with a bin size of 0.1 debye each. These energies were ascertained utilizing both PM6//PM6 and B3LYP/6-31G*//PM6 techniques for the entire collection and all subsets, encompassing CHON300, CHON500, CHNOPSFCl300, CHNOPSFCl500, CHNOPSFClNaKMgCa500, and the comprehensive set. We did not plot For all instances, dipole moments exhibit a strong correlation between PM6//PM6 and B3LYP/6-31G*//PM6. Given that the same molecular geometries were employed for both calculations, this outcome is anticipated, as the dipole moment is predominantly influenced by molecular geometry rather than the disparities in calculation methods. (A notable exception is carbon monoxide, though the direction of the dipole moment is not considered).",

The two methods gave generally good agreement with the 184 observed shifts with root mean square (RMS) errors 0.07\u00a0ppm (HSPEC) and 0.10\u00a0ppm (GIAO), but the GIAO calculations gave several significant (&gt;0.25\u00a0ppm) errors. One was for the H<sub3</sub proton in apopinenone and other \u03b1,\u03b2 unsaturated ketones; the others occurred for protons in close proximity to hydroxyl groups. To provide more information, smaller analogues of known geometry and chemical shifts were subject to the same analysis. In cyclopentenone, the Gaussian geometry gave good agreement with the observed shifts, but the MMFF94, MMX and MM3 geometries all gave errors for different protons. These results show clearly that the molecular geometries of the \u03b1,\u03b2 unsaturated ketones are responsible for the errors. The errors for the alcohols were examined using ethanol as model and were shown to be due to the different possible conformations of the OH group. Similar GIAO calculations on substituted methanes gave good agreement for the methyl compounds but poor agreement for di and tri halosubstituted methanes. The aforementioned method of molecular mechanics plus GIAO calculations is shown to be a very useful tool for the investigation of molecular geometries and conformations. However, multihalogen compounds may require different basis sets for accurate calculations. Copyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

An analysis considering diverse diatomic speciesDipole moments from experimental geometries\n\nThe dipole moments discussed in previous sections are obtained from optimized computational geometries at the corresponding levels of theory and basis sets. Nevertheless, and despite our exhaustive work, we did not analyze if the performance of the different methods and basis set for the dipole moment were correlated with their performance for the equilibrium geometry. For instance, when we consider the core-correlation, both magnitudes showed a simultaneous improvement. To reach a deeper insight on that question, we have calculated the dipole moment of the molecules in the dataset using experimental geometries taken from Ref. 8 and compare with the ones based on computational optimized geometries, as shown in Figs. 10 and Fig. 11. For these calculations, we employ the def2-QZVPP basis since it has been shown in the previous sections that the def2-QZVPP dipole moments are very closed to the predicted CBS(def2-T/QZVPP). Within the frozen-core approximation, the calculated dipole moments based on experimental geometries are generally smaller than the ones employing computational optimized geometries. Consequently, using experimental geometries can improve the dipole moments of some molecules whose dipole moments are overestimated, for example CuS, some bi-alkali molecules and some of the alkaline halides, but exacerbates the description of some metal/nonmetal halides. However, the RMSE is 0.67 D, which is even larger than the dipole moments for computational optimized geometries (0.61 D). In the case of core-correlations, as the description of dipole moments is already improved compared to the frozen-core results, using experimental geometries can make the predictions of some molecules closer to the experimental results, for example some transition metal compounds whose dipole moments are overestimated with computational optimized geometries. The overall RMSE of dipole moment can be reduced from 0.42 D with computationally optimized ge-ometries to 0.37 D with experimental geometries for 135 molecules.\n\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nIn this study, we have systematically analyzed the performance of CCSD(T) predicting dipole moments and equilibrium distances of diatomic molecules compared with a dataset of 135 experimental dipole moments and equilibrium distances.",

Nam et al., [69], \"Problematic calculations are density-sensitive and using HF densities fixes these issues.\"Not only that, but also all the other post-HF approaches produced very similar geometry and dipole moment values like that the traditional HF approach.",

Solvent effects were not included in the calculations. We assume that the solvents, employed in the experiments where yields were taken, are properly selected (during the optimization studies) for the ideal reactivity of the substrates and the solvents have similar effects on the equilibrium and planar conformers of a given substrate. In this study we will approximate the rotational Gibbs free energy (DG rot ) by the computed Kohn-Sham energy difference of the equilibrium and constrained geometries, where the conformational angle (s) is set to 0 (Scheme 1) and neglect the entropy, vibrational and zero-point energy differences between the equilibrium and constrained structures. We note that when formation of a six-membered metallacycle is expected all the three atoms of DG are forced to be in-plane with the aromatic ring requiring two dihedral angles to be 0 . In the following we will use either the equilibrium dihedral angle s, or the term DG rot when discussing the effect of steric hindrance between DG and ortho groups. In addition, we also express DG rot in RT units (standardized DG rot ; DG 0 rot \u00bc DG rot /RT), i.e. we can compare torsional energies at different temperatures.\n\n\nTheory for C-H activation with d 8 metals",

Nondestructive structure selection of the complexes and the dipole moment determination were performed by using a 2-m electrostatic hexapole field. The experimentally determined permanent dipole moments are 1.2 +/- 0.1 D for Al-CH(3)CN and 2.7 +/- 0.2 D for Al-NH(3). We find that the dipole moment of Al-NH(3) becomes larger than that of neat NH(3), while the formation of the Al-CH(3)CN complex produces a smaller dipole moment than that of neat CH(3)CN on the other hand. We performed the ab initio calculations to draw out plausible complex structures and to clarify the bonding character after formation of the complex, and we made comparisons with the computational results done by several groups. The Mulliken population analysis suggests the Al--&gt;CH(3)CN charge flow, but on the other hand the Natural population analysis indicates very little charge flow. For the Al-NH(3) complex, the polarization effect of NH(3) and the N--&gt;Al sigma donation would enhance the dipole moment strength. However, there still remains a controversial disagreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. Further experimental determination using the hexapole method for various metal-ligand complexes and clusters could reveal the basic nature of interaction in the complex systems in general, and this method would complement theoretical calculations.",

An initial investigation of staggered forms examined the linkage bonds characterized by the torsion angles phi, psi, and omega, and subsequently the fructose hydroxymethyl side groups, characterized by the torsion angles chi-1 and chi-6. Then, in our major search of conformational space, the torsion angles of two linkage bonds, phi and omega, were driven through 360 degrees in 20 degree increments at all staggered side group combinations. From these results, the low-energy forms were minimized without the driver restrictions to generate the global minimum structure found and herein reported. This conformer was then used to map the conformational space of phi and omega by driving only those torsion angles through 360 degrees.

This is confirmed by a recent study on matrix isolated \u03b1PH which could only identify vibrational signatures of equatorial conformers.

The coefficients of the axial conformer sM(s) functions are always negative or zero if forced to be positive semidefinite. Thus, we cannot find any direct evidence for the presence of axial conformers in the static diffraction.

The GED data were augmented by molecular orbital calculations, and the analysis was aided by use of rotational constants from microwave (MW) spectroscopy.

We performed the geometry optimization and rotatory strength calculation of methyl \u03b1 -D-Glc conformers using CAM-B3LYP with the multicomponent scheme (MC_CAM-B3LYP). In MC_CAM-B3LYP calculations, all hydrogen nuclei were treated quantum mechanically. Two isotopologues were investigated; the first isotopologue had only protons as the hydrogen nuclei and four OH groups of the molecule were replaced with the deuterons for the other isotopologue. We used 6-31G(d) electronic basis set for geometry optimization and 6-311+ + G(2d,2p) basis set for rotatory strength calculations. For both types of calculations, [1s] GTF calculations were used with 24.1825 a.u. exponent value for the proton and 35.6214 a.u. for deuteron optimized for the quantum treatment of hydrogen nuclei in the MC_HF scheme 22 . Electronic excitation calculation based on TD-DFT with CAM-B3LYP functional was performed to obtain the rotatory strength of the optimized geometry, where the occupied and virtual Kohn-Sham orbitals were evaluated with the multicomponent scheme and the excitation of the hydrogen nuclei was neglected. 30 rotatory strengths were calculated for each conformer to construct the CD spectrum according to the equation: where \u03c3 i is the excitation energy, R i is the corresponding electronic rotatory strength, and \u03c3 \u2206 is the bandwidth of each signal that was set to 0.30 eV.",

The geometries and frequencies of all the stationary points are optimized at the MP2/6-311+G(2d, 2p) level of theory. A hydrogen-bonded complex is located at the product channel for the OH + HOBr reaction. To improve the energetics information along the minimum energy path (MEP), single-point energy calculations are carried out at the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df, 3pd) level of theory. Interpolated single-point energy (ISPE) method is employed to correct the energy profiles for the three reactions. It is found that neither the barrier heights (DeltaE) nor the H-O bond dissociation energies [D(H-O)] exhibit any clear-cut linear correlations with the halogen electronegative. The decrease of DeltaE and D(H-O) for the three reactions are in order of HOF &gt; HOBr &gt; HOCl. Rate constants for each reaction are calculated by canonical variational transition-state theory (CVT) with a small-curvature tunneling correction (SCT) within 200-2000 K. The agreement of the rate constants with available experimental values for reactions R2 and R3 at 298 K is good. Our results show that the variational effect is small while the tunneling correction has an important contribution in the calculation of rate constants in the low-temperature range. Due to the lack of the kinetic data of these reactions, the present theoretical results are expected to be useful and reasonable to estimate the dynamical properties of these reactions over a wide temperature range where no experimental value is available.",

NMR NOE and T-ROE spectroscopy experiments, conformation-dependent coupling constants and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used in the analyses. To facilitate these studies, the compounds were synthesised as alpha-d-[6-(13)C]-Manp-OMe derivatives, which reduced the (1)H NMR spectral overlap and facilitated the determination of two- and three-bond (1)H,(1)H, (1)H,(13)C and (13)C,(13)C-coupling constants. The population distribution for the glycosidic omega torsion angle in alpha-d-Manp-(1--&gt;6)-alpha-d-Manp-OMe for gt/gg/tg was equal to 45:50:5, whereas in alpha-d-Manp-OMe it was determined to be 56:36:8. The dynamic model that was generated for beta-d-GlcpNAc-(1--&gt;6)-alpha-d-Manp-OMe by MD simulations employing the PARM22/SU01 CHARMM-based force field was in very good agreement with experimental observations. beta-d-GlcpNAc-(1--&gt;6)-alpha-d-Manp-OMe is described by an equilibrium of populated states in which the phi torsion angle has the exo-anomeric conformation, the psi torsion angle an extended antiperiplanar conformation and the omega torsion angle a distribution of populations predominantly between the gauche-trans and the gauche-gauche conformational states (i.e., gt/gg/tg) is equal to 60:35:5, respectively. The use of site-specific (13)C labelling in these disaccharides leads to increased spectral dispersion, thereby making NMR spectroscopy based conformational analysis possible that otherwise might be difficult to attain.",

Next, B3LYP/6-311++G(**) level geometry optimizations were carried out, albeit on a simpler model. The relative Gibbs free energies and geometry parameters are presented for the optimized structures. Conformational analysis concerning the clockwise (cw) and counterclockwise (ccw) arrangements of the OH groups as well as the three orientations of the NH2 and CH2OH groups was performed. Furthermore, a full scan of all the possible locations of the diosgenyl moiety in relation to the sugar ring in the target compounds was done. The PM3 optimization results indicate that diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside exists as a mixture of many rotamers. Of these, ccw conformers as well as the -ac orientation of the aglycone (ca -100\u00b0 for torsion angle \u03c6) are preferred. In the case of the N-protonated glucoside one rotamer is dominant in the mixture (population&gt;60%). Only the cw arrangement is stable in the protonated form, because of steric and electronic repulsion between the charged ammonium group and the hydrogen atom of the neighbouring 3-OH group. The gauche-trans (gt) orientation of the CH2OH group is favourable to both neutral and protonated forms of diosgenyl glucosides at the PM3 level. DFT studies also predict conformational mixtures for both neutral and protonated forms of simplified diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosides. These investigations showed unequivocally the preference for the ccw arrangement over cw, and that values of angle \u03c6 concur with the exo-anomeric effect. The B3LYP functional predicts the greater stability of the gt and tg orientations for the neutral and protonated analogues respectively. According to both PM3 and B3LYP calculations, torsion angle \u03c8 has only a minor influence on the conformational energy.

Energetics are compared to high-level MCG3/3//MC-QCISD/3 wave function theory and to results obtained by other density functionals. We employ canonical variational transition-state theory with multidimensional tunneling contributions and scaled generalized normal-mode frequencies evaluated in redundant curvilinear coordinates with anharmonicity included in the torsion. The transition state has a quantum mechanically distinguishable, nonsuperimposable mirror image that corresponds to a separate classical reaction path; the effect of the multiple paths is examined through use of a symmetry number and by torsional methods. Calculations with the reference-potential Pitzer-Gwinn treatment of the torsional mode agree with experiment, within experimental scatter, and predict a striking temperature dependence of the activation energy, increasing from -0.1 kcal/mol at 200 K to 0.2, 1.0, 3.4, and 9.8 kcal/mol at 300, 500, 1000, and 2400 K. The unusual temperature dependence arises from a dynamical bottleneck at an energy below reactants, following an addition complex on the reaction path with a classical binding energy of 4.4 kcal/mol. As a way to check the mechanism, kinetic isotope effects of the OH + D2S and OD + D2S reactions have been predicted.",

In contrast, the other two states, i.e. the 2(2)A' and 1(4)A' states, are energetically not favourable to the reaction as the first state has a potential barrier of 0.2 eV in the entrance channel and the former one presents long range potential wells and repulsive wall for carbon approaches near OH. The ab initio calculations of the potential energies have been performed at the multireference internally contracted single and double configuration interaction (MR-SDCI) level corrected for its size-inconsistency by the Davidson method (+Q), and using Dunning aug-cc-pVQZ atomic basis sets. Global PESs have then been generated for the two A'' states from an analytical fit obtained with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method on a large number of ab initio points located on a regular grid in Jacobi coordinates. The title reaction is much less exoergic (-0.41 eV) than the one on the ground state and each state presents many extrema (four for the 1(2)A'' and eight for the 1(4)A''). From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one. Nevertheless, a decreasing behaviour with the temperature remains between 10 and 500 K if we consider the total rate constant of C((3)P) + OH(X(2)Pi), sum of the three reactive states rate constants.",

We not only used multiple references, we also used open and mixed shell SCF cases; we therefore obtained values for the parameter \u03bb DC by minimizing the average differences between MRD-CI energy values computed for the same point with different reference sets (which thus had different sizes for the Davidson correction). We used \u03bb (SCF) DC = 0.52, 0.16, and 0.32 for closed, open, and mixed SCF cases, respectively; the average size of \u2206E DC was 1.31, 1.90, and 0.60 mE h , respectively, yielding full-CI corrections averaging 0.68, 0.30, and 0.19 mE h , respectively. For the 12 077 cases where the program obtained improved reference sets, and thus two different-sized Davidson corrections were available, the rms difference between the resulting energies was 0.16 mE h . This may be a slight underestimate of the energy uncertainty resulting from the Davidson correction, since on average the initial reference set yielded a Davidson correction only 1.75 times as large as the improved reference set, and we have no information from cases where only one value of the Davidson correction was available. There are suggestions of a systematic uncertainty of order 0.1 in the preferred value of \u03bb (SCF) DC , leading to a systematic uncertainty in the energy correction of order 0.13 mE h . We estimate the total uncertainty in the Davidson-type correction to full-CI to be about 0.3 mE h .",

The fit is used to investigate the dissociation dynamics along each potential energy surface for several initial geometries corresponding to Franck-Condon transition from neutral or singly ionized water molecule. For each case, we determine the dissociation channels and we compute the kinetic energy release and angular momentum distribution of the final arrangements. Among the eight potential energy surfaces investigated here, only the lowest triplet and the three lowest singlet can lead to the formation of bound residual fragment. The dissociation of HOD(2+) presents a strong preference for OH rather than OD bond breakage. It is characterized by the isotopic ratio, defined as the number of OD(+) over the number of OH(+) residual fragments. This ratio depends strongly on the shape of each potential energy surface and on the initial conditions.",

To first order in perturbation theory, the ZFS arises from the direct spin-spin dipole-dipole interaction. To second order, contributions arise from spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The latter contributions are difficult to treat since the SOC mixes states of different multiplicities. This is an aspect of dominant importance for the correct prediction of the D tensor. In this work, the theory of the D tensor is discussed from the point of view of analytic derivative theory. Starting from a general earlier perturbation treatment [F. Neese and E. I. Soloman, Inorg. Chem. 37, 6568 (1998)], straightforward response equations are derived that are readily transferred to the self-consistent field (SCF) Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional theory (DFT) framework. The main additional effort in such calculations arises from the solution of nine sets of nonstandard coupled-perturbed SCF equations. These equations have been implemented together with the spin-orbit mean-field representation of the SOC operator and a mean-field treatment of the direct spin-spin interaction into the ORCA electronic structure program. A series of test calculations on diatomic molecules with accurately known zero-field splittings shows that the new approach corrects most of the shortcomings of previous DFT based methods and, on average, leads to predictions within 10% of the experimental values. The slope of the correlation line is essentially unity for the B3LYP and BLYP functionals compared to approximately 0.5 in previous treatments.",

The theoretical data are also sought for astrochemical modeling of cold environments (&lt;50 K). The rates are calculated on the basis of a microcanonical approach using the Langevin model and the conservation laws of mass, energy, angular momentum, and nuclear spin. Full scrambling of all five nuclei during the collision is assumed for the calculations and alternatively partial dynamical restrictions are considered. The ergodic principle of the collision is employed in two limiting cases, neglecting (weak ergodic limit) or accounting for explicit degeneracies of the reaction mechanisms (strong ergodic limit). The resulting sets of rate coefficients are shown to be consistent with the detailed balance and thermodynamical equilibrium constants. Rate coefficients, k(T), for the deuteration chain of H(3)(+) with HD as well as H(2)D(+)/H(3)(+) equilibrium ratios have been measured in a variable temperature 22-pole ion trap. In particular, the D(2)H(+) + HD --&gt; D(3)(+) + H(2) rate coefficient indicates a change in reaction mechanism when going to higher temperatures. The good overall agreement between experiment and theory encourages the use of the theoretical predictions for astrophysical modeling.",

Ab initio multireference configuration interaction calculations were performed on both barrierless PESs (where the minimum energy path involves the insertion of the O atom into the middle of the H2(+) bond), and suitable analytical expressions were developed for the first time and used in quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations. k(1) \u2248 3k(2) independent of the isotopic variant, k(H2(+)) &gt; k(HD(+)) &gt; k(D2(+)) for , and the intermolecular and intramolecular isotopic effects are essentially independent of T.

The larger value of \u03c3(1(2)A'') with respect to \u03c3(1(2)A') arises from the larger value of bmax(1(2)A'') with respect to bmax(1(2)A'), and this results from the more attractive character of the former PES. Besides, the reaction probabilities are quite large [0.78-0.98 (1(2)A'') and 0.78-0.93 (1(2)A')], and the decreasing trend of both cross-sections as Ecol increases arises from the barrierless character of both PESs. We expect that these results (in particular, the competition between proton transfer and hydrogen atom transfer) will encourage experimentalists to carry out investigations on this interesting reaction.

Comparison with the high resolution experiments of Davis and co-workers (Science, 2000, 290, 958) shows that the structures (peaks) found in the relative translational energy distributions of products could not be satisfactorily reproduced in the calculations, probably due to the classical nature of the QCT method and the importance of quantum effects. The calculations, however, worked quite well for other properties. Overall, both surfaces led to similar results, although the YZCL2 surface is more accurate to describe the H(3)O PES, as derived from comparison with high level ab initio results. The differences observed in the QCT calculations were interpreted considering the somewhat larger anisotropy of the YZCL2 PES when compared with the WSLFH PES.",

The WP-EQM calculations include all total angular momenta up to J(max) = 50, and therefore the various dynamical observables are converged up to 0.6 eV. It has been found that it is necessary to include all Coriolis couplings to obtain reliable converged results. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods are thoroughly compared as a function of the total energy for a series of J values. Comparisons are also made of total reaction cross sections as function of the collision energy, and rate constants. In addition, opacity functions, integral cross sections (ICS) and differential cross sections (DCS) are presented at 102 meV, 201.3 meV and 524.6 meV collision energy. The agreement between the three sets of results is only qualitative. The QCT calculations fail to describe the overall reactivity and most of the dynamical observables correctly. At low collision energies, the QCT method is plagued by the lack of conservation of zero point energy, whilst at higher collision energies and/or total angular momenta, the appearance of an effective repulsive potential associated with the centrifugal motion \"over\" the well causes a substantial decrease of the reactivity. In turn, the statistical models overestimate the reactivity over the whole range of collision energies as compared with the WP-EQM method. Specifically, at sufficiently high collision energies the reaction cannot be deemed to be statistical and important dynamical effects seem to be present. In general the WP-EQM results lie in between those obtained using the QCT and SQCT methods. One of the main, unexpected, conclusions of this work is that an accurate description of the reaction and of its various dynamical features requires a computationally expensive, accurate quantum mechanical treatment.",

However, the calculation was limited at rather higher density (&gt;0.6 g/cm3) due to the difficulty of convergence, which is inherent to the hypernetted-chain (HNC) closure. The problem is overcome in this study by employing the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closure which hybridizes the HNC and the mean-spherical approximation (MSA).

The geometries and frequencies of the stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES) are optimized at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory, and the energies are refined at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df) (single-point) level of theory.

A model PES is developed and used in quasi-classical trajectory calculations to obtain the capture rate constant and nascent energy distributions of ClOOCl* produced via the chaperon mechanism. A range of VDW binding energies from 1.5 to 9.0 kcal mol(-1) are investigated. The anisotropic PES for the ClO.N(2) complex and a separable anharmonic oscillator approximation are used to estimate the equilibrium constant for formation of the VDW complex. Rate constants, branching ratios to produce ClOOCl, and nascent energy distributions of excited ClOOCl* are discussed with respect to the VDW binding energy and temperature. Interestingly, even for weak VDW binding energies, the N(2) usually carries away enough energy to stabilize the nascent ClOOCl*, although the VDW equilibrium constant is small. For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant. For the calculated ClO.N(2) binding energy of 1.5 kcal mol(-1), the VDW equilibrium constant is small, and the chaperon mechanism is only important at very high pressures.",

Accurate formulas for the compressibility factor of the HS solid and fluid branches are proposed, which represent the metastable region and take into account its divergence at close packing. Some basic second-order thermodynamic properties are obtained and a maximum in some of their derivatives in the metastable fluid region is found. The thermodynamic parameters associated with the melting-freezing transition have been determined to four digit accuracy, which generates accurate new values for the coexistence properties of the HS system. For the self-diffusion coefficient, D, it is shown that relatively large systems (N &gt; 104) are required to achieve an accurate linear extrapolation of D to the infinite size limit with a D vs. N-1/3 plot. Moreover, it is found that there is a density dependence of the value of the slope in the linear regime. The density dependent correction becomes practically insignificant at higher densities and the hydrodynamic formula found in the literature is still accurate. However, with decreasing density the density dependence of the size correction cannot be neglected, which indicates that other sources of N-dependence, apart from those derived on purely hydrodynamic grounds, may also be important (and as yet unaccounted for). A detailed analytic representation of the density dependence of the HS self-diffusion coefficient and the HS viscosity, \u03b7, is given. It is shown that the HS viscosity near freezing and in the metastable region can be described well by the Krieger-Dougherty equation. Both D and \u03b7 start to scale at high densities and in the metastable region in such a way that D\u03b7p = const, where p \u2243 0.97, and D \u2192 0 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e at a packing fraction of 0.58, which coincides with some previous predictions of the HS glass transition density.",

The main focus is the evolution of specific spectral patterns from the bottom of the potential well up to excitation energies of approximately 25,000 cm(-1), where large-amplitude, isomerization-type motion from H-CP to CP-H is prominent. Distinct structural and dynamical changes, caused by an abrupt transformation from essentially HC bonding to mainly PH bonding, set in around 13,000 cm(-1). They reflect saddle-node bifurcations in the classical phase space--a phenomenon well known in the nonlinear dynamics literature--and result in characteristic patterns in the spectrum and the quantum-number dependence of the vibrational fine-structure constants. Two polar opposites are employed to elucidate the spectral patterns: the exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, using an accurate potential energy surface and an effective or resonance Hamiltonian (expressed in a harmonic oscillator basis set and block diagonalized into polyads), which is defined by parameters adjusted to fit either the measured or the calculated vibrational energies. The combination of both approaches--together with classical mechanics and semiclassical analyses--provides a detailed spectroscopic picture of the breaking of one bond and the formation of a new one.",

Intuitively, if both coins are tossed the same number of times, the first coin should turn up fewer heads than the second one. More specifically, for any fixed k, the probability that the first coin produces at least k heads should be less than the probability that the second coin produces at least k heads. However proving such a fact can be difficult with a standard counting argument. Coupling easily circumvents this problem. Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be indicator variables for heads in a sequence of flips of the first coin. For the second coin, define a new sequence Y1, Y2, ..., Yn such that if Xi = 1, then Yi = 1, if Xi = 0, then Yi = 1 with probability (q \u2212 p)/(1 \u2212 p).",

Number of Wyckoff sequences of a given subdivision complexityA generating polynomial approach to find solutions\n\nOur combinatorial problem stated above is solved in two steps: first, by reducing it, conceptually, to an analogous classical problem of combinatorics, the coin change problem, as can be found in many textbooks on the topic (for instance, Marcus, 1998, p. 89), and second, by adapting the classical problem to the crystallographic one.\n\nThe classical coin change problem is stated in Appendix B, and can be seen as an illustration of the use of generating polynomials, defined in some abstract variable. Notably, the variable is an indeterminate symbol only, entailing no specific meaning other than to allow algebraic operations performed on it; hence it merely acts as a placeholder and bookkeeping device, yet is the decisive one, in order to systematically find a solution.\n\nThis use of generating polynomials has already been described in the first entry of this series (Hornfeck, 2022a) to which the reader, interested in more detailed information, is referred. An introduction to the wider field of generating functions is given by Graham et al. (1994), and a more detailed exposition of the main ideas involved is given by Wilf (2006). Now, adapting the classical coin change problem to our crystallographic one is carried out in three steps: (i) matching the number of distinct types of coins with the number of distinct Wyckoff positions; (ii) identifying the values of distinct types of coins with the pair of values of the Wyckoff position's multiplicity M i and arity A i ; and (iii) treating the pair of values (M i , A i ) in a coupled way, by introducing two abstract variables \u00f0x; y\u00de in the generating polynomials, instead of one.\n\nThus, in some way, the crystallographic problem is a coin change problem with a twist, based on imaginary coins with denominations on both their front and back sides and a pair of target values to reach upon summation. Similar combinatorial problems arise for the case of real cards, coupling values denoted by digits or letters with symbolic ones such as diamonds, hearts, spades and clubs.",

We tried to repeat his conditions but were unable to obtain such a low velocity. Whether Geiger's result may prove correct or not there must be some very radical change accompanying the absorption of the a-particles when their velocity falls to 0*41 of the initial velocity (radium C). We now turn to the discussion of the figures given in the first section of the paper for the velocity curves in the various materials. For the airvelocity curve Geiger deduced from his results the formula V3 = aR, where V is the velocity, a a constant and R the range of the a-particles emerging from the absorbing foil. Putting in the value 6'94 for the total range at 15\u00b0 and 76 cm. Hg, the values given in Column 6 of Table II were deduced and it will be seen that except for velocities less than 0*41 they show a good agreement with the experimental values. With regard to the velocity curves in other materials the formula does not hold, the curve approaching more nearly to that expressed by V2 = &R for substances of increasing atomic weight. This is indicated by the energy curve for gold shown in fig. 1. Darwin (loc. cit.) first attempted to deduce expressions for the velocity curve in various materials, the assumption being that the a-particle loses energy by setting in motion the electrons in the atoms of the absorbing substance. To avoid, as far as possible, any hypotheses as to the structure of atoms Darwin also assumed that an a-particle only acts on the electrons in an atom when it actually passes through the atom. Bohr has extended Darwin's results and removed the objection of limiting the action of the a-particle. Bohr arrives at a formula which may be reduced to",

At r 12 \u00bc d c \u00fe 2L the two NCs start to touch each other. A larger separation distance ensures that the initial forces on the centres of mass of both NCs are zero.\n\nTo calculate the PMF, we measure the average forces acting on the centre of mass of both gold cores, F 1 and F 2 over the course of a simulation run.

In this study, we take U 0 = 100. Our control test shows that our results are not sensitive to the value of U 0 around 100. The simulation cell is a rectangular cell where periodic boundary condition is applied. To diminish the boundary effect, we always keep the cell size larger than two nanoparticles by six times of the Debye length, and the calculation results are stable as tested against different cell sizes. In the simulations, the radii of nanoparticles and ions are taken as 10\u00c5 and 2\u00c5, respectively. The charges Z on nanoparticles are taken as \u221221e, ensuring the surface charge density is close to that of phosphate groups in nucleic acid (80). Also, the additional calculations are performed for other ion radii (3\u00c5, 4\u00c5) to study the ion size effect, and for other nanoparticle charge Z (= \u221212e, \u221224e, \u221236e) to study the charge density effect. In the calculations of potential of mean force \u2206G(x) = G(x) \u2212 G(x ref ), for simplicity, the outer reference distance x ref is taken as 40\u00c5 for all ion conditions. We used the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm for all simulations in our work, which is a computational approach for generating a set of N configurations of the system by the relative probability proportional to the Boltzmann factor: p(N i ) \u221d e \u2212E(N i )/k B T , and the transition probability p i\u2192 j from configuration i to configuration j is given by p i\u2192 j = e \u2212(E j \u2212E i )/k B T . Starting from an initial configuration with the two nanoparticles in the center and the ions randomly distributed in the simulation box, every particle randomly moves to a trial position and we calculate the energy change \u2206E due to the move. If a random number R(\u2208 [0, 1]) < p = e \u2212\u2206E/k B T , the trial move is accepted. Repeat the trial move until the system reaches the equilibrium. Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 (in the Supporting Material) shows that the statistical results of our simulations can quickly reach the convergence.",

Panel A shows the coefficient a 0 (R) based on MD data for three temperatures; the best estimate is indicated by red dots, the corresponding error margin by the surrounding red area. Panel B compares the predicted PMF (lines) and the PMF obtained from MD simulations (dots). Panels C and D show the results of the ideal gas model with (and without) depletion; T 0 = 400 K.

For fixed m, the particle therefore sees the effective potential\n\u2206G(\u2113) + \u03b3 2 \u2113 2 ,(5)\ni.e. Eq. (4) determines the variance of the random potential. The spring constant \u03b3 is determined by \u03b5 as follows. If \u2206\u03b5 were zero, the unzipping force would take a constant value f 0 (cf. the dashed line in Fig. 2b, which shows the FEC of a homogeneous AU-hairpin). The dependence of f 0 on \u03b5 can be calculated analytically by evaluating the sum in Eq. (1) by the saddle point method (see also (D.K. Lubensky and D.R. Nelson, in preparation)). The result is shown in Fig. 4 (solid line). Now \u03b3 = l 2 \u0393, where \u0393 is the local spring constant of a nonbinding RNA of m bases at force f 0 (\u03b5). Since the spring constant of a homopolymer scales with the inverse of the number of segments, we write \u0393 = \u0393 0 /m, where \u0393 0 depends only on f 0 , but not on m. Graphically, \u0393 0 (f 0 ) is the slope at f = f 0 of the dashed line in Fig. 2a (FEC of a homopolymeric RNA), multiplied by 251 (the number of bases in that example). In this way \u0393 0 (f 0 ) may also be determined from an experimental FEC. Note that the Gaussian approximation breaks down already at low forces, and the more detailed treatment according to Eq.\n\n(2) is necessary. The stacking energy for AU-pairs at T = 20 \u2022 C is 2 \u03b5 \u2248 1.21 kcal/mol corresponding to a threshold force f0 \u2248 11 pN, which agrees with the value observed in Fig. 2b (dashed line).",

In our case, A = \u0393 = 2\u03c0\u03b3. Natural spectral width of the transition \u03b3 is of 6 MHz. The factor g(F g , F e ) can be expressed by using 6J symbols [13]. The calculated concentrations of the ground state atoms v.s. detuning of the cooling laser are shown in figure 4. Note that the populations of the ground-state 2S 1/2 sub-levels are quite close by magnitude. It can be explained by the fact that the upper state 2P 3/2 sublevels are not resolved (hf-splitting is the same order as the natural width \u03b3). Therefore it is impossible to select the circling transition for the effective optical cooling. Atoms are continuously transferred from F = 2 to F = 1 and back. In the maximum (detuning range from 3\u03b3 to 6\u03b3) the estimated population of the excited state 2P 3/2 is order 10 \u22122 of the total population of the ground state. Therefore the total density of the trapped atoms n in the maximum is near 5 \u00d7 10 10 cm \u22123 . An estimated total number N of the trapped atoms is of 4 \u00d7 10 8 . Estimated temperature of the trapped atoms is order of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 K. The density n and total number N of atoms can be increased by increasing the magnetic field gradient. The linear dependence of n and N on the magnetic field gradient in the range 20-35 Gauss/cm has been observed [10].",

Two years ago I found the emission bands which go down to the B level and some of them were described and partially analysed in this journal.f In a series of papers! Dr. Davidson and I have been able to show th at these bands comprise a large number of distinct band systems and contain a very large part of the total strength of the visible emission spectrum of H 2. In previous papers I have called this B level of Dieke and Hopfield 2 1S as it has an effective principal quantum number in the neighbourhood of 2 and its properties are those of an S level. In view of recently proposed changes in the nomenclature \u00a7 for band spectra I propose in this paper to denote this B or 2 X S level by the symbol 2^?1S. In this notation 2 denotes the principal quantum number and < p indicates that the azimuthal or equivalent quantum number of the excited electron is 1. E means that the component of the total angular momentum (or equivalent quantized quantity) about the internuclear axis is 0 and the prefix1 that the state is a singlet state.Various attempts have been made from time to time to discover bands in this spectrum which end on Dieke and Hopfield's C level, but, until recently, nothing at all convincing has resulted from these efforts.

The action spectrum of the D&lt;--X transition band has been measured. The predissociation lifetime of the D state is determined to be about 13.5 fs. The quantum state-resolved OH product translational energy distributions and angular distributions have also been measured. By carefully simulating these distributions, quantum state distributions of the OH product as well as the state-resolved angular anisotropy parameters were determined. The most important pathway of the H(2)O dissociation via the D state leads to the highly rotationally excited OH(X,v=0) products. Vibrationally excited OH(X) products (up to v=10) and electronically excited OH(A,v=0,1,2) have also been observed. The OH(A)/OH(X) branching ratios are determined to be 17.9% at 244.540 nm (2omega(1)=81,761.4 cm(-1)) and 19.9% at 244.392 nm (2omega(2)=81,811 cm(-1)), which are considerably smaller than the value predicted by the theory.

For wavelengths longer than 75 nm, the D(') (1)Pi(u) (+) and (1)Pi(u) (-) components show a clearly different behavior: Tauhe (1)Pi(u) (+) one dissociates into H(1s)+H(n=2) whereas the (1)Pi(u) (-) one leads to molecular fluorescence.

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists. As yet, the complete set of bound vibrational energy levels is far from being known, experimentally as well as theoretically. In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)\u03a3(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128]. Theory agrees with experiment within 4.5 cm(-1) on average for the four vibrational level spacings that are so far known empirically. In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)\u03a3(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)\u03a3(u)(-) state. The ground state dissociation energy D(0) is predicted to be 23164 cm(-1).",

This cw laser system works at a wavelength of 350 nm with an output power up to 100 mW. The ultraviolet laser beam (diameter \u2248 1 cm) is sent onto the atomic cloud. The laser frequency can be scanned. When the laser frequency passes through the Rydberg transition, we observe the reduction of the resonance fluorescence of the trapped atoms. It is gone down to its partial or complete vanishing depending on the ultraviolet laser beam power and on the quantum number of upper state. For the more reliable determination of the transition frequency, in addition to the CCD camera, we install a photodetector for recoding the fluorescence intensity. The frequency of ultraviolet laser is controlled by a high precision wavemeter WSU (High Finesse Angstrom).

The vibration-rotation energy levels of the perturbed A 2Pi and B' 2Sigma+ states were fitted as individual term values, while those of the X 2Sigma+ ground state were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach. A new analytic potential energy function that imposes the theoretically correct attractive potential at long-range, and a radial Hamiltonian that includes the spin-rotation interaction were employed, and a significantly improved value for the ground state dissociation energy of MgH was obtained. The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The equilibrium dissociation energy for the X 2Sigma+ ground state of 24MgH has been determined to be De=11104.7+/-0.5 cm(-1) (1.37681+/-0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v''=0) is 739.11+/-0.01 cm(-1).

This study shows that the reactivity for this diatom-triatom reaction system is enhanced by vibrational excitations of H2, whereas the vibrational excitations of C2H only have a small effect on the reactivity. Furthermore, the bending excitations of C2H, compared to the ground state reaction probability, hinder the reactivity. The comparison of the rate constant between this calculation and experimental results agrees with each other very well. This comparison indicates that the new modified PES corrects the large barrier height problem in Wang and Bowman's old PES.",

The EEL spectra of N2 have shown rather complicated structures with many of the vibrational sublevels in an excited state overlapping with other vibrational sublevels in different excited states [2]. Thus, spectral deconvolution of the measured EEL spectra are necessary in order to obtain the absolute excitation DCSs, because the energy resolution of the electron spectrometer employed in the present measurements is ~40 meV that is not enough to resolve all of the vibrational sublevels in the final electronic states. The detailed of deconvolution procedure has been reported in ref. [2]. Excitation energies and Franck-Condon factors or relative intensity ratio between initial and final vibrational sublevels were referred in the literatures [6]. The GOSs as a function of the momentum transfer squared, 2 , were transformed from the measured absolute excitation DCSs and the scattering angles at each incident energy. Fitting the experimental GOSs at higher incident energies with the Vriens formula [7], where the Born approximation is satisfied, we obtained the optical oscillator strength (OOS) and apparent Born ICS for the excitation to the b 1 \u03a0u state. The present OOS is compared with the quasi-photon absorption measurement [8].\n\nFinally, BEf-scaled Born ICS for b 1 \u03a0u excitation were estimated from the apparent Born ICS using the excitation and binding energies in the b 1 \u03a0u excited state of N2 for the wide energy range. The comparison of the present BEf-scaled ICS with previous experimental data [9,10] for this excitation, shows good agreement in the low energy region.\n \n. H Tanaka, Rev. Mod. Phys. 8825004H.

For example, a spin particle would have f=2, one for each spin state. For large values of n, the number of states with magnitude of momentum less than or equal to p from the above equation is approximately which is just f times the volume of a sphere of radius n divided by eight since only the octant with positive ni is considered.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Going beyond previous studies, we consider the asymptotic limit of large N , maintaining L finite, using a nonstandard asymptotic technique. We derive an exact expression for rhoT(yT,t|yT,0) for a tagged particle located roughly in the middle of the system, from which we find that there are three time regimes of interest for finite-sized systems: (A) for times much smaller than the collision time t&lt;&lt;taucoll=1/(rho2D) , where rho=N/L is the particle concentration and D is the diffusion constant for each particle, the tagged particle undergoes a normal diffusion; (B) for times much larger than the collision time t &gt;&gt;taucoll but times smaller than the equilibrium time t&lt;&lt;taueq=L2/D, we find a single-file regime where rhoT(yT,t|yT,0) is a Gaussian with a mean-square displacement scaling as t1/2; and (C) for times longer than the equilibrium time t&gt;&gt;taue , rhoT(yT,t|yT,0) approaches a polynomial-type equilibrium probability density function. Notably, only regimes (A) and (B) are found in the previously considered infinite systems.",

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

The spectra give evidence for several electronic transitions in the region between 4000 and 10 000 cm(-1) and provide important information about some excited electronic states of Ti2 in proximity to the ground state. The vibrational fine structure measured for these transitions allowed to calculate the force constants and the anharmonicity of the potential energy curves of the excited states, and to estimate changes in the internuclear Ti-Ti distances relative to the electronic ground state. The quantum chemical studies confirm the previously suggested (3)Delta(g) state as the ground state of Ti2. The equilibrium bond distance is calculated to be 195.4 pm. The calculated harmonic frequency of 432 cm(-1) is in good agreement with the experimental value of 407.0 cm(-1). With the aid of the calculations it was possible to assign the experimentally observed transitions in the region between 4000 and 10 000 cm(-1) to the 1 (3)Pi(u)&lt;--(3)Delta(g), 1 (3)Phi(u)&lt;--(3)Delta(g), 2 (3)Pi(u)&lt;--(3)Delta(g), 2 (3)Phi(u)&lt;--(3)Delta(g), and (3)Delta(u)&lt;--(3)Delta(g) excitations (in the order of increasing energy).

The vibration-rotation energy levels of the perturbed A 2Pi and B' 2Sigma+ states were fitted as individual term values, while those of the X 2Sigma+ ground state were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach. A new analytic potential energy function that imposes the theoretically correct attractive potential at long-range, and a radial Hamiltonian that includes the spin-rotation interaction were employed, and a significantly improved value for the ground state dissociation energy of MgH was obtained. The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The equilibrium dissociation energy for the X 2Sigma+ ground state of 24MgH has been determined to be De=11104.7+/-0.5 cm(-1) (1.37681+/-0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v''=0) is 739.11+/-0.01 cm(-1).

The uncertainty in the new experimental dissociation energy of MgH is more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that for the best value available in the literature.

All available spectroscopic data then provide the basis for generating an accurately determined vibrationally complete semiempirical intermolecular potential function using a four-dimensional potential coordinate morphing methodology. These results are consistent with the existence of four bound isomers: OC-HI, OC-IH, CO-HI, and CO-IH. Analysis also leads to unequivocal characterization of the common isotopic ground state as having the OC-HI structure and with the first excited state having the OC-IH structure with an energy of 3.4683(80) cm(-1) above the ground state. The potential is consistent with the following barriers between the pairs of isomers: 382(4) cm(-1) (OC-IH/OC-HI), 294(5) cm(-1) (CO-IH/CO-HI), 324(3) cm(-1) (OC-IH/CO-IH), and 301(2) cm(-1) (OC-HI/CO-HI) defined with respect to each lower minimum. The potential is also determined to have a linear OC-IH van der Waals global equilibrium minimum structure having R(e)=4.180(11) \u00c5, \u03b8(1)=0.00(1)\u00b0, and \u03b8(2)=0.00(1)\u00b0. This is differentiated from its OC-HI ground state hydrogen bound structure having R(0)=4.895(1) \u00c5, \u03b8(1)=20.48(1)\u00b0, and \u03b8(2)=155.213(1)\u00b0 where the distances are defined between the centers of mass of the monomers and \u03b8(1) and \u03b8(2) as cos(-1)[&lt;cos(2) \u03b8(i)&gt;(1/2)] for i=1 and 2. A fundamentally new molecular phenomenon - ground state isotopic isomerization is proposed based on the generated semiempirical potential. The protonated ground state hydrogen-bonded OC-HI structure is predicted to be converted on deuteration to the corresponding ground state van der Waals OC-ID isomeric structure. This results in a large anomalous isotope effect in which the R(0) center of mass distance between monomeric components changes from 4.895(1) to 4.286(1) \u00c5. Such a proposed isotopic effect is demonstrated to be a consequence of differential zero point energy factors resulting from the shallower nature of hydrogen bonding at a local potential minimum (greater quartic character of the potential) relative to the corresponding van der Waals global minimum. Further consequences of this anomalous deuterium isotope effect are also discussed.",

The calculations were performed using a new parallel computer code, DIFFREALWAVE. The code is based on the real wavepacket approach of Gray and Balint-Kurti [J. Chem. Phys. 108, 950 (1998)]. The calculations are parallelized over the helicity quantum number Omega' (i.e., the quantum number for the body-fixed z component of the total angular momentum) and wavepackets for each J,Omega' set are assigned to different processors, similar in spirit to the Coriolis-coupled processors approach of Goldfield and Gray [Comput. Phys. Commun. 84, 1 (1996)]. Calculations for J=0-24 have been performed to obtain converged state-to-state differential cross sections in the energy range from 0.4 to 1.2 eV. The calculations employ five different potential energy surfaces, the BKMP2 surface and a hierarchical family of four new ab initio surfaces [S. L. Mielke, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 116, 4142 (2002)]. This family of four surfaces has been calculated using three different hierarchical sets of basis functions and also an extrapolation to the complete basis set limit, the so called CCI surface. The CCI surface is the most accurate surface for the H3 system reported to date. Our calculations of differential cross sections are the first to be reported for the A2, A3, A4, and CCI surfaces. They show that there are some small differences in the cross sections obtained from the five different surfaces, particularly at higher energies. The calculations also show that the BKMP2 performs well and gives cross sections in very good agreement with the results from the CCI surface, displaying only small divergences at higher energies.",

The present time-dependent wave-packet calculation takes into account the Coriolis coupling (CC) and uses the accurate ab initio potential-energy surface of Palmieri et al. [Mol.

The importance of including the CC quantum scattering calculation has been revealed by the comparison between the CC calculation and the previous coupled state (CS) calculation. The CC total cross sections for the v = 2, 4, and 6 states show collision energy-dependent behaviors different from those based on the CS calculation. Furthermore, the collision energy dependence of the total cross sections obtained in the present CC calculation only exhibits minor oscillations, indicating that the chance is slim for reactive resonances in total cross sections to survive through the partial-wave averaging. The magnitude and profile of the CC total cross sections for v = 0-2 in the collision energy range of 0.0-2.5 eV are found to be consistent with experimental cross sections obtained recently by Tang et al.

At large internuclear distances R, it dissociates to two separated atoms, one in the ground state and another in the 2p excited state. Radial pair density calculations and natural orbital analyses reveal unusual effect of electron correlation around the K minimum of the potential energy curve. As R&gt;2.0 a.u., a natural orbital of sigma(u) symmetry joins the two natural orbitals of sigma(g) symmetry at smaller R. The average interelectronic distance decreases as the internuclear distance increases from R=2.0 to 3.0 a.u. Around R=3.0 a.u. the singly peaked pair density curve splits into two peaks. The inner peak can be attributed to the formation of the ionic electron configuration (1s)(2), where both 1s electrons are on the same nucleus. As the two 1s electrons run into different nuclei, one of the two 1s electrons is promoted to the 2p state, which results in the outer peak in the pair density curve.

The occurrence of distinctive dynamical behavior at these two energies is analyzed in some detail. An extensive comparison with previous experimental measurements on the Rydberg H atom with D2 molecules has been carried out at the higher collision energy. In particular, the present theoretical results have been employed to perform simulations of the experimental kinetic energy spectra.",

The activation energy for the reaction H 2 +H \u2212\u2192 H+H 2 is defined as the difference between the energy of the H 3 saddle point and that of the well separated H atom and H 2 molecule. Density functional methods are not very accurate in calculating the activation energy. For example, DFT with an LDA functional gives H 3 as a bound molecule with a binding energy of 0.087 eV at the symmetric configuration with R 1 = R 2 = 1.795 Bohr. DFT/GGA, on the other hand, gives a barrier height of 0.152 eV at the symmetric configuration R = 1.767 Bohr [31]. The experimental barrier height is 9.7 kcal/mol= 0.420632 eV [32].\n\nUsing the AF QMC method, we studied the collinear H 3 system for three configurations with R 1 =R 2 =1.600, 1.757, and 1.900 Bohr. Table III shows the calculated barrier heights and compares these to results from DFT/GGA all-electron and pseudopotential calculations, and to results from recent DMC calculations [29]. The AE and pseudopotential DFT/GGA results are in excellent agreement with each other, a further indication of the good quality of the H pseudopotential. The DMC calculations [29] are exact in this case, through the use of a cancellation scheme [9,33], which is very effective at eliminating the sign problem for small systems. The AF QMC values are in good agreement with the exact calculated results.",

The results for calculations (iii) and (iv) are in very close agreement, showing that the upper electronic state makes only a very small contribution to the state-to-state dynamics, even at energies much higher than the conical intersection minimum (at 2.74 eV). At total energies above 3.5 eV, many of the state-to-state reaction probabilities show strong GP effects, indicating that they are dominated by interference between one- and two-transition-state (1-TS and 2-TS) reaction paths. These effects survive the coherent sum over partial waves to produce features in the state-to-state differential cross sections which could be detected in an experiment with an angular resolution of approximately 20 degrees . Efficient dephasing of the interference between the 1-TS and 2-TS contributions causes almost complete cancellation of the GP in the integral cross sections, thus continuing a trend observed at lower energies in earlier work.",

Six bands were rotationally resolved and analyzed to obtain ground and excited state rotational constants and bond lengths. Spectra for six OsC isotopomers, 192 Os 12C (40.3% natural abundance), 190 Os 12C(26.0%), 189 Os 12C(16.0%), 188 Os 12C(13.1%), 187 Os 12C(1.9%), and 186 Os 12C(1.6%), were recorded and rotationally analyzed. The ground state was found to be X 3 Delta 3, deriving from the 4 delta 3 16 sigma 1 electronic configuration. Four bands were found to originate from the X 3 Delta 3 ground state, giving B 0\"=0.533 492(33) cm(-1) and r 0 \"=1.672 67(5) A for the 192 Os 12C isotopomer (1 sigma error limits); two of these, the 0-0[19.1]2&lt;--X 3 Delta 3 and 1-0[19.1]2&lt;--X 3 Delta 3 bands, form a vibrational progression with Delta G' 1/2=953.019 cm(-1). The remaining two bands were identified as originating from an Omega\"=0 level that remains populated in the supersonic expansion. This level is assigned as the low-lying A 3 Sigma 0+ (-) state, which derives from the 4 delta 2 16 sigma 2 electronic configuration. The OsC molecule differs from the isovalent RuC molecule in having an X 3 Delta 3 ground state, rather than the X 2 delta 4, 1 Sigma+ ground state found in RuC. This difference in electronic structure is due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbital in Os, an effect which favors occupation of the 6s-like 16 sigma orbital. The relativistic stabilization of the 16 sigma orbital also lowers the energy of the 4 delta 2 16 sigma 2, 3 Sigma(-) term, allowing this term to remain populated in the supersonically cooled molecular beam.",

The characteristics of the estimated Lambda-doubling splitting constants (q(0), q(v), and mu) with n(= 5-8) of the nd (1)Delta(g) series have been explored. Detailed investigations reveal that the nd (1)Delta(g)(n = 6-8) states involve L uncoupling from the internuclear axis and each of these states is affected by an asymmetric perturbation caused by the up and down adjacent states. The rotational-branch intensity and position anomalies in the observed spectra of the nd (1)Delta(g) series (n = 5-8) of Na(2) lead to the conclusion that due to the effects of the L-uncoupling perturbations, the same l complexes approaching the same ion-core limits result in the same l-mixing processes which lead to the formation of the supercomplexes due to the anisotropy of the molecular-ion [Na(2)(+)(3s)] field.

The potential function yields an accurate representation of spectroscopic data that span 99.24% of the well depth and the number of fitted parameters is significantly less than half the number of parameters determined in conventional Dunham analyses. A novel variant of the Morse/long-range potential model has been employed in the representation of the ground state potential, and a critical comparison has been made with an extended modified Lennard-Jones potential model. Proper account has been taken of the known long-range van der Waals form of the potential, and our final potential function is determined with constrained literature values of the C(8) and C(10) dispersion energy coefficients, along with a fitted value of C(6)=3.31(5) x 10(7) cm(-1) A(6)=6870(100) a.u.

These processes represent important steps in a model that explains the enhanced 4.3 microm emission from CO(2) in the nocturnal mesosphere. The calculated energy transfer is mediated by weak long-range dipole-quadrupole interaction. The results of this calculation are very sensitive to the strength of the two transition moments. Because of the long range of the intermolecular potential, the resonance function, a measure of energy that can be efficiently exchanged between translation and vibration-rotation degrees of freedom, is rather narrow. A narrow resonance function coupled with the large rotational constant of OH is shown to render the results of the calculation very sensitive to the rotational distribution, or the rotational temperature if one exists, of this molecule. The calculations are carried out in the first and second orders of perturbation theory with the latter shown to give ET probabilities that are an order of magnitude larger than the former. The reasons for the difference in magnitude and temperature dependence of the first- and second-order calculations are discussed. The results of the calculations are compared with room temperature measurements as well as with an earlier calculation. Our calculated results are in good agreement with the room temperature measurements for the transfer of vibrational energy for the exothermic OH(nu=9) ET process but are about an order lower than the room temperature measurements for the exothermic OH(nu=8) ET process. The cause of this discrepancy is explored.

Linear arrangements of atoms are described using a dummy atom of infinite mass. The procedure has been automated in FORTRAN90 and its main advantage lies in the nontrivial reduction of the number of single-point energy calculations needed for the construction of the Hessian matrix when compared to the corresponding number using double differentiation in Cartesian coordinates. For molecules of C1 symmetry the computational savings in the energy calculations amount to 36N - 30, where N is the number of atoms, with additional savings when symmetry is present. Typical applications for small and medium size molecules in their minimum and transition state geometries as well as hydrogen bonded clusters (water dimer and trimer) are presented.

The primary relaxation pathway is towards local translation, followed by energy transfer to rotation through hindered-to-free rotational transitions. Free-to-free rotational transitions are found to be unimportant. All pathways are accompanied by the propagation of energy to argon phonon modes. The deexcitation probability of OH(v=1) is 1.3 x 10(-7) and the rate constant is 4.7 x 10(5) s(-1) between 4 and 10 K. The negligible temperature dependence is attributed to the presence of intermolecular attraction (&gt;&gt;kT) in the guest-host encounter, which counteracts the T(2) dependence resulting from local translation.

This statement is quantified by examining the ratio of Q V T (T vibr ) taken from the simulations and Q V T (T vibr ) obtained with (23). For T =300..600 K this ratio always lies between 0.4 and 1.5. These maximum and minimum are taken over the all modelling runs of section 4 including those with varied T e , p max SSH and f s V V (only points with T vibr > T +100 K are considered). For higher T the upper boundary (maximum) of the ratio above is increased: up to 2.4 for T =800 K and up to 3.4 for T =1000 K. Nonetheless, even in those cases (23) can always be taken as a good order of magnitude estimate. This is an expected result since vibrational distribution function of the lower vibrational levels in the gas discharge simulations was found to be close to Boltzmann, see an example in [15]. The populations of the upper levels near the dissociation limit deviate strongly from the Boltzmann distribution. However, since their populations are relatively small the high energy tail they form has no overwhelming impact on the total energy exchange rate.\n\nAt constant T the term (23) monotonically increases with increased E vibr so that with Q diss =0 the solution of (22) would finally arrive at some required stationary value E * vibr determined by the equality Q = Q V T (T, E * vibr ). Since only the very beginning of the conversion process is considered it can be taken that n = n M = n 0 , where n 0 is the initial value before the process starts. Then the threshold (critical) value of Q/n 2 0 which corresponds to certain E * vibr is readily found as:\nQ n 2 0 crit = R V T (T ) [E * vibr \u2212 E eq vibr (T )](25)\nThe criterion (25) has a simple physics meaning. For the vibrationally non-equilibrium process to start the rate of producing the vibrationally excited states has to be at least as fast as the rate with which vibrational energy is transferred into translationalrotational modes.",

J. McCaffery and R. J. Marsh, J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234310 (2013)] revealed an unexpected energy partitioning in which the H2 vibrational temperature greatly exceeds that of rotation. This occurs despite rotation and vibration distributions being close to Boltzmann from early in ensemble evolution. In this work, the study is extended to include H2 (0;0), O2 (0;0), and HF (0;0) in a wide range of atomic bath gases comprising some 22 ensembles in all. Translation-to-internal energy conversion in the systems studied was found to be relatively inefficient, falling approximately with (\u221a\u03bc')(-1) as bath gas mass increases, where \u03bc' is the reduced mass of the diatomic-bath gas pair. In all 22 systems studied, T(v) exceeds T(r)--by a factor &gt; 4 for some pairs. Analysis of the constraints that influence (0;0) \u2192 (1;j) excitation for each diatomic-atom pair in momentum-angular momentum space demonstrates that a vibrational preference results from energy constraints that limit permitted collision trajectories to those of low effective impact parameter, i.e., to those that are axial or near axial on impact with the Newton surface. This implies that a steric constraint is an inherent feature of vibration-rotation excitation and arises because momentum and energy barriers must be overcome before rotational states may be populated in the higher vibrational level.",

For the vibrational energy transfer (VET) measurements, the time-resolved fluorescence of the B-X(0,0) band is monitored following the (1,0) band excitation. For the rotational energy transfer (RET) measurements, the laser-induced fluorescence of the initially populated state is dispersed using a step-scan Fourier transform spectrometer. The time-resolved spectra obtained in the nanosecond regime may yield the RET information under a single pressure of the collider. The rate constants of intramolecular energy transfers are evaluated with simulation of kinetic models. The VET lies in the range of 4x10(-12) to 4x10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), with efficiency following the order of Ar&lt;CO&lt;N(2)O, reflecting the average over Boltzmann rotational distribution. The RET rates are more rapid by one to two orders of magnitude, comparable to the gas kinetic, with the trend of Ar&lt;CO&lt;N(2)O. The transfer rates decrease with increasing N and DeltaN, proceeding via the DeltaN=-1 transitions slightly larger than DeltaN=+1. With the fine-structure labels resolved up to N=6, the fine-structure-conserving collisions prevail increasingly with increasing N in DeltaN not equal 0. The rate constants for the F(2)--&gt;F(1) transitions are larger than the reverse F(1)--&gt;F(2) transitions in DeltaN=0 for the Ar and CO collisions. The trend of fine-structure conservation is along the order of N(2)O&lt;CO approximately Ar. For the CH-Ar collisions, the fine-structure conservation is less pronounced as compared with the v=0 level reported previously. In general, the propensity rules obeyed in the v=0 collision with Ar are valid in v=1, but the latter case shows a weaker tendency. It might be caused by the anisotropy difference of interaction potential when vibrational excitation is considered. For the polyatomic collider, the strong long-range dipole-dipole interaction may have the chance to vary the rotational orientation to increase the fine-structure-changing transitions.",

The principal focus is on the vibronic contributions, and the correlated distortions of the bipyridine ligand in the emitting MLCT excited state. To address the issues that are involved, the emission band shape at 77 K is interpreted as the sum of a fundamental component, corresponding to the {e,0'} --&gt; {g,0} transition, and progressions in the ground-state vibrational modes that correlate with the excited-state distortion. Literature values of the vibrational parameters determined from the resonance-Raman (rR) for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ are used to model the emission spectra and to evaluate the spectral analysis. The Gaussian fundamental component with an energy Ef and bandwidth Deltanu1/2 is deconvoluted from the observed emission spectrum. The first-, second-, and third-order terms in the progressions of the vibrational modes that contribute to the band shape are evaluated as the sums of Gaussian-shaped contributions of width Deltanu1/2. The fundamental and the rR parameters give an excellent fit of the observed emission spectrum of [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+, but not as good for the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ emission spectrum probably because the Franck-Condon excited state probed by the rR is different in symmetry from the emitting MLCT excited state. Variations in vibronic contributions for the series of complexes are evaluated in terms of reorganizational energy profiles (emreps, Lambdax) derived from the observed spectra, and modeled using the rR parameters. This modeling demonstrates that most of the intensity of the vibronic envelopes obtained from the frozen solution emission spectra arises from the overlapping of first-order vibronic contributions of significant bandwidth with additional convoluted contributions of higher order vibronic terms. The emrep amplitudes of these complexes have their maxima at about 1500 cm(-1) in frozen solution, and Lambdax(max) decreases systematically by approximately 2-fold as Ef decreases from 17,220 for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to 12,040 cm(-1) for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ through the series of complexes. Corrections for higher order contributions and bandwidth differences based on the modeling with rR parameters indicate that the variations in Lambdax(max) imply somewhat larger decreases in first-order bpy vibrational reorganizational energies. The large attenuation of vibrational reorganizational energies of the [Ru(Am)6-2n(bpy)n]2+ complexes contrasts with the apparent similarity of reorganizational energy amplitudes for the absorption and emission of [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+. These observations are consistent with increasing and very substantial excited-state/ground-state configurational mixing and decreasing excited-state distortion as Ef decreases, but more severe attenuation for singlet/singlet than triplet/singlet mixing (alphage &gt; alphaeg for the configurational mixing coefficients at the ground-state and excited-state potential energy minima, respectively); it is inferred that 0.18 &gt; or = alphage2 &gt; or = 0.09 for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and 0.37 &gt; or = alphage2 &gt; or = 0.18 for [Ru(NH3)4bpy]2+ in DMSO/water glasses, where the ranges are based on models that there is or is not a spin restriction on configurational mixing (alphage &gt; alphaeg and alphage = alphaeg), respectively, for these complexes.",

(J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 034312) was used in accurate calculations of the vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) levels of (H2O)2 and (D2O)2 involving the intermolecular rovibrational and tunneling states as well as the intramolecular vibrations. For the intermolecular VRT levels we used a 6 + 6d model in which the fast intramolecular vibrations are adiabatically separated from the much slower intermolecular vibrations, tunneling motions, and overall rotations. We also tested two six-dimensional (6d) rigid monomer models in which the monomers were frozen either at their equilibrium geometry or at their ground state vibrationally averaged geometry. All the results from the 6 + 6d model agree well with the large amount of detailed experimental data available from high-resolution spectroscopy. For most of the parameters characterizing the spectra the results of the two 6d rigid monomer models do not significantly differ from the 6 + 6d results. An exception is the relatively large acceptor tunneling splitting, which was the only quantity for which the 6d model with the monomers frozen at their equilibrium geometry was not in good agreement with the experimental data. The 6d model with monomers at their vibrationally averaged geometry performs considerably better, and the full 6 + 6d results agree with the measurements also for this quantity. For the excited intramolecular vibrations we tested two 6 + 6d models. In the first model the excitation was assumed to be either on the donor in the hydrogen bond or on the acceptor, and to hop from one monomer to the other upon donor-acceptor interchange. In the second model the monomer excitation remains localized on a given monomer for all dimer geometries. Almost the same frequencies of the intramolecular vibrations were found for the two models. The calculations show considerable variations in the frequencies of the intramolecular modes for transitions involving different tunneling levels and different values of the rotational quantum number K. For K = 0 --&gt; 0 transitions these variations largely cancel, however. A comparison with experimental data is difficult, except for the acceptor asymmetric stretch mode observed in high-resolution spectra, because it is not clear how much the different transitions contribute to the (unresolved) peaks in most of the experimental spectra. The large red shift of the donor bound OH stretch mode is correctly predicted, but the value calculated for this red shift is too small by more than 20%. Also in the smaller shifts of the other modes we find relatively large errors. It is useful, however, that our detailed calculations including all ground and excited state tunneling levels provide an explanation for the splitting of the acceptor asymmetric stretch band observed in He nanodroplet spectra, as well as for the fact that the other bands in these spectra show much smaller or no splittings.",

The reaction, forming NO(+)+C(2)H(2)O and NO+C(2)H(2)O(+), shows a bimodal dependence on collision energy (E(col)). At low E(col), the reaction is quite inefficient (&lt;2%) despite this being a barrierless, exoergic reaction, and is strongly inhibited by E(col). For E(col)&gt; approximately 0.5 eV, a second mechanism turns on, with an efficiency reaching approximately 27% for E(col)&gt;3 eV. The two reaction channels have nearly identical dependence on E(col) and NO(2)(+) vibrational state, and identical recoil dynamics, leading to the conclusion that they represent a single reaction path throughout most of the collision. All modes of NO(2)(+) vibrational excitation enhance both channels at all E(col), however, the effects of bend (010) and bend overtone (02(0)0) excitation are particularly strong (factor of 4). In contrast, the asymmetric stretch (001), which intuition suggests should be coupled to the reaction coordinate, leads to only a factor of approximately 2 enhancement, as does the symmetric stretch (100). Perhaps the most surprising effect is that of the bending angular momentum, which strongly suppress reaction, even though both the energy and angular momentum involved are tiny compared to the collision energy and angular momentum. The results are interpreted in light of ab initio and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus calculations.",

The calculated time constants describing energy flow out of the torsional mode are &lt;10 ps for classical vibrational energies near the classical reaction threshold energy (approximately 75 kcal mol(-1)) and greater. It is found that the rate of decay from the torsion largely depends on the amount of energy in the other vibrational modes. Analysis using power spectra shows that the torsional mode in TFE is strongly coupled to the other vibrational modes.

Specifically, competing H-bond structures (HBSs) may differ in the quantitative proportion between one-point and multiple-point H-bond connections. For an assessment of such HBSs, the effects of their internal as well as external (packing) interactions need to be taken into consideration. The semi-classical density sums (SCDS-PIXEL) method, which enables the calculation of interaction energies for molecule-molecule pairs, was used to investigate six polymorphs of phenobarbital (Pbtl) with different quantitative proportions of one-point and two-point H-bond connections. The structures of polymorphs V and VI of Pbtl were determined from single crystal data. Two-point H-bond connections are inherently inflexible in their geometry and lie within a small PIXEL energy range (-45.7 to -49.7\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol(-1)). One-point H-bond connections are geometrically less restricted and subsequently show large variations in their dispersion terms and total energies (-23.1 to -40.5\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol(-1)). The comparison of sums of interaction energies in small clusters containing only the strongest intermolecular interactions showed an advantage for compact HBSs with multiple-point connections, whereas alternative HBSs based on one-point connections may enable more favourable overall packing interactions (i.e. V vs. III). Energy penalties associated with experimental intramolecular geometries relative to the global conformational energy minimum were calculated and used to correct total PIXEL energies. The estimated order of stabilities (based on PIXEL energies) is III\u00a0&gt;\u00a0I\u00a0&gt;\u00a0II\u00a0&gt;\u00a0VI\u00a0&gt;\u00a0X\u00a0&gt;\u00a0V, with a difference of just 1.7\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol(-1) between the three most stable forms. For an analysis of competing HBSs, one has to consider the contributions from internal H-bond and non-H-bond interactions, from the packing of multiple HBS instances and intramolecular energy penalties. A compact HBS based on multiple-point H-bond connections should typically lead to more packing alternatives and ultimately to a larger number of viable low-energy structures than a competing one-point HBS (i.e. dimer vs. catemer). Coulombic interaction energies associated with typical short intermolecular C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O contact geometries are small in comparison with dispersion effects associated with the packing complementary molecular shapes.Graphical abstractCompeting H-bond motifs can differ markedly in their energy contributions.",

Energetics and HF vibrational frequency shifts from diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on additive and nonadditive potential-energy surfaces for n=1-12.\nThe ground-state energies and HF vibrational frequency shifts of Ar(n)HF clusters have been calculated on the nonadditive potential-energy surfaces (PESs) for n=2-7 and on the pairwise-additive PESs for the clusters with n=1-12, using the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method. For n&gt;3, the calculations have been performed for the lowest-energy isomer and several higher-lying isomers which are the closest in energy. They provide information about the isomer dependence of the HF redshift, and enable direct comparison with the experimental data recently obtained in helium nanodroplets. The agreement between theory and experiment is excellent, in particular, for the nonadditive DMC redshifts. The relative, incremental redshifts are reproduced accurately even at the lower level of theory, i.e., the DMC and quantum five-dimensional (rigid Ar(n)) calculations on the pairwise-additive PESs. The nonadditive interactions make a significant contribution to the frequency shift, on the order of 10%-12%, and have to be included in the PESs in order for the theory to yield accurate magnitude of the HF redshift. The energy gaps between the DMC ground states of the cluster isomers are very different from the energy separation of their respective minima on the PES, due to the considerable variations in the intermolecular zero-point energy of different Ar(n)HF isomers.",

First, a set of 148 collision cross sections is calculated as a function of the collision energy at the converged close-coupled level via the MOLSCAT code, using a recent potential energy surface for N(2)-N(2). Then, the corresponding rates for the range of 2 &lt; or = T &lt; or = 50 K are derived from the cross sections. The link between theory and experiment, aimed at assessing the calculated rates, is a master equation which accounts for the time evolution of rotational populations in a reference volume of gas in terms of the collision rates. In the experiment, the evolution of rotational populations is measured by Raman spectroscopy in a tiny reference volume (approximately 2 x 10(-3) mm(3)) of N(2) traveling along the axis of a supersonic jet. The calculated collisional rates are assessed experimentally in the range of 4 &lt; or = T &lt; or = 35 K by means of the master equation, and then are scaled by averaging over a large set of experimental data.

Seven of these compounds have not been studied before. The compounds are arranged in seven groups, which illustrate different cases of the internal heavy atom effect. The quantum yield of fluorescence, gamma and fluorescence decay time, tau(f) of deaerated and non-deaerated cyclohexane or ethanol solutions are measured. The oscillator strength, f(e), fluorescence rate constant, k(f), natural lifetime, tau(0)t, and intersystem crossing rate constant, kST, were calculated for each compound. The orbital nature of the lowest excited singlet state and direction of polarization of the S0 --&gt; S1 transitions are determined using the PPP-Cl method for each molecule. The investigation shows that substitution of a heavy atom(s) (Cl, S, Br, I etc.) into an aromatic or heteroaromatic molecule may produce different changes in all the fluorescence parameters (sometimes dramatically) and not necessarily lead to the quenching of fluorescence. Substitution of a heavy atom(s) may increase the value of the spin-orbit operator, Hso, if the S0 --&gt; S1 excitation is localized to some extent on a carbon atom bonded to a heavy atom(s) or on the heavy atom itself (O or S). Such substitution may change the symmetry of a molecule and hence the values of the [psiS1/Hso/psi'T1] matrix elements would change (in molecules of higher symmetry groups not all Ti states are able to mix with the perturbing S1 state). Such substitution may change the arrangement of Ti states below the S1, state and hence, the Franck-Condon factors would change. Such substitution may also change the value of the [psiS0/Mj/psiS1] matrix element and, consequently, the oscillator strength of the S0 --&gt; S1 transition would change. A combination of all these possible changes determines the value of k(f) and kST and, consequently, determines the value of gamma and tau(f). It is observed that in many cases, the value of the spin-orbit operator is related to the dipole moment operator, e.g. if the introduction of a heavy atom increases kST then, as a rule, it decreases f(e)(1A --&gt; 1La).",

From the kinetics point of view, the forward and reverse thermal rate constants and the activation energies were calculated using the variational transition-state theory with semiclassical transmission coefficients over a wide temperature range of 150-2500 K. The theoretical results reproduce the available experimental data, with a small curvature of the Arrhenius plot which indicates the role of tunneling in this hydrogen abstraction reaction. A dynamics study was also performed on this PES using quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations, including corrections to avoid zero-point energy leakage along the trajectories. First, we found a noticeable internal energy in the coproduct methyl radical, both in the ground-state [CH4 (v=0)] and vibrationally excited [CH4 (v=1)] reactions. This CH3 internal energy was directly precluded in some experiments or oversimplified in previous theoretical studies using pseudotriatomic models. Second, our QCT calculations give HCl rotational distributions slightly hotter than those in experiment, but correctly describing the experimental trend of decreasing the HCl product rotation excitation in going from HCl (v'=0) to HCl (v'=1) for the CH4 (v=1) reaction. Third, the state specific scattering distributions present a reasonable agreement with experiment, although they tend to make the reaction more forward and backward scattered than found experimentally probably because of the hotter rotational distribution and the deficiencies of the QCT methods.",

The vibrational levels of RbH(X1sigma+,v\" = 0-2) generated in the reaction of Rb(6D) with H2. Vibrational-state-specific total-removal relaxation rate coefficients, k(v) (M), for RbH(X1sigma+, v\" = 15-22) by M = H2 and N2 were investigated in a pump and probe configuration. By the overtone pumping with a cw diode laser, highly vibrational states v\" = 15-22 of RbH in its ground electronic state were obtained. Another diode laser was used to probe the prepared vibrational state. The decay signal of laser induced time-resolved fluorescence from A 1sigma+ (v') --&gt; X1sigma+ (v\") transition was monitored. Based on the Stern-Volmer equation, the total relaxation rate coefficient k(v) (H2) were yielded. A plot of k(v) (H2 + N2) vs alpha (mole fraction H2) yields a line with a slope of k(v) (H2)-k(v) (N2) and an intercept of k(v) (N2). The values of k(v) (H2) obtained from the slope of the fitted lines compare well with determined values of the k(v) (H2) from the Sern-Volmer plots. At v\" &lt; 18, the rate coefficients k(v) (M) increases linearly with vibrational quantum number. This linear region is dominated by single quantum relaxation (deltav = 1) collisional propensity rules. The region (v\" &gt; or = 18) where the dependence is much stronger than linear shows significant contribution from multiquantum (deltav &gt; or = 2) relaxation or resonant vibration-vibration energy transfer between highly vibrationally excited RbH and H2 or N2. For RbH(v\") + N2 (0), we measured the time-profile of v\" = 16 after preparation of v\" = 21. A clear bimodal distribution was observed. The first peak is due to resonant vibration-vibration energy transfer: RbH (v\" = 21) + N2 (0) --&gt; RbH (v\" = 16) + N2 (1). The much broader second peak, at longer time delays, is due to sequential single-quantum relaxation. Although the second process results in a distribution that is much more spread out in time, the peak height is in the same order of magnitude, indicating that the two processes are at least comparable in probability.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe other three quantum numbers, $n, l$, and $m_{l}$, are properties of specific atomic orbitals that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located. Orbitals are a result of solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for electrons in atoms. The electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states. One is termed the $\\alpha$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being in the positive direction of the $z$ axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number $m_{s}=\\frac{1}{2}$.

The expressions apply to general spin centers and arbitrary excitation geometry (Voigt, Faraday, and intermediate). They work for linear and circular polarized as well as unpolarized excitation, and for crystals and powders. The expressions are based on the concept of the (complex) magnetic transition dipole moment vector. Using the new theory, we determine the parities of ground and excited spin states of highspin (S = 5/2) Fe III in hemin from the polarization dependence of experimental ground state EPR line intensities. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a spectroscopic technique that yields unique information on structural [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], magnetic [8][9][10] and electronic properties [11][12][13] of paramagnetic states in material systems ranging from proteins to nanomagnets and semiconductors. In addition, EPR methods are increasingly used for controlled manipulation of spin systems, which may form the basis of spin quantum computing [14][15][16][17]. Experimental design, interpretation, prediction and control of the latter require general theoretical tools to calculate EPR transition energies and probabilities. These properties are determined by the spin center under study and the choice of the experimental parameters.\n\nIn a standard EPR experiment, linearly polarized lowfrequency microwave (mw) radiation is coupled into a resonator exposed to a static magnetic field B 0 such that the radiation magnetic field component B 1 (t) of the ensuing standing wave is perpendicular to B 0 . With a linear detector, the measured EPR spectral intensity is proportional to the power absorbed by the sample, which in turn is proportional to the quantum mechanical transition rate. For this standard geometry, compact expressions for the EPR transition rate can be found in the literature [18,19]. Analytical expressions for a single spin without fine or hyperfine interactions are known [20][21][22][23][24][25].",

A34, 909-921] in experimental X-ray charge-density studies makes use of real spherical harmonics when describing the angular component of aspherical deformations of the atomic electron density in molecules and crystals. The analytical form of the density-normalized Cartesian spherical harmonic functions for up to l \u2264 7 and the corresponding normalization coefficients were reported previously by Paturle &amp; Coppens [Acta Cryst. (1988), A44, 6-7]. It was shown that the analytical form for normalization coefficients is available primarily for l \u2264 4 [Hansen &amp; Coppens, 1978; Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988; Coppens (1992). International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. B, Reciprocal space, 1st ed., edited by U. Shmueli, ch. 1.2. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Coppens (1997). X-ray Charge Densities and Chemical Bonding. New York: Oxford University Press]. Only in very special cases it is possible to derive an analytical representation of the normalization coefficients for 4 &lt; l \u2264 7 (Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988). In most cases for l &gt; 4 the density normalization coefficients were calculated numerically to within seven significant figures. In this study we review the literature on the density-normalized spherical harmonics, clarify the existing notations, use the Paturle-Coppens (Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988) method in the Wolfram Mathematica software to derive the Cartesian spherical harmonics for l \u2264 20 and determine the density normalization coefficients to 35 significant figures, and computer-generate a Fortran90 code. The article primarily targets researchers who work in the field of experimental X-ray electron density, but may be of some use to all who are interested in Cartesian spherical harmonics. ",

The PES contains a first-order saddle point, (CH(4)- -F)(SP), separating reactants from products, and also minima describing the van der Waals complexes, (CH(4)- - -F)(vdW) and (CH(3)- - -HF)(vdW), in the entrance and exit channels, respectively. The structures of these stationary points, as well as those of the reactants and products have been computed and the corresponding energies have been determined using basis set extrapolation techniques considering (a) electron correlation beyond the CCSD(T) level, (b) effects of the scalar relativity and the spin-orbit couplings, (c) diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (DBOC), and (d) zero-point vibrational energies and thermal correction to the enthalpy at 298 K. The resulting saddle point barrier and ground state vibrationally adiabatic barrier heights (V(SP) and V(VAGS)), dissociation energy of (CH(3)- - -HF)(vdW) (D(e) and D(0)), and the reaction enthalpy (DeltaH(e) ( degrees ), DeltaH(0) ( degrees ), and DeltaH(298) ( degrees )) are (240+/-40 and 245+/-200 cm(-1)), (1070+/-10 and 460+/-50 cm(-1)), and (-10000+/-50, -11200+/-80, and -11000+/-80 cm(-1)), respectively. Variational vibrational calculations have been carried out for (CH(3)- - -HF)(vdW) in full (12) dimensions. Quasiclassical trajectory calculations of the reaction using the new PES are reported. The computed HF vibrational and rotational distributions are in excellent agreement with experiment.",

The Ca+HCl--&gt;CaCl+H reaction is endothermic by 5100 cm(-1) with a barrier of 4470 cm(-1) at bent geometry, taking the zero energy in the Ca+HCl asymptote. On both sides of this barrier are potential wells at linear geometries, a shallow one due to van der Waals interactions in the entrance channel, and a deep one attributed to the H(-)Ca(++)Cl(-) ionic configuration. The accuracy of the van der Waals well depth, approximately 200 cm(-1), was checked by means of additional calculations at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples level and it was concluded that previous empirical estimates are unrealistic. Also, the electric dipole function was calculated, analytically fitted in the regions of the two wells, and used to analyze the charge shifts along the reaction path. In the insertion well, 16,800 cm(-1) deep, the electric dipole function confirmed the ionic structure of the HCaCl complex and served to estimate effective atomic charges. Finally, bound rovibrational levels were computed both in the van der Waals well and in the insertion well, and the infrared-absorption spectrum of the insertion complex was simulated in order to facilitate its detection.",

One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the $n=1$ orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is\nsaid to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher $n$ value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 3.15).\n\nSince Bohr's model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Be}^{3+}$, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which $Z$ is the nuclear charge ( +1 for hydrogen, +2 for $\\mathrm{He},+3$ for Li , and so on) and $k$ has a value of $2.179 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{k Z^{2}}{n^{2}}\n$$",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

Dosimetric Characteristics.\nTo study the dosimetric characteristics of a commercial three-dimensional water scanner (3D SCANNER, Sun Nuclear Corp). The novel cylindrical scanner uses a compact electrometer mounted on the side of the tank, eliminating the need for chamber extension cables. The electrometer has a wide dynamic range, requiring no gain adjustment as scanning conditions change, e.g., field size, dose rate, wedge field, etc. Measurements from the 3D SCANNER were compared against those from another commercial scanner (Blue Phantom, IBA Dosimetry). Comparable collection intervals and scanning speeds were used on both systems. Profile and depth measurements were performed for open field beams (6 and 18 MV; 10-cm and 30-cm squared fields; depths of dmax, 10, and 30 cm) and wedged fields (6 and 18 MV; 30-cm squared field; depth of 10 cm). Electron beam profile and depth measurements were performed for a 20-cm squared applicator (6, 12, and 20 MeV; depth of dmax). The root mean square (RMS) values were determined for each scanner's measurements. The measured field sizes were within 0.06 cm and 0.05 cm for photon and electron beams, respectively. The photon D10/D20 ratios differed by &lt; 0.4% and the electron I50 values were within 0.02 cm. The RMS of the profiles was approximately 0.1% for both the 3D SCANNER and Blue Phantom measurements. Between the two scanners, all measurements agreed within RMS, excluding the penumbra region. Two exceptions occurred: a 0.5% difference was observed in the shoulder of the 12 MeV profiles, and a 0.8% difference was observed in the 6 MeV depth measurements near the surface. The quality of the scanned profile and depth measurements from the 3D SCANNER is comparable to that of another commercial scanner. Both scanning systems have similar levels of scanning noise.

The computed potential energy surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3 with symbols connected by filled lines. The ab initio calculations reveal a global minimum on the 1 2 B 2 state (in C 2v symmetry) at the obtuse geometry Q s = 3.2 a.u. and Q x = \u22120.4 a.u.. This corresponds to a bond length of 2.77\u00c5 and an angle of 73 \u2022 . The potential energy surface of the 1 2 A 1 electronic state has a local minima at the acute geometry Q s = 3.2 a.u. and Q x = 0.3 a.u., corresponding to a bond length of 3.08\u00c5 and a bond angle of 51 \u2022 . The minima of the two lowest electronic states are separated by the conical intersection at the totally symmetric configuration. When the symmetric stretch normal mode coordinate Q s is varied, a conical intersection seam at Q x = Q y = 0 a.u. is formed.

Sensitivity to symmetry and spin forbidden transitions as well as correlations to the triplet states of benzene make it possible to ascribe the main features, below 7 eV in the electronic part of the EEL spectrum, to triplet transitions. The lowest EEL feature with an energy onset at 3.5 eV is attributed to a transition to the (3)B(1)(n--&gt;pi(*)) valence electronic state and the next triplet n--&gt;pi(*) transition to a (3)A(2) state located around 4.5 eV. The remaining EEL features at 4.3, 5.2, 5.8, and 6.5 eV are all assigned to pi--&gt;pi(*) transitions to states of symmetry (3)B(2), (3)A(1), (3)B(2), and (3)B(2)+(3)A(1), respectively. The most intense maximum at 7.6 eV is found to correspond to both (1)B(2) and (1)A(1) transitions, as in the vacuum ultraviolet spectra. Absolute inelastic cross sections per scatterer are derived from a single collision treatment described herein. Their values are found to lie within the 10(-17) cm(2) range for both the electronic and the vibrational excitations. Features in the energy dependence of the cross sections are discussed, whenever possible, by comparison with data and mechanisms found in the gas phase. A maximum over the 4-5 eV range is attributed to a B (2)B(1) shape resonance and another one observed in the 6-7 eV range is ascribed to either or both sigma(*) shape resonances of (2)A(1) and (2)B(2) symmetries.",

Plots of &lt;r(-3)N&gt;(HOMO) and &lt;r(-3)N&gt;(LUMO) versus Q(N) (N=Se, S, and O) at the HF and MP2 levels are analyzed as two correlations. However, the plots at the DFT level can be analyzed as single correlation. A regression curve is assumed for the analysis. Behaviors of &lt;r(-3)N&gt; clarify how valence orbitals shrink or expand depending on Q(N). The applicability of &lt;r(-3)N&gt; is examined to establish a new method that enables us to analyze chemical shifts with the charge effect separately from others. A utility program derived from the Gaussian 03 (NMRANAL-NH03G) is applied to evaluate &lt;r(-3)N&gt; and examine the applicability to the NMR analysis.",

The PES is a precise fit to 36173 coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations of electronic energies done using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The fit uses a polynomial basis that is invariant with respect to permutation of the five H atoms, and thus describes all 120 equivalent minima. The rms fitting error is 78.1 cm(-1) for the entire data set of energies up to 30,000 cm(-1) and a normal-mode analysis of CH(5)(+) also verifies the accuracy of the fit. Two saddle points have been located on the surface as well and compared with previous theoretical work. The PES dissociates correctly to the fragments CH(3)(+) + H(2) and the equilibrium geometry and normal-mode analyses of these fragments are also presented. Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations are done for the zero-point energies of CH(5)(+) (and some isotopologs) as well as for the separated fragments of CH(5)(+), CH(3)(+) + H(2) and those of CH(4)D(+), CH(3)(+) + HD and CH(2)D(+) + H(2). Values of D(0) are reported for these dissociations. A molecular dynamics calculation of CH(4)D(+) dissociation at one total energy is also performed to both validate the applicability of the PES for dynamics studies as well as to test a simple classical statistical prediction of the branching ratio of the dissociation products.",

It is difficult to obtain a relation between R50 and Eo for all electrons at the surface because the number of scattered lower-energy electrons varies with the machine design. However, using only direct electrons to calculate Eo, there is a relationship which is in close agreement with that calculated using monoenergetic beams by Rogers and Bielajew [Med. Phys. 13, 687-694 (1986)]. We show that the empirical formula Eo,p = 0.22 + 1.98Rp + 0.0025R2p describes accurately the relationship between Rp and Eo,p for clinical beams of energies from 5 to 50 MeV with an accuracy of 3%. The electron mean energy, Ed, is calculated as a function of depth in water as well as plastic phantoms and is compared both with the relation, Ed = Eo (1-d/Rp), employed in AAPM protocols and with values in the IAEA Code of Practice. The conventional relations generally overestimate Ed over the entire therapeutic depth, e.g., the AAPM and IAEA overestimate Ed at dmax by up to 20% for an 18 MeV beam from a Clinac 2100C. It is also found that at all depths mean energies are 1%-3% higher near the field edges than at the central axis. We calculated depth-scaling factors for plastic phantoms by scaling the depth in plastics to the water-equivalent depth where the mean energies are equal. The depth-scaling factor is constant with depth in a given beam but there is a small variation ( &lt; 1.5%) depending on the incident beam energies. Depth-scaling factors as a function of R50 in plastic or water are presented for clear polystyrene, white polystyrene and PMMA phantom materials. The calculated depth-scaling factor is found to be equal to R50water/R50plastic. This is just the AAPM definition of effective density but there are up to 2% discrepancies between our calculated values and those recommended by the AAPM and the IAEA protocols. We find that the depth-scaling factors obtained by using the ratio of continuous-slowing-down ranges are inaccurate and overestimate our calculated values by 1%-2% in all cases. We also find that for accurate work, it is incorrect to use a simple 1/r2 correction to convert from parallel beam depth-dose curves to point source depth-dose curves, especially for high-energy beams.",

The rateequation model furthermore includes the BBR temperature, which we estimate to be 300 K with an uncertainty of about 5 K, caused by day-to-day variations of the temperature in the laboratory, and by a possibly elevated temperature of the trap electrodes due to rf current dissipation. If we compare the \u03bd 0,fit values after inserting BBR temperatures of 300 K and 305 K, we obtain a difference of 5 kHz, which we include in the uncertainty budget. Micromotion also causes a shift: by comparing the \u03bd 0,fit value from scenario 1a that includes micromotion (amplitude 11(4) nm) with a the result of a version with zero micromotion, a shift of 0.055 (20) MHz is obtained. Finally, we investigated the effect due to the uncertainty of the spin coefficient E 4 (see Eq. (1)), which is estimated to be 50 kHz [16]. Comparing fits with E 4 values differing by 50 kHz we find that this has a negligibly small effect of \u223c1 Hz on the result for \u03bd 0 . 1 a This is a shift with respect to a scenario with a zero effect of q or micromotion, and serves to illustrate the size of the effect. The shift itself, however, is absorbed in the value of \u03bd 0,fit . b The value of these shifts is actually nonzero but negligibly small, and therefore ignored here.  Table 4 shows the error budget, with a total uncertainty of 0.41 MHz that corresponds to 1.1 ppb. This result differs 0.21 MHz (0.6 ppb) from the more accurate theoretical value, \u03bd th = 383,407,177.150(15) MHz [2]. The two main uncertainty contributions are the statistical fit error of 0.33 MHz and the uncertainty in the q-factor scenario of 0.23 MHz.\n\n\nConclusion, implications and outlook",

The first method is to vary the binding energy for the descriptor (C, H, and O) on Ni(111) in RMGs' input file, which is described in (12).\n\u2206E AX Ni = \u2206E AX Pt + \u03b3 (\u2206E A Ni + \u03b4E A Ni ) \u2212 \u2206E A Pt(12)\nThe second approach is to assume that the DFT derived binding energy for the descriptor is correct and the heat of formation of the adsorbate in the Pt(111) database is varied, resulting in\n\u2206E AX Ni = (\u2206E AX Pt + \u03b4E AX Pt ) + \u03b3 \u2206E A Ni \u2212 \u2206E A Pt(13)\nThe first method would automatically account for the correlation between the heats of formation, which means that e.g., if the binding energy of C * is increased, the resulting values for CO * and HCO * are increased, which agrees with the d-band model. S19 Whereas the first method is easy to implement and accounts for correlation, it has a severe drawback because the uncertainty is scaled with the LS relation. If we perturbed the binding energy with \u00b1 0.3 eV, C * would have an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.3 eV because \u03b3 = 1 but the physisorbed species would not be uncertain at all since \u03b3 = 0. This premise is not valid. When we decrease the binding energy of C by 30 kJ mol \u22121 , the CO binding energy will be decreased by the same amount. On top of that, there can be a small uncertainty but this will describe the general trend. Therefore, we choose the latter method within this work. Figure S11 illustrates the quasi-random sampling and the correlation between the adsorbates according to the LS relations. The three descriptor species H * , C * , and O * are uncorrelated and the quasi-random numbers fill the entire uncertainty range. The uncertainty domain for the C-O parameter space is illustrated in Figure S11a, which shows the uniform distribution inside the boundaries of [-0.3 eV, 0.3 eV]",

An ensemble of 2000 exchange-correlation functionals was created around the BEEF-vdW model parameters using the BEEFensemble command to calculate the uncertainty distribution of the species binding energy self-consistently. The results are displayed in Figure S12. Figure S12a shows a scatter plot of the probability distribution of the C * and O * pair of binding energies. The uncertainty in C * binding energies is significant with values from \u22128.5 eV to \u22125 eV. The red box inside Figure S12a-c shows the uniform [-0.3 eV, 0.3 eV] boundary around the average, which was used within this work. This comparison clearly shows that the applied uniform sampling distribution of this narrow uncertainty range stands to reason. We even underestimate the uncertainty in the DFT-derived binding energies for C * and O * . There is a correlation between the C * and H * binding energy.

As expected from the linear scaling relations, there is a strong correlation between C * and CH * as well as O * and OH * . Interestingly, the uncertainty in CH * is significant and in the same order as the uncertainty in C * . The correlation between C * and CO * is not that strong, which is related to the unique structure of CO * .
