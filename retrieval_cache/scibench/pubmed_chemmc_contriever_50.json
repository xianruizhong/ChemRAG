The calculated electronic band structure and the density of states indicate that the Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$ and Li$_{2}$RhSi$_{2}$ compounds are in metallic character. Mechanical properties such as elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature were calculated for these compounds. The calculated results suggest that the compounds are mechanically stable and behave in a ductile manner. The phonon spectra have no imaginary frequency, which proves that these compounds are dynamically stable. Electron--phonon coupling parameters confirm that they are weak--coupling superconductors. Although the influence of spin--orbit coupling in superconductivity is not significant for these compounds, it has a very small influence on electronic structure for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$. The calculated critical temperature ($T_c^{\\mu^{\\star}=0.11}$) values of 3.29 K for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$ and 2.82 K for Li$_{2}$RhSi$_{2}$ agree well with experimental estimates.",

Since $R(t)$ is unknown and varies with time, this problem has a free boundary. Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$.

It is often formulated as $ \\log \\left({{{\\sigma}^{2}}}/{{{\\mu}^{2}}}\\; \\right) = \\beta\\log\\mu+\\log\\alpha $, where $ \\beta $ is a key parameter since its sign determines the qualitative dependence of noise on mean.

We show, however, that this is the wrong conclusion and that the dispersive forces repel the atom from the light in this particular case, giving the photons a momentum p_{0}/n. This leads us to identify Abraham's optical momentum with the kinetic momentum transfer. The form due to Minkowski is similarly associated with the canonical momentum.

The key to the method is to analyze the energy loss of swift heavy ions interacting with the respective bound and free electrons of the plasma. A slowly developing and lowly ionized hydrogen theta-pinch plasma is prepared. A Boltzmann plot of the hydrogen Balmer series and the Stark broadening of the H_{β} line preliminarily defines the plasma with a free electron density of (1.9±0.1)×10^{16}  cm^{-3} and a free electron temperature of 0.8-1.3 eV. The temperature uncertainty results in a wide hydrogen density, ranging from 2.3×10^{16} to 7.8×10^{18}  cm^{-3}. A 108 MHz pulsed beam of ^{48}Ca^{10+} with a velocity of 3.652  MeV/u is used as a probe to measure the total energy loss of the beam ions. Subtracting the calculated energy loss due to free electrons, the energy loss due to bound electrons is obtained, which linearly depends on the bound electron density. The total hydrogen density is thus determined as (1.9±0.7)×10^{17}  cm^{-3}, and the free electron temperature can be precisely derived as 1.01±0.04  eV. This method should prove useful in many studies, e.g., inertial confinement fusion or warm dense matter.",

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10 keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000 nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions.

Using a comb-locked cavity ring-down spectrometer, for the first time, we observed the Lamb-dip spectrum of the R(1) line in the overtone of hydrogen deuteride (HD). The line position was determined to be 217 105 182.79±0.03_{stat}±0.08_{syst}  MHz (δν/ν=4×10^{-10}), which is the most accurate rovibrational transition ever measured in the ground electronic state of molecular hydrogen. Moreover, from calculations including QED effects up to the order m_{e}α^{6}, we obtained predictions for this R(1) line as well as for the HD dissociation energy, which are less accurate but signaling the importance of the complete treatment of nonadiabatic effects. Provided that the theoretical calculation reaches the same accuracy, the present measurement will lead to a determination of the proton-to-electron mass ratio with a precision of 1.3 parts per billion.",

This is because the electronic spectrum has a very high level density near the nuclear transition energy that ensures the resonance condition is fulfilled. We present a quantum statistical theory based on many-body quantum chaos to demonstrate that typical values for the electronic factor increase the probability of electronic bridge in ^{235}U^{7+} by many orders of magnitude.

Light from the stopping region was collected by a large solid-angle light pipe and directed to a photomultiplier. Spectra were obtained by inserting a series of optical interference filters in front of the photomultiplier. Identical spectra were obtained with an intense electron emitter replacing the (64)Cu source. These results indicate that any Lyman alpha-radiation present at the photomultiplier is masked by a large background continuum associated with gas excitation processes.

Following previous approaches, we quantify time uncertainty by how well one can read off the time from a quantum clock. We then use entropy to quantify the information-theoretic distinguishability of the various time states of the clock. Our main result is an entropic energy-time uncertainty relation for general time-independent Hamiltonians, stated for both the discrete-time and continuous-time cases. Our uncertainty relation is strong, in the sense that it allows for a quantum memory to help reduce the uncertainty, and this formulation leads us to reinterpret it as a bound on the relative entropy of asymmetry.

The radiative lifetime is determined to be 4.98(25)×10^{7}  s, corresponding to 1.58(8) yr. The result reduces the relative uncertainty in this exceptionally long excited state lifetime by 1 order of magnitude with respect to previous experimental estimates. Our method is based on the coherent excitation of the corresponding transition and avoids limitations through competing decay processes. The explicit dependence on the laser intensity is eliminated by simultaneously measuring the resonant Rabi frequency and the induced quadratic Stark shift. Combining the result with information on the dynamic differential polarizability permits a calculation of the transition matrix element to infer the radiative lifetime.",

For a general (complex) reaction network, it is computationally hard to fulfill these two requirements. However, it is possible to approximately address these challenges in a physically consistent way. On the one hand, it may be sufficient to consider approximate free energies if a reliable uncertainty measure can be provided. On the other hand, a highly resolved time evolution may not be necessary to still determine quantitative fluxes in a reaction network if one is interested in specific time scales. In this paper, we present discrete-time kinetic simulations in discrete state space taking free energy uncertainties into account. The method builds upon thermo-chemical data obtained from electronic structure calculations in a condensed-phase model. Our kinetic approach supports the analysis of general reaction networks spanning multiple time scales, which is here demonstrated for the example of the formose reaction. An important application of our approach is the detection of regions in a reaction network which require further investigation, given the uncertainties introduced by both approximate electronic structure methods and kinetic models. Such cases can then be studied in greater detail with more sophisticated first-principles calculations and kinetic simulations.",

In the model there are two unknown functions: One is $\\sigma(r,t)$ which is the nutrient concentration at time $t$ and radius $r$, and the other one is $R(t)$ which is the outer tumor radius at time $t$. Since $R(t)$ is unknown and varies with time, this problem has a free boundary. Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$.

It is often formulated as $ \\log \\left({{{\\sigma}^{2}}}/{{{\\mu}^{2}}}\\; \\right) = \\beta\\log\\mu+\\log\\alpha $, where $ \\beta $ is a key parameter since its sign determines the qualitative dependence of noise on mean.

We have developed similar measures for vaccine preventable diseases based on the number needed to vaccinate. These measures quantify the number of people, or the number of vaccine doses, needed to prevent one event due to disease per year and allow the calculation of the vaccine cost to prevent one event due to disease per year. We used this method to compare influenza and pneumococcal vaccine programmes for people aged 65 years or more. We calculated the vaccine cost (dollars AUD) to prevent a case of disease, a hospitalisation or a death due to influenza or invasive pneumococcal disease each year in this age group. For influenza, the vaccine costs were dollars 598 to prevent one case per year, dollars 10787 per hospitalisation prevented and dollars 74801 per death prevented each year. We assumed all cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were hospitalised so the vaccine cost of dollars 11494 per case prevented was the same as the vaccine cost per hospitalisation prevented, while the vaccine cost per death prevented each year was dollars 49972. These results suggest the vaccine costs for the prevention of one hospitalisation or one death each year due to invasive pneumococcal disease among the elderly in Australia would be similar to the costs for the prevention of one hospitalisation or death due to influenza.",

The model involves a parameter $\\alpha$ which is the ratio of the hopping strength from an atom at the center of a honeycomb lattice to one of the atoms on the hexagon to the hopping strength around its rim. Our results were employed to determine the longitudinal dielectric function and the magnetoplasmon dispersion relation. The magnetic field splits the continuous valence, conduction and at energy subband into discrete Landau levels which present significant effects on the polarization function and magnetoplasmon dispersion. This includes the fact that the energies of the Landau levels are valley dependent which leads to different behaviors of the polarization function as the hopping parameter $\\alpha$ (or $\\phi = tan^{-1}\\alpha$) is reduced continuously toward zero. This essential critical behavior of the polarization function leads to a softening of a magnetoplasmon mode. We present results for a doped layer in the integer quantum Hall regime for fixed hopping parameter $\\alpha$ and various magnetic fields as well as chosen magnetic field and different $\\alpha$ in the random phase approximation.",

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

The relationship between variance ($ \\sigma^{2} $) and mean expression ($ \\mu $) is of paramount importance for investigations into the evolutionary origins and consequences of noise in gene expression. It is often formulated as $ \\log \\left({{{\\sigma}^{2}}}/{{{\\mu}^{2}}}\\; \\right) = \\beta\\log\\mu+\\log\\alpha $, where $ \\beta $ is a key parameter since its sign determines the qualitative dependence of noise on mean.

The essential mechanism revealed here can well interpret diverse experimental phenomena underlying expression noise.

We present a simple deterministic HIV model with super-infection by two HIV-1 subtypes. Mathematical characteristics including the basic reproductive number $(\\mathcal{R}_0)$, invasion threshold $(\\mathcal{R}_{21},\\mathcal{R}_{12})$ and conditions for asymptotic stability are derived. In the absence of super-infection the model exhibits competitive exclusion, and all equilibria are globally attracting if they exist except for the disease free which is a saddle for $\\mathcal{R}_0&gt;1.$ The results show that the subtype with the dominant reproductive number exceeding unity dominates the weaker subtype forcing it to extinction regardless of the size of the reproductive number. On the other end, super-infection may promote subtype co-existence whenever the minimum of the subtype specific reproductive numbers $(\\mathcal{R}_1,\\mathcal{R}_2)$ and the invasion reproductive numbers $(\\mathcal{R}_{12},\\mathcal{R}_{21})$ exceed unity. Our results demonstrate that if the partial reproductive numbers $(\\mathcal{R}_1~\\mbox{and}~\\mathcal{R}_2 )$ and the invasion reproductive number for the weaker subtype $(\\mathcal{R}_{21})$ satisfy $\\mathcal{R}_2&lt;1,~\\mathcal{R}_1&gt;1~\\mbox{and}~\\mathcal{R}_{21}&gt;1,$ then primary infection by subtype $1$ may stay the extinction of subtype $2$ despite its relatively low reproductive fitness. For certain parameter ranges, hysteresis (including backward bifurcation) occurs with possible differences in the asymptotic level of disease prevalence. Super-infection may thus facilitate the continued re-generation of reproductively noncompetent subtypes whose subtype specific reproductive numbers will be less than unity while at the same time allowing for the mutual coexistence and persistence of multiple strains. Persistence and co-existence of multiple strains has detrimental effect on vaccine design and development and administration of ART where one or more of the strains are drug resistant.",

The proposing technique for determining the total effective dose is based on three methods of calculation. The first one is multiplying the value of the individual dose equivalent $H_{p}(10)$ by the factor of 0.642 to account for radiation shielding by various organs and tissues and its backscattering. The second method is multiplying $H_{p}(10)$ by the conversion factor of air kerma in free air in a plate phantom, depending on the photon energy. The third method is multiplying $H_{p}(10)$ by the sum of the radiosensitivity coefficients of various organs and tissues. As a result of research, a complex method was developed for determining the total effective dose, composed of doses of cosmic radiation, external gamma-, beta- and neutron radiation, internal exposure from radionuclides, including CDP of radon and thoron, entering the body through the organs of digestion and respiration. The proposed technique for determining the total effective dose allows one to take into account the comprehensive effect of ionizing radiation sources on a person and to obtain a more accurate measure of radiation risk than the existing methods provide.",

Mechanical properties such as elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature were calculated for these compounds. The calculated results suggest that the compounds are mechanically stable and behave in a ductile manner. The phonon spectra have no imaginary frequency, which proves that these compounds are dynamically stable. Electron--phonon coupling parameters confirm that they are weak--coupling superconductors. Although the influence of spin--orbit coupling in superconductivity is not significant for these compounds, it has a very small influence on electronic structure for Li$_{2}$IrSi$_{2}$.

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

Electron tomography can be used to accurately verify the local $t$. The relations of log-ratio of zero-loss filtered energy-filtering TEM beam intensity ($I_{{\\rm ZLP}}$) and unfiltered beam intensity ($I_{\\rm u}$) versus sample thickness $t$ were measured for five values of collection angle in a microscope equipped with an energy filter.

I used a modified Laspeyres price index approach to compute practice cost indices, aggregated to the level of existing Medicare Part B payment areas and also created an index of Medicare payment levels. In comparing this prevailing charge index with the various geographic practice cost estimates, I found a considerable range in some individual localities' values within practice cost indices that in aggregate appear to be highly correlated. For the most part, estimated costs and prevailing charges appear to be comparable. However, results indicate that not every low paid area is underpaid relative to costs and not every highly paid area is overpaid.",

This regime provides an efficient and compact alternative for the production of high angular momentum electron beams, which may have many potential applications in condensed-matter spectroscopy, new electron microscopes, and bright x-ray vortex generation.",
