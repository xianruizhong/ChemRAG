In this paper, we review the definition of I(r) and some of its key properties. Apart from its relevance to reactive behavior, I(r) has an important role in several fundamental areas, including atomic shell structure, electronegativity and local polarizability and hardness.

Here we report the experimental measure of a sizeable offset (ca. 0.6 eV) between the vacuum levels of an aqueous solution (0.05 M NaCl) and that of our photoelectron analyzer, indicating a breakdown of the gas-like vacuum level alignment assumption for the aqueous solution. By quantifying the vacuum level offset as a function of solution chemical composition our measurements enable, for the first time, quantitative determination of ionization energies in liquid solutions. These results reveal that the ionization energy of liquid water is not independent of the chemical composition of the solution as is usually inferred in the literature, a finding that has important ramifications as measured ionization energies are frequently used to validate theoretical models that posses the ability to provide microscopic insight not directly available by experiment.

Using a newly developed set of molecules with heavy elements (called GW-SOC81), we find that, when based upon hybrid density functional calculations, fully relativistic (FR) and scalar-relativistic (SR) G0W0 calculations of vertical ionization potentials both yield excellent performance compared to experiment, with errors below 1.9%.

The ΔMBPT(2) method is defined as the correlated extension of the ΔHF method. Energy differences are obtained by integrating the energy derivative with respect to occupation numbers over the appropriate parameter range. This is made possible by writing the second-order energy as a function of the occupation numbers. Relaxation effects are fully included at the SCF level. This is in contrast to linear response theory, which makes the D-ΔMBPT(2) applicable not only to single excited but also higher excited states. We show the relationship of the D-ΔMBPT(2) method for IPs and EAs to a second-order approximation of the effective Fock-space coupled-cluster Hamiltonian and a second-order electron propagator method. We also discuss the connection between the D-ΔMBPT(2) method for excitation energies and the CIS-MP2 method. Finally, as a proof of principle, we apply our method to calculate ionization potentials and excitation energies of some small molecules. For IPs, the ΔMBPT(2) results compare well to the second-order solution of the Dyson equation. For excitation energies, the deviation from equation of motion coupled cluster singles and doubles increases when correlation becomes more important. When using the numerical integration technique, we encounter difficulties that prevented us from reaching the ΔMBPT(2) values. Most importantly, relaxation beyond the Hartree-Fock level is significant and needs to be included in future research.",

The nature of H+ in condensed media.\nRecent research has taught us that most protonated species are decidedly not well represented by a simple proton addition. What is the actual nature of the hydrogen ion (the \"proton\") when H(+), HA, H2A(+), and so forth are written in formulas, chemical equations, and acid catalyzed reactions? In condensed media, H(+) must be solvated and is nearly always dicoordinate, as illustrated by isolable bisdiethyletherate salts having H(OEt2)2(+) cations and weakly coordinating anions. Even carbocations such as protonated alkenes have significant C-H···anion hydrogen bonding that gives the active protons two-coordinate character. Hydrogen bonding is everywhere, particularly when acids are involved. In contrast to the normal, asymmetric O-H···O hydrogen bonding found in water, ice, and proteins, short, strong, low-barrier (SSLB) H-bonding commonly appears when strong acids are present. Unusually low frequency IR νOHO bands are a good indicator of SSLB H-bonds, and curiously, bands associated with group vibrations near H(+) in low-barrier H-bonding often disappear from the IR spectrum. Writing H3O(+) (the Eigen ion), as often appears in textbooks, might seem more realistic than H(+) for an ionized acid in water. However, this, too, is an unrealistic description of H(aq)(+). The dihydrated H(+) in the H5O2(+) cation (the Zundel ion) gets somewhat closer but still fails to rationalize all the experimental and computational data on H(aq)(+). Researchers do not understand the broad swath of IR absorption from H(aq)(+), known as the \"continuous broad absorption\" (cba). Theory has not reproduced the cba, but it appears to be the signature of delocalized protons whose motion is faster than the IR time scale. What does this mean for reaction mechanisms involving H(aq)(+)? For the past decade, the carborane acid H(CHB11Cl11) has been the strongest known Brønsted acid. (It is now surpassed by the fluorinated analogue H(CHB11F11).) Carborane acids are strong enough to protonate alkanes at room temperature, giving H2 and carbocations. They protonate chloroalkanes to give dialkylchloronium ions, which decay to carbocations. By partially protonating an oxonium cation, they get as close to the fabled H4O(2+) ion as can be achieved outside of a computer. ",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

The QuantumATK simulation engines enable electronic-structure calculations using density functional theory or tight-binding model Hamiltonians, and also offers bonded or reactive empirical force fields in many different parametrizations. Density functional theory is implemented using either a plane-wave basis or expansion of electronic states in a linear combination of atomic orbitals.

Seamless integration of the different simulation engines into a common platform allows for easy combination of different simulation methods into complex workflows. Besides giving a general overview and presenting a number of implementation details not previously published, we also present four different application examples.

Mapping Oscillator Strength across Molecular Absorption Spectra.\nThe effectiveness of solar energy capture and conversion materials derives from their ability to absorb light and to transform the excitation energy into energy stored in free carriers or chemical bonds. The Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule mandates that the integrated (electronic) oscillator strength of an absorber equals the total number of electrons in the structure. Typical molecular chromophores place only about 1% of their oscillator strength in the UV-vis window, so individual chromophores operate at about 1% of their theoretical limit. We explore the distribution of oscillator strength as a function of excitation energy to understand this circumstance. To this aim, we use familiar independent-electron model Hamiltonians as well as first-principles electronic structure methods. While model Hamiltonians capture the qualitative electronic spectra associated with π electron chromophores, these Hamiltonians mistakenly focus the oscillator strength in the fewest low-energy transitions. Advanced electronic structure methods, in contrast, spread the oscillator strength over a very wide excitation energy range, including transitions to Rydberg and continuum states, consistent with experiment. Our analysis rationalizes the low oscillator strength in the UV-vis spectral region in molecules, a step toward the goal of oscillator strength manipulation and focusing. ",

More intriguingly, strong coupling between molecules and light is possible even without the presence of a photon. The phenomenon that makes this possible is called vacuum fluctuations, which is the finite zero point energy of the quantized electromagnetic field inside an optical cavity. The light-matter coupling, which can be as large as 1 eV (100 kJ mol-1), leads to the formation of new hybrid states, called polaritons. The formed hybrid states can be viewed as a linear combination of light (vacuum field) and matter (molecules), thus completely changing the energy landscape of the system. Using vacuum fluctuations, strong light-matter interactions have for instance been used to change chemical reactivity, charge conductivity, excited state relaxation pathways and rates of chemical reactions of organic molecules.

In this Perspective, we provide a historical overview of BSE, with a particular focus on its condensed-matter roots. We also propose a critical review of its strengths and weaknesses in different chemical situations.",

A comparison of the theory with the data suggests that the truncated sum rules in the three-level model give a reasonable fundamental limit. Furthermore, we posit that the two-photon absorption cross section near the limit must have only three dominant states, so by default, the three-level model is appropriate. This ansatz is supported by a rigorous analytical calculation that the resonant term gets smaller as more states are added. We also find that the contributions of the nonexplicitly resonant terms cannot be neglected when analyzing real molecules with many excited states, even near resonance. However, puzzling as it may be, extrapolating an off-resonant result to resonance using only the resonant term of the three-level model is shown to be consistent with the exact result. In addition, the off-resonant approximation is shown to scale logarithmically when compared with the full three-level model. This scaling can be used to simplify the analysis of measurements. We find that existing molecules are still far from the fundamental limit; so, there is room for improvement. But, reaching the fundamental limit would require precise control of the energy-level spacing, independently of the transition dipole moments-a task that does not appear possible using today's synthetic approaches. So, we present alternative methods that can still lead to substantial improvements which only require the control of the transition moment to the first excited state. While it is best to normalize measured two-photon absorption cross sections to the fundamental limits when comparing molecules, we show that simply dividing by the square of the number of electrons per molecule yields a good metric for comparison.",

For example, some applications are based on light scattering with twice the energy of the incoming photon for selected compounds, that is, the nonlinear optical effect related to the second-order susceptibility term from the electronic polarization expression. The microscopic interpretation of this phenomenon is called the first-order molecular hyperpolarizability or incoherent second harmonic generation of light. Understanding such phenomena as a function of the incoming wavelength is crucial to improving the optical response of future materials. Still, the experimental apparatus, hyper-Rayleigh scattering, apparently simple, is indeed a challenging task. Therefore, we proposed a proper alternative to obtain the dispersion of the first-order hyperpolarizability using the well-known one- and two-photon absorption techniques. By the spectral analysis of both the spectra, we gathered spectroscopic parameters and applied them for predicting the first-order hyperpolarizability dispersion. This prediction is based on an <in</i-level energy system, taking into account the position and magnitude of transition dipole moments and the difference between the permanent dipole moment of the <in</i-excited states. Moreover, using the presented method, we can avoid underestimating the first-order hyperpolarizability by not suppressing higher-energy transitions.

FUV spectroscopy provides new possibilities for studying electronic structures and transitions in almost all types of molecules, from water to polymers. It also shows great promise for a variety of applications. It is well known that wavelengths below 200 nm are rich in information regarding the electronic structure and states of molecules. However, absorptivity is so high in the FUV region, that it has not been employed to investigate solids and liquids. Another problem for FUV region analysis was the instrumentation: FUV spectrometers required vacuum evacuation. Moreover, it was difficult to find applications for FUV spectroscopy. Recently, we introduced the attenuated total reflection (ATR) technique to FUV spectroscopy, which overcomes these issues. ATR-FUV spectroscopy enables the measurement of FUV spectra for solid and liquid samples, establishing a new spectroscopic research area. Using ATR-FUV spectroscopy, electronic transitions that cannot be observed with ordinary UV spectroscopy (200-380 nm) are accessible; Rydberg transitions are just one example. FUV spectroscopy has been demonstrated to have unique and versatile applications. A variety of extensive application studies are now in progress, ranging from applications to fundamental science, such as studies of hydrogen bonding, hydration, and adsorption of water and aqueous solutions, to practical applications such as online, geochemical, environmental, and polymer film analyses.

All proteins and large polypeptides examined in solid form, and in solutions, display this quenchable and photobleachable radiation which can be established not owing to aromatic sidechains. As a note of caution, we wish to state that we have not been able to completely eliminate the possibility that the radiation may be an artifact owing to second order effects such as, e.g., Raman scattering of Raman-scattered photons; however, we assert that all our experiments indicate that the radiation actually owes to some form of fluorescence. We propose that peptide electrons that have been delocalized through intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bond formation display these long-wavelength electronic transitions. If confirmed by future studies, this preliminary discovery may turn out to have important implications for biomolecular spectroscopy, protein crystallography, and materials science.",

Because the CO and NH atom groups in peptide bonds are generally engaged in extensive hydrogen bonding in globular proteins even in aqueous solution, one could argue that proteins in solution must also display this novel blue fluorescence. Here, using high concentrations to enhance detectability, two globular proteins, gamma-crystallin, and lysozyme, are shown to fluoresce visibly, exhibiting: (a) two excitation maxima, at approximately 315 nm and approximately 385 nm, (b) maximal emission at 425 nm in 100 mg/ml lysozyme and 465 nm in 100 mg/ml gamma-crystallin, (c) a time-resolved emission decay that is best fitted by a sum of three exponentials with lifetimes of 3.14, 0.46, and 9.08 ns, respectively, and comparable relative amplitudes of around 30-40 percent each, and (d) a weak CD spectrum displaying a positive band at approximately 385 nm and a negative band at approximately 465 nm.

The field of nucleon spin provides a critical window for testing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the gauge theory of the strong interactions, since it involves fundamental aspects of hadron structure which can be probed in detail in experiments, particularly deep inelastic lepton scattering on polarized targets. QCD was initially probed in high energy deep inelastic lepton scattering with unpolarized beams and targets. With time, interest shifted from testing perturbative QCD to illuminating the nucleon structure itself. In fact, the spin degrees of freedom of hadrons provide an essential and detailed verification of both perturbative and nonperturbative QCD dynamics. Nucleon spin was initially thought of coming mostly from the spin of its quark constituents, based on intuition from the parton model. However, the first experiments showed that this expectation was incorrect. It is now clear that nucleon physics is much more complex, involving quark orbital angular momenta as well as gluonic and sea quark contributions. Thus, the nucleon spin structure remains a most active aspect of QCD research, involving important advances such as the developments of generalized parton distributions (GPD) and transverse momentum distributions (TMD). Elastic and inelastic lepton-proton scattering, as well as photoabsorption experiments provide various ways to investigate non-perturbative QCD. Fundamental sum rules-such as the Bjorken sum rule for polarized photoabsorption on polarized nucleons-are also in the non-perturbative domain. This realization triggered a vigorous program to link the low energy effective hadronic description of the strong interactions to fundamental quarks and gluon degrees of freedom of QCD. This has also led to advances in lattice gauge theory simulations of QCD and to the development of holographic QCD ideas based on the AdS/CFT or gauge/gravity correspondence, a novel approach providing a well-founded semiclassical approximation to QCD. Any QCD-based model of the nucleon's spin and dynamics must also successfully account for the observed spectroscopy of hadrons. Analytic calculations of the hadron spectrum, a long sought goal of QCD research, have now being realized using light-front holography and superconformal quantum mechanics, a formalism consistent with the results from nucleon spin studies. We begin this review with a phenomenological description of nucleon structure in general and of its spin structure in particular, aimed to engage non-specialist readers. Next, we discuss the nucleon spin structure at high energy, including topics such as Dirac's front form and light-front quantization which provide a frame-independent, relativistic description of hadron structure and dynamics, the derivation of spin sum rules, and a direct connection to the QCD Lagrangian. We then discuss experimental and theoretical advances in the nonperturbative domain-in particular the development of light-front holographic QCD and superconformal quantum mechanics, their predictions for the spin content of nucleons, the computation of PDFs and of hadron masses.",

Several particle discoveries by proton as the experimental tool are considered. Protons play important roles in science, medicine, and industry. This article was prompted by my experience in the curative treatment of cancer patients by protons and my interest in the nature of protons as particles. The latter has been stimulated by many discussions with particle physicists and reading related books and journals. Protons in our universe number ≈10(80). Protons were created at 10(-6) -1 second after the Big Bang at ≈1.37 × 10(10) years beforethe present. Proton life span has been experimentally determined to be ≥10(34) years; that is, the age of the universe is 10(-24)th of the minimum life span of a proton. The abundance of the elements is hydrogen, ≈74%; helium, ≈24%; and heavier atoms, ≈2%. Accordingly, protons are the dominant baryonic subatomic particle in the universe because ≈87% are protons. They are in each atom in our universe and thus involved in virtually every activity of matter in the visible universe, including life on our planet. Protons were discovered in 1919. In 1968, they were determined to be composed of even smaller particles, principally quarks and gluons. Protons have been the experimental tool in the discoveries of quarks (charm, bottom, and top), bosons (W(+), W(-), Z(0), and Higgs), antiprotons, and antineutrons. Industrial applications of protons are numerous and important. Additionally, protons are well appreciated in medicine for their role in radiation oncology and in magnetic resonance imaging. Protons are the dominant baryonic subatomic particle in the visible universe, comprising ≈87% of the particle mass.

[J. Chem. Phys. 131, 054106 (2009)] to compute the ground state of correlated many-electron systems, an extension to the computation of excited states (exFCIQMC) is presented. The Hilbert space is divided into a large part consisting of pure Slater determinants and a much smaller orthogonal part (the size of which is controlled by a cut-off threshold), from which the lowest eigenstates can be removed efficiently. In this way, the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is restricted to the orthogonal complement of the lower excited states and projects out the next highest excited state. Starting from the ground state, higher excited states can be found one after the other. The Schrödinger equation in imaginary time is solved by the same population dynamics as in the ground state algorithm with modified probabilities and matrix elements, for which working formulae are provided. As a proof of principle, the method is applied to lithium hydride in the 3-21G basis set and to the helium dimer in the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. It is shown to give the correct electronic structure for all bond lengths. Much more testing will be required before the applicability of this method to electron correlation problems of interesting size can be assessed. ",

Using a newly developed set of molecules with heavy elements (called GW-SOC81), we find that, when based upon hybrid density functional calculations, fully relativistic (FR) and scalar-relativistic (SR) G0W0 calculations of vertical ionization potentials both yield excellent performance compared to experiment, with errors below 1.9%.

What is not generally appreciated is that Bohr's original semiclassical conception differed significantly from the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory and offers an alternative semiclassical approximation scheme with remarkable attributes. More specifically, Bohr's original method did not impose action quantization constraints but rather obtained these as predictions by simply matching photon and classical orbital frequencies. In other words, the hydrogen atom was treated entirely classically and orbital quantized emerged directly from the Planck-Einstein photon quantization condition, E = h nu. Here, we revisit this early history of quantum theory and demonstrate the application of Bohr's original strategy to the three quintessential quantum systems: an electron in a box, an electron in a ring, and a dipolar harmonic oscillator. The usual energy-level spectra, and optical selection rules, emerge by solving an algebraic (quadratic) equation, rather than a Bohr-Sommerfeld integral (or Schroedinger) equation. However, the new predictions include a frozen (zero-kinetic-energy) state which in some (but not all) cases lies below the usual zero-point energy. In addition to raising provocative questions concerning the origin of quantum-chemical phenomena, the results may prove to be of pedagogical value in introducing students to quantum mechanics.",

Like its singlet counterpart, the M parametric 2-RDM method for arbitrary spin states is derived using approximate N-representability conditions, which allow it to capture more correlation energy than coupled cluster with single and double excitations at a lower computational cost. We present energies, optimized bond lengths, potential energy curves, and occupation numbers for a set of molecules in a variety of spin states using the M and K parametric 2-RDM methods as well as several wavefunction methods. We show that the M parametric 2-RDM method can describe bond breaking of open-shell molecules like triplet B(2) and singlet and triplet OH(+) even in the presence of strong correlation.

Vertical excitation energies and one-electron properties are computed using the same geometries as in our previous ab initio benchmark study on electronically excited states. The CI calculations for the standard methods (MNDO, AM1, PM3) and for the orthogonalization-corrected methods (OM1, OM2, OM3) include single, double, triple, and quadruple excitations (CISDTQ) using the graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) as implemented in the MNDO code. The CIS calculations for the established INDO/S method and the reparametrized INDO/S2 variant employ a modified version of the ZINDO program. As compared to the best theoretical reference data from the ab initio benchmark, all currently applied semiempirical methods tend to underestimate the vertical excitation energies, but the errors are much larger in the case of the standard methods (MNDO, AM1, PM3). Overall, the mean absolute deviations relative to the theoretical best estimates are lowest for OM3, and only slightly higher for OM1 and OM2 (in the range of 0.4-0.5 eV). INDO/S performs similar to OM2 for the vertical excitation energies of singlet states, but deteriorates considerably for triplet states. The INDO/S2 reparametrization for oxygen improves the results for low-lying singlet states of oxygen-containing compounds, but makes them worse for high-lying singlets as well as for triplets. The ab initio reference data for oscillator strengths and excited-state dipole moments are again best reproduced by the orthogonalization-corrected approaches (OM1, OM2, OM3), which thus emerge as the most favorable semiempirical methods overall for treating valence excited states of large organic chromophores.

Vertical excitation energies and one-electron properties are computed for the valence excited states of these molecules using both multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory, CASPT2, and a hierarchy of coupled cluster methods, CC2, CCSD, and CC3. The calculations are done at identical geometries (MP26-31G*) and with the same basis set (TZVP). In most cases, the CC3 results are very close to the CASPT2 results, whereas there are larger deviations with CC2 and CCSD, especially in singlet excited states that are not dominated by single excitations. Statistical evaluations of the calculated vertical excitation energies for 223 states are presented and discussed in order to assess the relative merits of the applied methods. CC2 reproduces the CC3 reference data for the singlets better than CCSD. On the basis of the current computational results and an extensive survey of the literature, we propose best estimates for the energies of 104 singlet and 63 triplet excited states.",

This approach utilizes molecular orbital techniques with Gaussian basis sets for the electrons and positrons and includes electron-positron correlation with explicitly correlated Gaussian-type geminal functions. An efficient strategy is developed to reduce the number of variational parameters in the NEO-XCHF calculations. The annihilation rates, electron and positron densities, and electron-positron contact densities are compared to available results from higher-level calculations. Our analysis illustrates that the NEO-XCHF method produces qualitative to semi-quantitative results for these properties at a relatively low computational cost by treating only the essential electron-positron correlation explicitly. The NEO-HF method, which does not include explicit correlation and therefore is extremely efficient, is found to provide qualitatively accurate electron-positron contact densities for the e(+)LiH system but not for the LiPs system. Thus, the utility of the NEO-HF method for determining where annihilation occurs is system dependent and not generally reliable.

We test the algorithm on both simulated and experimental data. The results show the algorithm to be highly effective for the simultaneous tracking of many particles (up to 80 in one test). It provides estimates of particle positions that are easily mapped to entire trajectories and handles a variable number of particles in the field of view.

Using a nondegenerate OPO we produce squeezing of these parameters, and as an illustration, we reconstruct the \"cigar-shaped\" uncertainty volume on the orbital Poincaré sphere.",

This extra twist has been used, for example, to drive circular motion of microscopic particles in optical tweezers as well as to create vortices in quantum gases. Here we excite an atomic transition with a vortex laser beam and demonstrate the transfer of optical orbital angular momentum to the valence electron of a single trapped ion. We observe strongly modified selection rules showing that an atom can absorb two quanta of angular momentum from a single photon: one from the spin and another from the spatial structure of the beam. Furthermore, we show that parasitic ac-Stark shifts from off-resonant transitions are suppressed in the dark centre of vortex beams. These results show how light's spatial structure can determine the characteristics of light-matter interaction and pave the way for its application and observation in other systems.",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

One of the major characteristics is that the (orbital) energies of all the ENOs are summed up exactly equal to the total electronic energy of a wavefunction under study. Another outstanding feature is that the population of each ENO varies as the chemical reaction proceeds, keeping the total population constant though. The study of ENOs has been driven by the need for new methods to analyze extremely complicated nonadiabatic electron wavepackets such as those embedded in highly quasi-degenerate excited-state manifolds. Yet, ENOs can be applied to scrutinize many other chemical reactions, ranging from the ordinary concerted reactions, nonadiabatic reactions, and Woodward-Hoffman forbidden reactions, to excited-state reactions. We here present the properties of ENOs and a couple of case studies of numerical realization, one of which is about the mechanism of nonadiabatic electron transfer.",

Resonance is commonly discussed within valence bond theory as the stabilizing effect of mixing different Lewis structures. Yet, most computational chemists work with delocalized molecular orbitals, which are also usually employed to explain the concept of aromaticity, a ring delocalization in cyclic planar systems which abide certain number rules. However, all three concepts lack a real space definition, that is not reliant on orbitals or specific wave function expansions. Here, we outline a redefinition from first principles: delocalization means that likely electron arrangements are connected via paths of high probability density in the many-electron real space. In this picture, resonance is the consideration of additional electron arrangements, which offer alternative paths. Most notably, the famous 4n + 2 Hückel rule is generalized and derived from nothing but the antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions.",

Chem. Phys. 124, 081106 (2006)]. The main purpose of that Communication was to suggest considering the RT phenomenon as a topological effect, just like the Jahn-Teller phenomenon. However, whereas in the first publication we just summarized a few basic features to support that idea, here in the present article, we extend the topological approach and show that all the expected features that characterize a three (multi) state RT-type'3 system of a triatomic molecule can be studied and analyzed within the framework of that approach. This, among other things, enables us to employ the topological D matrix [Phys. Rev. A 62, 032506 (2000)] to determine, a priori, under what conditions a three-state system can be diabatized. The theoretical presentation is accompanied by a detailed numerical study as carried out for the HNH system. The D-matrix analysis shows that the two original electronic states 2A1 and 2B1 (evolving from the collinear degenerate Pi doublet), frequently used to study this Renner-Teller-type system, are insufficient for diabatization. This is true, in particular, for the stable ground-state configurations of the HNH molecule. However, by including just one additional electronic state--a B state (originating from a collinear Sigma state)--it is found that a rigorous, meaningful three-state diabatization can be carried out for large regions of configuration space, particularly for those, near the stable configuration of NH2. This opens the way for an accurate study of this important molecule even where the electronic angular momentum deviates significantly from an integer value.",

The key to this completely general analysis is considering the electrons in groups of three, drawing attention to the curvatures of pair potentials, rather than just their amplitudes and slopes. We show that a positive curvature at short distances is essential for the mutual distancing of electrons and a negative curvature at longer distances is essential to account for the influence of lone pairs on bond torsion.

This approach provides a convenient way for prediction of the γ magnitude of DOVE four wave mixing spectroscopy, an optical analogue to two-dimensional (2D) NMR.

For molecular geometries around the equilibrium distance, two features of the wave function contribute to this delocalization: (i) Superposition of atomic orbitals extends the electronic wave function from one atom to two or more atoms; (ii) intra-atomic contraction of the atomic orbitals further increases the inter-atomic delocalization. The inter-atomic kinetic energy lowering that (perhaps counter-intuitively) is a consequence of the intra-atomic contractions drives these contractions (which per se would increase the energy).

We have shown that Si[double bond, length as m-dash]Si bonds are \"classical\" and closely resemble C[double bond, length as m-dash]C ones, being similarly subjected to a sort of tug of war in which the σ bond favors distortion and the π bond opposes it. The essential difference between Si and C boils down to the sizes of their valence shells, which determine the π-bending stiffness. In carbon, such a stiffness is large because, upon bending, the atomic s orbitals interfere destructively with the p ones. In silicon, the s shell is smaller than the p one, the bending stiffness is reduced and the π bonds typically succumb, distort, and weaken. Electron correlation plays a major role in this context, since π bonds are far from their molecular orbital limit. Hence, we have further shown that upon weakening the effective repulsion between π electrons one may remove any structural instability, strengthen the π bonds and turn Si into a closer relative of C than it used to be.",

This is evident from, for example, the strongly debated origin of the higher stability of branched alkanes relative to linear alkanes and the possibility of constructing hydrocarbons with extraordinarily long C-C single bonds through steric crowding. Although empirical bond distance/bond strength relationships have been established for C-C bonds (longer C-C bonds have smaller bond dissociation energies), these have no present theoretical basis.

To understand this characteristic, we calculated the fundamental and overtone intensities of the Δv = 1-6 transitions for the OH stretching of alcohols and acids and the CH stretching of hydrocarbons with different types of hybridization. Based on the local-mode model, from the three components of the dipole moment function (DMF) of each molecule, a one-component effective DMF that recovered about 95% of the total intensity for the Δv = 1-6 transitions was constructed and expressed as a sixth-order polynomial of the bond displacement ΔR, with the leading expansion coefficients M1, M2, and M3 for the linear, quadratic, and cubic terms, respectively. When these coefficients for each molecule were represented as points in the coordinate system O-M1M2M3, the points for some set of molecules were found to lie on a straight line. Interestingly, the line had a direction cosine such that the resultant transition moments exhibited a small substituent dependence of the overtone intensities. Moreover, the slope of the line could be well approximated by the Morse exponential parameter and the bond distance. These characteristics of the DMFs can be rationalized by using the calculated transition moments and the wave function expansion method with the eigenfunction of the Morse potential. It was also verified by the quasiclassical method of Medvedev that these characteristics of the DMFs are the intrinsic reason for the weak substituent dependence of the overtone intensities. It is emphasized that the graphical representation of the DMF parameters provides a comprehensive tool for discussing various aspects of vibrational intensities. ",

For linear and cyclic clusters, frequencies evaluated with the reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential provide the closest agreement with experiment. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) between experiment and the calculated harmonic frequencies is 79 cm(-1) for the bending modes and 76 cm(-1) for the stretching modes. The effects of anharmonicity are included via second order vibrational perturbation theory and tend to increase the frequency of the bending modes while the stretching modes have negative shifts in the region of 20-60 cm(-1), with larger shifts for the higher frequency modes. This results in MADs for the bending and stretching modes of 84 cm(-1) and 58 cm(-1), respectively. For the fullerene molecule C60, the high frequency modes are predicted to have harmonic frequencies that are significantly higher than experiment, and this is not corrected by accounting for anharmonicity. This overestimation of experimental observed frequencies is also evident in the calculated frequencies of the G band in nanotubes. This suggests that the REBO potential is not optimal for these larger systems and it is shown that adjustment of the parameters within the potential leads to closer agreement with experiment, particularly if higher and lower frequency modes are considered separately.

We mainly deal with microcanonical ensembles to effectively compare the counting of states in continuous and discrete settings. When dealing with non-interacting elements, this effectively reduces the calculation of the microcanonical entropy to counting the number of certain partitions, or compositions of a number. This is true in the literal sense, when quantization is assumed, even in the classical limit. Thus, we build on a moderately dated, ingenuous mathematical work of Haselgrove and Temperley on counting the partitions of an arbitrarily large positive integer into a fixed (but still large) number of summands, and show that it allows us to exactly calculate the low energy/temperature entropy of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein gas in a box. Next, aided by the asymptotic analysis of the number of compositions of an integer as the sum of three squares, we estimate the entropy of the three-dimensional problem. For each selection of the total energy, there is a very sharp optimal number of particles to realize that energy. Therefore, the entropy is 'large' and almost independent of the particles, when the particles exceed that number. This number scales as the energy to the power of ( 2 / 3 ) -rds in one dimension, and ( 3 / 5 ) -ths in three dimensions. In the one-dimensional case, the threshold approaches zero temperature in the thermodynamic limit, but it is finite for mesoscopic systems. Below that value, we studied the intermediate stage, before the number of particles becomes a strong limiting factor for entropy optimization. We apply the results of moments of partitions of Coons and Kirsten to calculate the relative fluctuations of the ground state and excited states occupation numbers. At much lower temperatures than threshold, they vanish in all dimensions. We briefly review some of the same results in the grand canonical ensemble to show to what extents they differ.",

We discuss the most probable particle position (position of the maximum of the probability density) and the local uncertainty in an unstable cubic potential, V(x)∼x^{3}, both in the transient regime and in the long-time limit. The maximum shifts against the acting force as a function of time and temperature. Simultaneously, the local uncertainty does not increase faster than the observable shift. In the long-time limit, the probability density naturally attains a quasistationary form. We interpret this process as a stabilization via the measurement-feedback mechanism, the Maxwell demon, which works as an entropy pump. The rules for measurement and feedback naturally arise from the basic properties of the unstable dynamics. All reported effects are inherent in any unstable system.

Apart from a heuristic argument of Bloch, there are neither systematic numerical calculations nor a rigorous derivation of this fact. Here we present a rigorous study of the spectral fluctuations of noninteracting identical particles moving freely in a mean field emphasizing the evolution with the number of particles N as well as with the energy. Our results are conclusive. For N &gt; or =2 the spectra of these systems exhibit Poisson fluctuations provided that we consider sufficiently high excitation energies.

From this property, one may conjecture that the growth of the typical particle number with the size of the interval is slower than exponential, but, surprisingly enough, only by a subleading factor at large Δx.

We rise to the challenge with an alternative to the wave function-centered interpretations: instead of a quantum wave passing through both slits, we have a localized particle with nonlocal interactions with the other slit. Key to this explanation is dynamical nonlocality, which naturally appears in the Heisenberg picture as nonlocal equations of motion. This insight led us to develop an approach to quantum mechanics which relies on pre- and postselection, weak measurements, deterministic, and modular variables. We consider those properties of a single particle that are deterministic to be primal. The Heisenberg picture allows us to specify the most complete enumeration of such deterministic properties in contrast to the Schrödinger wave function, which remains an ensemble property. We exercise this approach by analyzing a version of the double-slit experiment augmented with postselection, showing that only it and not the wave function approach can be accommodated within a time-symmetric interpretation, where interference appears even when the particle is localized. Although the Heisenberg and Schrödinger pictures are equivalent formulations, nevertheless, the framework presented here has led to insights, intuitions, and experiments that were missed from the old perspective.",

We find that MBL does indeed occur in one of the two models we study, but the entanglement appears to grow faster than logarithmically with time unlike in other MBL systems. ",

We show that, at short time, the energy density can at most increase as sqrt[t], which can be achieved when the time dependence of a_{s} is also proportional to sqrt[t], and especially, a universal maximum energy growth rate can be reached when a_{s} varies as 2sqrt[ℏt/(πm)]. If a_{s} varies faster or slower than sqrt[t], it is, respectively, proximate to the quench process and the adiabatic process, and both result in a slower energy growth rate. These results are obtained by analyzing the short time dynamics of the short-range behavior of the many-body wave function characterized by the contact, and are also confirmed by numerically solving an example of interacting bosons with time-dependent Bogoliubov theory.

This model draws its relevance from recent experimental progress in the domain of cold atomic gases, which are studied in a setting where atoms that are excited to high-lying Rydberg states interact through power-law potentials that translate into power-law excitation rates. The out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this system turns out to be surprisingly rich. It features a self-similar evolution which leads to a characteristic power-law time dependence of observables such as the particle concentration, and results in a scale invariance of the structure factor.

The butterfly effect implies the ballistic growth of local operators in time, which can be quantified with the \"butterfly\" velocity v_{B}. Similarly, the Lieb-Robinson velocity places a state-independent ballistic upper bound on the size of time evolved operators in nonrelativistic lattice models. Here, we argue that v_{B} is a state-dependent effective Lieb-Robinson velocity. We study the butterfly velocity in a wide variety of quantum field theories using holography and compare with free-particle computations to understand the role of strong coupling.

The method does not require any grid calculations, and it is directly extendable to high dimensional systems. The usual exponential scaling of the basis set size with the dimensionality of the system can be avoided by means of an appropriate truncation scheme. Furthermore, the approach has the advantage to provide IR spectra beyond the harmonic approximation without losing the possibility of an intuitive assignment of absorption peaks in terms of normal modes of vibration.",

Accordingly, the perturbed ground-state energy is shifted and broadened, thus acquiring an imaginary part which is considered to be a paradigm of nonperturbative behavior. Here we demonstrate how the low order coefficients of a divergent perturbation series can be used to obtain excellent approximations to both real and imaginary parts of the perturbed ground state eigenenergy. The key is to use analytic continuation functions with a built-in singularity structure within the complex plane of the coupling constant, which is tailored by means of Bender-Wu dispersion relations. In the examples discussed the analytic continuation functions are Gauss hypergeometric functions, which take as input fourth order perturbation theory and return excellent approximations to the complex perturbed eigenvalue. These functions are Borel consistent and dramatically outperform widely used Padé and Borel-Padé approaches, even for rather large values of the coupling constant. ",

More specifically, Bohr's original method did not impose action quantization constraints but rather obtained these as predictions by simply matching photon and classical orbital frequencies. In other words, the hydrogen atom was treated entirely classically and orbital quantized emerged directly from the Planck-Einstein photon quantization condition, E = h nu. Here, we revisit this early history of quantum theory and demonstrate the application of Bohr's original strategy to the three quintessential quantum systems: an electron in a box, an electron in a ring, and a dipolar harmonic oscillator. The usual energy-level spectra, and optical selection rules, emerge by solving an algebraic (quadratic) equation, rather than a Bohr-Sommerfeld integral (or Schroedinger) equation. However, the new predictions include a frozen (zero-kinetic-energy) state which in some (but not all) cases lies below the usual zero-point energy.

The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

In contrast, most quantum chemical methods yield the total energy which is a large number compared to the difference and has therefore to be computed to a higher relative precision than would be necessary for the difference alone. Hence, it is desirable to compute energy differences directly, thereby avoiding the precision problem. Whenever it is possible to find a parameter which transforms smoothly from an initial to a final state, the energy difference can be obtained by integrating the energy derivative with respect to that parameter (cf. thermodynamic integration or adiabatic connection methods). If the dependence on the parameter is predominantly linear, accurate results can be obtained by single-point integration. In density functional theory and Hartree-Fock, we applied the formalism to ionization potentials, excitation energies, and chemical bond breaking. Example calculations for ionization potentials and excitation energies showed that accurate results could be obtained with a linear estimate. For breaking bonds, we introduce a nongeometrical parameter which gradually turns the interaction between two fragments of a molecule on. The interaction changes the potentials used to determine the orbitals as well as the constraint on the orbitals to be orthogonal.",

While special relativity assumes that there is no fundamental length-scale associated with such invariance, there is a fundamental scale (the Planck scale, l(Planck) approximately 1.62 x 10(-33) cm or E(Planck) = M(Planck)c(2) approximately 1.22 x 10(19) GeV), at which quantum effects are expected to strongly affect the nature of space-time. There is great interest in the (not yet validated) idea that Lorentz invariance might break near the Planck scale. A key test of such violation of Lorentz invariance is a possible variation of photon speed with energy. Even a tiny variation in photon speed, when accumulated over cosmological light-travel times, may be revealed by observing sharp features in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light-curves. Here we report the detection of emission up to approximately 31 GeV from the distant and short GRB 090510. We find no evidence for the violation of Lorentz invariance, and place a lower limit of 1.2E(Planck) on the scale of a linear energy dependence (or an inverse wavelength dependence), subject to reasonable assumptions about the emission (equivalently we have an upper limit of l(Planck)/1.2 on the length scale of the effect).

The analysis uses the equations of classical electro-magnetism and conservation of energy while modeling an eigenstate electron as a nonlocal entity. Essential to the analysis are physical properties that were discovered and analyzed only after the historical interpretation of quantum mechanics was established: electron non-locality and the standing electro-magnetic energy that accompanies and encompasses an active, electrically small volume. The standing energy produces a driving radiation reaction force that, under certain circumstances, is many orders of magnitude larger than currently accepted values. These properties provide a sufficient basis for the Schrödinger equation as a descriptor of non-relativistic eigenstate electrons in or near equilibrium.

The Lorentz transformation, established in 1904, preceded the special theory of relativity. Later on, Lorentz played a much admired role in the debate on the new developments in physics, in particular as chairman of a series of Solvay conferences. Gradually his stature outside of physics grew, both nationally as chairman of the Zuiderzee committee and internationally as president of the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations.

This Kapitza-Dirac effect is analogous to the diffraction of light by a grating, but with the roles of the wave and matter reversed. The electron and the light grating interact extremely weakly, via the 'ponderomotive potential', so attempts to measure the Kapitza-Dirac effect had to wait for the development of the laser.

Deflection of electrons by high-intensity laser light, which is also a consequence of the Kapitza-Dirac effect, has also been demonstrated.

A comparison of the theory with the data suggests that the truncated sum rules in the three-level model give a reasonable fundamental limit. Furthermore, we posit that the two-photon absorption cross section near the limit must have only three dominant states, so by default, the three-level model is appropriate. This ansatz is supported by a rigorous analytical calculation that the resonant term gets smaller as more states are added. We also find that the contributions of the nonexplicitly resonant terms cannot be neglected when analyzing real molecules with many excited states, even near resonance. However, puzzling as it may be, extrapolating an off-resonant result to resonance using only the resonant term of the three-level model is shown to be consistent with the exact result. In addition, the off-resonant approximation is shown to scale logarithmically when compared with the full three-level model. This scaling can be used to simplify the analysis of measurements. We find that existing molecules are still far from the fundamental limit; so, there is room for improvement. But, reaching the fundamental limit would require precise control of the energy-level spacing, independently of the transition dipole moments-a task that does not appear possible using today's synthetic approaches. So, we present alternative methods that can still lead to substantial improvements which only require the control of the transition moment to the first excited state. While it is best to normalize measured two-photon absorption cross sections to the fundamental limits when comparing molecules, we show that simply dividing by the square of the number of electrons per molecule yields a good metric for comparison.",

Rittenhouse described the action of a diffraction grating in 1786, but no explanation was possible until the wave theory of light was developed. Fraunhofer discovered the dark lines in the solar spectrum in 1814, and then investigated diffraction, producing the first ruled gratings, making detailed measurements and calculating the wavelengths of prominent spectral lines. After Bunsen and Kirchhoff showed the association between spectral lines and chemical elements there was an upsurge of interest in measuring wavelengths. The gratings used in this work almost all came from one source, a relatively unknown instrument maker called Nobert, who made them by an extremely laborious process using a machine he had built himself. The most significant wavelength measurements were made by Ångström, but Mascart, Van der Willigen, Stefan, Ditscheiner and Cornu also did important work. Nobert gratings were investigated by Quincke, copied photographically by Rayleigh, and were known and discussed in the USA.

For that reason the article gives a short survey about the history of the lightelectric effects. Lenard's basical work about the release of the photoelectrons is dealt with in detail, without which Einstein would scarcely have found his lightquanta. Furthermore it is shown how difficult it was for the physicists to give up--at least partially--the traditional view of the undulation-nature of light, and how they searched to explain the great energies of the photoelectrons. On the other side it is set forth how Einstein's formula of lightquanta was gradually confirmed. The tragical development of Einstein's personal relations with Johannes Stark and Philipp Lenard are briefly described. Stark was one of the few who supported Einstein's ideas at the beginning. Only with the Compton-effect, which could only be quantitatively interpreted by means of lightquanta and the special theory of relativity 1923, the way was free for the general acceptance of the lightquanta. Einstein did not agree to the obtained dualism of undulation and corpuscle; he had a different solution in mind about the fusion of the two forms of appearance of light.",

The Lorentz law is the universal expression of the force exerted by electromagnetic fields on a volume containing a distribution of electrical charges and currents. If electric and magnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are traditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and magnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current densities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current densities, respectively. In this way, Maxwell's macroscopic equations are reduced to his microscopic equations, and the Lorentz law is expected to provide a precise expression of the electromagnetic force density on material bodies at all points in space and time. This Letter presents incontrovertible theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity. We argue that the Lorentz law must be abandoned in favor of a more general expression of the electromagnetic force density, such as the one discovered by Einstein and Laub in 1908. Not only is the Einstein-Laub formula consistent with special relativity, it also solves the long-standing problem of \"hidden momentum\" in classical electrodynamics.",

The analysis is simple and powerful for long tau, where the strong collision limit applies. There, the variation of M with theta can be fit, yielding the number n of spins S to which each spin I is coupled. Data from amorphous silicon with 1H and 2D show the described effect.

The 2cNESC is a Dirac-exact method that employs the exact two-component one-electron Hamiltonian and thus leads to exact Dirac SO splittings for one-electron atoms. For many-electron atoms and molecules, the effect of the two-electron SO interaction is modeled by a screened nucleus potential using effective nuclear charges as proposed by Boettger [Phys. Rev.

Conveniently, these are precisely the states that are accessed by the family of single spin-flip methods. Building an effective Hamiltonian with these states allows one to extract all of the J(AB) constants in the molecule. Unlike approaches based on density functional theory, this procedure relies on neither spin-contaminated states nor nonunique spin-projection formulas. A key benefit is that it is possible to obtain completely spin-pure exchange coupling constants with inexpensive ab initio calculations. A couple of examples are provided to illustrate the approach, including a 4-nickel cubane complex and a 6-chromium horseshoe complex with 18 entangled electrons.",

Momentum-balance (MB) is the difference between the equimomentum and antimomentum and, therefore, indicates if equal or opposite momentum is more probable in a system of electrons. The equimomentum, antimomentum, and MB densities are also introduced, which are the local contribution to each quantity. The MB and MB density of the extrapolated-full configuration interaction wave functions of atoms of the first three rows of the periodic table are analyzed, with a particular focus on contrasting the correlated motion of electrons with opposite-spin and parallel-spin. Coulomb correlation between opposite-spin electrons leads to a higher probability of equimomentum, whereas Fermi correlation between parallel-spin electrons leads to a higher probability of antimomentum. The local contribution to MB, given an electron is present, is a minimum at the nucleus and generally increases as the distance from the nucleus increases.

The MO-VB has been especially designed to deal with weak intermolecular interactions, and in recent years it has been successfully applied to compute the potential energy surface of several complexes, namely He(2), He-H(2)O, He-CH(4) and Ne-CH(4). In this investigation we test extensively the performance of the MO-VB on two limit systems, the He dimer and the LiH-He complex, which span three extremes in the field of van der Waals interactions: a purely dispersive system (He...He) and, thanks to the highly polar Li-H bond, a noble gas approaching a cation (He...Li(+)), and an anion (He...H(-)). Very accurate computations are available in the literature for He(2) and LiH-He, performed either with conventional Molecular Orbital or Monte Carlo approaches, and hence these systems are the ideal candidates to establish the capabilities of the MO-VB. Based on the results of our study, we conclude that in He(2) and LiH-He the MO-VB overestimates the correlation energy contribution to the interaction energy of about 5%, and hence it is a valid option for computing accurate lower bounds to the potential energy surface of these complexes.",

The parameterizations have been carried out in a much more extensive manner, aimed at producing a new, more accurate model called Sparkle/AM1, mainly for the vast majority of all Eu(III), Gd(III), and Tb(III) complexes, which possess oxygen or nitrogen as coordinating atoms. All such complexes, which comprise 80% of all geometries present in the Cambridge Structural Database for each of the three ions, were classified into seven groups. These were regarded as a \"basis\" of chemical ambiance around a lanthanide, which could span the various types of ligand environments the lanthanide ion could be subjected to in any arbitrary complex where the lanthanide ion is coordinated to nitrogen or oxygen atoms. From these seven groups, 15 complexes were selected, which were defined as the parameterization set and then were used with a numerical multidimensional nonlinear optimization to find the best parameter set for reproducing chemical properties. The new parameterizations yielded an unsigned mean error for all interatomic distances between the Eu(III) ion and the ligand atoms of the first sphere of coordination (for the 96 complexes considered in the present paper) of 0.09 A, an improvement over the value of 0.28 A for the previous model and the value of 0.68 A for the first model (Chem.

While in a strictest sense, energy calculations with vdW-DFAs should be carried out fully self-consistently, we demonstrate conclusively for a total of 11 methods that such a strategy only increases the computational time effort without having any significant effect on energetic properties, electron densities, or orbital-energy differences.

However, the high potential of BVM to be used as an important analytical tool was overlooked in recent inorganic chemistry due to its empirical character and serious restrictions for its application. Recent quantum chemistry data (BOs and electron densities at the bond critical points, ρc) enable us to establish the validity of the BVM to any type of chemical bonds, as well as a direct BO/ρc relationship. Such a BVM revisit overcomes most of the limitations anticipated previously for the model and thus makes it universal. This Perspective highlights the advance in model development, in particular its application to compounds with metal-metal bonds, which allows us to establish (i) a linear correlation between BOs and stretching force constants used as a measure of the bond strength and (ii) a quantitative description of the steric/electrostatic effects in cluster compounds enabling us to understand their nature and the influence of such effects on structural stability.

By introducing a flexible mixing of Hartree-Fock and DFT exchange in the LCgau scheme, we showed that a DFT functional could simultaneously achieve high accuracy in the reproduction of thermochemical properties, molecular geometries, as well as charge transfer and valence-Rydberg excitation energies. With an alternative mixing of short-range exchange, LCgau-core can reproduce core excitations with high accuracy, especially in the C, N, and O atoms, but at the expense of slightly higher atomization energy errors. We now show that LC2gau can simultaneously perform well for all types of excitations, as well as thermochemistry. In contrast to the previously proposed LC functionals, a notable feature is the inclusion of 100% DFT exchange as the interelectronic distance vanishes, showing that pure DFT approximations can be successfully used at short range, and the importance of including an appropriate correction in the midrange. This is achieved using two Gaussian functions in combination with the error function to describe the exchange partitioning. We rationalize the success of LC2gau by demonstrating a near-linear behavior of the total energies of the C atom as a function of the fractional number of electrons, both in the valence and core regions, which indicates an alleviation of significant self-interaction errors observed with other functionals.",

Observations drawn from the populations and volumes of L-basins are contrasted with the three subsidiary VSEPR postulates. We find unexpectedly small populations, nearer to one than to two, for non-hydrogen cores and bonding domains, and populations much larger than two for non-bonding domains. We conclude that non-bonding or lone pairs have larger domains than bonding pairs in the same valence shell, in accordance with VSEPR. We also confirm that double and triple bond domains are larger than single-bond domains. However we cannot substantiate the effect of the electronegativity of central atom or ligand on the volume of bonding domains. In summary, the full topology of L(r) supports two out of three subsidiary VSEPR postulates.",

The GIPAW method roots in the plane wave pseudopotential formalism of the density functional theory (DFT), and avoids the use of the cluster approximation. This method has undoubtedly revitalized the interest in quantum chemical calculations in the solid-state NMR community. It has quickly evolved and improved so that the calculation of the key components of NMR interactions, namely the shielding and electric field gradient tensors, has now become a routine for most of the common nuclei studied in NMR. Availability of reliable implementations in several software packages (CASTEP, Quantum Espresso, PARATEC) make its usage more and more increasingly popular, maybe indispensable in near future for all material NMR studies. The majority of nuclei of the periodic table have already been investigated by GIPAW, and because of its high accuracy it is quickly becoming an essential tool for interpreting and understanding experimental NMR spectra, providing reliable assignments of the observed resonances to crystallographic sites or enabling a priori prediction of NMR data. The continuous increase of computing power makes ever larger (and thus more realistic) systems amenable to first-principles analysis. In the near future perspectives, as the incorporation of dynamical effects and/or disorder are still at their early developments, these areas will certainly be the prime target.",

While our benchmark study is somewhat limited, we make recommendations for the use of ph-AFQMC for general main-group chemistry applications. For systems where single determinant wave functions are qualitatively accurate, we expect the accuracy of ph-AFQMC in conjunction with a single-determinant trial wave function to be between that of coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) and CCSD with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)). For these applications, ph-AFQMC should be a method of choice when canonical CCSD(T) is too expensive to run. For systems where multireference (MR) wave functions are needed for qualitative accuracy, ph-AFQMC is far more accurate than MR perturbation theory methods and competitive with MR configuration interaction (MRCI) methods.

First, we incorporate the resolution of the identity (RI) and atomic resolution of the identity (ARI) approximations when generating the relevant integrals, which allows for a drastic reduction in computational cost.

Though ammonia triborane is a very electron-deficient compound, it forms a stable white powder which is now being investigated as a potential hydrogen storage material. In contrast to previous electronic structure predictions, our calculations show that ammonia triborane has one localized molecular orbital in the center of the electron-deficient triborane ring (much like the single molecular orbital in H(3)(+)), which gives the molecule added energetic stability.

The λ value is defined as a function of the free valence index in our previous scheme, denoted as λ-DFVB(K) in this paper. Here we revisit the λ-DFVB method and present a new scheme based on natural orbital occupation numbers (NOONs) for parameter λ, named λ-DFVB(IS), to simplify the process of λ-DFVB calculation.

Furthermore, λ-DFVB(IS) does not involve further self-consistent field calculation after performing the valence bond self-consistent field (VBSCF) calculation, and thus, the computational effort in λ-DFVB(IS) is approximately the same as the VBSCF method, greatly reduced from λ-DFVB(K). The performance of λ-DFVB(IS) was investigated on a broader range of molecular properties, including equilibrium bond lengths and dissociation energies, atomization energies, atomic excitation energies, and chemical reaction barriers.

Common methods that correct energetic delocalization errors, such as the Hubbard U correction in DFT+U or Hartree-Fock exchange in global hybrids, do so at the cost of worsening static correlation errors. We recently introduced an alternate approach [Bajaj et al., J. Chem. Phys. 147, 191101 (2017)] known as judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT), wherein the deviation from exact behavior of semilocal functionals over both fractional spin and charge, i.e., the so-called flat plane, was used to motivate functional forms of second order analytic corrections. In this work, we introduce fully nonempirical expressions for all four coefficients in a DFT+U+J-inspired form of jmDFT, where all coefficients are obtained only from energies and eigenvalues of the integer-electron systems. We show good agreement for U and J coefficients obtained nonempirically as compared with the results of numerical fitting in a jmDFT U+J/J' correction. Incorporating the fully nonempirical jmDFT correction reduces and even eliminates the fractional spin error at the same time as eliminating the energetic delocalization error. We show that this approach extends beyond s-electron systems to higher angular momentum cases including p- and d-electrons. Finally, we diagnose some shortcomings of the current jmDFT approach that limit its ability to improve upon DFT results for cases such as weakly bound anions due to poor underlying semilocal functional behavior.",

We assessed both BLYP and dispersion-corrected BLYP with respect to benchmark calculations for the hydrogen bond lengths and binding energies of 20 complexes containing the elements C, H, N, O, and S. Benchmark data included geometries calculated using MP2 and CCSD(T) and binding energies using W2, W1, CBS-QB3, and other CCSD(T) extrapolation schemes. With respect to benchmark methods, dispersion-corrected BLYP exhibited a mean signed error of 0.010 A in the hydrogen bond length and a mean relative error of 5.1% in the hydrogen bond binding energy. By comparison, uncorrected BLYP exhibited error statistics of 0.036 A and 15.9%, respectively. We conclude that DCACPs robustly improve the BLYP description of hydrogen-bonded systems at small additional computational cost. New benchmark geometries (MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ) and new benchmark binding energies (W1) are presented for seven complexes, and the remaining benchmark data were taken from previous literature.",

Energy differences are obtained by integrating the energy derivative with respect to occupation numbers over the appropriate parameter range. This is made possible by writing the second-order energy as a function of the occupation numbers. Relaxation effects are fully included at the SCF level. This is in contrast to linear response theory, which makes the D-ΔMBPT(2) applicable not only to single excited but also higher excited states. We show the relationship of the D-ΔMBPT(2) method for IPs and EAs to a second-order approximation of the effective Fock-space coupled-cluster Hamiltonian and a second-order electron propagator method.

Finally, as a proof of principle, we apply our method to calculate ionization potentials and excitation energies of some small molecules. For IPs, the ΔMBPT(2) results compare well to the second-order solution of the Dyson equation. For excitation energies, the deviation from equation of motion coupled cluster singles and doubles increases when correlation becomes more important.

At the same time, nuclear quantum motion is known to be important and to induce a redshift of excited state energies. However, it is thus far unclear whether incorporating nuclear quantum motion in molecular excited state calculations leads to a systematic improvement of their predictive accuracy, making further investigation necessary. Here, we present such an investigation by employing two first-principles methods for capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations on excited state energies, which we apply to the Thiel set of organic molecules. We show that accounting for zero-point motion leads to much improved agreement with experiment, compared to \"static\" calculations that only account for electronic effects, and the magnitude of the redshift can become as large as 1.36 eV. Moreover, we show that the effect of nuclear quantum motion on excited state energies largely depends on the molecular size, with smaller molecules exhibiting larger redshifts. Our methodology also makes it possible to analyze the contribution of individual vibrational normal modes to the redshift of excited state energies, and in several molecules, we identify a limited number of modes dominating this effect. Overall, our study provides a foundation for systematically quantifying the shift of excited state energies due to nuclear quantum motion and for understanding this effect at a microscopic level.",

The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

We present energies, optimized bond lengths, potential energy curves, and occupation numbers for a set of molecules in a variety of spin states using the M and K parametric 2-RDM methods as well as several wavefunction methods.

What is not generally appreciated is that Bohr's original semiclassical conception differed significantly from the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory and offers an alternative semiclassical approximation scheme with remarkable attributes. More specifically, Bohr's original method did not impose action quantization constraints but rather obtained these as predictions by simply matching photon and classical orbital frequencies. In other words, the hydrogen atom was treated entirely classically and orbital quantized emerged directly from the Planck-Einstein photon quantization condition, E = h nu. Here, we revisit this early history of quantum theory and demonstrate the application of Bohr's original strategy to the three quintessential quantum systems: an electron in a box, an electron in a ring, and a dipolar harmonic oscillator.

For these transitions, the upper and lower states have almost identical Ω(f) weights. This appears to be a necessary condition for a transition to be strong.

The Hilbert space is divided into a large part consisting of pure Slater determinants and a much smaller orthogonal part (the size of which is controlled by a cut-off threshold), from which the lowest eigenstates can be removed efficiently. In this way, the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is restricted to the orthogonal complement of the lower excited states and projects out the next highest excited state. Starting from the ground state, higher excited states can be found one after the other. The Schrödinger equation in imaginary time is solved by the same population dynamics as in the ground state algorithm with modified probabilities and matrix elements, for which working formulae are provided. As a proof of principle, the method is applied to lithium hydride in the 3-21G basis set and to the helium dimer in the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. It is shown to give the correct electronic structure for all bond lengths.

Without dissolved ions, the interactions between biological molecules are insufficiently complex to support life. This complexity is intimately tied to the variation in properties induced by the presence of different ions. These specific ion effects, widely known as Hofmeister effects, have been known for more than 100 years. They are ubiquitous throughout the chemical, biological and physical sciences. The origin of these effects and their relative strengths is still hotly debated. Here we reconsider the origins of specific ion effects through the lens of Coulomb interactions and establish a foundation for anion effects in aqueous and non-aqueous environments. We show that, for anions, the Hofmeister series can be explained and quantified by consideration of site-specific electrostatic interactions. This can simply be approximated by the radial charge density of the anion, which we have calculated for commonly reported ions. This broadly quantifies previously unpredictable specific ion effects, including those known to influence solution properties, virus activities and reaction rates. Furthermore, in non-aqueous solvents, the relative magnitude of the anion series is dependent on the Lewis acidity of the solvent, as measured by the Gutmann Acceptor Number. Analogous SIEs for cations bear limited correlation with their radial charge density, highlighting a fundamental asymmetry in the origins of specific ion effects for anions and cations, due to competing non-Coulombic phenomena.",

We discuss how to identify such cases, and how DC-DFT applies more generally. To illustrate, we calculate potential energy surfaces of HO·Cl(-) and HO·H2O complexes using various common approximate functionals, with and without this density correction. Commonly used approximations yield wrongly shaped surfaces and/or incorrect minima when calculated self consistently, while yielding almost identical shapes and minima when density corrected.

We show that such radii, which we denote R(XHe), make good qualitative sense. We also compare our R(XHe) values to more traditional ionic radii from solid crystal X-ray measurements, as well as estimates of such radii from \"ionic\" gas-phase MF, MOM, MF(+), and MO molecules, where M is a metal atom. Such comparisons lead to interesting conclusions about bonding in ionic crystals and in simple gas-phase oxide and fluoride molecules. The definition is shown to be reasonable for -1, +1, and even for many of the larger +2 atomic ions. Another advantage of the R(XHe) definition is that it is also consistently valid for ground states and excited states of both neutral atoms and atomic ions, even for open-shell np and nd cases where the electron clouds of the ions are not spherically symmetric and R(XHe) thus depends on the \"approach\" direction of the He atom. Finally, we note that when there is a contribution from covalent bonding with the He atom, and/or in cases where the ion is small and has a very high charge, so that there is distortion even of the He 1s electrons, R(XHe) is not expected to be representative of the size of the ion. We then suggest that in these cases small, and sometimes unphysical, values of R(XHe) are diagnostic of the fact that simple \"physical\" interactions have been supplemented by a \"chemical\" component.",

This flux is identified with the bond valence, and Gauss' law with the valence-sum rule, providing a secure theoretical foundation for the bond-valence model. The localization of the Coulomb field provides an unambiguous definition of coordination number and our calculations show that, in addition to the expected primary coordination sphere, there are a number of weak bonds between cations and the anions in the second coordination sphere.

The parameterizations have been carried out in a much more extensive manner, aimed at producing a new, more accurate model called Sparkle/AM1, mainly for the vast majority of all Eu(III), Gd(III), and Tb(III) complexes, which possess oxygen or nitrogen as coordinating atoms. All such complexes, which comprise 80% of all geometries present in the Cambridge Structural Database for each of the three ions, were classified into seven groups. These were regarded as a \"basis\" of chemical ambiance around a lanthanide, which could span the various types of ligand environments the lanthanide ion could be subjected to in any arbitrary complex where the lanthanide ion is coordinated to nitrogen or oxygen atoms. From these seven groups, 15 complexes were selected, which were defined as the parameterization set and then were used with a numerical multidimensional nonlinear optimization to find the best parameter set for reproducing chemical properties. The new parameterizations yielded an unsigned mean error for all interatomic distances between the Eu(III) ion and the ligand atoms of the first sphere of coordination (for the 96 complexes considered in the present paper) of 0.09 A, an improvement over the value of 0.28 A for the previous model and the value of 0.68 A for the first model (Chem.

The results, therefore, indicate that Eu(III), Gd(III), and Tb(III) Sparkle/AM1 calculations possess geometry prediction accuracies for lanthanide complexes with oxygen or nitrogen atoms in the coordination polyhedron that are competitive with present day ab initio/effective core potential calculations, while being hundreds of times faster.",

We propose and validate a new general methodology, denoted PQEq, to predict rapidly and dynamically the atomic charges and polarization underlying the electrostatic interactions. Here the polarization is described using an atomic sized Gaussian shaped electron density that can polarize away from the core in response to internal and external electric fields, while at the same time adjusting the charge on each core (described as a Gaussian function) so as to achieve a constant chemical potential across all atoms of the system. The parameters for PQEq are derived from experimental atomic properties of all elements up to Nobelium (atomic no. = 102). We validate PQEq by comparing to QM interaction energy as probe dipoles are brought along various directions up to 30 molecules containing H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Cl atoms. We find that PQEq predicts interaction energies in excellent agreement with QM, much better than other common charge models such as obtained from QM using Mulliken or ESP charges and those from standard force fields (OPLS and AMBER). Since PQEq increases the accuracy of electrostatic interactions and the response to external electric fields, we expect that PQEq will be useful for a large range of applications including ligand docking to proteins, catalytic reactions, electrocatalysis, ferroelectrics, and growth of ceramics and films, where it could be incorporated into standard force fields as OPLS, AMBER, CHARMM, Dreiding, ReaxFF, and UFF.",

This approach provides rigorous definitions for the corresponding screening length, effective permittivity, and renormalized charges, and can be employed for precise and reliable calculations of these parameters within any scheme. In particular, we introduce a simple procedure for extracting this information from computer simulations. The viability of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to a three-component model system which includes anionic nanoparticles and monovalent cations and anions. The mean forces between nanoparticles are determined directly from simulations with two macroions, plus small ions, inside a single cell with periodic boundary conditions. The values of the parameters of interest, on the other hand, are gathered from two separate sets of computer simulations: one set provides information about the short-range correlations among the small ions, which in turn determine the screening length and effective permittivity; the second set supplies the short-range components of the ionic distribution around one isolated macroion, which also determine its renormalized charge. The method presented here thus avoids the uncertain fitting of these parameters from the asymptotic tail of the mean force and allows us to investigate in detail this connection between the renormalized charge of the macroion and the short-range (virtual) part of the ionic cloud surrounding it.

The nature of H+ in condensed media.\nRecent research has taught us that most protonated species are decidedly not well represented by a simple proton addition. What is the actual nature of the hydrogen ion (the \"proton\") when H(+), HA, H2A(+), and so forth are written in formulas, chemical equations, and acid catalyzed reactions? In condensed media, H(+) must be solvated and is nearly always dicoordinate, as illustrated by isolable bisdiethyletherate salts having H(OEt2)2(+) cations and weakly coordinating anions. Even carbocations such as protonated alkenes have significant C-H···anion hydrogen bonding that gives the active protons two-coordinate character. Hydrogen bonding is everywhere, particularly when acids are involved. In contrast to the normal, asymmetric O-H···O hydrogen bonding found in water, ice, and proteins, short, strong, low-barrier (SSLB) H-bonding commonly appears when strong acids are present. Unusually low frequency IR νOHO bands are a good indicator of SSLB H-bonds, and curiously, bands associated with group vibrations near H(+) in low-barrier H-bonding often disappear from the IR spectrum. Writing H3O(+) (the Eigen ion), as often appears in textbooks, might seem more realistic than H(+) for an ionized acid in water. However, this, too, is an unrealistic description of H(aq)(+). The dihydrated H(+) in the H5O2(+) cation (the Zundel ion) gets somewhat closer but still fails to rationalize all the experimental and computational data on H(aq)(+). Researchers do not understand the broad swath of IR absorption from H(aq)(+), known as the \"continuous broad absorption\" (cba). Theory has not reproduced the cba, but it appears to be the signature of delocalized protons whose motion is faster than the IR time scale. What does this mean for reaction mechanisms involving H(aq)(+)? For the past decade, the carborane acid H(CHB11Cl11) has been the strongest known Brønsted acid. (It is now surpassed by the fluorinated analogue H(CHB11F11).) Carborane acids are strong enough to protonate alkanes at room temperature, giving H2 and carbocations. They protonate chloroalkanes to give dialkylchloronium ions, which decay to carbocations. By partially protonating an oxonium cation, they get as close to the fabled H4O(2+) ion as can be achieved outside of a computer. ",

Here, we demonstrate that the asymmetric response observed in simulation is the result of an arbitrary choice of the oxygen atom to be the centre of a water molecule. We show that an alternative and reasonable choice, which places the centre 0.5 Å towards the hydrogen atoms, results in a linear and charge symmetric response of water to ionic charge for a classical water model consistent with the Born model. Therefore, this asymmetry should be regarded as a property of the specific short-range repulsive interaction not an intrinsic electrostatic property of water and so the fact that the Born model does not reproduce it is not a limitation of this approach.

An approximate form of the latter is now widely used for this purpose, although it includes a number of deviations from chemical experience. More recently, Allen introduced an atomic electronegativity scale based upon the spectroscopic average ionization energies of the valence electrons. This has gained considerable acceptance. However it does not take into account the interpenetration of valence and low-lying subshells, and it also involves some ambiguity in enumerating d valence electrons. In this paper, we analyze and characterize a formulation of relative atomic electronegativities that is conceptually the same as Allen's but avoids the aforementioned problems. It involves the property known as the average local ionization energy, I̅(r), defined as [Formula: see text], where ρi(r) is the electronic density of the i(th) orbital, having energy εi, and ρ(r) is the total electronic density. I̅(r) is interpreted as the average energy required to remove an electron at the point r. When I̅(r) is averaged over the outer surfaces of atoms, taken to be the 0.001 au contours of their electronic densities, a chemically meaningful scale of relative atomic electronegativities is obtained. Since the summation giving I̅(r) is over all occupied orbitals, the issues of subshell interpenetration and enumeration of valence electrons do not arise. The procedure is purely computational, and all of the atoms are treated in the same straightforward manner. The results of several different Hartree-Fock and density functional methods are compared and evaluated; those produced by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional are chemically the most realistic. ",

The approximation, with no fitted parameters, was tested against numerical solutions of the Poisson equation, where it has produced a significant speed-up. For neutral small molecules, the hydration free energies estimated from the closed-form ASC formula are within 0.8 kcal/mol RMSD from the numerical Poisson reference; the electric field at the surface is in quantitative agreement with the reference. Performance of the approximation was also tested on larger structures, including a protein, a DNA fragment, and a viral receptor-target complex. For all structures tested, a near-quantitative agreement with the numerical Poisson reference was achieved, except in regions of high negative curvature, where the new approximation is still qualitatively correct. A unique efficiency feature of the proposed \"source-based″ closed-form approximation is that the ASC and electric field can be estimated individually at any point or surface patch, without the need to obtain the full global solution.

We highlight methods that can avoid spurious local extrema as a practical solution to the orbital optimization problem.

This leads to response equations in a subspace orthogonal to the unperturbed eigenvectors. It is shown how these projected equations can be solved without storage of the double excitation part of the eigenvectors. By exploiting the resolution-of-the-identity approximation and a numerical Laplace transformation, the quadratic scaling of the main memory demands of RI-CC2 with the system size could be preserved. This enables calculations of excited state polarizabilities for large molecules, e.g., linear polyacenes up to decacene with almost 2500 basis functions on a single compute node within a few days. For a test set of molecules where measurements are available as reference data, we compare the orbital-relaxed and unrelaxed CC2 approaches with experiment to validate its accuracy. The approach can be easily extended to other response methods, in particular CIS(D∞). The latter gives results which, in the orbital-relaxed case, are within a few percent of the CC2 values, while coupled cluster singles results deviate typically by about 20% from orbital-relaxed CC2 and experimental reference data.

The effect has been linked to low-lying 3<id</i virtual orbitals approaching the valence shell. However, since most of this effect is captured at the self-consistent field level, the effect of tight <id</i functions in high-level coupled-cluster calculations has not been extensively studied. Here, we construct an extensive data set of 45 second-row species to examine the effect of tight <id</i functions in CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations in conjunction with basis sets of up to sextuple-ζ quality.

The effects of the tight <id</i functions are diminished with the size of the basis set; however, they are still chemically significant at the CCSD and (T) levels. For example, with the cc-pVTZ basis set, we obtain contributions to the TAEs of up to ∼1.5 and ∼0.3 kcal/mol at the CCSD and (T) levels, respectively, and with the cc-pVQZ basis set, we obtain contributions of up to ∼1.0 and ∼0.2 kcal/mol at the CCSD and (T) levels, respectively.

Comparison of the CASSCF linear response (LR) methods MC-RPA and MC-TDA and the state-averaged (SA) CASSCF method is made for 122 singlet excitation energies and 69 oscillator strengths. Of all CASSCF methods, when considering the complete test set, MC-RPA performs best for both excitation energies and oscillator strengths with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.74 eV and 51%, respectively. MC-TDA and SA-CASSCF show a similar accuracy for the excitation energies with a MAE of ∼1 eV with respect to more accurate coupled cluster (CC3) excitation energies. The opposite trend is observed for the subset of n → π* excitation energies for which SA-CASSCF exhibits the least deviations (MAE 0.65 eV). By looking at s-tetrazine in more detail, we conclude that better performance for the n → π* SA-CASSCF excitation energies can be attributed to a fortunate error compensation. For oscillator strengths, SA-CASSCF performs worst for the complete test set (MAE 100%) as well as for the subsets of n → π* (MAE 192%) and π → π* excitations (MAE 84.9%). In general, CASSCF gives the worst performance for excitation energies of all excited-state ab initio methods considered so far due to lacking the major part of dynamic electron correlation, though MC-RPA and TD-DFT (BP86) show similar performance. Among all LR-type methods, LR-CASSCF oscillator strengths are the ones with the least accuracy for the same reason.

General expressions for CIS-CCPT are derived and expanded explicitly to first-order in the wavefunction and second-order in the energy. By virtue of the nature of CCPT this method is a priori size extensive and incorporates infinite-order effects into the wavefunction. This results in a balanced singles space excited state theory that at second-order is an improvement over the ubiquitous CIS(D) method and comparable in quality to equation of motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC). A modest test set composed of the first four excited states from nine small organic molecules was used to quantify the accuracy and consistency of the CIS-CCPT2 excitation energies and density of states. We find that CIS-CCPT2 has a standard deviation error of 0.18 eV for excitation energies and 0.14 eV for density of states compared to EOM-CC, a factor of two better than CIS(D) with a significant reduction in the maximum deviation as well.

HCISCF is then used to study the electronic structure of butadiene, pentacene, and Fe-porphyrin. One of the most striking results of our work is that the converged active space orbitals obtained from HCISCF are relatively insensitive to the accuracy of the HCI calculation. This allows us to obtain nearly converged CASSCF energies with an estimated error of less than 1 mHa using the orbitals obtained from the HCISCF procedure in which the integral transformation is the dominant cost. For example, an HCISCF calculation on the Fe-porphyrin model complex with an active space of (44e, 44o) took only 412 s per iteration on a single node containing 28 cores, out of which 185 s was spent in the HCI calculation and the remaining 227 s was used mainly for integral transformation. Finally, we also show that active space orbitals can be optimized using HCISCF to substantially speed up the convergence of the HCI energy to the Full CI limit because HCI is not invariant to unitary transformations within the active space.",

To shed further light on this issue, the convergence to the basis set limit of CCSD (coupled cluster theory with all single and double excitations) and of different approximate implementations of CCSD-F12 (explicitly correlated CCSD) has been investigated in detail for the W4-17 thermochemical benchmark. Near the CBS ([1-particle] complete basis set) limit, CCSD and CCSD(F12<sup*</sup) agree to within their respective uncertainties (about ±0.04 kcal/mol) due to residual basis set incompleteness error, but a nontrivial difference remains between CCSD-F12b and CCSD(F12<sup*</sup), which is roughly proportional to the degree of static correlation. The observed basis set convergence behavior results from the superposition of a rapidly converging, attractive, CCSD[F12]-CCSD-F12b difference (consisting mostly of third-order terms) and a more slowly converging, repulsive, fourth-order difference between CCSD(F12<sup*</sup) and CCSD[F12].

It is particularly useful for the description of noncovalent interactions where the inclusion of triple excitations is necessary for achieving a satisfactory accuracy. While it is widely used as a benchmark, the accuracy of CCSD(T) interaction energies has not been reliably quantified yet against more accurate calculations. In this work, we compare the CCSD[T], CCSD(T), and CCSD(TQ) noniterative methods with full CCSDTQ and CCSDT(Q) calculations. We investigate various types of noncovalent complexes [hydrogen-bonded (water dimer, ammonia dimer, water ··· ammonia), dispersion-bound (methane dimer, methane ··· ammonia), and π-π stacked (ethene dimer)] using various coupled-clusters schemes up to CCSDTQ in 6-31G*(0.25), 6-31G**(0.25, 0.15), and aug-cc-pVDZ basis sets. We show that CCSDT(Q) reproduces the CCSDTQ results almost exactly and can thus serve as a benchmark in the cases where CCSDTQ calculations are not feasible. Surprisingly, the CCSD[T] method provides better agreement with the benchmark values than the other noniterative analogs, CCSD(T) and CCSD(TQ), and even than the much more expensive iterative CCSDT scheme. The CCSD[T] interaction energies differ from the benchmark data by less than 5 cal/mol on average (for all complexes and all basis sets), whereas the error of CCSD(T) is 9 cal/mol. In larger systems, the difference between these two methods can grow by as much as 0.15 kcal/mol.

Improved algorithms for fast and robust second-order CASSCF convergence.\nA new improved implementation of the second-order multiconfiguration self-consistent field optimization method of Werner and Knowles [J. Chem. Phys. 82, 5053 (1985)] is presented. It differs from the original method by more stable and efficient algorithms for minimizing the second-order energy approximation in the so-called microiterations. Conventionally, this proceeds by alternating optimizations of the orbitals and configuration (CI) coefficients and is linearly convergent. The most difficult part is the orbital optimization, which requires solving a system of nonlinear equations that are often strongly coupled. We present a much improved algorithm for solving this problem, using an iterative subspace method that includes part of the orbital Hessian explicitly, and discuss different strategies for performing the uncoupled optimization in a most efficient manner. Second, we present a new solver in which the orbital-CI coupling is treated explicitly. This leads to quadratic convergence of the microiterations but requires many additional evaluations of reduced (transition) density matrices. In difficult optimization problems with a strong coupling of the orbitals and CI coefficients, it leads to much improved convergence of both the macroiterations and the microiterations. Third, the orbital-CI coupling is treated approximately using a quasi-Newton approach with Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno updates of the orbital Hessian. It is demonstrated that this converges almost as well as the explicitly coupled method but avoids the additional effort for computing many transition density matrices. The performance of the three methods is compared for a set of 21 aromatic molecules, an Fe(ii)-porphine transition metal complex, as well as for the [Cu<sub2</subO<sub2</sub(NH<sub3</sub)  <sub6</sub]<sup2+</sup, FeCl<sub3</sub, Co<sub2</sub(CO)<sub6</subC<sub2</subH<sub2</sub, and Al<sub4</subO<sub2</sub complexes.

We concurrently optimize the molecular ground-state geometry and full wave function-Jastrow factor, orbitals, and configuration interaction coefficients-in variational Monte Carlo (VMC) for the prototypical case of 1,3- trans-butadiene, a small yet theoretically challenging π-conjugated system. We find that the CIPSI selection outperforms the conventional scheme of correlating orbitals within active spaces chosen by chemical intuition: it gives significantly better variational and diffusion Monte Carlo energies for all but the smallest expansions, and much smoother convergence of the geometry with the number of determinants. In particular, the optimal bond lengths and bond-length alternation of butadiene are converged to better than 1 mÅ with just a few thousand determinants, to values very close to the corresponding CCSD(T) results. The combination of CIPSI expansion and VMC optimization represents an affordable tool for the determination of accurate ground-state geometries in quantum Monte Carlo.",

We report an extensive study examining the basis set convergence of post-CCSD(T) contributions (up to CCSDT(Q)) for a diverse set of 28 reaction barrier heights. In contrast to previous studies, we focus here on larger transition structures (TSs) involving 4-7 non-hydrogen atoms. The set of reaction barrier heights includes pericyclic, bipolar cycloaddition, cycloreversion, and multiple-proton transfer reactions. We find that in most cases post-CCSD(T) contributions converge rapidly toward the basis set limit, such that even double-ζ and truncated double-ζ basis sets provide useful estimates of the T-(T) and (Q) contributions, respectively. In addition, we find that due to the tendency of these small basis sets to systematically underestimate the T-(T) and (Q) components, scaling is an effective approach for improving performance. For example, scaling the T-(T)/cc-pVDZ contribution by 1.25 results in an RMSD of merely 0.4 kJ mol<sup-1</sup relative to basis set limit reference values from W3lite-F12 theory. Similarly, calculating the (Q) contribution with a cc-pVDZ basis set without d functions and scaling by 1.6 results in an RMSD of 0.5 kJ mol<sup-1</sup. We also examine the magnitude of post-CCSD(T) contributions for a wide range of TSs. We find that for pericyclic, bipolar cycloaddition, and multiple-proton transfer reactions there is an effective cancellation between the T-(T) and (Q) components (i.e., they have opposite signs and are of similar magnitude), such that overall post-CCSD(T) contributions to the reaction barrier heights are below ∼1 kJ mol<sup-1</sup (in absolute value). However, for the barrier heights of cycloreversion reactions, the T-(T) and (Q) components are both negative and large and consequentially post-CCSD(T) contributions reduce the reaction barrier heights by significant amounts ranging between 4.1 and 6.7 kJ mol<sup-1</sup.",

The Lorentz law is the universal expression of the force exerted by electromagnetic fields on a volume containing a distribution of electrical charges and currents. If electric and magnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are traditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and magnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current densities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current densities, respectively. In this way, Maxwell's macroscopic equations are reduced to his microscopic equations, and the Lorentz law is expected to provide a precise expression of the electromagnetic force density on material bodies at all points in space and time. This Letter presents incontrovertible theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity. We argue that the Lorentz law must be abandoned in favor of a more general expression of the electromagnetic force density, such as the one discovered by Einstein and Laub in 1908. Not only is the Einstein-Laub formula consistent with special relativity, it also solves the long-standing problem of \"hidden momentum\" in classical electrodynamics.",

The effect also provides a means to determine to a few per cent the body-frame dipole moment of CO+, thus establishing a method for measuring dipole moments of molecular ions for which few comparably accurate measurements exist.

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

Problematic aspects regarding variations in collection efficiency over the accepted momentum phase space are addressed and a methodology for their correction presented.

In particular, these systems can be used to detect energy depositions many orders of magnitude below typical ionization scales. As illustrations, we suggest some applications in particle physics. We outline a nondestructive time-of-flight measurement capable of sub-eV energy resolution for slowly moving, collimated particles.

In this work, effects of a uniform homogeneous external electric field on some characteristic one-electron properties of simple molecules are analyzed. EMDs and ESPs were used to understand the response of water, hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide, chloroacetylene, and ammonia in an electric field. Remarkably, the EMD maxima for these molecules get rotated as the electric field strength is varied. A greater order of change in EMD than in ESP with increasing electric field strength brings out the sensitivity of the EMDs, especially for the valence electronic region, which in the momentum space is mapped onto the vicinity of its origin. The eigenvectors of the EMD Hessian maxima at the momentum-space origin are seen to rotate as a function of increasing field strength, with the extra angular momentum imparted by the field manifesting itself as reconfiguration of the EMD distribution. In the presence of the field, valence states may couple with higher electronic states, leading to a mixing of the states resulting in avoided crossings as a function of the field strength.

This first article presents a model-based, hidden variable analysis of quantum theory that provides the statistical nature of wave functions. The analysis uses the equations of classical electro-magnetism and conservation of energy while modeling an eigenstate electron as a nonlocal entity. Essential to the analysis are physical properties that were discovered and analyzed only after the historical interpretation of quantum mechanics was established: electron non-locality and the standing electro-magnetic energy that accompanies and encompasses an active, electrically small volume. The standing energy produces a driving radiation reaction force that, under certain circumstances, is many orders of magnitude larger than currently accepted values. These properties provide a sufficient basis for the Schrödinger equation as a descriptor of non-relativistic eigenstate electrons in or near equilibrium.

This CPT invariance implies that the fundamental properties of antiparticles and their matter-conjugates are identical, apart from signs. There is a deep link between CPT invariance and Lorentz symmetry--that is, the laws of nature seem to be invariant under the symmetry transformation of spacetime--although it is model dependent. A number of high-precision CPT and Lorentz invariance tests--using a co-magnetometer, a torsion pendulum and a maser, among others--have been performed, but only a few direct high-precision CPT tests that compare the fundamental properties of matter and antimatter are available. Here we report high-precision cyclotron frequency comparisons of a single antiproton and a negatively charged hydrogen ion (H(-)) carried out in a Penning trap system. From 13,000 frequency measurements we compare the charge-to-mass ratio for the antiproton (q/m)p- to that for the proton (q/m)p and obtain (q/m)p-/(q/m)p − 1 =1(69) × 10(-12). The measurements were performed at cyclotron frequencies of 29.6 megahertz, so our result shows that the CPT theorem holds at the atto-electronvolt scale. Our precision of 69 parts per trillion exceeds the energy resolution of previous antiproton-to-proton mass comparisons as well as the respective figure of merit of the standard model extension by a factor of four. In addition, we give a limit on sidereal variations in the measured ratio of &lt;720 parts per trillion. By following the arguments of ref. 11, our result can be interpreted as a stringent test of the weak equivalence principle of general relativity using baryonic antimatter, and it sets a new limit on the gravitational anomaly parameter of |α − 1| &lt; 8.7 × 10(-7).",

One advantage of the proposed formulation is that it sidesteps the long-standing Abraham-Minkowski controversy surrounding the electromagnetic momentum inside a material medium by simply \"assigning\" the Abraham momentum density E(r,t)xH(r,t)/c2 to the electromagnetic field. This well-defined momentum is thus taken to be universal as it does not depend on whether the field is propagating or evanescent, and whether or not the host medium is homogeneous, transparent, isotropic, dispersive, magnetic, linear, etc. In other words, the local and instantaneous momentum density is uniquely and unambiguously specified at each and every point of the material system in terms of the E and H fields residing at that point.

Our energy-minimizing approach extends the advantages of particle tracking to situations where particle imaging velocimetry and digital imaging correlation are typically required. This approach is much more reliable than the standard squared-displacement minimizing approach for spatially-correlated displacements that are larger than the typical interparticle spacing. Thus, it is suitable for particles embedded in a material undergoing large deformations. On the other hand, squared-displacement minimization is more effective for particles undergoing uncorrelated random motion.

By studying charged particles moving in conservative central force fields, it is shown that the process of radiation emission can be treated as a frictional process that withdraws mechanical energy from the moving particles and that dissipates the radiation energy in the environment. When the dissipation occurs inside natural (eye) or technical photon detectors, detection events are produced which form observational images of the underlying mechanical motion. As the individual events, in which radiation is emitted and detected, represent pieces of physical action that add onto the physical action associated with the mechanical motion itself, observation appears as a physical overhead that is burdened onto the mechanical motion. We show that such overheads are minimized by particles following Hamilton's equations of motion. In this way, trajectories with minimum curvature are selected and dissipative processes connected with their observation are minimized. The minimum action principles which lie at the heart of Hamilton's equations of motion thereby appear as principles of minimum energy dissipation and/or minimum information gain.

The energy of a particle varies between species but is independent of where it is placed. Placement of one particle changes the open-slot configuration for particles of all species. This statistical interaction is encoded in a generalized Pauli principle, from which the multiplicity of states for a given particle combination is determined and used for the exact statistical mechanical analysis. Particles from all species belong to one of four categories: compacts, hosts, tags, or hybrids. Compacts and hosts find open slots in segments of pseudovacuum. Tags find open slots inside hosts. Hybrids are tags with hosting capability. In the taxonomy of particles proposed here, \"species\" is indicative of structure and \"category\" indicative of function.

Building on these results, we describe for a wide range of experimental scenarios how to choose experimental parameters in order to optimize the precision.

Our analysis is based on a multi-scale turning angle model to characterize motion locally, together with a Hidden Markov Model with two states representing different directional persistence. We define one of the states by the motion of particles in a reference data set where some active processes have been inhibited. We illustrate the usefulness of the method by studying transport of vesicles along microtubules and transport of nanospheres activated by myosin. We study the results using mean square displacements, durations, and particle speeds within each state. We conclude that the method provides accurate identification of states of motion with different directional persistence, with very good agreement in terms of mean-squared displacement between the reference data set and one of the states in the two-state model.

Due to the shot noise characteristics of the photon generation process, this model uses a Poisson distribution to capture the measurement noise inherent in imaging. In order to apply our time-varying approach to the UKF, we first need to transform the measurements into a model with additive Gaussian noise. This is carried out using a variance stabilizing transform.

The comparison further includes an analysis of the application of the measures to a classical ideal gas and a compressible fluid.

A detailed derivation is formulated in a bottom-up manner by considering the thermodynamics of small systems with the appropriate consideration of the fluctuations. Connected to the local volume is a local density and corresponding local pressure, which is determined from an equation-of-state based force field that depends also on a particle temperature. Compared to the original DPDE method, the formulation of the generalised DPDE method requires a change in the independent variable from the particle internal energy to the particle entropy. As part of the re-formulation, the terms dressed particle entropy and the corresponding dressed particle temperature are introduced, which depict the many-body contributions in the local volume. The generalised DPDE method has similarities to the energy form of the smoothed dissipative particle dynamics method, yet fundamental differences exist, which are described in the manuscript. The basic dynamic equations are presented along with practical considerations for implementing the generalised DPDE method, including a numerical integration scheme based on the Shardlow-like splitting algorithm. Demonstrations and validation tests are performed using analytical equation-of-states for the van der Waals and Lennard-Jones fluids. Particle probability distributions are analysed, where excellent agreement with theoretical estimates is demonstrated.

Within this framework, there are two important considerations. The first one refers to the generic assumption that the observations are temporally independent given the sequence of object states. The second consideration, often made in the literature, uses the transition prior as the proposal distribution. Thus, the current observations are not taken into account, requiring the noise process of this prior to be large enough to handle abrupt trajectory changes. As a result, many particles are either wasted in low likelihood regions of the state space, resulting in low sampling efficiency, or more importantly, propagated to distractor regions of the image, resulting in tracking failures. In this paper, we propose to handle both considerations using motion. We first argue that, in general, observations are conditionally correlated, and propose a new model to account for this correlation, allowing for the natural introduction of implicit and/or explicit motion measurements in the likelihood term. Second, explicit motion measurements are used to drive the sampling process towards the most likely regions of the state space. Overall, the proposed model handles abrupt motion changes and filters out visual distractors, when tracking objects with generic models based on shape or color distribution. Results were obtained on head tracking experiments using several sequences with moving camera involving large dynamics. When compared against the Condensation Algorithm, they have demonstrated the superior tracking performance of our approach.",

Lett. 47, 145 (1999)] or (with probability 1-P) with a thermostat that is introduced here, which is based on a pairwise interaction similar to the Nosé-Hoover thermostat. When the pairwise Nosé-Hoover thermostat dominates (low P), the liquid has a high diffusion coefficient and low viscosity, but when the Lowe-Andersen thermostat dominates, the diffusion coefficient is low and viscosity is high. This novel Nosé-Hoover-Lowe-Andersen thermostat is Galilean invariant and preserves both total linear and angular momentum of the system, due to the fact that the thermostatic forces between each pair of the particles are pairwise additive and central. We show by simulation that this thermostat also preserves hydrodynamics. For the (noninteracting) ideal gas at P = 0, the diffusion coefficient diverges and viscosity is zero, while for P &gt; 0 it has a finite value. By adjusting probability P, the Schmidt number can be varied by orders of magnitude. The temperature deviation from the required value is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), while the equilibrium properties of the system are very well reproduced. The thermostat is easy to implement and offers a computational efficiency better than (DPD), with better temperature control and greater flexibility in terms of adjusting the diffusion coefficient and viscosity of the simulated system. Applications of this thermostat include all standard molecular dynamic simulations of dense liquids and solids with any type of force field, as well as hydrodynamic simulation of multiphase systems with largely different bulk viscosities, including surface viscosity, and of dilute gases and plasmas.",

By studying charged particles moving in conservative central force fields, it is shown that the process of radiation emission can be treated as a frictional process that withdraws mechanical energy from the moving particles and that dissipates the radiation energy in the environment. When the dissipation occurs inside natural (eye) or technical photon detectors, detection events are produced which form observational images of the underlying mechanical motion. As the individual events, in which radiation is emitted and detected, represent pieces of physical action that add onto the physical action associated with the mechanical motion itself, observation appears as a physical overhead that is burdened onto the mechanical motion. We show that such overheads are minimized by particles following Hamilton's equations of motion. In this way, trajectories with minimum curvature are selected and dissipative processes connected with their observation are minimized. The minimum action principles which lie at the heart of Hamilton's equations of motion thereby appear as principles of minimum energy dissipation and/or minimum information gain.

Particles and elements of the pseudovacuum are characterized by motifs (patterns of several consecutive site variables). Particles are floating objects that can be placed into open slots on the lattice. Open slots are recognized as permissible links between motifs. The energy of a particle varies between species but is independent of where it is placed. Placement of one particle changes the open-slot configuration for particles of all species. This statistical interaction is encoded in a generalized Pauli principle, from which the multiplicity of states for a given particle combination is determined and used for the exact statistical mechanical analysis. Particles from all species belong to one of four categories: compacts, hosts, tags, or hybrids. Compacts and hosts find open slots in segments of pseudovacuum. Tags find open slots inside hosts. Hybrids are tags with hosting capability. In the taxonomy of particles proposed here, \"species\" is indicative of structure and \"category\" indicative of function.

We therefore ask to what extent the concept of effective temperature is valid.

In contrast to many-particle systems, in which it is difficult to measure and predict fluctuations, our system has no particle-particle interactions and its dynamics can be captured fully by video imaging. Surprisingly, we find that the sphere behaves exactly like a harmonically bound brownian particle.

Building on these results, we describe for a wide range of experimental scenarios how to choose experimental parameters in order to optimize the precision.

Our analysis is based on a multi-scale turning angle model to characterize motion locally, together with a Hidden Markov Model with two states representing different directional persistence. We define one of the states by the motion of particles in a reference data set where some active processes have been inhibited. We illustrate the usefulness of the method by studying transport of vesicles along microtubules and transport of nanospheres activated by myosin. We study the results using mean square displacements, durations, and particle speeds within each state. We conclude that the method provides accurate identification of states of motion with different directional persistence, with very good agreement in terms of mean-squared displacement between the reference data set and one of the states in the two-state model.

Due to the shot noise characteristics of the photon generation process, this model uses a Poisson distribution to capture the measurement noise inherent in imaging. In order to apply our time-varying approach to the UKF, we first need to transform the measurements into a model with additive Gaussian noise. This is carried out using a variance stabilizing transform. Results from simulations show that our approach is successful in tracing time-varying diffusion constants at a range of physically relevant signal levels.

Although, in general, particle filtering methods yield improved results, it is difficult to achieve real time performance. In this paper, we analyze the computational drawbacks of traditional particle filtering algorithms, and present a method for implementing the particle filter using the Independent Metropolis Hastings sampler, that is highly amenable to pipelined implementations and parallelization. We analyze the implementations of the proposed algorithm, and, in particular, concentrate on implementations that have minimum processing times. It is shown that the design parameters for the fastest implementation can be chosen by solving a set of convex programs.

The paper presents some methods to track the movement of two types of objects: arbitrary objects and humans. Both problems estimate the state density function of an object using particle filters.

Connected to the local volume is a local density and corresponding local pressure, which is determined from an equation-of-state based force field that depends also on a particle temperature. Compared to the original DPDE method, the formulation of the generalised DPDE method requires a change in the independent variable from the particle internal energy to the particle entropy. As part of the re-formulation, the terms dressed particle entropy and the corresponding dressed particle temperature are introduced, which depict the many-body contributions in the local volume. The generalised DPDE method has similarities to the energy form of the smoothed dissipative particle dynamics method, yet fundamental differences exist, which are described in the manuscript. The basic dynamic equations are presented along with practical considerations for implementing the generalised DPDE method, including a numerical integration scheme based on the Shardlow-like splitting algorithm.

In equilibrium, the system has a continuous phase transition from a low-energy magnetized phase, in which the particles are clustered on the spherical surface, to a high-energy homogeneous phase.

Within this framework, there are two important considerations. The first one refers to the generic assumption that the observations are temporally independent given the sequence of object states. The second consideration, often made in the literature, uses the transition prior as the proposal distribution. Thus, the current observations are not taken into account, requiring the noise process of this prior to be large enough to handle abrupt trajectory changes. As a result, many particles are either wasted in low likelihood regions of the state space, resulting in low sampling efficiency, or more importantly, propagated to distractor regions of the image, resulting in tracking failures. In this paper, we propose to handle both considerations using motion. We first argue that, in general, observations are conditionally correlated, and propose a new model to account for this correlation, allowing for the natural introduction of implicit and/or explicit motion measurements in the likelihood term. Second, explicit motion measurements are used to drive the sampling process towards the most likely regions of the state space. Overall, the proposed model handles abrupt motion changes and filters out visual distractors, when tracking objects with generic models based on shape or color distribution. Results were obtained on head tracking experiments using several sequences with moving camera involving large dynamics. When compared against the Condensation Algorithm, they have demonstrated the superior tracking performance of our approach.",

We present a new nonlinear filter for continuous-time measurements with a much more general stochastic measurement model. It integrates to Bayes' rule over short time intervals and provides Bayes-optimal estimates from quantized, intermittent, or ambiguous sensor measurements. The filter has a close link to Information Theory, and we show that the rate of change of entropy of the density estimate is equal to the mutual information between the measurement and the state and thus the maximum achievable.

Each pair of particles is thermostated either (with probability P) with a pairwise Lowe-Andersen thermostat [C. P. Lowe, Europhys. Lett. 47, 145 (1999)] or (with probability 1-P) with a thermostat that is introduced here, which is based on a pairwise interaction similar to the Nosé-Hoover thermostat. When the pairwise Nosé-Hoover thermostat dominates (low P), the liquid has a high diffusion coefficient and low viscosity, but when the Lowe-Andersen thermostat dominates, the diffusion coefficient is low and viscosity is high. This novel Nosé-Hoover-Lowe-Andersen thermostat is Galilean invariant and preserves both total linear and angular momentum of the system, due to the fact that the thermostatic forces between each pair of the particles are pairwise additive and central. We show by simulation that this thermostat also preserves hydrodynamics. For the (noninteracting) ideal gas at P = 0, the diffusion coefficient diverges and viscosity is zero, while for P &gt; 0 it has a finite value. By adjusting probability P, the Schmidt number can be varied by orders of magnitude. The temperature deviation from the required value is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), while the equilibrium properties of the system are very well reproduced. The thermostat is easy to implement and offers a computational efficiency better than (DPD), with better temperature control and greater flexibility in terms of adjusting the diffusion coefficient and viscosity of the simulated system. Applications of this thermostat include all standard molecular dynamic simulations of dense liquids and solids with any type of force field, as well as hydrodynamic simulation of multiphase systems with largely different bulk viscosities, including surface viscosity, and of dilute gases and plasmas.",

However, preliminary results presented here indicates that time scale goes as N2 for a different type of initial condition.

Three hundred thirty mainly strong lines are assigned to pure rotational transitions in the (100), (001), and (020) vibrational states.

Transitions in (020) are assigned up to Ka = 18, compared with the maximum Ka of 10 known previously. Crossings of vibration-rotation energy levels result in the observation of extra intensity-stealing transitions.

The observed transitions were analyzed together with hitherto unassigned transitions from measurements between 78 and 118 GHz. About 1900 rotational transitions of OCCCS in the vibrational ground state and in 13 excited bending states could be assigned, the latter including the eighth, ninth, and tenth excited state of the low-lying bending mode nu(7) as well as the second excited state of the bending mode nu(6). Besides the determination of effective constants for these newly identified vibrational states, our data also served to considerably improve the effective constants for some of the bending states already characterized in previous publications.

We observe a strong phase change when scanning the radio frequency through molecular resonance.

Direct absorption from the lowest singlet state a1A1 to c1A1 occurs in the near UV, but it is weak because it corresponds to a two electron transition between the dominant single configuration approximations to the electronic wave functions. Some absorption lines in the c-a system were originally reported in 1966 [G. Herzberg and J. W. C. Johns, Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 295, 107 (1966)], but the weak spectra could not be assigned at the time. Interest in the c1A(1) state was rekindled by recent ab initio results [S. N. Yurchenko, P. Jensen, Y. Li, R. J. Buenker, and P. R. Bunker, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 208, 136 (2001)] which prompted the present work. The new spectra provide accurate energies for rotational levels in the v2linear =11,l = 1 level of the state, and permit assignment of most of the line positions measured by Herzberg and Johns. The double-resonance technique used may be easily extended to the measurement of lower rovibrational levels in the electronic state and possibly also to access the d1A2 state which is theoretically expected to lie at similar energies but, for symmetry reasons, is not accessible from the lowest singlet state in a single electric-dipole transition.",

About 11 000 observed line positions of (13)C(16)O(2) selected from the literature have been used to derive 84 parameters of a reduced effective Hamiltonian globally describing all known vibrational-rotational energy levels in the ground electronic state.

The standard deviations of the fits are 3.2 and 12.0% for these regions, respectively. The quality of the fittings and the extrapolation properties of the fitted parameters are discussed.

In order to resolve the disagreement, have performed high-precision variational calculations in Hylleraas coordinates.

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

We have studied excited-state orbits of electron-ion pair to analyze the consequences of the MDP on the classical Coulomb catastrophe. From the optimized ground-state energies, we find that the experimental first- and second-ionization energies are fairly well predicted.

Within nine charge population schemes (Löwdin, Mulliken, Becke, Hirshfeld, CM5, Hirshfeld-I, NPA, CHELPG, MK-ESP) in common use, the charge fluctuation contribution is found to dominate the molecular polarizability, with its ratio ranging from 59.9% with the Hirshfeld or CM5 scheme to 96.2% with the Mulliken scheme.

The calculations applied the supermolecular coupled-cluster method with single, double, and noniterative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] and very large orbital basis sets-up to augmented quintuple zeta size supplemented with bond functions. The same basis sets were used in symmetry-adapted perturbation theory calculations performed mainly for larger separations to provide an independent check of the supermolecular approach. The contributions beyond CCSD(T) were computed using the full configuration interaction method and basis sets up to augmented triple zeta plus midbond size. All the calculations were followed by extrapolations to complete basis set limits. For two representative points, calculations were also performed using basis sets with the cardinal number increased by one or two. For the same two points, we have also solved the Schrodinger equation directly using four-electron explicitly correlated Gaussian (ECG) functions. These additional calculations allowed us to estimate the uncertainty in the interaction energies used to fit the potential to be about 0.15 K or 0.3% at the minimum of the potential well. This accuracy is about an order of magnitude better than that achieved by earlier potentials for this system. For a near-minimum T-shaped configuration with the center-of-mass distance R=6.4 bohrs, the ECG calculations give the interaction energy of -56.91+/-0.06 K, whereas the orbital calculations in the basis set used for all the points give -56.96+/-0.16 K. The computed points were fitted by an analytic four-dimensional potential function. The uncertainties in the fit relative to the ab initio energies are almost always smaller than the estimated uncertainty in the latter energies. The global minimum of the fit is -57.12 K for the T-shaped configuration at R=6.34 bohrs. The fit was applied to compute the second virial coefficient using a path-integral Monte Carlo approach. The achieved agreement with experiment is substantially better than in any previous work.",

Reference data included the gas-phase geometries and energies of the water molecule, small water clusters, the hydronium ion, and small hydronium ion-water clusters, as well as the gas-phase potential energy surface for proton transfer between the two water molecules in a Zundel ion, all calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.

This first article presents a model-based, hidden variable analysis of quantum theory that provides the statistical nature of wave functions. The analysis uses the equations of classical electro-magnetism and conservation of energy while modeling an eigenstate electron as a nonlocal entity. Essential to the analysis are physical properties that were discovered and analyzed only after the historical interpretation of quantum mechanics was established: electron non-locality and the standing electro-magnetic energy that accompanies and encompasses an active, electrically small volume. The standing energy produces a driving radiation reaction force that, under certain circumstances, is many orders of magnitude larger than currently accepted values. These properties provide a sufficient basis for the Schrödinger equation as a descriptor of non-relativistic eigenstate electrons in or near equilibrium.

Our algorithm combines the approaches of (i) solid-state grid-based algorithms using self-energies and (ii) the complex Kohn method from electron-molecule scattering. For the general problem of a molecular target with n-electrons, our algorithm should ideally solve for electronic transmission with a computational cost scaling as n(2), although the present implementation is limited to one-dimensional problems. In this paper, we implement our algorithm to solve three one-dimensional model problems involving two electrons: (i) Single-channel resonant transmission through a double-barrier well (DBW), where the target already contains one bound-state electron [Rejec et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 075311 (2003)]; (ii) multichannel resonant transmission through a DBW, where the incoming electron can exchange energy with the bound electron; (iii) transmission through a triple-barrier well (TBW), where the incoming electron can knock forward the bound electron, yielding a physical model of electron-assisted electron transfer. This article offers some insight about the role and size of exchange and correlation effects in molecular conduction, where few such rigorous calculations have yet been made. Such multibody effects have already been experimentally identified in mesoscopic electron transport, giving rise to the \"0.7 anomaly,\" whereby electrons traveling through a narrow channel pair up as singlets and triplets. We expect the effect of electronic correlation to be even more visible for conduction through molecules, where electrons should partially localize into bonding and antibonding orbitals.",

Despite all this interest, there is still considerable debate over the molecular structure of the hydrated electron: does it occupy a cavity, have a significant number of interior water molecules, or have a structure somewhere in between? The reason for all this debate is that different computer simulations have produced each of these different structures, yet the predicted properties for these different structures are still in reasonable agreement with experiment. In this Feature Article, we explore the reasons underlying why different structures are produced when different pseudopotentials are used in quantum simulations of the hydrated electron. We also show that essentially all the different models for the hydrated electron, including those from fully ab initio calculations, have relatively little direct overlap of the electron's wave function with the nearby water molecules. Thus, a non-cavity hydrated electron is better thought of as an \"inverse plum pudding\" model, with interior waters that locally expel the surrounding electron's charge density. Finally, we also explore the agreement between different hydrated electron models and certain key experiments, such as resonance Raman spectroscopy and the temperature dependence and degree of homogeneous broadening of the optical absorption spectrum, in order to distinguish between the different simulated structures. Taken together, we conclude that the hydrated electron likely has a significant number of interior water molecules. ",

What is not generally appreciated is that Bohr's original semiclassical conception differed significantly from the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory and offers an alternative semiclassical approximation scheme with remarkable attributes. More specifically, Bohr's original method did not impose action quantization constraints but rather obtained these as predictions by simply matching photon and classical orbital frequencies. In other words, the hydrogen atom was treated entirely classically and orbital quantized emerged directly from the Planck-Einstein photon quantization condition, E = h nu. Here, we revisit this early history of quantum theory and demonstrate the application of Bohr's original strategy to the three quintessential quantum systems: an electron in a box, an electron in a ring, and a dipolar harmonic oscillator. The usual energy-level spectra, and optical selection rules, emerge by solving an algebraic (quadratic) equation, rather than a Bohr-Sommerfeld integral (or Schroedinger) equation. However, the new predictions include a frozen (zero-kinetic-energy) state which in some (but not all) cases lies below the usual zero-point energy.

Another outstanding feature is that the population of each ENO varies as the chemical reaction proceeds, keeping the total population constant though. The study of ENOs has been driven by the need for new methods to analyze extremely complicated nonadiabatic electron wavepackets such as those embedded in highly quasi-degenerate excited-state manifolds. Yet, ENOs can be applied to scrutinize many other chemical reactions, ranging from the ordinary concerted reactions, nonadiabatic reactions, and Woodward-Hoffman forbidden reactions, to excited-state reactions.

Within the memory kernel, the diabatic coupling is treated perturbatively and a second order expansion is found to give a simple closed form expression for the kernel. The accuracy of the second order truncation is maximized by performing a fixed rotation of the diabatic electronic states that minimizes the first order free energy of the system and thus minimizes the effect of the perturbation on the thermodynamics. The resulting two-hop Langevin equation (THLE) is then validated by applying it to a simple spin-boson model, where exact results exist. Excellent agreement is found in a wide parameter range, even where the perturbation is moderately strong. Results obtained in the rotated electronic basis are found to be consistently more accurate than those from the unrotated basis. These benchmark calculations also allow us to demonstrate the advantage of treating the population fluctuations instead of the populations as the relevant variables, as only the former lead to reliable results at long time. Thus, the THLE appears to provide a viable alternative to established methods--such as Ehrenfest dynamics or surface hopping--for the treatment of nonadiabatic effects in electron transfer simulations.",

However, it is computationally expensive to perform geometry optimizations for enormous conformers. In this study, we introduce the gray-box optimization (GBO) framework, which enables optimal control over the entire geometry optimization process, among multiple conformers. Algorithms designed for GBO roughly estimate energetically preferable conformers during their geometry optimization iterations. They then preferentially compute promising conformers. To evaluate the performance of the GBO framework, we applied it to a test set consisting of seven dipeptides and mycophenolic acid to determine their stable conformations at the density functional theory level. We thus preferentially obtained energetically favorable conformations. Furthermore, the computational costs required to find the most stable conformation were significantly reduced (approximately 1% on average, compared to the naive approach for the dipeptides).",

The experimental study, with gas-phase cryogenic ion vibrational predissociation (CIVP) spectroscopy, solid-state Fourier transfer infrared (FT-IR), and single-crystal X-ray crystallography, is accompanied by density functional theory calculations, including an extensive search and analysis of accessible conformations. We begin with the unsubstituted molecular torsion balance, and then step up the complexity systematically by adding alkyl groups incrementally as dispersion energy donors (DEDs) to achieve a degree of chemical complexity comparable to what is typically found in transition states for many regio- and stereoselective reactions in organic and organometallic chemistry. We find clear evidence for the small attractive contribution by DEDs, as had been reported in other studies, but we also find that small individual contributions by London dispersion, when they operate in opposition to other weak noncovalent interactions, produce composite effects on the structure that are difficult to predict intuitively, or by modern quantum chemical calculations. The experimentally observed structures, together with a reasonable value for a reference cation-π interaction, indicate that the pairwise interaction between two <itert</i-butyl groups, in the best case, is modest. Moreover, the visualization of the conformational space, and comparison to spectroscopic indicators of the structure, as one steps up the complexity of the manifold of noncovalent interactions, makes clear that in silico predictive ability for the structure of moderately large, flexible, organic molecules falters sooner than one might have expected.",

It is based on the Foster-Boys orbital localization method, whereby we automatically identify lone pairs and π orbitals as possible protonation sites. The method becomes efficient in conjunction with the robust and fast GFN-xTB semiempirical method proposed recently (Grimme et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017, 13, 1989). The protonated isomers that are found within a few seconds to minutes of computational wall-time on a standard desktop computer are then energetically refined using density functional theory (DFT), where we use a high-level double-hybrid reference method to benchmark GFN-xTB and low-cost DFT approaches. The proposed DFT/GFN-xTB/LMO composite protocol is generally applicable to almost arbitrary molecules including transition metal complexes. Importantly it is found that even in electronically complicated cases, the GFN-xTB optimized protomer structures are reasonable and can safely be used in single-point DFT calculations. Corrections from energy to free energy mostly have a small effect on computed protomer populations. The resulting protomer equilibrium is valuable, for example, in the context of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry where it may help identify the ionized species and assist the interpretation of the experiment. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The main danger is that nonlinear optimizations of both the wavefunction and the molecular geometry may converge to higher local minima or to saddle points, producing misleading results. For instance, some of the calculated molecular geometries of ferrocene in the aforementioned paper correspond to an SCF solution that converged to an excited state. This is the cause of the apparent large variation in the calculated iron-ring distance with the basis set. Another problem we noticed is that the source of the diffuse functions used in the earlier work in connection with the 6-31G and 6-311G basis sets for transition metals is not specified in the literature or the program manual. They are also a poor match for the 6-31G basis set.

A key problem herein is to routinely generate conformers for these molecules due to their complexity and manifold of possible coordination patterns. In this study we used our recently published CREST protocol [Pracht et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2020, 22, 7169-7192] to generate conformer ensembles for a variety of 40 challenging transition metal containing molecules, which were then used to form a comprehensive conformational energy benchmark set termed TMCONF40. Several low-cost semiempirical, density functional theory (DFT) and force-field methods were compared to high level DLPNO-CCSD(T1) and double-hybrid DFT reference values. Close attention was paid to the energetic ordering of the conformers in the statistical evaluation. With respect to the double-hybrid references, both tested low-cost composite DFT methods produce high Pearson correlation coefficients of rp,mean,B97-3c//B97-3c = 0.922 and rp,mean,PBEh-3c//B97-3c = 0.890, with mean absolute deviations close to or below 1 kcal mol-1. This good performance also holds for a comparison to DLPNO-CCSD(T1) reference energies for a smaller subset termed TMCONF5. Based on DFT geometries, the GFNn-xTB methods yield reasonable Pearson correlation coefficients of rp,mean,GFN1-xTB//B97-3c = 0.617 (MADmean = 2.15 kcal mol-1) and rp,mean,GFN2-xTB//B97-3c = 0.567 (MADmean = 2.68 kcal mol-1), outperforming the widely used PMx methods on the TMCONF40 test set. Employing the low-cost composite DFT method B97-3c on GFN2-xTB geometries yields an slightly improved correlation of rp,mean,B97-3c//GFN2-xTB = 0.632. Furthermore, for 68% of the investigated complexes at least one low-energy conformer was found that is more stable than the respective crystal structure conformation, which signals the importance of conformational studies.

We optimize a portion of an ensemble of conformationally flexible lysozyme structures obtained from highly accurate X-ray crystallography data that serve as a reliable benchmark. We not only analyze root-mean-square deviations from the experimental Cartesian coordinates, but also, for the first time, demonstrate how London dispersion and BSSE influence crystallographic R factors.

Not only are statistical errors on average lower with HF-D3-gCP, but also the convergence behavior is much better. In particular, we show that the BP86/6-31G* approach should not be relied upon as a black-box method, despite its widespread use, as its success is based on an unpredictable cancellation of errors.

For example, calculated redox potentials are sensitive to density functional choice and often fall short of the desired accuracy. Thus, ranges of errors for computed redox potentials between different density functionals can become quite large. The current study presents a cost-effective protocol that utilizes effective error cancellation schemes in order to accurately predict the redox potentials of a wide range of organic molecules. This computational protocol, called CBH-Redox, is an extension of the connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH) method, and produces thermochemical data with near-G4 accuracy. Herein, we test the CBH-Redox protocol against both experimental and G4 reference values and compare these results to DFT alone. Considering 46 C, O, N, F, Cl, and S atom-containing molecules, when using the CBH-Redox correction scheme, the MAEs for all eight density functionals tested are within the 0.09 V target accuracy versus both experiment and G4. Moreover, CBH-Redox achieves an impressive accuracy, with a MAE of 0.05 V or below when compared to G4 for six of the eight density functionals tested.

They continue to inspire synthetic efforts and \"crystal engineering\", with implications ranging from fundamental questions to pharmaceutical research. The structural complexity of molecular solids is linked with diverse intermolecular interactions: hydrogen bonding with all its facets, halogen bonding, and other secondary bonding mechanisms of recent interest (and debate). Today, high-resolution diffraction experiments allow unprecedented insight into the structures of molecular crystals. Despite their usefulness, however, these experiments also face problems: hydrogen atoms are challenging to locate, and thermal effects may complicate matters. Moreover, even if the structure of a crystal is precisely known, this does not yet reveal the nature and strength of the intermolecular forces that hold it together. In this Account, we show that periodic plane-wave-based density functional theory (DFT) can be a useful, and sometimes unexpected, complement to molecular crystallography. Initially developed in the solid-state physics communities to treat inorganic solids, periodic DFT can be applied to molecular crystals just as well: theoretical structural optimizations \"help out\" by accurately localizing the elusive hydrogen atoms, reaching neutron-diffraction quality with much less expensive measurement equipment. In addition, phonon computations, again developed by physicists, can quantify the thermal motion of atoms and thus predict anisotropic displacement parameters and ORTEP ellipsoids \"from scratch\". But the synergy between experiment and theory goes much further than that. Once a structure has been accurately determined, computations give new and detailed insights into the aforementioned intermolecular interactions. For example, it has been debated whether short hydrogen bonds in solids have covalent character, and we have added a new twist to this discussion using an orbital-based theory that once more had been developed for inorganic solids. However, there is more to a crystal structure than a handful of short contacts between neighboring residues. We hence have used dimensionally resolved analyses to dissect crystalline networks in a systematic fashion, one spatial direction at a time. Initially applied to hydrogen bonding, these techniques can be seamlessly extended to halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonding, quantifying bond strength and cooperativity in truly infinite networks. Finally, these methods promise to be useful for (bio)polymers, as we have recently exemplified for α-chitin. At the interface of increasingly accurate and popular DFT methods, ever-improving crystallographic expertise, and new challenging, chemical questions, we believe that combined experimental and theoretical studies of molecular crystals are just beginning to pick up speed.",

In MQC calculations, the quantum and classical degrees of freedom are coupled together using pseudopotentials. Although most pseudopotentials are developed empirically, there are methods for deriving pseudopotentials using the results of quantum chemistry calculations, which guarantee that the explicitly-treated valence electron wave functions remain orthogonal to the implicitly-treated core electron orbitals. Whether empirical or analytically derived in nature, to date all such pseudopotentials have been subject to the frozen core approximation (FCA) that ignores how changes in the nuclear coordinates alter the core orbitals, which in turn affects the wave function of the valence electrons. In this paper, we present a way to go beyond the FCA by developing pseudopotentials that respond to these changes. In other words, we show how to derive an analytic expression for a pseudopotential that is an explicit function of nuclear coordinates, thus accounting for the polarization effects experienced by atomic cores in different chemical environments. We then use this formalism to develop a coordinate-dependent pseudopotential for the bonding electron of the sodium dimer cation molecule and we show how the analytic representation of this potential can be used in one-electron MQC simulations that provide the accuracy of a fully quantum mechanical Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation at all internuclear separations. We also show that one-electron MQC simulations of Na(2)(+) using our coordinate-dependent pseudopotential provide a significant advantage in accuracy compared to frozen core potentials with no additional computational expense. This is because use of a frozen core potential produces a charge density for the bonding electron of Na(2)(+) that is too localized on the molecule, leading to significant overbinding of the valence electron. This means that FCA calculations are subject to inaccuracies of order ~10% in the calculated bond length and vibrational frequency of the molecule relative to a full HF calculation; these errors are fully corrected by using our coordinate-dependent pseudopotential. Overall, our findings indicate that even for molecules like Na(2)(+), which have a simple electronic structure that might be expected to be well-treated within the FCA, the importance of including the effects of the changing core molecular orbitals on the bonding electrons cannot be overlooked.",

A number of studies have shown that an accurate description of the electronic structure of the lowest-lying states of this molecule is particularly challenging due to the interplay between the strong dynamical correlation effects in the 3d shell and the delocalization of the 3d hole over the chlorine atoms. More generally, this problem is representative of the difficulties encountered when studying open-shell metal-containing molecular systems. Here, it is shown that qualitatively different results for the spin density distribution are obtained from the various quantum-mechanical approaches. At the DFT level, the spin density distribution is found to be very dependent on the functional employed. At the QMC level, Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) results are strongly dependent on the nodal structure of the trial wave function. Regarding wave function methods, most approaches not including a very high amount of dynamic correlation effects lead to a much too high localization of the spin density on the copper atom, in sharp contrast with DFT. To shed some light on these conflicting results Full CI-type (FCI) calculations using the 6-31G basis set and based on a selection process of the most important determinants, the so-called CIPSI approach (Configuration Interaction with Perturbative Selection done Iteratively) are performed. Quite remarkably, it is found that for this 63-electron molecule and a full CI space including about 10(18) determinants, the FCI limit can almost be reached. Putting all results together, a natural and coherent picture for the spin distribution is proposed. ",

In this regime, relevant for many important chemical processes, the non-adiabatic couplings between the electronic energy states can produce finite temperature effects in several molecular properties, such as the geometry, the vibrational frequencies, the binding energy, and several chemical reactions. In this work, we introduce a novel finite-temperature non-adiabatic molecular dynamics based on a novel covariant formulation of the electronic partition function. In this framework, the nuclei are not constrained to move in a specific electronic potential energy surface. Then, by using a rigorous variational upper bound to the free energy, we are led to an approximate partition function that can be evaluated numerically. The method can be applied to any technique capable to provide an energy value over a given wave function ansatz depending on several variational parameters and atomic positions. In this work, we have applied the proposed method within a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme. In particular, we consider in this first application only classical ions, but we explicitly include an electronic correlation (Jastrow) term in the wave function, by extending in this way the standard variational QMC method, from ground state to finite temperature properties. We show that our approximation reduces correctly to the standard ground-state Born-Oppenheimer (gsBO) at zero temperature and to the correct high temperature limit. Moreover, at temperatures large enough, this method improves the upper bound of the free energy obtained with a single BO energy surface, since within our approach it is possible to estimate the electron entropy of a correlated ansatz in an efficient way. We test this new method on the simple hydrogen molecule, where at low temperature we recover the correct gsBO low temperature limit. Moreover, we show that the dissociation of the molecule is possible at a temperature much smaller than the one corresponding to the gsBO energy surface, in good agreement with experimental evidence. Several extensions of the proposed technique are also discussed, as for instance the inclusion of quantum effects for ions and the calculation of critical (magnetic, superconducting) temperatures.",

This leads to both a new semilocal self-interaction correction scheme and a new physical argument for the choice of parameters in the LDA+U method.

In a second stage, only for the cases in which these features were previously detected, a rigorous analysis was carried out by several combinations of theoretical methods and basis sets in order to ensure that they are not only calculation artifacts. Our best results support that Li2, B2, C2, and P2 are molecules that possess true NNMs. A NNM was found in values obtained from the largest basis sets for Na2, but it disappeared at the experimental geometry because optimized bond lengths are significantly inaccurate for this case (deviations of 0.10 Å). Two of these maxima are also observed in Si2 with CCSD and large basis sets, but they are no longer detected as core-valence correlation or multiconfigurational wave functions are taken into account. Therefore, the NNMs in Si2 can be considered unphysical features due to an incomplete treatment of electron correlation. Finally, we show that a NNM is encountered in LiNa, representing the first discovery of such electron density maxima in a heteronuclear diatomic system at its equilibrium geometry, to our knowledge. Some results for LiNa, found in variations in internuclear distances, suggest that molecular electric moments, such as dipole and quadrupole, are sensitive to the presence of NNMs. ",

Compared to the PZ functional, the KSDT functional generally lowers the dc electrical conductivity of low-density Al, yielding improved agreement with experiment. The greatest lowering is about 15% for T=15 kK. Correspondingly, the KS band structure of low-density fcc Al from the KSDT functional exhibits a clear increase in interband separation above the Fermi level compared to the PZ bands. In some density-temperature regimes, the deuterium equations of state obtained from the two XC functionals exhibit pressure differences as large as 4% and a 6% range of differences. However, the hydrogen principal Hugoniot is insensitive to the explicit XC T dependence because of cancellation between the energy and pressure-volume work difference terms in the Rankine-Hugoniot equation. Finally, the temperature at which the HEG becomes unstable is T≥7200 K for the T-dependent XC, a result that the ground-state XC underestimates by about 1000 K. ",

Following the work of Pernal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 013001 (2018)], the working equations of the approach, termed AC-DOCI, are rooted in the extended random phase approximation (ERPA) and require knowledge of only the ground-state two-electron reduced density matrix (2RDM) from the DOCI. As such, the AC is naturally suited to modeling electron correlation in variational 2RDM (v2RDM)-based approximations to the DOCI. The v2RDM-driven AC-DOCI is applied to the dissociation of molecular nitrogen and the double dissociation of water; the approach yields energies that are similar in quality to those from second-order multireference perturbation theory near equilibrium, but the quality of the AC-DOCI energy degrades at stretched geometries. The exact adiabatic connection path suggests the assumption that the one-electron reduced-density matrix is constant along the AC path is invalid at stretched geometries, but this deficiency alone cannot explain the observed behavior. Rather, it appears that the ERPA's single-particle-transition ansatz cannot, in general, provide good approximations to the 2RDM along the AC path. The AC-DOCI is also applied to a set of 45 reaction energies; for these systems, the approach has an average accuracy that is comparable to that of single-reference second-order many-body perturbation theory.",

The effect has been linked to low-lying 3<id</i virtual orbitals approaching the valence shell. However, since most of this effect is captured at the self-consistent field level, the effect of tight <id</i functions in high-level coupled-cluster calculations has not been extensively studied. Here, we construct an extensive data set of 45 second-row species to examine the effect of tight <id</i functions in CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations in conjunction with basis sets of up to sextuple-ζ quality. The selected set of molecules covers the gamut from systems where the tight <id</i functions play a relatively minor role (e.g., SiH, SH, SiF, PF<sub3</sub, HOCl, Cl<sub2</sub, and C<sub2</subCl<sub2</sub) to challenging systems containing a central second-row atom bonded to many oxygen or fluorine atoms (e.g., PF<sub5</sub, SF<sub6</sub, SO<sub3</sub, ClO<sub3</sub, and HClO<sub4</sub) and systems containing many second-row atoms (e.g., P<sub4</sub, S<sub4</sub, CCl<sub4</sub, and C<sub2</subCl<sub6</sub). In conjunction with the cc-pVDZ basis set, we find chemically significant contributions to the total atomization energies (TAEs) of up to ∼2 kcal/mol at the CCSD level, ∼1 kcal/mol at the (T) level, and contributions of up to ∼0.1 kcal/mol for the post-CCSD(T) components. The effects of the tight <id</i functions are diminished with the size of the basis set; however, they are still chemically significant at the CCSD and (T) levels. For example, with the cc-pVTZ basis set, we obtain contributions to the TAEs of up to ∼1.5 and ∼0.3 kcal/mol at the CCSD and (T) levels, respectively, and with the cc-pVQZ basis set, we obtain contributions of up to ∼1.0 and ∼0.2 kcal/mol at the CCSD and (T) levels, respectively. We also find that a simple natural bond orbital population analysis of the 3<id</i orbitals of the second-row atom provides a useful <ia priori</i indicator of the magnitude of the effect of tight <id</i functions on post-CCSD(T) contribution to the TAEs in oxide and fluoride systems.

The reconstructed 3-RDMs, compared with 3-RDMs from full configuration interaction, demonstrate in nonminimal basis sets the accuracy of the first-order expansion (V) as well as the important role of the second-order corrections (NY, M, and VTP). Calculations at nonequilibrium geometries further show that cumulant functionals can reconstruct the 3-RDM from a multireferenced 2-RDM with reasonable accuracy, which is relevant to recent multireferenced formulations of the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrodinger equation (ACSE) and canonical diagonalization. Theoretically, we perform a detailed perturbative analysis of the M functional to identify its second-order components. With these second-order components we connect the M, NY, and VTP reconstructions for the first time by deriving both the NY and VTP functionals from the M functional. Finally, these 3-RDM reconstructions are employed within the ACSE [D. Mazziotti, Phys. Rev.

Here, we extend the scope of GKS-spRPA correlated one-particle energies from frontier-orbital ionization to core orbital ionization energies, which are notoriously difficult for GW and other response methods due to strong orbital relaxation effects. For a benchmark consisting of 23 1s core electron binding energies (CEBEs) of second-row elements, chemical shifts estimated from GKS-spRPA one-particle energies yield mean absolute deviations from experiment of 0.2 eV, which are significantly more accurate than the standard GW and comparable to Δ self-consistent field theory without semiempirical adjustment of the energy functional. For small ammonia clusters and cytosine tautomers, GKS-spRPA based chemical shifts capture subtle variations in covalent and noncovalent bonding environments; GKS-spRPA 1s CEBEs for these systems agree with equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles and ADC(4) results within 0.2-0.3 eV.

GKS-spRPA predicts a lowering of the oxygen 1s CEBE of approximately 1.6-1.7 eV in solid and liquid phases, consistent with liquid-jet X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and gas phase cluster experiments.

Although the bulk of the theoretical work studying the hydrated electron is based on mixed quantum/classical (MQC) methods, recent advances in computer power have allowed several attempts to study this object using <iab initio</i methods. The difficulty with employing <iab initio</i methods for this system is that even with relatively inexpensive quantum chemistry methods such as density functional theory (DFT), such calculations are still limited to at most a few tens of water molecules and only a few picoseconds duration, leaving open the question as to whether the calculations are converged with respect to either system size or dynamical fluctuations. Moreover, the <iab initio</i simulations of the hydrated electron that have been published to date have provided only limited analysis. Most works calculate the electron's vertical detachment energy, which can be compared to experiment, and occasionally the electronic absorption spectrum is also computed. Structural features, such as pair distribution functions, are rare in the literature, with the majority of the structural analysis being simple statements that the electron resides in a cavity, which are often based only on a small number of simulation snapshots. Importantly, there has been no <iab initio</i work examining the temperature-dependent behavior of the hydrated electron, which has not been satisfactorily explained by MQC simulations. In this work, we attempt to remedy this situation by running DFT-based <iab initio</i simulations of the hydrated electron as a function of both box size and temperature. We show that the calculated properties of the hydrated electron are not converged even with simulation sizes up to 128 water molecules and durations of several tens of picoseconds. The simulations show significant changes in the water coordination and solvation structure with box size. Our temperature-dependent simulations predict a red-shift of the absorption spectrum (computed using TD-DFT with an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functional) with increasing temperature, but the magnitude of the predicted red-shift is larger than that observed experimentally, and the absolute position of the calculated spectra are off by over half an eV. The spectral red-shift at high temperatures is accompanied by both a partial loss of structure of the electron's central cavity and an increased radius of gyration that pushes electron density onto and beyond the first solvation shell. Overall, although <iab initio</i simulations can provide some insights into the temperature-dependent behavior of the hydrated electron, the simulation sizes and level of quantum chemistry theory that are currently accessible are inadequate for correctly describing the experimental properties of this fascinating object.",

The most accurate energies, based either on direct extrapolation of the CCSD(T) correlation energies obtained with the aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets or on the sum of extrapolated MP2 interaction energies (from aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets) and extrapolated DeltaCCSD(T) correction terms [difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies] differ only slightly, which demonstrates the reliability and robustness of both techniques. The latter values, which represent new standards for the H-bonding and stacking structures of the uracil dimer, differ from the previously published data for the S22 set by a small amount. This suggests that interaction energies of the S22 set are generated with chemical accuracy. The most accurate CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies are compared with interaction energies obtained from various computational procedures, namely the SCS-MP2 (SCS: spin-component-scaled), SCS(MI)-MP2 (MI: molecular interaction), MP3, dispersion-augmented DFT (DFT-D), M06-2X, and DFT-SAPT (SAPT: symmetry-adapted perturbation theory) methods. Among these techniques, the best results are obtained with the SCS(MI)-MP2 method. Remarkably good binding energies are also obtained with the DFT-SAPT method. Both DFT techniques tested yield similarly good interaction energies. The large magnitude of the stacking energy for the uracil dimer, compared to that of the benzene dimer, is explained by attractive electrostatic interactions present in the stacked uracil dimer.

In this work, we test whether the Huang-Carter (HC) kinetic energy density functional (KEDF), which contains the physics to properly describe covalently bonded semiconductor materials, can also be used to describe covalent bonds in molecules. In particular, we calculate a variety of homonuclear diatomic molecules with the HC functional within OFDFT. The OFDFT bond dissociation energy, equilibrium bond length, and vibrational frequency of these dimers are in remarkably good agreement with benchmark KSDFT results, given the lack of orbitals in the calculation. We vary the two parameters λ (controlling the reduced density gradient contribution to the nonlocal kernel) and β (the exponent of the density in the nonlocal term) present in the HC KEDF and find that the optimal λ correlates with the magnitude of the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap. Although the HC KEDF represents a significant improvement over previous KEDFs in describing covalent systems, deficiencies still exist. Despite the similar overall shape of the KSDFT and OFDFT ground state electron densities, the electron density within the bonding region is still quite different. Furthermore, OFDFT is not yet able to give reasonable description of magnetic states.

Riplinger et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 024109 (2016)]. The production level implementations of the DLPNO-CCSD and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods were shown to be applicable to realistic systems composed of a few hundred atoms in a routine, black-box fashion on relatively modest hardware. In 2011, a reduced-scaling CCSD approach for high-spin open-shell unrestricted Hartree-Fock reference wave functions was proposed (UHF-LPNO-CCSD) [A. Hansen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 135, 214102 (2011)]. After a few years of experience with this method, a few shortcomings of UHF-LPNO-CCSD were noticed that required a redesign of the method, which is the subject of this paper. To this end, we employ the high-spin open-shell variant of the N-electron valence perturbation theory formalism to define the initial guess wave function, and consequently also the open-shell PNOs. The new PNO ansatz properly converges to the closed-shell limit since all truncations and approximations have been made in strict analogy to the closed-shell case. Furthermore, given the fact that the formalism uses a single set of orbitals, only a single PNO integral transformation is necessary, which offers large computational savings. We show that, with the default PNO truncation parameters, approximately 99.9% of the total CCSD correlation energy is recovered for open-shell species, which is comparable to the performance of the method for closed-shells. UHF-DLPNO-CCSD shows a linear scaling behavior for closed-shell systems, while linear to quadratic scaling is obtained for open-shell systems. The largest systems we have considered contain more than 500 atoms and feature more than 10 000 basis functions with a triple-ζ quality basis set.",

The combination of DLPNO-CCSD with implicit solvation methods allows the calculation of accurate energies and chemical properties of solvated systems at an affordable computational cost. We have efficiently implemented different schemes within the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) for DLPNO-CCSD in the ORCA quantum chemistry suite. In our implementation, the overhead due to the additional solvent terms amounts to less than 5% of the time the equivalent gas phase job takes. Our results for organic neutrals and open-shell ions in water show that for most systems, adding solvation terms to the coupled-cluster amplitudes equations and to the energy leads to small changes in the total energy compared to only considering solvated orbitals and corrections to the reference energy. However, when the solute contains certain functional groups, such as carbonyl or nitrile groups, the changes in the energy are larger and estimated to be around 0.04 and 0.02 kcal/mol for each carbonyl and nitrile group in the solute, respectively. For solutes containing metals, the use of accurate CC/C-PCM schemes is crucial to account for correlation solvation effects. Simultaneously, we have calculated the electrostatic component of the solvation energy for neutrals and ions in water for the different DLPNO-CCSD/C-PCM schemes. We observe negligible changes in the deviation between DLPNO-CCSD and canonical-CCSD data. Here, DLPNO-CCSD results outperform those for Hartree-Fock and density functional theory calculations.",

Both of the errors arise from the incompleteness of the basis set. These two errors make opposite contributions to the interaction energies.

As demonstrated by the ethylene torsion and the C(2v) ring-opening of oxirane, SF-TD-DFT is very useful for describing nearly degenerate situations. However, it may occasionally yield unphysical results. This stems from the noncollinear form of the generalized gradient approximation, which becomes numerically instable in the presence of spin-flip excitations from the closed- to vacant-shell orbitals of an open-shell reference. To cure this defect, a simple modification, dubbed as ALDA0, is proposed in the spirit of adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA). It is applicable to all kinds of density functionals and yields stable results without too much loss of accuracy. In particular, the combination of ALDA0 with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation is a promising tool for studying global potential energy surfaces. In addition to the kernel problem, SF-TD-DFT is also rather sensitive to the choice of reference states, as demonstrated by the spin multiplet states of closed-shell molecules of H(2)O, CH(2)O, and C(2)H(4). Surprisingly, SF-TD-DFT with pure density functionals may also fail for valance excitations with large orbital overlaps, at variance with the spin-conserving counterpart (SC-TD-DFT). In this case, the inclusion of a large amount of Hartree-Fock exchange is mandatory for quantitative results.

We discuss applications of NEGF simulations to describe the femtosecond dynamics of various finite fermionic systems following an excitation out of equilibrium. This includes the expansion dynamics of ultracold atoms in optical lattices following a confinement quench and the excitation of strongly correlated electrons in a solid by the impact of a charged particle. NEGF, presently, are the only ab initio quantum approach that is able to study the dynamics of correlations for long times in two and three dimensions. However, until recently, NEGF simulations have mostly been performed with rather simple selfenergy approximations such as the second-order Born approximation (SOA). While they correctly capture the qualitative trends of the relaxation towards equilibrium, the reliability and accuracy of these NEGF simulations has remained open, for a long time. Here we report on recent tests of NEGF simulations for finite lattice systems against exact-diagonalization and density-matrix-renormalization-group benchmark data. The results confirm the high accuracy and predictive capability of NEGF simulations-provided selfenergies are used that go beyond the SOA and adequately include strong correlation and dynamical-screening effects. With an extended arsenal of selfenergies that can be used effectively, the NEGF approach has the potential of becoming a powerful simulation tool with broad areas of new applications including strongly correlated solids and ultracold atoms. The present review aims at making such applications possible. To this end we present a selfcontained introduction to the theory of NEGF and give an overview on recent numerical applications to compute the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of correlated fermions.

In many cases (uniform electron gas, jellium surface, and free atom), the correction to RPA is a short-ranged effect that is captured by a local spin density approximation (LSDA) or a generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Nonempirical density functionals for the correction to RPA were constructed earlier at the LSDA and GGA levels (RPA+), but they are constructed here at the fully nonlocal level (RPA++), using the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Langreth, Lundqvist, and collaborators. While they make important and helpful corrections to RPA total and ionization energies of free atoms, they correct the RPA atomization energies of molecules by only about 1 kcal/mol. Thus, it is puzzling that RPA atomization energies are, on average, about 10 kcal/mol lower than those of accurate values from experiment. We find here that a hybrid of 50% Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA with 50% RPA+ yields atomization energies much more accurate than either one does alone. This suggests a solution to the puzzle: While the proper correction to RPA is short-ranged in some systems, its contribution to the correlation hole can spread out in a molecule with multiple atomic centers, canceling part of the spread of the exact exchange hole (more so than in RPA or RPA+), making the true exchange-correlation hole more localized than in RPA or RPA+. This effect is not captured even by the vdW-DF nonlocality, but it requires the different kind of full nonlocality present in a hybrid functional. ",

The CNTOs may be included in an active space based on a cutoff threshold for the eigenvalues corresponding to the orbitals. We present MLCC results for core excitation energies calculated using coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) in the inactive space and CCSD with perturbative triples (CC3) in the active space. The use of CNTOs results in small errors compared to full CC3.",

Moreover, it is shown that decision-making is intrinsically an intractable process because everything depends on everything else. However, no decision is arbitrary but bounded by free energy, such as resources and propellants, and restricted by mechanisms like molecular, neural, and social networks. The least-time maximation of entropy, equivalent to the minimization of free energy, parallels the optimization of subjective expected utility.

The main outcome was the proportion of \"heads\" coin tosses achieved (out of 300 attempts) by each participant. Each of the participants attempted to flip the coin so as to achieve a heads result. All participants achieved more heads than tails results, with 7 of the 13 participants having significantly more heads results (p&lt;or=0.05).

Recently, methods from statistical physics were used to show that a fairly broad class of models does provide a general explanation of Zipf's law. This explanation rests on the observation that real world data is often generated from underlying causes, known as latent variables. Those latent variables mix together multiple models that do not obey Zipf's law, giving a model that does. Here we extend that work both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we provide a far simpler and more intuitive explanation of Zipf's law, which at the same time considerably extends the class of models to which this explanation can apply. Furthermore, we also give methods for verifying whether this explanation applies to a particular dataset. Empirically, these advances allowed us extend this explanation to important classes of data, including word frequencies (the first domain in which Zipf's law was discovered), data with variable sequence length, and multi-neuron spiking activity.",

In hydrophilic systems the forces observed were found to be well described by DLVO theory at large separation distances. Very long range hydrophobic forces were not observed in hydrophilic-hydrophobic systems. Nevertheless, the jump into contact was found to occur at distances greater that those predicted by just van der Waals attraction. The interaction between two hydrophobic surfaces was dominated by the long-range attraction due to hydrophobic forces. This interaction was found to be sensitive to the type of substrate as well as to the pH and electrolyte concentration. Measured pull-off forces showed poor reproducibility. However, average values showed clear trends and were used to estimate interfacial energies or work of adhesion for all systems studied by means of the Derjaguin approximation. These values were compared to those calculated by the surface tension component theory using the acid-base approach. Good qualitative agreement was obtained, giving support for the usefulness of this approach in estimating interfacial energies between surfaces in liquid media. A comparison of the measured adhesion force with hydrodynamic detachment experiments showed good qualitative agreement. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.",

The predictions of the model have been tested against the results of trajectory calculations for collisions of five different target molecules with argon or helium under a variety of temperatures, collision energies, and initial rotational levels. The model predicts selected moments of the joint probability distribution, P(Jf,ΔE) with an R(2) ≈ 0.90. The calculation is efficient, in most cases taking less than one CPU-hour. The model provides several insights into the energy transfer process. The joint probability distribution is strongly dependent on rotational energy transfer and conservation laws and less dependent on vibrational energy transfer. There are two mechanisms for rotational excitation, one due to motion normal to the intermolecular potential and one due to motion tangential to it and perpendicular to the line of centers. Energy transfer is found to depend strongly on the intermolecular potential and only weakly on the intramolecular potential. Highly efficient collisions are a natural consequence of the energy transfer and arise due to collisions at \"sweet spots\" in the space of impact parameter and molecular orientation. ",

Both the capacitance and the polarizability can be obtained in a single calculation using the boundary-element technique.

This first article presents a model-based, hidden variable analysis of quantum theory that provides the statistical nature of wave functions. The analysis uses the equations of classical electro-magnetism and conservation of energy while modeling an eigenstate electron as a nonlocal entity. Essential to the analysis are physical properties that were discovered and analyzed only after the historical interpretation of quantum mechanics was established: electron non-locality and the standing electro-magnetic energy that accompanies and encompasses an active, electrically small volume. The standing energy produces a driving radiation reaction force that, under certain circumstances, is many orders of magnitude larger than currently accepted values.

What is not generally appreciated is that Bohr's original semiclassical conception differed significantly from the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory and offers an alternative semiclassical approximation scheme with remarkable attributes. More specifically, Bohr's original method did not impose action quantization constraints but rather obtained these as predictions by simply matching photon and classical orbital frequencies. In other words, the hydrogen atom was treated entirely classically and orbital quantized emerged directly from the Planck-Einstein photon quantization condition, E = h nu. Here, we revisit this early history of quantum theory and demonstrate the application of Bohr's original strategy to the three quintessential quantum systems: an electron in a box, an electron in a ring, and a dipolar harmonic oscillator. The usual energy-level spectra, and optical selection rules, emerge by solving an algebraic (quadratic) equation, rather than a Bohr-Sommerfeld integral (or Schroedinger) equation. However, the new predictions include a frozen (zero-kinetic-energy) state which in some (but not all) cases lies below the usual zero-point energy. In addition to raising provocative questions concerning the origin of quantum-chemical phenomena, the results may prove to be of pedagogical value in introducing students to quantum mechanics.",

To represent the electron-nuclear Hamiltonian in matrix form and propagate the dynamics, the computations employ the Jordan-Wigner transformation for the fermionic creation/annihilation operators and the discrete variable representation for the nuclear operators. The simulations offer a standard for electronic decoherence that can be used to test approximations. They also provide a useful platform to answer fundamental questions about electronic decoherence that cannot be addressed through approximate or implicit schemes. Specifically, through simulations, we isolate basic mechanisms for electronic coherence loss and demonstrate that electronic decoherence is possible even for one-dimensional nuclear bath. Furthermore, we show that (i) decreasing the mass of the bath generally leads to faster electronic decoherence; (ii) electron-electron interactions strongly affect the electronic decoherence when the electron-nuclear dynamics is not pure-dephasing; (iii) classical bath models with initial conditions sampled from the Wigner distribution accurately capture the short-time electronic decoherence dynamics; (iv) model separable initial superpositions often used to understand decoherence after photoexcitation are only relevant in experiments that employ delta-like laser pulses to initiate the dynamics.

The authors showed that the initial fast spreading of the wave packets is followed at all energies by slow periodic intramolecular vibronic energy redistribution (IVER) with periods in the range of 0.3 to several tens of picoseconds. These energy transfers lead to oscillations with the same periods in the population of each electronic state. Propagation of wave packets indicates that IVER frequencies also dominate the fluctuations of the squared modulus of the autocorrelation function |A(t)|2 at energies not too high above the bottom of the conical intersection, but this is no longer the case at higher energies. For example, for initial wave packets prepared by almost vertical excitation of the vibrational ground state of the ground electronic surface, the oscillations of |A(t)|2 essentially reflect the detuning from 1:2 resonance between the frequency of the bend and that of the symmetric stretch in the excited electronic state.

The system-environment interaction can be described by a spectral density for a spin-boson model. The quantum dynamics of electronic excitations in the chromophore are completely determined by this spectral density, which is of great interest for describing quantum decoherence and quantum measurements. Specifically, the spectral density determines the time scale for the \"collapse\" of the wave function of the chromophore due to continuous measurement of its quantum state by the environment. Although of fundamental interest, there very few physical systems for which the spectral density has been determined experimentally and characterized. In contrast, here, we give the parameters for the spectral densities for a wide range of chromophores, proteins, and solvents. Expressions for the spectral density are derived for continuum dielectric models of the chromophore environment. There are contributions to the spectral density from each component of the environment: the protein, the water bound to the protein, and the bulk solvent. Each component affects the quantum dynamics of the chromophore on distinctly different time scales. Our results provide a natural description of the different time scales observed in ultrafast laser spectroscopy, including three pulse photon echo decay and dynamic Stokes shift measurements. We show that even if the chromophore is well separated from the solvent by the surrounding protein, ultrafast solvation can be still be dominated by the solvent. Consequently, we suggest that the subpicosecond solvation observed in some biomolecular chromophores should not necessarily be assigned to ultrafast protein dynamics. The magnitude of the chromophore-environment coupling is sufficiently strong that the quantum dynamics of electronic excitations in most chromophores at room temperature is incoherent, and the time scale for \"collapse\" of the wave function is typically less than 10 fs.",

Rather than postulating them and investigating the consequence of each definition, as is customary, here we adopt a bottom-up approach and construct the entropy expression within the microcanonical formalism upon two fundamental thermodynamic pillars: (i) The second law of thermodynamics as formulated for quasistatic processes: δQ/T is an exact differential, and (ii) the law of ideal gases: PV=k(B)NT. The first pillar implies that entropy must be some function of the phase volume Ω. The second pillar singles out the logarithmic function among all possible functions. Hence the construction leads uniquely to the expression S=k(B)lnΩ, that is, the volume entropy. As a consequence any entropy expression other than that of Gibbs, e.g., the Boltzmann entropy, can lead to inconsistencies with the two thermodynamic pillars. We illustrate this with the prototypical example of a macroscopic collection of noninteracting spins in a magnetic field, and show that the Boltzmann entropy severely fails to predict the magnetization, even in the thermodynamic limit. The uniqueness of the Gibbs entropy, as well as the demonstrated potential harm of the Boltzmann entropy, provide compelling reasons for discarding the latter at once.",

It applies to systems composed of many particles, however, we are seeing that one can formulate laws of thermodynamics when only a small number of particles are interacting with a heat bath.

Here, we find that for processes which are approximately cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a different form compared to the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but an entire family of constraints. We find a family of free energies which generalize the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law relates to one of these, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. We find three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are relevant for small systems, and also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics are unified in this framework, with the first law defining the class of operations, the zeroth law emerging as an equivalence relation between thermal states, and the remaining laws being monotonicity of our generalized free energies.

Matter-wave interferometers, which split and recombine wave packets in order to observe interference, provide a way to probe the superposition principle on macroscopic scales and explore the transition to classical physics. In such experiments, large wave-packet separation is impeded by the need for long interaction times and large momentum beam splitters, which cause susceptibility to dephasing and decoherence. Here we use light-pulse atom interferometry to realize quantum interference with wave packets separated by up to 54 centimetres on a timescale of 1 second. These results push quantum superposition into a new macroscopic regime, demonstrating that quantum superposition remains possible at the distances and timescales of everyday life. The sub-nanokelvin temperatures of the atoms and a compensation of transverse optical forces enable a large separation while maintaining an interference contrast of 28 per cent. In addition to testing the superposition principle in a new regime, large quantum superposition states are vital to exploring gravity with atom interferometers in greater detail. We anticipate that these states could be used to increase sensitivity in tests of the equivalence principle, measure the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect, and eventually detect gravitational waves and phase shifts associated with general relativity.

We propose a direct analytical procedure to test if a generalized entropy satisfies the third law, assuming only very general assumptions for the entropy S and energy U of an arbitrary N-level classical system. Mathematically, the method relies on exact calculation of β=dS/dU in terms of the microstate probabilities p(i). To illustrate this approach, we present exact results for the two best known generalizations of statistical mechanics.

The Lorentz law is the universal expression of the force exerted by electromagnetic fields on a volume containing a distribution of electrical charges and currents. If electric and magnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are traditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and magnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current densities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current densities, respectively. In this way, Maxwell's macroscopic equations are reduced to his microscopic equations, and the Lorentz law is expected to provide a precise expression of the electromagnetic force density on material bodies at all points in space and time. This Letter presents incontrovertible theoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the fundamental tenets of special relativity. We argue that the Lorentz law must be abandoned in favor of a more general expression of the electromagnetic force density, such as the one discovered by Einstein and Laub in 1908.

On the one hand the quantum pure state, i.e., the wavefunction, of an isolated system is determined to calculate molecular properties and their time evolution according to the unitary Schrödinger equation. On the other hand a mixed state, i.e., a statistical density matrix, is the standard formalism to account for thermal equilibrium, as postulated in the microcanonical quantum statistics. In the present paper an alternative treatment relying on a statistical analysis of the possible wavefunctions of an isolated system is presented. In analogy with the classical ergodic theory, the time evolution of the wavefunction determines the probability distribution in the phase space pertaining to an isolated system. However, this alone cannot account for a well defined thermodynamical description of the system in the macroscopic limit, unless a suitable probability distribution for the quantum constants of motion is introduced. We present a workable formalism assuring the emergence of typical values of thermodynamic functions, such as the internal energy and the entropy, in the large size limit of the system. This allows the identification of macroscopic properties independently of the specific realization of the quantum state. A description of material systems in agreement with equilibrium thermodynamics is then derived without constraints on the physical constituents and interactions of the system.

However, when such processes are studied on a nonsynchronized ensemble, the inherent fluctuations are lost, and only the average rate of the process can be measured. With the recent development of methods of single-molecule manipulation and detection, it is now possible to follow the progress of an individual molecule, measuring not just the average rate but the fluctuations in this rate as well. These fluctuations can provide a great deal of detail about the underlying kinetic cycle that governs the dynamical behavior of the system. However, extracting this information from experiments requires the ability to calculate the general properties of arbitrarily complex theoretical kinetic schemes. We present here a general technique that determines the exact analytical solution for the mean velocity and for measures of the fluctuations. We adopt a formalism based on the master equation and show how the probability density for the position of a molecular motor at a given time can be solved exactly in Fourier-Laplace space. With this analytic solution, we can then calculate the mean velocity and fluctuation-related parameters, such as the randomness parameter (a dimensionless ratio of the diffusion constant and the velocity) and the dwell time distributions, which fully characterize the fluctuations of the system, both commonly used kinetic parameters in single-molecule measurements. Furthermore, we show that this formalism allows calculation of these parameters for a much wider class of general kinetic models than demonstrated with previous methods.",

This quantity, while previously mentioned in the literature, has been investigated in detail only in the quantum case. We describe this framework reasonably pedagogically, then show that in this framework, certain choices of coarse-graining lead to an entropy that is well-defined out of equilibrium, additive on independent systems, and that grows toward thermodynamic entropy as the system reaches equilibrium, even for systems that are genuinely isolated. Choosing certain macroscopic regions, this dynamical thermodynamic entropy measures how close these regions are to thermal equilibrium. We also show that in the given formalism, the correspondence between classical entropy (defined on classical phase space) and quantum entropy (defined on Hilbert space) becomes surprisingly direct and transparent, while manifesting differences stemming from noncommutativity of coarse-grainings and from nonexistence of a direct classical analog of quantum energy eigenstates.",

E.g., we find that temperature no longer exists and that a new component of entropy emerges from long time averaging of other quantities.

Observations of quantized steps in electrical conductance have provided important insights into the physics of mesoscopic systems and have allowed the development of quantum electronic devices. Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of electric charges, it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles. In its most fundamental form, it requires a quantum-degenerate Fermi gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report the observation of quantized conductance in the transport of neutral atoms driven by a chemical potential bias. The atoms are in an ultraballistic regime, where their mean free path exceeds not only the size of the transport channel, but also the size of the entire system, including the atom reservoirs. We use high-resolution lithography to shape light potentials that realize either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions are imprinted on a quasi-two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting the reservoirs. By varying either a gate potential or the transverse confinement of the constrictions, we observe distinct plateaux in the atom conductance. The conductance in the first plateau is found to be equal to the universal conductance quantum, 1/h. We use Landauer's formula to model our results and find good agreement for low gate potentials, with all parameters determined a priori. Our experiment lets us investigate quantum conductors with wide control not only over the channel geometry, but also over the reservoir properties, such as interaction strength, size and thermalization rate.

Using a newly developed set of molecules with heavy elements (called GW-SOC81), we find that, when based upon hybrid density functional calculations, fully relativistic (FR) and scalar-relativistic (SR) G0W0 calculations of vertical ionization potentials both yield excellent performance compared to experiment, with errors below 1.9%.

Vertical excitation energies and one-electron properties are computed using the same geometries as in our previous ab initio benchmark study on electronically excited states. The CI calculations for the standard methods (MNDO, AM1, PM3) and for the orthogonalization-corrected methods (OM1, OM2, OM3) include single, double, triple, and quadruple excitations (CISDTQ) using the graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) as implemented in the MNDO code. The CIS calculations for the established INDO/S method and the reparametrized INDO/S2 variant employ a modified version of the ZINDO program. As compared to the best theoretical reference data from the ab initio benchmark, all currently applied semiempirical methods tend to underestimate the vertical excitation energies, but the errors are much larger in the case of the standard methods (MNDO, AM1, PM3). Overall, the mean absolute deviations relative to the theoretical best estimates are lowest for OM3, and only slightly higher for OM1 and OM2 (in the range of 0.4-0.5 eV). INDO/S performs similar to OM2 for the vertical excitation energies of singlet states, but deteriorates considerably for triplet states. The INDO/S2 reparametrization for oxygen improves the results for low-lying singlet states of oxygen-containing compounds, but makes them worse for high-lying singlets as well as for triplets. The ab initio reference data for oscillator strengths and excited-state dipole moments are again best reproduced by the orthogonalization-corrected approaches (OM1, OM2, OM3), which thus emerge as the most favorable semiempirical methods overall for treating valence excited states of large organic chromophores.

The interaction energies were first calculated using the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and noniterative triple excitations and large basis sets, followed by an extrapolation procedure. Next, a contribution from iterative triple and noniterative quadruple excitations was added from calculations in smaller basis sets. The resulting interaction energies were then averaged over the ground-state and both ground- and first-excited-states vibrational wave functions of H2 and CO, respectively.

However, it is thus far unclear whether incorporating nuclear quantum motion in molecular excited state calculations leads to a systematic improvement of their predictive accuracy, making further investigation necessary. Here, we present such an investigation by employing two first-principles methods for capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations on excited state energies, which we apply to the Thiel set of organic molecules. We show that accounting for zero-point motion leads to much improved agreement with experiment, compared to \"static\" calculations that only account for electronic effects, and the magnitude of the redshift can become as large as 1.36 eV. Moreover, we show that the effect of nuclear quantum motion on excited state energies largely depends on the molecular size, with smaller molecules exhibiting larger redshifts. Our methodology also makes it possible to analyze the contribution of individual vibrational normal modes to the redshift of excited state energies, and in several molecules, we identify a limited number of modes dominating this effect. Overall, our study provides a foundation for systematically quantifying the shift of excited state energies due to nuclear quantum motion and for understanding this effect at a microscopic level.",

The Hilbert space is divided into a large part consisting of pure Slater determinants and a much smaller orthogonal part (the size of which is controlled by a cut-off threshold), from which the lowest eigenstates can be removed efficiently. In this way, the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is restricted to the orthogonal complement of the lower excited states and projects out the next highest excited state. Starting from the ground state, higher excited states can be found one after the other. The Schrödinger equation in imaginary time is solved by the same population dynamics as in the ground state algorithm with modified probabilities and matrix elements, for which working formulae are provided.

Energy differences are obtained by integrating the energy derivative with respect to occupation numbers over the appropriate parameter range. This is made possible by writing the second-order energy as a function of the occupation numbers. Relaxation effects are fully included at the SCF level. This is in contrast to linear response theory, which makes the D-ΔMBPT(2) applicable not only to single excited but also higher excited states.

This computational study was carried out using the CCSD(T) level of theory with the aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets, where X = D, T, Q, and 5. All calculated energies were corrected using the BSSE method. The lowest energy geometry and the shape of the intermolecular potential energy surface showed significant dependence on the size of the basis set as well as the BSSE corrections.

Starting at the first excited state of either the symmetric or asymmetric stretches, VER can occur either directly to the ground state or indirectly via intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR). The VER rate constants for the various pathways are calculated within the framework of the Landau-Teller formalism, where they are expressed in terms of two-time quantum-mechanical correlation functions.

This suggests that the modified vibron model can provide a simple but useful alternative to the much more elaborate global treatments of the rovibrational data. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.",

In this theory the liquid atomic motion consists of two contributions, normal mode vibrations in a single representative potential energy valley, and transits, which carry the system across boundaries between valleys. The mean square displacement time correlation function (the MSD) is a direct measure of the atomic motion, and our goal is to determine if the V-T formalism can produce a physically sensible account of this motion. We employ molecular dynamics (MD) data for a system representing liquid Na, and find the motion evolves in three successive time intervals: on the first 'vibrational' interval, the vibrational motion alone gives a highly accurate account of the MD data; on the second 'crossover' interval, the vibrational MSD saturates to a constant while the transit motion builds up from zero; on the third 'random walk' interval, the transit motion produces a purely diffusive random walk of the vibrational equilibrium positions. This motional evolution agrees with, and adds refinement to, the MSD atomic motion as described by current liquid dynamics theories. ",

(2) From that condition, how accurately can we extract fundamental frequencies of a molecule? (3) What is the benefit of using ab initio MD for frequency calculations? Our analytical approaches to those questions are classical and quantum normal form theories.

From those calculations, we show comparisons of the frequencies from MD with the post vibrational self-consistent field calculations, second- and fourth-order perturbation theories, and experiments. We also apply direct ab initio MD to frequency calculations of C-H vibrational modes of tetracene and naphthalene.

The purpose of this paper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for entropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of +/-0.1% to the available experimental high-temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two nuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution S_{vib}(T/theta_{0}) , where T is temperature and theta_{0} is the vibrational characteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution S_{tr}(T/theta_{tr}) , where theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each liquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the liquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the V-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to internal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived in a single formula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike.

These vibrations have recently been categorized into two types: spatially extended vibrations, whose vibrational density of states (vDOS) follows a non-Debye quadratic law, and quasilocalized vibrations (QLVs), whose vDOS follows a quartic law. The former are explained by elasticity theory with quenched disorder and microscopic replica theory as being a consequence of elastic instability, but the origin of the latter is still debated. Here, we show that the latter can also be directly derived from elasticity theory with quenched disorder. We find another elastic instability that the theory encompasses but that has been overlooked so far, namely, the instability of the system against a local dipolar force. This instability gives rise to an additional contribution to the vDOS, and the spatial structure and energetics of the mode originating from this instability are consistent with those of the QLVs. Finally, we construct a model in which the additional contribution to the vDOS follows a quartic law.",

Such calculations provide in addition accurate free energy gradient vectors and Hessian matrices and thus open the door for the characterization of stationary points in free energy landscapes and the study of chemical reaction mechanisms in large disordered systems. The vibrational spectrum of the water molecule in liquid water has been computed as a test case. It has been obtained using a weighted average of instantaneous signals assuming the instantaneous normal modes approach. Vibrational frequencies are also computed by diagonalizing the Hessian of the free energy surface. Comparison is made with experimental data and with calculations using the Fourier transform of the time autocorrelation function of the dipole moment.

The theorem states that, if a large molecule, typically biological macromolecules such as proteins, undergoes small-amplitude conformational fluctuations around its native conformation in such a way that within the range of conformational fluctuations at thermal equilibrium the conformational energy surface can be approximated by a multidimensional parabola, then the mass-weighted mean-square displacement of constituent atoms is given by the sum of the contributions from each normal mode of conformational vibration, which in turn is proportional to the inverse of the square of its frequency. This theorem provides a firm theoretical basis for the fact hitherto empirically recognized in the conformational dynamics of, for instance, native proteins that very-low-frequency normal modes make dominant contributions to the conformational fluctuations at thermal equilibrium. Discussion is given on the implication of this theorem, especially on the importance of the concept of the low-frequency normal modes, even in the case where the basic assumption of the harmonicity of the energy surface does not hold.",

The DOS is obtained using spectra analysis of atomic velocities and accounts for anharmonicity. The increase of delta(L) with pressure is non-negligible: delta(L) is about 0.116 and 0.145 at ambient and extreme pressures, respectively.

These broad vibrational features can be modeled from first principles, in a reduced dimensional calculation, that adiabatically separates low-frequency modes, which modulate the hydrogen bond length, from high-frequency OH stretch and bend modes that contribute to the vibrational structure. Previously this method was used to investigate the origin of an unusual vibrational feature frequently found in the spectra of dimers between carboxylic acids and nitrogen-containing aromatic bases that spans over 900 cm<sup-1</sup and contains two broad peaks. It was found that the width of this feature largely originates from low-frequency modes modulating the hydrogen bond length and that the structure results from Fermi resonance interactions. In this report, we examine how these features change with the relative acid and base strength of the components as reflected by their aqueous pK<subA</sub values. Dimers with large pK<subA</sub differences are found to have features that can extend to frequencies below 1000 cm<sup-1</sup. The relationships between mean OH/NH frequency, aqueous pK<subA</sub, and O-N distance are examined in order to obtain a more rigorous understanding of the origin and shape of the vibrational features. The mean OH/NH frequencies are found to correlate well with O-N distances. The lowest OH stretch frequencies are found in dimer geometries with O-N distances between 2.5 and 2.6 Å. At larger O-N distances, the hydrogen bonding interaction is not as strong, resulting in higher OH stretch frequencies. When the O-N distance is smaller than 2.5 Å, the limited space between the O and N determines the OH stretch frequency, which gives rise to frequencies that decrease with O-N distances. These two effects place a lower limit on the OH stretch frequency which is calculated to be near 700 cm<sup-1</sup. Understanding how the vibrational features of strongly hydrogen-bonded structures depend on the relative pK<subA</sub and other structural parameters will guide studies of biological structures and analysis of proton transfer studies using photoacids.",

The magnetism in each nucleus is often referred to as spin. A strong, static magnetic field B0 is used to align spins, forming a magnetic density within the patient. A second, rotating magnetic field B1 (RF pulse) is applied for a short duration, which rotates the spins away from B0 in a process called excitation. After the spins are rotated away from B0, the RF pulse is turned off, and the spins precess about B0. As long as the spins are all pointing in the same direction at any one time (have phase coherence), they act in concert to create rapidly oscillating magnetic fields. These fields in turn create a current in an appropriately placed receiver coil, in a manner similar to that of an electrical generator. The precessing magnetization decays rapidly in a duration roughly given by the T2 time constant. At the same time, but at a slower rate, magnetization forms again along the direction of B0; the duration of this process is roughly expressed by the T1 time constant. The precessional frequency of each spin is proportional to the magnetic field experienced at the nucleus. Small variations in this magnetic field can have dramatic effects on the MR image, caused in part by loss of phase coherence. These magnetic field variations can arise because of magnet design, the magnetic properties (susceptibility) of tissues and other materials, and the nuclear environment unique to various sites within any given molecule. The loss of phase coherence can be effectively eliminated by the use of RF refocusing pulses. Conventional MR imaging experiments can be characterized as either gradient echo or spin echo, the latter indicating the use of a RF refocusing pulse, and by the parameters TR, TE, and flip angle alpha. Tissues, in turn, are characterized by their individual spin density, M0, and by the T1, T2, and T2* time constants. Knowledge of these parameters allows one to calculate the resulting signal from a given tissue for a given MR imaging experiment.",

NSCD involves both optical excitations of the molecule and hyperfine interactions and, thus, it offers a means to realize a spectroscopy with spatially localized, high-resolution information. To survey the factors relating the molecular and electronic structure to the NSCD signal, we theoretically investigate NSCD of twenty structures of the four most common nucleic acid bases (adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine). The NSCD signal correlates with the spatial distribution of the excited states and couplings between them, reflecting changes in molecular structure and conformation. This constitutes a marked difference to the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift, which only reflects the local molecular structure in the ground electronic state. The calculated NSCD spectra are rationalized by means of changes in the electronic density and by a sum-over-states approach, which allows to identify the contributions of the individual excited states. Two separate contributions to NSCD are identified and their physical origins and relative magnitudes are discussed. The results underline NSCD spectroscopy as a plausible tool with a power for the identification of not only different molecules, but their specific structures as well.",

This paradigm is increasingly turning out to be energy-inefficient, because movement of charge within an information processing device invariably causes current flow and an associated dissipation. Replacing 'charge' with the 'spin' of an electron to encode information may eliminate much of this dissipation and lead to more energy-efficient 'green electronics'. This realization has spurred significant research in spintronic devices and circuits where spin either directly acts as the physical variable for hosting information or augments the role of charge. In this review article, we discuss and elucidate some of these ideas, and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Many of them can potentially reduce energy dissipation significantly, but unfortunately are error-prone and unreliable. Moreover, there are serious obstacles to their technological implementation that may be difficult to overcome in the near term. This review addresses three constructs: (1) single devices or binary switches that can be constituents of Boolean logic gates for digital information processing, (2) complete gates that are capable of performing specific Boolean logic operations, and (3) combinational circuits or architectures (equivalent to many gates working in unison) that are capable of performing universal computation.",

The users of NMR wanted higher magnetic fields, and the key issue for NMR manufacturers became how to increase the magnetic field strength. With a permanent magnet, the maximum magnetic field is 90 MHz (2.11 Tesla), and the limit with an electromagnet is 100 MHz (2.4 Tesla). This limitation was removed with the advent of superconducting magnets (SCM). Furthermore, in addition to the Continuous Wave method, which only allowed observation of 1H nuclei, Pulse Fourier Transform (FT) methods were developed, enabling observation and measurement of 13C and other nuclei. The development of SCM and FT was epoch-making for NMR, and the field has flourished since then. Of course, there has been technical innovation that could not be accomplished by the NMR manufacturers alone, such as the development of superconducting materials and winding techniques for SCM, and new algorithm development and the acceleration of computing speeds for FT.

When the derivative is expressed in terms of the three-state ensemble model, in the regime of low temperatures and up to temperatures of chemical interest, one finds that for zero fractional charge, the thermodynamic hardness is proportional to T<sup-1</sup(I-A), where I is the first ionization potential, A is the electron affinity, and T is the temperature. However, the thermodynamic hardness is nearly zero when the fractional charge is different from zero. Thus, through the present definition, one avoids the presence of the Dirac delta function.

By studying charged particles moving in conservative central force fields, it is shown that the process of radiation emission can be treated as a frictional process that withdraws mechanical energy from the moving particles and that dissipates the radiation energy in the environment. When the dissipation occurs inside natural (eye) or technical photon detectors, detection events are produced which form observational images of the underlying mechanical motion. As the individual events, in which radiation is emitted and detected, represent pieces of physical action that add onto the physical action associated with the mechanical motion itself, observation appears as a physical overhead that is burdened onto the mechanical motion. We show that such overheads are minimized by particles following Hamilton's equations of motion. In this way, trajectories with minimum curvature are selected and dissipative processes connected with their observation are minimized. The minimum action principles which lie at the heart of Hamilton's equations of motion thereby appear as principles of minimum energy dissipation and/or minimum information gain. Whereas these principles dominate the motion of single macroscopic particles, these principles become challenged in microscopic and intensely interacting multi-particle systems such as molecules moving inside macroscopic volumes of gas.",

This has lead to the general believe that \"a fundamental yet empirically useful understanding of how pressure alters the chemistry of the elements is lacking\" [R. J.

In this paper, we are interested in studying the role that the Pauli principle plays on the localization/delocalization of confined noninteracting electrons. To this end, we have considered the simple case of a 1-dimensional (1-D) double well as a confining potential, and the Electron Localization Function (ELF) has been used to characterize the degree localization/delocalization of the systems of noninteracting electrons. Then, we have systematically studied the topology of the ELF as a function of the double well parameters (barrier eight and wells distance) and of the number of electrons.

We measure the low-voltage current flows between gold electrodes in pure water and use the time-dependent behaviour at voltage switch-on and switch-off to evaluate the relative contribution to the steady current arising from tunnelling of electrons between the electrodes and ions in solution and from the neutralization of ions adsorbed onto the electrode surface. We ascribe the larger current contribution to quantum tunnelling of electrons to and from ions in solution near the electrodes. We refine Gurney's barrier scheme to include solvated electron states and quantify energy differences using updated information. We show that Gurney's conditions would prevent the current flow at low voltages we observe but outline how the ideas of Marcus (Marcus 1956 <iJ. Chem.

Intuition suggests that the HF kinetic energy should not exceed the exact kinetic energy; but no proof of this conjecture exists, despite a near century of development. Beginning from a generalized virial theorem derived from scaling considerations, we derive a general expression for the kinetic energy difference that applies to all systems.

Despite all this interest, there is still considerable debate over the molecular structure of the hydrated electron: does it occupy a cavity, have a significant number of interior water molecules, or have a structure somewhere in between? The reason for all this debate is that different computer simulations have produced each of these different structures, yet the predicted properties for these different structures are still in reasonable agreement with experiment. In this Feature Article, we explore the reasons underlying why different structures are produced when different pseudopotentials are used in quantum simulations of the hydrated electron. We also show that essentially all the different models for the hydrated electron, including those from fully ab initio calculations, have relatively little direct overlap of the electron's wave function with the nearby water molecules. Thus, a non-cavity hydrated electron is better thought of as an \"inverse plum pudding\" model, with interior waters that locally expel the surrounding electron's charge density. Finally, we also explore the agreement between different hydrated electron models and certain key experiments, such as resonance Raman spectroscopy and the temperature dependence and degree of homogeneous broadening of the optical absorption spectrum, in order to distinguish between the different simulated structures. Taken together, we conclude that the hydrated electron likely has a significant number of interior water molecules. ",

In fact, basis sets of triple-zeta quality or higher sometimes result in an artificially high transmission and possibly even qualitatively wrong conclusions regarding chemical trends. In these cases, transport persists when molecular atoms are replaced by basis functions alone (\"ghost atoms\"). The occurrence of such ghost transmission is correlated with low-energy virtual molecular orbitals of the central subsystem and may be interpreted as a biased and thus inaccurate description of vacuum transmission.

The former case where the tunnelling barrier is considered to be delocalized across the system can be well described with common mean-field techniques based on density functional theory (DFT), while the latter case with its two distinct barriers localized at the interfaces usually requires a multideterminant description.

Recent work has rigorously analyzed the deformation of the lateral electric field in a (streaming potential) slit cell by electron transfer reactions at the interface, taking into account both convective diffusion of the electroactive species and kinetics of the interfacial electron transfer reaction. Here a common, generic basis for faradaic and non-faradaic double layer depolarization is formulated along the lines set by Onsager, and methodologies for retrieving the underlying electrokinetic parameters from experimental data are evaluated. Particular attention is paid to the limitations of double layer polarization, as posed by the substrate.",

Unlike the previous model, the current version is not fit directly to any observables; rather, we use an ab initio exchange-correlation potential, along with a repulsive potential that is fit to reproduce the density maximum of the excess electron's wave function within the static-exchange approximation. The new parametrization performs at least as well as the previous model, as compared to ab initio benchmarks for (H(2)O)(n) (-) clusters, and also predicts reasonable values for the diffusion coefficient, radius of gyration, and absorption maximum of the bulk species. The new model predicts a vertical electron binding energy of 3.7 eV in bulk water, which is 1.4 eV smaller than the value obtained using nonpolarizable models; the difference represents the solvent's electronic reorganization energy following electron detachment. We find that the electron's first solvation shell is quite loose, which may be responsible for the electron's large, positive entropy of hydration. Many-body polarization alters the electronic absorption line shape in a qualitative way, giving rise to a high-energy tail that is observed experimentally but is absent in previous simulations. In our model, this feature arises from spatially diffuse excited states that are bound only by electronic reorganization (i.e., solvent polarization) following electronic excitation.",

Here we report the experimental measure of a sizeable offset (ca. 0.6 eV) between the vacuum levels of an aqueous solution (0.05 M NaCl) and that of our photoelectron analyzer, indicating a breakdown of the gas-like vacuum level alignment assumption for the aqueous solution. By quantifying the vacuum level offset as a function of solution chemical composition our measurements enable, for the first time, quantitative determination of ionization energies in liquid solutions. These results reveal that the ionization energy of liquid water is not independent of the chemical composition of the solution as is usually inferred in the literature, a finding that has important ramifications as measured ionization energies are frequently used to validate theoretical models that posses the ability to provide microscopic insight not directly available by experiment.

In a perfect rotationally invariant system the current does not depend on the electron-electron interaction (the latter is characterized by a standard dimensionless parameter r(S)) and hence is not sensitive to the microscopic structure of the electron correlated state. This changes, however, if a symmetry-breaking external potential is introduced or, in a realistic system, due to the crystal lattice potential (Hamer et al 1987 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 20 5677-93). In our model, we calculate the persistent current as a function of r(S) in the presence of a weak Gaussian-shaped 'impurity' potential. We find that while below a threshold value r(S)&lt;r(S)(c)≈2.05 the current is independent of r(S), it decays exponentially for r(S)&gt;r(S)(c). This signals the formation of an electron Wigner crystal pinned by the impurity potential. The electron density, homogeneous below r(S)(c), indeed shows a periodic modulation at r(S)&gt;r(S)(c). The modulation amplitude follows a (r(S)-r(S)(c))((1)/(2)) behaviour which is characteristic for a second-order phase transition, as expected in the mean-field-type DFT-OEP approach.

In our approach, the constrained state is calculated directly by running a fast optimization of the constraining potential at each iteration of the usual self-consistent-field procedure. Here, we show that the same constrained DFT approach applies to systems with multiple constraints on the density. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we focus on the study of long-range charge-transfer (CT) states. We show that constrained DFT is size-consistent:  one obtains the correct long-range CT energy when the donor-acceptor separation distance goes to infinity. For large finite distances, constrained DFT also correctly describes the 1/R dependence of the CT energy on the donor-acceptor separation. We also study a model donor-(amidinium-carboxylate)-acceptor complex, where experiments suggest a proton-coupled electron-transfer process. Constrained DFT is used to explicitly calculate the potential-energy curves of both the donor state and the acceptor state.

H.; Hernandez, R.; Handy, N. C.; Jayatilaka, D.; Willets, A. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990, 172, 62] is qualitatively incorrect for deep tunneling at energies well below the top of the barrier. The origin of this deficiency is that the formula uses an effective barrier weakly related to the true energetics but correctly adjusted to reproduce the harmonic description and anharmonic corrections of the reaction path at the saddle point as determined by second order vibrational perturbation theory. We present an analytic improved semiclassical formula that correctly includes energetic information and allows a qualitatively correct representation of deep tunneling. This is done by constructing a three segment composite Eckart potential that is continuous everywhere in both value and derivative. This composite potential has an analytic barrier penetration integral from which the semiclassical action can be derived and then used to define the semiclassical tunneling probability. The middle segment of the composite potential by itself is superior to the original formula of Miller et al. because it incorporates the asymmetry of the reaction barrier produced by the known reaction exoergicity. Comparison of the semiclassical and exact quantum tunneling probability for the pure Eckart potential suggests a simple threshold multiplicative factor to the improved formula to account for quantum effects very near threshold not represented by semiclassical theory. The deep tunneling limitations of the original formula are echoed in semiclassical high-energy descriptions of bound vibrational states perpendicular to the reaction path at the saddle point. However, typically ab initio energetic information is not available to correct it.

Hence, it is desirable to compute energy differences directly, thereby avoiding the precision problem.

However, in some cases, it cannot determine accurately the position of the hydrogen. To investigate the origins of this difficulty, the SE structures of several molecules containing either the OH or the CH3 group are determined and compared to their best ab initio counterparts. It appears that an important factor is the accuracy of the geometry used to calculate the force field, in particular when the least-squares system is not well conditioned. In this case, the mixed regression method is often an easy way to circumvent this difficulty.",

Repeated calculations were done by several different methods on both the whole molecule (104 residues plus heme) and on a 23-residue fragment containing two helices, a turn, and flanking residues.

Although much smaller in absolute magnitude than the well-known one-loop Bethe logarithm, the two-loop analog is quite significant when compared to the current experimental accuracy of the 1S-2S transition: It contributes -8.19 and -0.84 kHz for the 1S and the 2S state, respectively. The two-loop Bethe logarithm has been the largest unknown correction to the hydrogen Lamb shift to date.

In such case, typical variation of spectroscopic parameters over a wide range of shift parameters is smaller than 0.005 Å for equilibrium distances, 30 cm(-1) for harmonic vibrational frequencies, and 0.1 eV for dissociation energies. It is found that large values of σ not only remove intruder states but they also bring the MRPT energies and properties closer to experimental values. The presented analysis allows us to determine optimal values of the shift parameters to be used in conjunction with various versions of MRPT; these values are recommended to replace the ad hoc values of σ suggested in MRPT manuals in calculations for diatomics. Transferability of the optimal shift parameters to larger molecular systems and to other basis sets than aug-cc-pVTZ is anticipated but remains to be formally established. ",

In this way, nitrogen-proton distances were determined with picometer accuracy, so that vibrational averaging effects on dipole-dipole couplings need to be considered. The obtained structures were finally confirmed by the complete agreement of computed and experimental 'H and '5N chemical shifts.

Molecular hydrogen, with only two protons and two electrons, is the simplest molecule with which all aspects of a chemical bond, including electron correlation effects, can be studied. Highly precise values of its ionization and dissociation energies provide stringent tests of the precision of molecular quantum mechanics and of quantum-electrodynamics calculations in molecules.

Ionization energies of a broad range of molecules can now be determined experimentally with high accuracy (i.e. about 0.01 cm(-1)).
