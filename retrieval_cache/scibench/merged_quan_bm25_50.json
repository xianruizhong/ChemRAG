We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the expression changes in genes related to growth and photoprotection under different light environments. The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL. There was no significant difference in photosynthetic capacity between mature leaves in contrasting light environments. Although the biomass of C. concinna under LL was less than that under FL, the height of C. concinna under LL was higher than that under FL, indicating that C. concinna could grow well under the two light environments.

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

This article provides a pipeline to enhance the synthesis of such images in three-dimensional (3D) using a deep learning (DL) neural network architecture for spatial regularization in a personalized setting where having more than a few training images is impractical. Our DL enhancements employ a Deep Image Prior (DIP) with a U-net type denoising architecture that includes situations with minimal training data, such as personalized syn-MRI. We provide a general workflow for syn-MRI from three or more training images. Our workflow, called DIPsyn-MRI, uses DIP to enhance training images, then obtains parametric images using LS or MLE before synthesizing images at desired design parameter settings. DIPsyn-MRI is implemented in our publicly available Python package DeepSynMRI available at: https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI. We demonstrate feasibility and improved performance of DIPsyn-MRI on 3D datasets acquired using the Brainweb interface for spin-echo and FLASH imaging sequences, at different noise levels. Our DL enhancements improve syn-MRI in the presence of different intensity nonuniformity levels of the magnetic field, for all but very low noise levels.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors. To account for this, this work proposes a sensor interface with $\\mathrm {C}_{P}$ canceller. By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface.

The results showed that of all these gases, only the CH$_4$ gas molecule was the electron acceptor with significant charge transfer on the VO$_2$ sheet. The adsorption energies of CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O are -229.5 meV, -239.1 meV and -388.3 meV, respectively. We have also compared the adsorption energy of three different gas molecules on the VO$_2$ surface, our calculation results show that when the three kinds of gases are adsorbed on the VO$_2$ surface, the order of the surface adsorption energy is H$_2$O$&gt;$ CO$&gt;$ CH$_4$. It is also found that after adsorption of CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O molecules, the electronic properties of VO$_2$ sheet changed obviously. However, due to the strong adsorption of H$_2$O molecule on VO$_2$ sheet, it is difficult to desorption, which hinders its application in gas molecular sensors. The optical properties of VO$_2$ sheet are further calculated. The absorption of CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O molecules is introduced to red-shift the dielectric function of the thin film, which indicates that the optical properties of the thin film have changed significantly. According to the change of optical properties of VO$_2$ sheet before and after molecular adsorption, VO$_2$ can be used as a highly selective optical gas sensor for CH$_4$, CO and H$_2$O detection. These results provide a new approach for the potential application of VO$_2$ based optical gas sensors.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest.

The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

The content of anthocyanin glucosides was detected in plasma and urinary excretion. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity was assessed after intake.

The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins differed significantly and amounted to $0.18$ % (red wine) and $0.23$ % (red grape juice) of the administered dose. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity increased to higher levels after juice ingestion compared to wine. The intestinal absorption of the anthocyanins of red grape juice seemed to be improved compared to red wine, suggesting a possible synergistic effect of the glucose content of the juice. The improved absorption resulted in an enhanced plasmatic bioactivity.",

The purpose of this paper is to experimentally optimize the energy thresholds and tube voltage for single-exposure DE x-ray\u00a0angiography. We optimized single-exposure DE x-ray angiography using the iodine signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) per root patient air kerma (\u03ba) as a figure\u00a0of merit. We measured the iodine SDNR by imaging an iodine stepwedge immersed in a water tank with a depth of 30\u00a0cm in the direction of x-ray propagation. The stepwedge was imaged using tube voltages ranging from 90 to 150\u00a0kV and a cadmium telluride (CdTe) x-ray detector with two energy bins and analog charge summing for charge sharing suppression. The energy threshold that separates the two energy bins was varied from approximately 35\u00a0keV to approximately 75% of the maximum energy of the x-ray beam.

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039\u00a0kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57\u00a0$\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mol}/{\\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30\u00a0000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",

The thermodynamic basis of this low reactivity is the very strong H-H bond, with a bond dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol. The kinetic basis of the low reactivity is the nonpolar nature of H2 and its weak polarizability. It spontaneously reacts with chlorine and fluorine to form hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, respectively. The reactivity of H2 is strongly affected by the presence of metal catalysts. Thus, while mixtures of H2 with O2 or air combust readily when heated to at least 500 C by a spark or flame, they do not react at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst.

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Photoresists are most commonly used at wavelengths in the ultraviolet spectrum or shorter (<400 nm). For example, diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) absorbs strongly from approximately 300 nm to 450 nm. The absorption bands can be assigned to n-\u03c0* (S0\u2013S1) and \u03c0-\u03c0* (S1\u2013S2) transitions in the DNQ molecule. In the deep ultraviolet (DUV) spectrum, the \u03c0-\u03c0* electronic transition in benzene or carbon double-bond chromophores appears at around 200 nm. Due to the appearance of more possible absorption transitions involving larger energy differences, the absorption tends to increase with shorter wavelength, or larger photon energy. Photons with energies exceeding the ionization potential of the photoresist (can be as low as 5 eV in condensed solutions) can also release electrons which are capable of additional exposure of the photoresist.

''Caged\" compounds are defined as relatively small molecules that can release substance of interest under the action of light. Several approaches to carry this functionality to long-wavelength region are known. However, this problem has no simple solution because typical organic bond dissociation energy is about 350-400 kJ/mol, which corresponds to a 340 nm UV light. Unfortunately, the energy of infrared photon is at least twice less. Therefore, one needs to either use the energy of multiple photons or somehow weaken the bond. Below, we describe several strategies to solve the problem. First section is devoted to a near-infrared PPGs which work through a direct single-photon photoprocess. Second section describes compounds with photorelease step that involves a reaction with singlet oxygen. In the third section, we give a brief overview of two-photon absorbing PPGs. Last section concludes the paper and gives references for further reading on connected topics, including photon upconversion-based photorelease technique.\n\n\nSingle-photon PPGs\n\nThe ''uncaging\" reaction implies the dissociation of covalent bond between PPG and leaving group (LG) and therefore requires energy. For a rough estimate the average bond energy can be used to calculate the photon wavelength needed for the dissociation. For instance, C-C and C-O bonds correspond to 320-350 nm light, slightly weaker C-N bond -up to 395 nm. This simple consideration shows why the majority of known PPGs works in the near-UV spectral region. However, the process is far from simple ''scission\" and often proceeds through several stages which typically include intramolecular electron or hydrogen atom transfer, rearrangements or cyclizations, and solvolysis.",

In a solid, the spins of many electrons can act together to affect the magnetic and electronic properties of a material, for example endowing it with a permanent magnetic moment as in a ferromagnet. In many materials, electron spins are equally present in both the up and the down state, and no transport properties are dependent on spin. A spintronic device requires generation or manipulation of a spin-polarized population of electrons, resulting in an excess of spin up or spin down electrons.

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors. To account for this, this work proposes a sensor interface with $\\mathrm {C}_{P}$ canceller. By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009\u00b10.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01\u00b1 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the \"portullugo\" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (~ 2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with ~ 50% matrix completeness across data sets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support: Anacampserotaceae $+$ Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees. Our results add to the growing number of examples illustrating the complexity of phylogenetic signals in genomic-scale data.",

A. Wheeler [1] proposed the existence of several kinds of exotic systems composed of three particles with equal masses and bound through Coulomb interaction. The positronium negative ion (Ps \u2212 ), a bound state of a positron and two electrons, is the only system that has been observed thus far [2]. Since the prediction by Wheeler, many theoretical studies have been performed to explore the nature of Ps \u2212 . For example, the ground-state energy and the annihilation rate have been calculated [3]- [10] and the photodetachment process has been studied [11]- [13]. However, measurements of the decay rate have been the only experiments performed for many years [14]- [16] because of extremely low Ps \u2212 intensities.\n\nIn 2006, a new method of generating Ps \u2212 was developed [17]. Some of the slow positrons injected into a clean tungsten sample are emitted as Ps \u2212 . Although the formation efficiency observed was less than 0.01%, a dramatic enhancement of the efficiency up to 1.25% has been achieved by coating Cs atoms onto the tungsten surface [18,19]. Furthermore, coating with Na has been found to be as effective for Ps \u2212 production and the effect appears to remain for longer [20]. This technique has enabled us to perform the first observation of the photodetachment of Ps \u2212 [21]. This paper will give a brief review of the experimental studies performed so far.\n\nby the detector were blue shifted and hence separated from the \u03b3-rays from any other two photon annihilation processes. The Ps \u2212 formation efficiency, the fraction of positrons yielding Ps \u2212 , was 0.028%. Mills also investigated the decay rate of the Ps \u2212 . The bias for the gird in front of the target and the distance between the target and the foil were changed and the Ps \u2212 formation efficiencies measured were fitted to obtain the decay rate. The value determined was 2.09 (9) ns \u22121 , which is consistent with the theoretical value calculated by Ho [5].",

For electron scattering, new total electron scattering cross sections (e-TCS) have been measured with a high resolution magnetically confined electron beam transmission system from 1 to 200 eV. Dissociative electron attachment processes for electron energies from 3 to 52 eV have been analyzed by measuring the relative O<sup-</sup anion production yield. In addition, elastic, inelastic, and total scattering cross section calculations have been carried out in the framework of the Independent Atom Model by using the Screening Corrected Additive Rule, including interference effects (IAM-SCARI). Based on the previous cross section compilation from Itikawa ( <iJ. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data</i, 2002, 31, 749-767) and the present measurements and calculations, an updated recommended e-TCS data set has been used as reference values to obtain a self-consistent integral cross section data set for the elastic and inelastic (vibrational excitation, electronic excitation, and ionization) scattering channels. A similar calculation has been carried out for positrons, which shows important differences between the electron scattering behavior: e.g., more relevance of the target polarization at the lower energies, more efficient excitation of the target at intermediate energies, but a lower total scattering cross section for increasing energies, even at 5000 eV. This result does not agree with the charge independence of the scattering cross section predicted by the first Born approximation (FBA). However, we have shown that the inelastic channels follow the FBA's predictions for energies above 500 eV while the elastic part, due to the different signs of the scattering potential constituent terms, remains lower for positrons even at the maximum impact energy considered here (5000 eV). As in the case of electrons, a self-consistent set of integral positron scattering cross sections, including elastic and inelastic (vibrational excitation, electronic excitation, positronium formation, and ionization) channels is provided. Again, to derive these data, positron scattering total cross sections based on a previous compilation from Brunger et al. ( <iJ. Phys. Chem. Ref.

Data for the main inelastic channels, i.e. direct ionization and positronium formation, derived with this procedure, show excellent agreement with the experimental results available in the literature.

The total ground state energies of the anion-positron bound systems are empirically found to be an upper bound to the Hartree-Fock(HF) energies.

INTRODUCTIONDespite extensive studies [1-11] the problem of a positron forming a transient bound state with a neutral atomhas not yet been decisively settled. It is known that a negatively charged ion always binds a positron; in fact it turns out that there is an infinite number of bound states. The classical Coulomb interaction between an anion and a positron is sufficient to bind a positron while in case of neutral atoms the polarization of electron charge distribution is found to be vital for binding[12]. Schrader et al. [13,14] have calculated the positronium affinities for halogen atoms using a diffusion quantum Monte Carlo technique in which the core region is represented by a model potential. Accurate calculations on the positronium hydride, positronium helium and positronium lithium systems using the all particle diffusion Monte Carlo method have been recently reported by Yoshida et al. [8,9]. Very recently, Bressanini [15] et al. have investigated the positron-anion bound states for the anionic species Li \u2212 , B \u2212 , C \u2212 , O \u2212 and F \u2212 using variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo techniques. They found that except B \u2212 all these systems are stable against dissociation into the corresponding neutral atom and positronium. Such methods are computationally very demanding thereby restricting their applicability to systems with fewer particles. The independent particle approximation methods such as the Hartree-Fock or density functional theories enable one to compute with ease the anionic-positron interactions for all the anions in the periodic table. Calculations within the restricted HF theory have been reported by Cade and Farazdel [16,17] and Patrick and Cade [12] for the systems",

The CI method has recently been applied to the study of positronic atoms (electronically stable states consisting of a positron bound to an atom) [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] and also to positron-atom scattering states [21,22,23]. The attractive electronpositron interaction leads to the formation of a Ps cluster (i.e. something akin to a positronium atom) in the outer valence region of the atom [12,19,24,25].\n\nThe accurate representation of a Ps cluster using only single particle orbitals centered on the nucleus requires the inclusion of orbitals with much higher angular momenta than a roughly equivalent electron-only calculation [11,12,26,27]. In the most extreme case so far considered, namely e + Li, a calculation with J = 30 was required before the energy had decreased enough to establish binding. Given that helium is described as slowly convergent [1], one struggles to find an adjective that could characterize the convergence properties of positronic systems! The two most important expectation values for positronic systems are the energy, and the rate for electron-positron annihilation. The annihilation rate, which is proportional to the expectation of the electronpositron \u03b4-function, has the inconvenient property that it is even more slowly convergent than the energy with respect to orbital angular momentum. One has successive increments decreasing at high J according to [7,15,28]:\n\u2206\u0393 J = \u0393 J \u2212 \u0393 J\u22121 \u2248 A \u0393 (J + 1 2 ) 2 ,(2)\nTo put this in perspective, it would take a calculation with J \u2248 250 to recover 99% of the PsH annihilation rate [10]. In addition to the slow convergence with J, the \u03b4-function operator also exhibits very slow convergence with respect to the radial basis [10].",

The thermalized positron will eventually annihilate with an electron of the medium. It can annihilate as a free particle with an electron of the medium into two -photons each carrying the mass-energy (~511 keV) of the annihilating particles. However, due to energy advantage, a significant fraction of thethermalized positrons forms a bound state, positronium (Ps), a hydrogen-like atom consisting of the positron and an electron of the medium prior to annihilation. Due to the relatively large size of the Ps atoms, they only form within and annihilate from the pores in molecular media, thus making them unique and efficient probes of such 'holes' in the matrix. Depending on the spin configurations of the two particles, a Ps atom form as a para-positronium (p-Ps: antiparallel positron and electron spins; total spin 0) or an ortho-Positronium (o-Ps: parallel positron and electron spins; total spin 1). The total spins of the two Ps-states dictate that an o-Ps has an abundance of three times that of p-Ps. In vacuum, a p-Ps annihilates into twophotons with a lifetime of 125 ps while an o-Ps annihilates into three -photons with a lifetime of 142 ns which is three orders of magnitude larger.

(1) for some species (e.g., argon and nitrogen), the rate for dichlorofluoromethane CCl 2 F 2 (\"Freon-12\") was much larger.

Indeed, the evidence for positrons was discovered in 1932 by Carl David Anderson in cosmic rays. With enough energy, such as by absorbing a photon, an electron-positron pair could be created, a process called pair production; the reverse process, annihilation, could also occur with the emission of a photon. This showed that particle numbers need not be fixed during an interaction. Historically, however, positrons were at first thought of as \"holes\" in an infinite electron sea, rather than a new kind of particle, and this theory was referred to as the Dirac hole theory.

The e + Na system is formulated as a three-body system: a frozen core, a positron and an electron. In this way, the system resembles the hydrogen-positron system, but there are some qualitative differences. First, the interaction between the Na + core and the active electron is Coulombic only at very long range. At shorter distances the nuclear charge is only partially screened, which makes it necessary to employ some sort of model potential for the e \u2212 Na + interaction. More generally this interaction should also include electron exchange, but this has not been explicitly included in our study. The e + Na interaction is, like the e + H interaction, at long distances dominated by the polarizability of the atom, giving a potential \u221d r \u22124 . The polarizability of Na (162 atomic units) is however larger than that of H (4.5 atomic units), which allows the formation of a truly bound state of the e + Na system [1]. Furthermore, the hydrogen atom has energy levels degenerate with respect to orbital angular momentum (neglecting fine structure) whereas the alkali atoms do not. Another characteristic of a positron-Na system is that the ionization energy of Na (0.19 a.u.) is smaller than the binding energy of Ps (0.25 a.u.), allowing for positronium formation even at zero impact energy.\n\nS-, P-, and D-wave resonances are calculated for energies extending up to the positronium (Ps) n = 2 formation thresholds for natural parity. Resonance states for P e and D o are calculated for unnatural parity for energies extending up to the Ps, n = 3 formation threshold; which have not been previously reported.

In localized cyclohexatriene, the carbon\u2013carbon bonds should be alternating 154 and 133 pm. Instead, all carbon\u2013carbon bonds in benzene are found to be about 139 pm, a bond length intermediate between single and double bond. This mixed single and double bond (or triple bond) character is typical for all molecules in which bonds have a different bond order in different contributing structures. Bond lengths can be compared using bond orders. For example, in cyclohexane the bond order is 1 while that in benzene is 1 + (3 \u00f7 6) = .

The most common form is the single bond: a bond composed of two electrons, one from each of the two atoms. The carbon\u2013carbon single bond is a sigma bond and is formed between one hybridized orbital from each of the carbon atoms. In ethane, the orbitals are sp3-hybridized orbitals, but single bonds formed between carbon atoms with other hybridizations do occur (e.g. sp2 to sp2). In fact, the carbon atoms in the single bond need not be of the same hybridization. Carbon atoms can also form double bonds in compounds called alkenes or triple bonds in compounds called alkynes. A double bond is formed with an sp2-hybridized orbital and a p-orbital that is not involved in the hybridization. A triple bond is formed with an sp-hybridized orbital and two p-orbitals from each atom. The use of the p-orbitals forms a pi bond.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

In considering the hydrophobicity of intramembranous protein (IMP) H-bonds which cross the phospholipid bilayer of plasma membranes, and the necessity for photonic recycling in cell surface interactions after dissipation of energetic states, present models lack structure and thermodynamic properties to maintain (DeltaE) sufficient energy sources necessary for amplifications by factors of 10(12). Even though one accepts that the ligand-receptor association alters the conformation of extracellular, extruding portions of IMP's at the cell surface, and that this change can be transmitted to the cytoplasm by the transmembranous helical segments by nonlinear vibrations of proteins with generation of soliton waves, one is still unable to account for repair and balanced function. Indeed, responses of critical molecules to certain magnetic field signals may include enhanced vibrational amplitudes, increased quanta of thermal energies and order inducing interactions. We may accept that microtrabecular reticulum-receptor is associated with actin filaments and ATP molecules which contribute to the activation of the cyclase enzyme system through piezoelectricity. Magnetic fields will pass through the membrane which sharply attenuates the electric field component of an EM field, due to its high impedance. Furthermore, EM oscillations are converted to mechanical vibrations; i.e., photon-phonon transduction, to induce molecular vibrations of frequencies specifically responsible for bioamplifications of weak triggers at the membrane surface, as well as GAP junctions. The hydrogen bonds of considerable importance are those in proteins (10(12)Hz) and DNA (10(11)Hz) and may be viewed as centers of EM radiation emission in the range from the mm microwaves to the far IR. However, classical electrodynamical theory does not yield a model for biomolecular resonant responses which are integrated over time and account for the connection between the phonon field and photons. Jacobson Resonance does supply an initial physical mechanism, as equivalencies in energy to that of Zeeman Resonance (i.e., zero-order magnetic resonance) and cyclotron resonance may be derived from the DeBroglie wave particle equation. For the first time, we view the introduction of Relativity Theory to biology in the expression, mc(2)=BvLq, where m is the mass of a particle in the 'box' or 'string' (molecule in a biosystem), c is the velocity of electromagnetic field in space, independent of its inertial frame of reference, B is the magnetic flux density,v is the velocity of the carrier or 'string' (a one or two dimensional 'box') in which the particle exists, L is its dimension (length) and q represents a unit charge q=1C, by defining electromotive force as energy per unit charge. Equivalencies suggest that qvBL is one of the fundamental expressions of energy of a charged wave-particle in magnetic fields, just as Zeeman and cyclotron resonance energy expressions, gbetaB and qhB/2pim, and is applicable to all charged particles (molecules in biological systems). There may exist spontaneous, independent and incessant interactions of magnetic vector B and particles in biosystems which exert Lorentz forces. Lorentz forces may be transmitted from EM field to gravitational field as a gravity wave which return to the phonon field as microgravitational fluctuations to therein produce quantum vibrational states that increase quanta of thermal energies integrated over time. This may account for the differential of 10(12) between photonic energy of ELF waves and the Boltzman energy kT. Recent data from in vivo controlled studies are included as empirical support for the various hypotheses presented.",

We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group.

Each such particle can emit not more than one photon at a time, a quantum-mechanical effect known as photon antibunching. Recording anti-bunching in a fluorescence image provides additional information that can be used to enhance the microscope's resolution beyond the diffraction limit, and was demonstrated for several types of fluorescent particles. Intuitively, antibunching can be thought of as detection of \u2018missing\u2019 events of two photons emitted from every particle that cannot simultaneously emit two photons. It is therefore used to produce an image that would have been produced using photons with half the wavelength of the detected photons. By detecting N-photon events, the resolution can be improved by up to a factor of N over the diffraction limit.",

The energy gradients that serve as an input for the Velocity-Verlet algorithm were analytically calculated in the electronic part of the simulation. In contrast to the nuclei, the electrons are treated by means of ab initio quantum mechanics. Here, the electronic wave function is expanded into a linear combination of basis functions, that represent the contribution of the different calculated electronic states to the total wave function. The time evolution of the quantum amplitudes is followed using the 5th order Butcher algorithm 5 with a time step of 5 \u00b7 10 \u22126 fs.

In contrast we immediately see from the Table and from Figure 5 that larger discrepancies are found between the two methods for doublet states. The equilibrium distance is now shorter by about 0.2a 0 in the FCI/ECP+CPP method, which could partly be accounted for the larger contribution of the core-core repulsion around 7.6a 0 than in the lowest states with a higher R e . While consistent in magnitude, the harmonic constants differ by about 4 cm \u22121 between the two methods, which could be reduced if we account for the short-range core-core term. The largest discrepancy concerns the well depth of the 3 2 \u03a3 + and 2 2 \u03a0 states which is deeper by about 1000 cm \u22121 in the FCI/ECP+CPP results. The PEDM functions of Figure 6b reveal that while having similar trends, the details of the electronic wave functions induce significant differences in the oscillating patterns, i.e. in the relative weights of the configurations.

Nevertheless these TDMs deserve more attention. Asymptotically such transitions are in principle forbidden due to atomic spin-flip selection rule. Actually the 1 S \u2192 3 P 1 excitation is allowed by electric dipole transition due to secondorder spin-orbit mixing with the higher 1 P 1 state, while the excitation towards the 3 P 0,2 states is strongly forbidden. In the molecular region, the disallowed transitions from ground state becomes allowed due to the Pauli exchange interaction which can be measured by the magnitude of the exchange energy [79]).

If one assumes no dependence of the electronic transition dipole with respect to the changes in the molecular geometry during the transition, the so-called Franck-Condon (FC) approximation, the vibrational structure of the optical bands is determined by the overlap integral of vibrational wave functions, known as the FC factors 7 . In order to use a common coordinate system to evaluate the latter integrals, Duschinsky 8 proposed a linear transformation to account for the rotation and displacement of the normal modes between the initial and final states molecular structures.\n\nRecently, Huh et al. 9 showed an elegant mapping between FC transitions and the scattering of quantum states of photons going through an interferometer and measured using photon number resolving detectors (PNRD). They showed that FCFs are analogous to a) Electronic mail: nicolas@xanadu.ai the photon-number probability amplitudes of squeezeddisplaced states after going through a linear optical network. A similar problem, N single photons scattering through an interferometer and being probed by PNRD, so-called Boson Sampling 10 , has provided a significant momentum for the development of photonic technologies and for the study of combinatorial sampling problems. These developments were motivated by Aaronson and Arkhipov 10 , who showed that a classical computer requires a time that is exponential in the number of photons to generate the samples that the quantum experiment generates by construction. This was one of the first provable computational tasks in which a rudimentary, non-universal quantum computer can exhibit an exponential speedup over classical computers 11 .\n\nAn important part of the arguments developed by Aaronson and Arkhipov is that the probability amplitudes appearing in Boson Sampling are proportional to a matrix function known as the permanent, which counts the number of perfect matchings of an undirected bipartite graph, and is in the #P Complete complexity class 12 .",

[3][4][5] This method has a rather high computational effort (6N-5 harmonic frequency evaluations with N being the number of atoms in the system) but at the same time considers only local curvature information close to the minimum. For this reason VPT2 approaches are known to be of limited accuracy in case of strongly anharmonic potentials (e.g., OH bonds) which have been recently confirmed in joint experimental and theoretical investigations. [6,7] A further widely employed method is the so-called Vibrational Self Consisting Field (VSCF) [8][9][10][11] approach. This method uses, in analogy to Hartree-Fock SCF, an ansatz which by definition strongly approximates coupling of different modes. Various improved VSCF approaches have been formulated focusing on higher accuracy [12][13][14][15] and a computational efficient procedure. [16][17][18][19][20][21] While VSCF and its extensions are based on grid data that is typically interpolated to obtain a continuous representation of the potential energy surface, there exist different families of grid-based methods evaluating the wave functions only on the provided data-points. These methods lead to reliable results with comparably small computational effort. [6,7,[22][23][24][25] The latter are not limited to problems in vibrational spectroscopy, but have also been applied in approaches to describe the electronic density in atoms and small molecules. [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] ] Among these is the so-called Numerov method, [34,35] which was shown to predict the experimentally determined vibrational frequencies of H 2 and H 2 O within 1 cm \u22121 (\u22640.1)% using correlated ab initio based potential energy information. [36] Also density functional theory (DFT) at hybrid level [37,38] combined with the Numerov scheme proved highly accurate in predicting the IR fundamental and first overtone of the OH-vibrational modes of methanol and phenol, especially under gas-phase conditions where a deviation of <0.5% was achieved.

We investigate these ISC rates experimentally and theoretically as a function of S1 state vibrational excess energy Eexc. The S1 vibronic levels are pumped with a \u223c5 ns UV laser, the S1 and triplet state ion signals are separated by prompt or delayed ionization with a second UV laser pulse. After correcting the raw ISC yields for the relative S1 and T1 ionization cross sections, we obtain energy dependent ISC quantum yields QISC (corr)=1%-5%. These are combined with previously measured vibronic state-specific decay rates, giving ISC rates kISC = 0.4-1.5 \u22c5 10(9) s(-1), the corresponding S1\u21ddS0 internal conversion (IC) rates are 30-100 times larger.

The Markov approximation leading to Eq. (11) completely neglects any correlation between forces at different times and essentially only contains thermal fluctuations. That the Markov approximation has a classical flavor can be seen in the low temperature limit where the fluctuating forces vanish. The Langevin equation with a harmonic potential then gives rise to a decaying average energy: E(t) = E 0 e \u2212\u03b7t/M which is not allowed quantum mechanically, since the average energy can not become less than the zero point energy. This paradox is solved by going beyond the Markov approximation where a small fluctuating force exactly cancels the frictional decay. To get an idea of the range of temperatures where the Markov approximation works, we can estimate the correlation time by t c = /k B T . [19] The timestep used in the molecular dynamics in this work was 1 f s which corresponds to T = 2900 K and this gives an estimate on the lower temperature limit to the Markov approximation. Memory effects in non-adiabatic dynamics will be explored further in a future paper.\n\n\nVI. SUMMARY\n\nWe have analyzed the effect of including zero point motion properly in Langevin dynamics with a temperature dependent friction tensor. The method which involves initial phase space sampling, have been compared to a quasiclassical approach where classical initial conditions matching the zero point energy is used. For a harmonic oscillator, the initial conditions is the only quantum mechanical correction since the quantum dynamics becomes classical and we have shown how to obtain vibrational probabilities from the classical energy distribution resulting from Langevin dynamics with phase space sampling. As expected, the result agrees extremely well with an inherently quantum mechanical master equation approach when the initial conditions is included correctly, whereas the quasiclassical approach only tends to a reasonable result after \u223c 1 ps of interaction. We have also compared the results of using quantized and quasiclassical initial conditions in a Morse potential and found only a little effect on the probability for escaping the potential well. The reason for this can be attributed to the fact that the escape probabilities involves a sum over the continuous set of free states and the quasiclassical approach yields a good description of average quantities.",

An important consequence of the expressions obtained in present paper is the possibility obtaining these date of matrix elements compared to the number of calculations using numerical methods. Even for comparatively light diatomic molecules (except the hydrogen molecule and hydrides) using the obtained expressions allows reduce the number of necessary calculations more than one order of magnitude.\n\n\ndiagram technique describing the actions of the annihilation operator at the consideration of vibrational dependences of matrix elements has been developed.

These formulas for the case of anharmonic potential curves were previously absent in the literature known to us. It is important to emphasize that proposed method for determining of vibrational dependences of matrix elements is a direct, simple and intuitive unlike the techniques developed earlier and does not require using any special theories of quantum mechanics (hypervirial, Hellmann-Feynman and others) and hypergeometric functions. The only required information reduces to knowing the explicit form of the annihilation operator and the wave function of the ground vibrational state of the molecule.

Basis functions describing a large number of chemically inert core electrons may thus be excluded from the molecular GRECP calculation.\n\nThe X and M parameters were calculated by the finite field method (see, e.g., Refs. [21,22]). The operator corresponding to a desired property [see Eqs. (3) and (5)] is multiplied by a small parameter \u03bb and added to the Hamiltonian. The derivative of the energy with respect to \u03bb gives the computed property. This is strictly correct only at the limit of vanishing \u03bb, but it is usually possible to find a range of \u03bb values where the energy is linear with \u03bb and energy changes are large enough to allow sufficient precision. The quadratic dependence on \u03bb is eliminated in the present calculations by averaging absolute energy changes obtained with \u03bb of opposite signs.",

Electron spin echo experiments (echo detected ESR, electron spin-lattice relaxation, and spin echo dephasing) were performed in the temperature range of 4.2-50 K. The rigid lattice g factors are g(x) = 2.0016, g(y) = 2.0505, and g(z) = 2.0355, and they are gradually averaged with temperature to the final collapse into a single line with g = 2.028 above 300 K.

The low-lying orbital states of the open form of S(3)(-) molecule having C(2v) symmetry are considered and molecular orbital (MO) theory of the g factors is presented. The orbital mixing coefficients were calculated from experimental g factors and available theoretical orbital splitting. They indicate that the unpaired electron spin density in the ground state is localized mainly (about 50%) on the central sulfur atom of S(3)(-) anion radical, whereas in the excited electronic state the density is localized mainly on the lateral sulfur atoms (90%). A strong broadening of the ESR lines in directions around the twofold symmetry axis of the radical S(3)(-) molecule (z-axis) is discovered below 10 K. It is due to a distribution of the S-S-S bond angle value influencing mainly the energy of the (2)B(2)-symmetry MO. This effect is smeared out by molecular dynamics at higher temperatures. A distribution of the g factors is confirmed by the recovery of the spin system magnetization during spin-lattice relaxation measurements, which is described by a stretched exponential function. Both the spin-lattice relaxation and electron spin echo dephasing are governed by localized phonon mode of energy of about 40 cm(-1). Thus, the anion-radical S(3)(-) molecules are weakly bonded to the zeolite framework, and they do not participate in the phonon motion of the host lattice because of their own local dynamics.",

An EPR spectrum of this state exhibits broad split signals due to the interaction of the tyrosyl radical, Y(Z)(*), with the S = 1/2 S(2) state of the Mn(4) cluster. We present a novel approach to analyze S(2)Y(Z)(*) spectra of one-dimensionally (1-D) oriented acetate-inhibited PS II membranes to determine the magnitude and relative orientation of the S(2)Y(Z)(*) dipolar vector within the membrane. Although there exists a vast body of EPR data on isolated spins in oriented membrane sheets, the present study is the first of its kind on dipolar-coupled electron spin pairs in such systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and establish a rigorous treatment to account for the disorder present in partially oriented 1-D membrane preparations. We find that (i) the point-dipole distance between Y(Z)(*) and the Mn(4) cluster is 7.9 +/- 0.2 A, (ii) the angle between the interspin vector and the thylakoid membrane normal is 75 degrees, (iii) the g(z)()-axis of the Mn(4) cluster is 70 degrees away from the membrane normal and 35 degrees away from the interspin vector, and (iv) the exchange interaction between the two spins is -275 x 10(-)(4) cm(-)(1), which is antiferromagnetic. Due to the sensitivity of EPR line shapes of oriented spin-coupled pairs to the interspin distance, the present study imposes a tighter constraint on the Y(Z)-Mn(4) point-dipole distance than obtained from randomly oriented samples. The geometric constraints obtained from the 1-D oriented sample are combined with published models of the structure of Mn-depleted PS II to propose a location of the Mn(4) cluster. A structure in which Y(Z) is hydrogen bonded to a manganese-bound hydroxide ligand is consistent with available data and favors maximal orbital overlap between the two redox center that would facilitate direct electron- and proton-transfer steps.",

The trajectories of baseballs pitched by both a pitcher and a pitching machine were recorded using four synchronized video cameras (60 Hz) and were analyzed using direct linear transform (DLT) procedures. A polynomial function using the least squares method was used to derive the time-displacement relationship of the ball coordinates during flight for each pitch. The baseball was filmed immediately after ball release using a high-speed video camera (250 Hz), and the direction of the spin axis and the spin rate (omega) were calculated based on the positional changes of the marks on the ball. The lift coefficient was correlated closely with omegasinalpha (r = 0.860), where alpha is the angle between the spin axis and the pitching direction. The term omegasinalpha represents the vertical component of the velocity vector. The lift force, which is a result of the Magnus effect occurring because of the rotation of the ball, acts perpendicularly to the axis of rotation.

Caused by selective excitation of molecular orientations DEER primary data also depend on the mutual orientation of the spin labels. For a doubly spin labeled variant of the cytoskeletal protein vinculin tail strong orientation selection can be observed already at X-band frequencies, which allows us to reduce the problem to the relative orientation of two molecular axes and the spin-spin axis parameterized by three angles. A full grid search of parameter space reveals that the DEER experiment introduces parameter-space symmetry higher than the symmetry of the spin Hamiltonian. Thus, the number of equivalent parameter sets is twice as large as expected and the relative orientation of the two spin labels is ambiguous. Except for this inherent ambiguity the most probable relative orientation of the two spin labels can be determined with good confidence and moderate uncertainty by global fitting of a set of five DEER experiments at different offsets between pump and observer frequency. The experiment provides restraints on the angles between the z axis of the nitroxide molecular frame and the spin-spin vector and on the dihedral between the two z axes. When using the same type of label at both sites, assignment of the angle restraints is ambiguous and the sign of the dihedral restraint is also ambiguous.",

The magnetic coupling in the dimer is profoundly affected by changes in both the bridging ligands and Mn oxidation state. In particular, change in the bridging structure has a dramatic effect on the nature of the Jahn-Teller distortion observed for the Mn(III) centers in the III/III and III/IV dimers. The principal magnetic interactions in [Mn(2)(mu-O)(2)(O(2)CH)(NH(3))(6)](n+)() involve the J(xz/xz)and J(yz/yz) pathways but due to the tilt of the Mn(2)O(2) core, they are less efficient than in the planar di-mu-oxo structure and, consequently, the calculated exchange coupling constants are generally smaller. In both the III/III and III/IV dimers, the Mn(III) centers are high-spin, and the Jahn-Teller effect gives rise to axially elongated Mn(III) geometries with the distortion axis along the Mn-O(c) bonds. In the III/IV dimer, the tilt of the Mn(2)O(2) core enhances the crossed exchange J(x)()()2(-)(y)()()2(/)(z)()()2 pathway relative to the planar di-mu-oxo counterpart, leading to significant delocalization of the odd electron. Since this delocalization pathway partially converts the Mn(IV) ion into low-spin Mn(III), the magnetic exchange in the ground state can be considered to arise from two interacting spin ladders, one is the result of coupling between Mn(IV) (S = 3/2) and high-spin Mn(III) (S = 2), the other is the result of coupling between Mn(IV) (S = 3/2) and low-spin Mn(III) (S = 1). In [Mn(2)(mu-O)(O(2)CH)(2)(NH(3))(6)](n+)(), both the III/III dimer and the lowest energy structure for the III/IV dimer involve high-spin Mn(III), but the Jahn-Teller axis is now orientated along the Mn-oxo bond, giving rise to axially compressed Mn(III) geometries with long Mn-O(c) equatorial bonds. In the IV/IV dimer, the ferromagnetic crossed exchange J(yz)()(/)(z)()()2 pathway partially cancels J(yz/yz) and, as a consequence, the antiferromagnetic J(xz/xz) pathway dominates the magnetic coupling. In the III/III dimer, the J(yz/yz) pathway is minimized due to the smaller Mn-O-Mn angle, and since the ferromagnetic J(yz)()(/)(z)()()2 pathway largely negates J(xz/xz), relatively weak overall antiferromagnetic coupling results. In the III/IV dimer, the structures involving high-spin and low-spin Mn(III) are almost degenerate. In the high-spin case, the odd electron is localized on the Mn(III) center, and the resulting antiferromagnetic coupling is similar to that found for the IV/IV dimer. In the alternative low-spin structure, the odd electron is significantly delocalized due to the crossed J(yz)()(/)(z)()()2 pathway, and cancellation between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic pathways leads to overall weak magnetic coupling. The delocalization partially converts the Mn(IV) ion into high-spin Mn(III), and consequently, the spin ladders arising from coupling of Mn(IV) (S = 3/2) with high-spin (S = 2) and low-spin (S = 1) Mn(III) are configurationally mixed. Thus, in principle, the ground-state magnetic coupling in the mixed-valence dimer will involve contributions from three spin-ladders, two associated with the delocalized low-spin structure and the third arising from the localized high-spin structure.",

A short dc pulse along the z axis rotates the transverse spin components of nuclear species I and S through different angles, converting a portion of the scalar order into vector order. The development of vector order can be described analytically by means of single-transition operators, and it is found to be maximal when the transverse components of I are rotated by an angle of \u00b1\u03c0\u22152 relative to those of S.

Complex 1a, formally diiron(I), has a system spin S = 3 with an isolated MS = +/-3 quasi-doublet as a ground state; the MS = +/-2 doublet is &gt;100 cm-1 higher in energy. Complex 1a exhibits at 4.2 K a large, positive magnetic hyperfine field, Bint = +68.1 T, and an effective g value of 16 +/- 2 along the easy magnetization axis of the ground doublet; this value is significantly larger than the spin-only value (g = 12). These results have been rationalized by DFT calculations, which show that each Fe site donates significant electron density into the pi* orbitals of dinitrogen, resulting in a configuration best described as two high-spin FeII (Sa = Sb = 2) bridged by triplet N22- (Sc = 1). In this description the minority spin electron of each iron is accommodated by two nonbonding, closely spaced 3d orbitals, z2 and yz (z is perpendicular to the diketiminate planes, x is along the Fe...Fe vector). Spin-orbit coupling between these orbital states generates a large unquenched orbital momentum along the iron-iron vector. The S = 3 ground state of 1a results from strong antiferromagnetic direct exchange couplings of the Fe spins (Sa = Sb = 2) to the N22- spin (Sc = 1) and can be formulated as ((Sa,Sb)Sab = 4, Sc = 1), S = 3&gt;; H = J(Sa + Sb).Sc with J approximately 3500 cm-1.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009&lt;\u200910-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009=\u20090.003) but was unaffected by CO (P\u2009=\u20090.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

The effect of diffuse function augmentation converges slowly, and cannot be reproduced with double- \u03b6 or triple- \u03b6 calculations as these are plagued with basis set superposition and incompleteness errors.",

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315\u00a0$\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50\u00a0$\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives. Cs and CD measurements were obtained from the left carotid artery. A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV. The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories. Study results demonstrated that the proposed approach has a potential to provide valuable surrogate markers for cardiovascular risk assessment.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with \u2113 = 0 transfer but enhances those with \u2113 = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009&lt;\u200910-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009=\u20090.003) but was unaffected by CO (P\u2009=\u20090.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2.

High correlation (r<sup2</sup \u00a0=\u00a00.99) between 1.5\u2009T and 3.0\u2009T QSM-BLS, with narrow reproducibility coefficients (range, [0.13, 0.21] ppm) were observed for each protocol. This work evaluated the feasibility and performance of liver QSM-BLS across iron levels and acquisition protocols at 1.5\u2009T and 3.0\u2009T. High correlation and reproducibility were observed between QSM-BLS and SQUID-BLS across protocols and field strengths. In summary, QSM-BLS may enable reliable and reproducible quantification of liver iron concentration.",

A total of 53 genetic correlations and 47 heritability estimates from 13 scientific articles were used in the meta-analysis. The included papers were published between 2010 and 2022. To measure heterogeneity, Chi-square (Q) test was performed, and the I<sup2</sup statistic was determined. The average heritability estimates for the studied traits were low to moderate and ranged from 0.137 (for METY) to 0.250 (for METP\u2009+\u2009CO<sub2</sub ).

The genetic correlation estimate between METP with O<sub2</sub was -0.597 (p\u00a0&lt;\u20090.05), but its genetic correlations with other gas traits ranged from 0.593 (with METP\u2009+\u2009CO<sub2</sub ) to 0.653 (CO<sub2</sub ; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Also, mean estimates of genetic correlation between METP with live weight (LW), feed intake (FI), and residual feed intake (RFI) were 0.719, 0.598, and 0.408, respectively. The genetic correlations of CO<sub2</sub with performance traits varied from 0.641 (with RFI) to 0.833 (with FI; p\u00a0&lt;\u20090.05). This meta-analysis showed gas emission traits in sheep are under low-to-moderate genetic control. The average genetic parameter estimates obtained in this study could be considered in the genetic selection programmes for sheep, especially when there is no access to accurate phenotypic records or genetic parameter estimates for gas emission traits.",

However, classical methods that use least-squares (LS) or maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are unsatisfactory at higher noise levels because the underlying inverse problem is ill-posed. This article provides a pipeline to enhance the synthesis of such images in three-dimensional (3D) using a deep learning (DL) neural network architecture for spatial regularization in a personalized setting where having more than a few training images is impractical. Our DL enhancements employ a Deep Image Prior (DIP) with a U-net type denoising architecture that includes situations with minimal training data, such as personalized syn-MRI. We provide a general workflow for syn-MRI from three or more training images. Our workflow, called DIPsyn-MRI, uses DIP to enhance training images, then obtains parametric images using LS or MLE before synthesizing images at desired design parameter settings. DIPsyn-MRI is implemented in our publicly available Python package DeepSynMRI available at: https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI. We demonstrate feasibility and improved performance of DIPsyn-MRI on 3D datasets acquired using the Brainweb interface for spin-echo and FLASH imaging sequences, at different noise levels. Our DL enhancements improve syn-MRI in the presence of different intensity nonuniformity levels of the magnetic field, for all but very low noise levels. This article provides recipes and software to realistically facilitate DL-enhanced personalized syn-MRI.",

Ground and excited state structures of the uranyl tetrahalide complexes a. Uranyl tetrahalide dianions The structure of uranyl tetrachloride dianion has been well-studied by the variety of theoretical and experimental techniques [6,15,20,35,[48][49][50][51]. Insofar as the inclusion of all effects like in experimental conditions is challenging for ab initio calculations because of the difficulties in building chemically relevant models and the fast growing of the computational costs as the model expands, the present quantum chemical study was performed on models with increasing chemical complexity, to approach the solution sample.\n\nThe spin-free optimized ground and the first excited state distances between uranium and the coordinated atoms of the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2together with experimental data are shown in Table I.\n\nIn the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2gas-phase PBE0 calculations, the ground state R U\u2212O =1.758 \u00c5 value is in a good agreement with 1.766 \u00c5 obtained with the CCSD(T) wave-function method, while R U\u2212Cl =2.714 \u00c5 comes out shorter than 2.735 \u00c5. Moreover, the PBE0 geometries are in good accordance with the all-electron CAM-B3LYP results reported by Tecmer et al. [35]. This gives us confidence in the ability of PBE0 to provide fairly accurate geometries of the uranium containing complexes. The inclusion of solvent effects on [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2does not significantly change the R U\u2212O distance as compared to the gas-phase calculations, but it shortens R U\u2212Cl as the solvent polarity increases. Keeping in mind that we do not have strictly the same conditions as in the experiment, it is worth examining trends in both theoretical and experimental data. The comparison of the experimental crystal structure of Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 [6] with the structure of uranyl tetrachloride dianion in acetonitrile [49] shows that the R U\u2212O bond length is almost the same in both conditions, while R U\u2212Cl values are found to be longer in solution by about 0.01 \u00c5.",

When such transition occurs \nthe U-O bond weakens and the excited state potential \ncurve shifts along the U-O symmetric stretching mode \nto larger distances and becomes flatter [19]. Looking at \nthe excited state geometries of the uranyl tetrahalide di-\nanions one can note a lengthening of the R U\u2212O bond \nby 0.031 \u00c5 and 0.028 \u00c5, in [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2 -and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2 -, \nrespectively, since the excitation depopulates the U-O \nbonding \u03c3 u orbital. The differences of the R U\u2212X bonds \nare small, about 0.010 \u00c5 in average, because the \u03c3 u or-\nbital has small contributions from the halide valence p or-\nbitals. From highly resolved low-temperature two-photon \nabsorption spectra of Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 , Denning et al. [15, 46] \ndetermined that the U -O and U -Cl bonds elongate by \n0.070 \u00c5 and 0.014 \u00c5, respectively.

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract \u03bd s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane. The resulting \u03bd s value amounts to (836 \u00b1 18) cm \u22121 . It is in good agreement with the values, (823 \u00b1 14) cm \u22121 , 825 cm \u22121 , and (850 \u00b1 25) cm \u22121 observed in acetone [7], [C 4 mim][Tf 2 N] [8], and in [Bu 3 MeN][Tf 2 N] [9], respectively. This vibration corresponds to a Raman active vibration of the uranyl unit and can be correlated to the yl-U -O bond length. Using the empiric relation of Bartlett and Cooney [47]:\nR U\u2212O /(\u00c5) = 106.5 \u00d7 \u03bd \u22122/3 s + 0.575(1)\nwe calculated the U -O bond length to be equal to (1.77 \u00b1 0.01) \u00c5 (using \u03bd s = (836 \u00b1 18) cm \u22121 ) for our uranyl sample. This value is in a good agreement with all experimental data listed in Table I, and can therefore serve as reference data to assess the accuracy of the ab initio calculations we will now discuss.",

Results of a chosen set of functionals were compared to post-HF methods (EOM-CCSD, NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MRCI). In addition, the semiempirical OM2/MNDO method using MRCISD computational level was confronted with the above-mentioned techniques. Despite the fact that the first excited state has a significant double-excitation character some functionals were able to qualitatively determine the correct state order (where the lowest excited state has a <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msubsup<mml:miA</mml:mi <mml:mig</mml:mi <mml:mo-</mml:mo</mml:msubsup </mml:mrow <mml:annotation$$ {\\mathrm{A}}_{\\mathrm{g}}^{-} $$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math character). The most successful functionals in transition energies predictions were PBE, TPSS and BLYP in Tamm-Dancoff approach (TDA), which had the smallest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) scoring towards the experimental values. Regarding RMSD scoring, the OM2/MNDO method performed fairly well, too. Besides absorption spectra, lifetimes of the first two excited states were estimated based on a stochastic approach exploring a swarm of OM2/MNDO hopping dynamics using the Tully fewest switch algorithm for each molecule. The longest lifetime of the first excited state (S<sub1</sub ) was found for decapentaene (about 5\u00a0ps). Further elongation of the conjugated chain caused a mild decrease of this value to ca 1.5\u00a0ps for docosaundecaene.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

With increasing of polarity the \u03bd U\u2212Cl stretching frequencies insignificantly increase (4 and 7 cm \u22121 ) for the ground and excited states, respectively, while the uranyl \u03bd b , \u03bd s and \u03bd a decrease by 5 up to 25 cm \u22121 in both states. This shift of the ground-state frequencies should be observable in the computed luminescence spectra, namely in the spacing between the vi- brationally resolved peaks, while the minor change of the excited state frequencies should only affect the vibronic intensities. The substitution of chlorides by bromides in the uranyl equatorial plane lead to the following changes in the vibrational spectra. Compared to uranyl tetrachloride, the \u03bd b value decreased by less than 10 cm \u22121 in both ground and excited states. The \u03bd s increased by 13 and 62 cm \u22121 in the ground and excited states, respectively. Similarly, the \u03bd a increased by 14 cm \u22121 for the ground and 76 cm \u22121 for the first excited state. The U -Br stretching mode is 83 cm \u22121 lower in both ground and excited states than the U -Cl symmetric stretching vibration. This is in line with the ground-state experimental trends measured for\nCs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 with [C 7 H 16 NO 2 ][UO 2\nBr 4 ] (91, 2, 6 and 9 cm \u22121 for \u03bd U\u2212Br , \u03bd b , \u03bd s and \u03bd a , respectively). These changes indicate that the bromide ligand has a smaller effect on the electronic structure of uranium than chloride, since the U-Br bond strength is essentially ionic and has less impact on the U-O bonding. Consistently, the uranium -oxygen symmetrical stretching frequency is higher than in the chloride complex and close to the bare uranyl value. For [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2we estimate a shift of frequencies between the ground and excited state equal to 6, 2, 31 and 53 cm \u22121 for \u03bd U\u2212Br , \u03bd b , \u03bd s and \u03bd a , respectively.",

In spite of multiple quasidegeneracies (particularly for the cases of Sc(2) and Mn(2)), the GVVPT2 PECs are smooth with no discontinuities. Since these molecules have been identified as ones that widely used perturbative methods are inadequate for describing well, due to intruder state problems, unless shift parameters are introduced that can obfuscate the physics, this study suggests that the conclusion about the inadequacy of multireference perturbation theory be re-evaluated. The ground state of Sc(2) is predicted to be X(5)\u2211(u)(-), and its spectroscopic constants are close to the ones at the MRCISD level. Near equilibrium geometries, the 1(3)\u2211(u)(-) electronic state of Sc(2) is found to be less stable than the quintet ground state by 0.23 eV. The Cr(2) PEC has several features of the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) experimental curve (e.g., the pronounced shelf at elongated bond lengths), although the predicted bond length is slightly long (R(e) = 1.80 \u00c5 with cc-pVQZ compared to the experimental value of 1.68 \u00c5). The X(1)\u2211(g)(+) ground state of Mn(2) is predicted to be a van der Waals molecule with a long bond length, R(e), of 3.83 \u00c5 using a cc-pVQZ basis set (experimental value = 3.40 \u00c5) and a binding energy, D(e), of only 0.05 eV (experimental value = 0.1 eV). We obtained R(e) = 3.40 \u00c5 and D(e) = 0.09 eV at the complete basis set (CBS) limit for ground state Mn(2). Low lying excited state curves have also been characterized for all three cases (Cr(2), Mn(2), and Sc(2)) and show similar mathematical robustness as the ground states. These results suggest that the GVVPT2 multireference perturbation theory method is more broadly applicable than previously documented.",

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

In contrast, for the \u2113 = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 \u2212 ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and \u2113 = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the expression changes in genes related to growth and photoprotection under different light environments. The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL. There was no significant difference in photosynthetic capacity between mature leaves in contrasting light environments. Although the biomass of C. concinna under LL was less than that under FL, the height of C. concinna under LL was higher than that under FL, indicating that C. concinna could grow well under the two light environments. Our results describing the acclimatization of light at the physiological, molecular and transcriptome levels are important for a complete understanding of successional mechanisms.",

However, the relative importance of different age groups in propagating epidemics is uncertain. During a communicable disease outbreak, some groups may be disproportionately represented during the outbreak's ascent due to increased susceptibility and/or contact rates. Such groups or subpopulations can be identified by considering the proportion of cases within the subpopulation occurring before (Bp) and after the epidemic peak (Ap) to calculate the subpopulation's relative risk, RR=Bp/Ap. We estimated RR for several subpopulations (age groups) using data on laboratory-confirmed US influenza hospitalizations during epidemics between 2009-2014. Additionally, we simulated various influenza outbreaks in an age-stratified population, relating the RR to the impact of vaccination in each subpopulation on the epidemic's initial effective reproductive number R_e(0). We found that children aged 5-17 had the highest estimates of RR during the five largest influenza A outbreaks, though the relative magnitude of RR in this age group compared to other age groups varied, being highest for the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. For the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 influenza B epidemics, adults aged 18-49, and 0-4 year-olds had the highest estimates of RR respectively. For 83% of simulated epidemics, the group with the highest RR was also the group for which initial distribution of a given quantity of vaccine would result in the largest reduction of R_e(0). In the largest 40% of simulated outbreaks, the group with the highest RR and the largest vaccination impact was children 5-17. While the relative importance of different age groups in propagating influenza outbreaks varies, children aged 5-17 play the leading role during the largest influenza A epidemics. Extra vaccination efforts for this group may contribute to reducing the epidemic's impact in the whole community.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009&lt;\u200910-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009=\u20090.003) but was unaffected by CO (P\u2009=\u20090.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives. Cs and CD measurements were obtained from the left carotid artery. A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV. The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories. Study results demonstrated that the proposed approach has a potential to provide valuable surrogate markers for cardiovascular risk assessment.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009\u00b10.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01\u00b1 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean\u00a0(\u00b1standard deviation) ages: 47.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5 years). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed on the 10-item CES-D to test four model fits: (a) unidimensional model, (b) two-factor correlated model, (c) three-factor correlated model, and (d) second-order factor model. The diagonal-weighted least-squares\u00a0estimator was used, as it is commonly applied to latent variable models with ordered categorical variables.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and pruritus were also used to assess each keloid. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of various internal cytokines in keloids and normal skin. We compared the perfusion and expression levels of intrinsic cytokines between keloids and normal skin. We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).

Ordinarily, it is challenging to quantify these sub-compartments; therefore, neuroscientific studies commonly make the simplifying assumption of a mono-exponential decay obtaining a single &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"&gt; &lt;mml:semantics&gt; &lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msubsup&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;R&lt;/mml:mi&gt; &lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt; &lt;mml:mo&gt;*&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:msubsup&gt; &lt;/mml:mrow&gt; &lt;mml:annotation&gt;$$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$&lt;/mml:annotation&gt;&lt;/mml:semantics&gt; &lt;/mml:math&gt; estimate per voxel. In this work, we investigated how the multi-compartment nature of tissue microstructure affects single compartment &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"&gt; &lt;mml:semantics&gt; &lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msubsup&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;R&lt;/mml:mi&gt; &lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt; &lt;mml:mo&gt;*&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:msubsup&gt; &lt;/mml:mrow&gt; &lt;mml:annotation&gt;$$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$&lt;/mml:annotation&gt;&lt;/mml:semantics&gt; &lt;/mml:math&gt; estimates. We used 2-pool (myelin and non-myelin water) simulations to characterize the bias in single compartment &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"&gt; &lt;mml:semantics&gt; &lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msubsup&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;R&lt;/mml:mi&gt; &lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt; &lt;mml:mo&gt;*&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:msubsup&gt; &lt;/mml:mrow&gt; &lt;mml:annotation&gt;$$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$&lt;/mml:annotation&gt;&lt;/mml:semantics&gt; &lt;/mml:math&gt; estimates. Based on our numeric observations, we introduced a linear model that partitions &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"&gt; &lt;mml:semantics&gt; &lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msubsup&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;R&lt;/mml:mi&gt; &lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt; &lt;mml:mo&gt;*&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:msubsup&gt; &lt;/mml:mrow&gt; &lt;mml:annotation&gt;$$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$&lt;/mml:annotation&gt;&lt;/mml:semantics&gt; &lt;/mml:math&gt; into \u03b1-dependent and \u03b1-independent components and validated this in vivo at 7T. We investigated the dependence of both components on the sub-compartment properties and assessed their robustness, orientation dependence, and reproducibility empirically. &lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"&gt; &lt;mml:semantics&gt; &lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:msubsup&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;R&lt;/mml:mi&gt; &lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt; &lt;mml:mo&gt;*&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:msubsup&gt; &lt;/mml:mrow&gt; &lt;mml:annotation&gt;$$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$&lt;/mml:annotation&gt;&lt;/mml:semantics&gt; &lt;/mml:math&gt; increased with myelin water fraction and residency time leading to a linear dependence on \u03b1. We observed excellent agreement between our numeric and empirical results. Furthermore, the \u03b1-independent component of the proposed linear model was robust to the choice of \u03b1 and reduced dependence on fiber orientation, although it suffered from marginally higher noise sensitivity.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

However, the indirect effects of differences in light requirements on the growth of mid- and late-successional tree species are unclear, and this potential growth effect has not been explained at the transcriptome level. Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the expression changes in genes related to growth and photoprotection under different light environments. The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL. There was no significant difference in photosynthetic capacity between mature leaves in contrasting light environments. Although the biomass of C. concinna under LL was less than that under FL, the height of C. concinna under LL was higher than that under FL, indicating that C. concinna could grow well under the two light environments. Our results describing the acclimatization of light at the physiological, molecular and transcriptome levels are important for a complete understanding of successional mechanisms.",

This article provides a pipeline to enhance the synthesis of such images in three-dimensional (3D) using a deep learning (DL) neural network architecture for spatial regularization in a personalized setting where having more than a few training images is impractical. Our DL enhancements employ a Deep Image Prior (DIP) with a U-net type denoising architecture that includes situations with minimal training data, such as personalized syn-MRI. We provide a general workflow for syn-MRI from three or more training images. Our workflow, called DIPsyn-MRI, uses DIP to enhance training images, then obtains parametric images using LS or MLE before synthesizing images at desired design parameter settings. DIPsyn-MRI is implemented in our publicly available Python package DeepSynMRI available at: https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI. We demonstrate feasibility and improved performance of DIPsyn-MRI on 3D datasets acquired using the Brainweb interface for spin-echo and FLASH imaging sequences, at different noise levels. Our DL enhancements improve syn-MRI in the presence of different intensity nonuniformity levels of the magnetic field, for all but very low noise levels.

We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots.

The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status.

All parameter estimates given by SAEM appeared to be narrowly distributed and were close to the true value used for simulation. In contrast, the distribution of estimates from FOCEi were skewed and more biased. When initial estimates were perturbed, FOCEi estimates were more biased and imprecise. nlmixr is reliable for NLMEM. SAEM was superior to FOCEi in terms of bias and precision, and more robust against initial estimate perturbations.",

The content of anthocyanin glucosides was detected in plasma and urinary excretion. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity was assessed after intake. Based on the plasma content, biokinetic criteria of the single anthocyanins were calculated, such as AUC, $\\mathrm{c}_{\\mathrm{max}}$ , $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{max}}$ , and the elimination rate $\\mathrm{t}_{1/2}$ . The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins differed significantly and amounted to $0.18$ % (red wine) and $0.23$ % (red grape juice) of the administered dose. Additionally, the plasmatic antioxidant activity increased to higher levels after juice ingestion compared to wine. The intestinal absorption of the anthocyanins of red grape juice seemed to be improved compared to red wine, suggesting a possible synergistic effect of the glucose content of the juice. The improved absorption resulted in an enhanced plasmatic bioactivity.",

When the CO bond was stretched to 4 a 0 , the system was strongly multireference, and all the errors were noticeably larger than that for the equilibrium geometry. To make the truncated CI errors in the stretched geometry similar to CISD in the equilibrium geometry, we had to go to CI(4) for the energies but CI(5) for the 2-RDM. MCCI could achieve a 2-RDM accuracy similar to CI(6) but using fewer determinants than CI(4). When increasing the size of the basis set to cc-pVDZ for the equilibrium geometry, we found that, although MCCI had much higher accuracy than CISDT, it could not reach that of CI(4) due to the larger FCI space. CI(4) used around 2.8 million determinants, and the multireference character is not strong here. For this singlet system, we also considered the use of CSFs for the 2-RDM calculation and found that the main benefit seemed to be a reduced size of the wavefunction in the CSF representation as the spin contamination for MCCI with SDs was not large. Finally, we looked at CSFs when constructing the 2-RDM for the M s = 1 triplet state of oxygen. Now, the reduction in the size of the wavefunction when using CSFs was not observed, unlike for the CO singlet. However, again, the spin contamination was very low when SDs were used.  Figure 11. MCCI errors using SDs or CSFs compared with FCI against number of configurations for the B 1g ground state of oxygen with M s = 1 using the 6-31G basis set and two frozen orbitals. The efficient calculation of the 2-RDM enabled these comparisons with FCI 2-RDMs calculated from wavefunctions as large as 2,414,950,976 \u00d7 ( 2.4 10 ) 9 determinants. These large FCI 2-RDMs should provide useful benchmark data for developers of 2-RDM functional theory. 57 Previous work has demonstrated that the selected CI approach of MCCI can construct wavefunctions that capture the energy 58,59 or",

The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the \"portullugo\" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (~ 2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C$_{\\mathrm{4}}$ and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with ~ 50% matrix completeness across data sets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support: Anacampserotaceae $+$ Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees.

We correlate only the valence electrons and use state-average natural orbitals obtained with a preliminary calculation at the CIPSI level. For each state, we compute the energy with only one CSF, and on top of this configuration, we perform a CAS-CI calculation restricted to the \u03c3 and the \u03c0 orbitals in a CAS-\u03c3 and CAS-\u03c0, respectively. The reference FCI excitation energy in this basis and the associated confidence interval are computed following the scheme presented in ref 38 rather than extrapolating the variational energies of the individual states in the limit of the PT2 energy correction going to zero. Indeed, the uncertainties of the extrapolated FCI energies of both states are larger than the uncertainty on the estimated excitation energy computed with this scheme. Since the CC3 estimate for CN3 and CN5 is in excellent agreement with the FCI value, we use the CC3 excitation energy as reference for CN7. We note that, because of the use of the simple 6-31G basis set, the FCI and CC3 excitation energies are much higher than the more accurate results presented above, but this is not relevant for the present discussion.\n\nFor the CN3 molecule, the excitation energy obtained with a single CSF for each state is 8.91 eV, namely, higher by 1.4 eV than the FCI result. The CAS-\u03c0 calculation corrects only 60% of the error, indicating that the \u03c3 orbitals also play an important role in the stabilization of the excited state. Similarly, the excitation energy obtained with the CAS-\u03c3 improves the excitation energy with respect to the single CSF by recovering about 31% of the error. These results indicate the importance of both \u03c3 and \u03c0 orbitals in the calculation of the excitation energy of CN3.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

However, a more discerning comparison of atomic charges Q IMB X and Q g X reveals that the latter ones are usually closer to the corresponding exact IMB-charges (calculated within set of functions g).

Contrary to the previously proposed method involving a reference set of (external) minimal-basis orbitals (e.g. Huzinaga's MINI basis set) [7], in this approach we have used the criterion of maximum overlap to the set of free-atom orbitals obtained from ab initio calculations (using the same set of basis functions) for the corresponding system promolecule. Hence, the resulting minimal-basis orbitals are intrinsic for individual molecules and consequently exhibit appropriate convergence properties as the number of basis functions used in calculations increases.\n\nIt has also been demonstrated that the MOC-scheme can be successfully utilized to approximate canonical free-atom orbitals within any arbitrary basis set using oneoff calculated FAOs of high quality (by default stored on disk); therefore, generating of IMB-orbitals does not require every-time calculations of promolecular systems. Moreover, partial atomic charges calculated within representation of such moleculeadapted atomic orbitals tend to converge noticeably faster to their exact values in the limit of complete basis set.",

In Sec. 2 we describe the model of chemical separation during a gravitational collapse of a structure. In Sec. 3 we introduce physical quantities used in this study, and typical numerical values relevant to the structure formation. In Sec. 4 we show results of calculations of the chemical separation caused by the magnetic field. In Sec. 5 we comment on the magnetic field amplitude. In Sec. 6 we comment on a possible generation of a magnetic field gradient during the gravitational collapse. In Sec. 7 we identify a parameter region required for a successful chemical separation. In Sec. 8 we briefly mention a later epoch of the structure formation and possible reactions neglected in this study. We suggest that the chemical separation of the 7 Li + ion can reduce the abundance ratio 7 Li/H in the early structure. Another theoretical constraint on the magnetic field amplitude is also described. In Sec. 9 we summarize this study. In Appendix A we show drift velocities of protons and electrons in a structure, equations for ions and electrons which should be satisfied in equilibrium states, and typical values of variables required for an efficient chemical separation. In Appendix B we show supplemental Figure 1. Illustration of chemical separation in a collapsing structure. In the left panel, the large solid circle delineates a collapsing structure, thin arrows are magnetic field lines, and open arrows are gravitational accelerations.

Calculations have also indicated that p-beam writing exhibits minimal proximity effects (unwanted exposure due to secondary electrons), since the secondary electrons induced in proton/electron collisions have low energy. A further advantage stems from the ability of protons to displace atoms while traversing material, thereby increasing localized damage especially at the end of range.

We assumed that the PMF has a gradient in a direction perpendicular to the field direction. This gradient is realized by an electric current density in the direction perpendicular to both directions of the field lines and the gradient. The Lorentz force on the charged species then causes a velocity difference between charged and neutral species in the direction of the field gradient. Resultantly, a velocity of charged species can be different from that of neutral species which collapses gravitationally during the structure formation. Therefore, 7 Li + ions may have possibly escaped from gravitational collapse of early structures. Calculations for fluid motions of charged and neutral species were performed through a simple estimation using fundamental fluid and electromagnetic equations. We assumed a gravitational contraction of neutral matter in a spherically symmetric structure. In addition, we utilized a cylindrical coordinate, and assumed a gradient of the altitudinal (z-component) magnetic field in the radial direction. Related physical quantities are listed, and their typical values are given in Sec. 3. Some analytical equations are introduced in Appendix A.\n\nWhen the amplitude of magnetic field is sufficiently large, the charged fluid significantly decouples from the neutral fluid. It is then possible that during the gravitational contraction of structure mainly composed of neutral hydrogens, contractions of protons, electrons, and 7 Li + ions do not occur. Although fluid motions of charged chemical species are solved for only H + , e, and 7 Li + in this study, other charged species are expected to have similar motions. Because of large inductances of large astronomical structures, the generation of magnetic field is never efficient during the structure formation at z \u223c 10. Therefore, only PMFs which existed from the start of the structure formation can trigger the chemical separation.\n\nThe chemical separation requires the magnetic field gradient in a direction perpendicular to the field direction. Although such a gradient was assumed in the initial condition in this study, it may be produced associated with a density gradient during the gravitational contraction of structures without any initial field gradient.",

This electrification in turn produces some electrostatic forces in addition to the gravitational and fluid friction forces that affect the movement of saltating sand particles, further, the wind-blown sand saltation. To evaluate this effect quantitatively, this paper presents a simulation of evolution of wind-blown sand grains after the electrostatic forces exerted on the grains are taken into account in the wind feedback mechanism of wind-blown saltation. That is, the coupling interaction between the wind flow and the saltating sand particles is employed in the simulation to the non-stationary wind and sand flows when considering fluid drag, gravitation, and a kind of electrostatic force generated from a distribution of electric field changing with time in the evolution process of the sand saltation. On the basis of the proposed simulation model, a numerical program is given to perform the simulation of this dynamic process and some characteristic quantities, e.g., duration of the system to reach the steady state, and curves of the saltating grain number, grain transport rate, mass-flux profile, and wind profile varying with time during the non-stationary evolution are displayed. The obtained numerical results exhibit that the electrostatic force is closely related to the average charge-to-mass ratio of sand particles and has obvious influence on these characteristic quantities. The obtained results also show that the duration of the system to reach the steady state, the sand transport rate and the mass flux profile coincide well with experimental results by Shao and Raupach (1992) when the average charge-to-mass ratio of sand particles is 60 microC/kg for the sand particles with average diameter of 0.25 mm. When the average charge-to-mass ratios of sand particles are taken as some other certain values, the calculation results still show that the mass flux profiles are well in agreement with the experimental data by Rasmussen and Mikkelsen (1998) for another category of sand particles, which tell us that the electrostatic force is one of main factors that have to be considered in the research of mechanism of wind-blown sand saltation.",

A 0.08 x 0.24 x 0.24 nm crystal was shown to have space group C2/c, having unit cell dimensions of a = 22.757(5) \u00c5, b = 13.566(3) \u00c5, and c = 12.120(2) \u00c5 and unit cell angles of alpha = gamma = 90 degrees and beta = 109.07(3) degrees with Z = 4. A total of 3195 independent reflections were refined to R = 0.0454. Each Pt(II) site has the anticipated NO(2)Cl square-planar mer coordination. The Pt-N(1) distance (N(1) is the N donor of the hdta(4)(-) ligand) is 2.001(9) \u00c5, only slightly shorter than typical Pt-N distances (2.04-2.09 \u00c5) for sp(3) donors. The Pt-O distances to the coordinated glycinato donors in 1 are 2.012(7) and 2.000(8) \u00c5, values very similar to those of trans-[Pt(gly)(2)] (gly = glycinate). The Pt-Cl distance of 2.310(3) \u00c5 is in the range of 2.27-2.32 \u00c5 observed for other Pt(II)-Cl(-) bonds. The bond angles are close to the ideal 90 degrees or 180 degrees value: angleN-Pt-O = 85.4(3) degrees and 83.2(4) degrees; angleN-Pt-Cl = 176.6(2) degrees. The [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) units are packed in an end-to-end fashion such that the [Pt(II)(iminodiacetate)Cl] headgroups are overlapping. This provides square-planar to square-planar stacking of the headgroups. (1)H and (13)C NMR data are presented which show that the [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) coordination of the solid state is maintained in solution. The coordinated glycinato arms of [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) are equivalent, exhibiting only one AB pattern in the (1)H NMR (H(a), 4.31 ppm; H(b), 3.89 ppm; J(ab) = 16.1 Hz) and one type of coordinated carboxylate ((13)C NMR resonance at 189.7 ppm). Time-dependent (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra show that inosine first displaces only Cl(-) in [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) in solutions up to one inosine per Pt(II) center. A higher concentration of inosines (Ino) results in the displacement of one of the glycinato arms, detectable at 175.0 ppm by (13)C NMR. The sequential nature and binding of two Ino ligands, necessarily cis in [Pt(2)(hdta)(Ino)(4)], mimics the steps necessary to allow major groove-spanning ligation of DNA in the manner of the Farrell-type binuclear platinum(II) amine complexes.",

The average nu(CO) frequencies for each tricarbonyl species reported are compared to those related dianions previously reported in order to gauge the pi-donor character of the different ligands. The (13)C NMR spectrum for each tricarbonyl derivative consists of a single sharp peak for the three inequivalent carbonyls as a result of a low-energy, fast intramolecular exchange process. Both inter- and intramolecular CO-exchange processes have been probed via variable temperature (13)C NMR. In the case of the 16-electron species the geometry of the metal dianion is that of a distorted trigonal bipyramid consisting of three carbonyl ligands and a five-membered chelate ring bound through the pi-donor atoms at an equatorial and an axial position, with the stronger pi-donor atom in the equatorial site. The equatorial site for the most effective pi-donor is preferred over the axial position because the unoccupied d(xy)() orbital lies in the equatorial plane, and may be stabilized via a pi-donor ligand in the equatorial position. The axial position exhibits a filled/filled repulsion as both orbitals available for pi-bonding are filled.",

The complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance measurements, UV-visible, infrared, proton nuclear magnetic, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, and electrochemical techniques. The compounds possess relatively high nu(NO) stretching frequencies indicating that a high degree of positive charge resides on the coordinated nitrosyl group.

Within the complex, the benzo[h]quinoline (bzq) groups lie in close proximity with most C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distances being between 3.3 and 3.7 \u00c5, which is indicative of significant \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The reaction of 1 with halogens X(2) (X(2) = Cl(2), Br(2), or I(2)) proceeds with a two-electron oxidation to give the corresponding dihalodiplatinum(III) complexes [{Pt(bzq)(\u03bc-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-\u03baN,S)X}(2)] (X = Cl 2, Br 3, I 4). Their X-ray structures confirm the retention of the half-lantern structure and the coordination mode of the bzq and the bridging ligand \u03bc-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-\u03baN,S.

Time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies performed on 1 show a formal bond order of 0 between the metal atoms, with the 6p(z) contribution diminishing the antibonding character of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and being responsible for an attractive intermetallic interaction. A shortening of the Pt-Pt distance from 2.959 \u00c5 in the ground state S(0) to 2.760 \u00c5 in the optimized first excited state (T(1)) is consistent with an increase in the Pt-Pt bond order to 0.5. In agreement with TD-DFT calculations, the intense, structureless, red emission of 1 in the solid state and in solution can be mainly attributed to triplet metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer ((3)MMLCT) [d\u03c3*(Pt-Pt) \u2192 \u03c0*(bzq)] excited states. The high quantum yields of this emission measured in toluene (44%) and solid state (62%) at room temperature indicate that 1 is a very efficient and stable (3)MMLCT emitter, even in solution. The high luminescence quantum yield of its red emission, added to its neutral character and the thermal stability of 1, make it a potential compound to be incorporated as phosphorescent dopant in multilayer organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs).",

Selected spectral features are described. The X-ray structures of Pd(PhA)(2) and Pd(PhB)(2) have revealed trans-planar geometry consistent with metal oxidation state of +2. Bond length trends within the chelate rings are rationalized in terms of steric and electronic factors. In Pd(PhA)(2) a total of 10 ligand pi electrons are present, each formally monoanionic ligand contributing five. Model EHMO studies have revealed that the filled HOMO (a(u)) in Pd(RA)(2) is a bonding combination of two ligand pi orbitals with large azo contributions. The LUMO (b(g)) is roughly the corresponding antibonding combination. The outer pi-electron configuration of Pd(RA)(2) is (a(u))(2)(b(g))(0). Four successive voltammetric responses, two oxidative and two reductive, are observed. The E(1/2) range is -1.3 to +0.8 V vs SCE for Pd(PhA)(2) in a 1:9 MeCN-CH(2)Cl(2) mixture (Pt electrode).

The thermal variation of the high spin state fraction observed by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy is in agreement with that obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements. The fitting of M\u00f6ssbauer and magnetic data with the Ising-like model allowed us to determine the energy gap between the high-spin and low-spin states (Delta(eff) = 835 K) and to estimate the variation of the thermodynamic parameters upon spin transition. The calculated variations of enthalpy (DeltaH = 6.76 kJ mol(-)(1)) and entropy (DeltaS = 49 J mol(-)(1) K(-)(1)) associated with the spin transition are in agreement with those previously observed for iron(II) spin-crossover compounds.

In methanol solution, the perchlorato complexes 1, 2, Cu(TRIM)(ClO(4))(2) (3), 4, and Cu(TIK)(ClO(4))(2) (5) exhibited redox potentials from -215 to +284 mV vs NHE together with a visible absorption from 604 to 728 nm. Electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy data, particularly the nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI) parameters e(2)qQ and eta of the remote nitrogen (N1H), were analyzed and interpreted according to the model devised by Jiang et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 9035) with reference to Cu(HIm)(4)(ClO(4))(2). The results are the following: (i) C2 substitution of the imidazole ring, next to the remote nitrogen (1, 2) decreases the asymmetry parameter eta to ca. 0.75 compared to 1.00 for Cu(HIm)(4)(ClO(4))(2); this effect of C2 substitution on the symmetry of the electric field gradient at N1H appears similar for both the electron-donating methylene substituents (1) and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group (2). (ii) The electron-donating or -withdrawing properties of the substituent are reflected by the variation of the e(2)qQ parameter, increasing from 1.43 to 1.75 MHz (1) or decreasing to 1.38 MHz (2), and by the nu(+) transition shifting toward higher frequencies from 1.49 to 1.65 MHz (1, 3, 4) or to lower frequencies to 1.29 MHz (2, 5). The use of the eta and nu(+) parameters to assign the Ndelta vs Nepsilon coordination of histidine to the metal and to detect modified histidine in copper-binding proteins is discussed.",

The mixed-valence states at various temperatures were also determined by (57)Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of 1 showed a valence-detrapped state at room temperature. With decreasing temperature the spectrum was abruptly transformed into a valence-trapped state around 129 K, well corresponding to the heat-capacity anomaly due to the phase transition (T(trs) = 128.2 K) observed in the calorimetry. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination revealed that 1 has an equilateral structure at 296 and 135 K, and that the structure changes into an isosceles one at 100 K due to the electron trapping. The crystal system of 1 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 20.026(1) \u00c5, c = 12.292(2) \u00c5; at 135 K, a = 19.965(3) \u00c5, c = 12.145(4) \u00c5; and at 100 K, the crystal system changes into triclinic system, space group P&amp;onemacr;, with Z = 2 and a = 12.094(2) \u00c5, b = 12.182(3) \u00c5, c = 12.208(3) \u00c5, alpha = 110.04(2) degrees, beta = 108.71(2) degrees, gamma = 109.59(2) degrees. The X-ray structure determination at 100 K suggests that the electronically trapped phase of 1 at low temperature is an antiferroelectrically ordered phase, because the distorted Fe(3)O molecules, which are expected to possess a nonzero electronic dipole moment, oriented alternatively in the opposite direction with respect to the center of symmetry. On the other hand, no heat-capacity anomaly was observed in 2 between 7 and 300 K, and X-ray structure determination indicated that 2 shows no structure change when the temperature is decreased from 296 K down to 102 K. The crystal system of 2 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 19.999(1) \u00c5, c = 12.259(1) \u00c5; at 102 K, a = 19.915(2) \u00c5, c = 12.061(1) \u00c5. Even at 102 K the CoFe(2)O complex still has a C(3) axis, and the three metal ion sites are crystallographically equivalent because of a static positional disorder of two Fe(III) ions and one Co(II) ion. The activation energy of intramolecular electron transfer of 1 in the high-temperature disordered phase was estimated to be 3.99 kJ mol(-)(1) from the temperature dependence of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra with the aid of the spectral simulation including the relaxation effect of intramolecular electron transfer.

An unusual feature of the structures is disorder in the C ring, consistent with a two-site occupancy in which the major conformation has the C46 methyl group in the usual position, \"upwardly\" axial, and the C47 methyl group equatorial, while in the minor conformation both are pseudoequatorial, above and below the corrin ring. (13)C NMR chemical shifts of C46, C47, C12, and C13 suggest that the C ring disorder may persist in solution as a ring flip. Since molecular dynamics simulations fail to reveal any population of the minor conformation, the effect is likely to be electronic rather than steric. The axial bond lengths in 10-Cl-MeCbl are very similar to those in MeCbl (d(Co)(-)(C) = 1.979(7) vs 1.99(2); to 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, d(Co)(-)(NB3) = 2.200(7) vs 2.19(2)), but the bonds to the four equatorial N donors, d(Co)(-)(N(eq)), are on average 0.05 \u00c5 shorter. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, d(Co)(-)(C) and d(Co)(-)(NB3) are longer (by 0.10(2) and 0.03(1) \u00c5, respectively) than the bond lengths observed in CNCbl itself, while conversely, the C-N bond length is shorter by 0.06(2) \u00c5, but there is little difference in d(Co)(-)(N(eq)). The Co-O bond length to coordinated water in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is very similar to that found in H(2)OCbl(+) itself, but the d(Co)(-)(NB3) bond is longer (1.967 vs1.925(2) \u00c5), while the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) is very similar. The coordinated water molecule in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is hydrogen bonded to the c side chain carbonyl oxygen, as in H(2)OCbl(+). NMR observations indicate that the H bond between coordinated H(2)O and the c side chain amide persists in solution. The equilibrium constant, K(Co), for coordination of bzm to Co(III) is smaller in 10-Cl-MeCbl and 10-Cl-CNCbl than in their C10-unsubstituted analogs (181 vs 452; 4.57 x 10(3) vs 3.35 x 10(5)), but could not be determined for 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl because hydrolysis of the phosphodiester is competitive with the establishment of the base-off equilibrium. Substitution of H by Cl at C10 causes the bands in the electronic spectrum of 10-Cl-XCbl complexes to move to lower energy, which is consistent with an increase in electron density in the corrin pi-conjugated system. This increased electron density is not due to greater electron donation from the axial ligand as bonds between these and the metal are either longer (not shorter) or unchanged, and it most probably arises from pi-donation to the corrin by Cl at C10. As the donor power of X increases (H(2)O &lt; CN(-) &lt; Me), the corrin ring becomes more flexible to deformation, and the number of bond lengths and bond angles that are significantly different in XCbl and 10-Cl-XCbl increases; importantly, the C10-Cl bond length, d(C10)(-)(Cl), increases as well. Thus, despite the fact that chlorine is an inductively electron withdrawing substituent, its resonance electron donation is the more important effect on electron distribution in the corrin ring. Mulliken charges obtained from semiempirical RHF-SCF MO calculations using the ZINDO/1 model on XCbl and their 10-Cl analogs at the crystal structure geometry are shown to correlate reasonably well with (13)C NMR shifts and may be used to determine the pattern of electron distribution in these complexes. Substitution by Cl at C10 causes an increase in charge density at Co when X = H(2)O and CN(-), while the charge density on the four equatorial N donors remains virtually unchanged, but a decrease when X = Me, while the charge density on the equatorial N donors also decreases. In response, d(Co)(-)(NB3) increases in the first two complexes but the equatorial bond lengths remain virtually unchanged, while d(Co)(-)(NB3) remains unchanged and the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) decreases in 10-Cl-MeCbl. Furthermore, the partial charge on chlorine increases as the donor power of X increases. The small decrease in the pK(a) of coordinated H(2)O in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) compared to H(2)OCbl(+) itself (7.65 vs 8.09) is due to a decreased charge density on oxygen in 10-Cl-OHCbl compared to OHCbl. The picture that emerges, therefore, is of competitive electron donation by X and Cl toward the corrin system. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, the decrease in the C&amp;tbd1;N bond length as Co-C increases compared to CNCbl suggests that dpi-ppi bonding between cobalt and cyanide is important. (13)C and (15)N NMR observations on 10-Cl-(13)C(15)NCbl are consistent with these effects.",

The X-ray crystallography establishes that the structure consists of two Ag(+) atoms bridged by two dmb ligands forming a 20-membered ring and by two counteranions via one of the O-atoms, forming a four-membered ring (local symmetry = D(2)(h)()). The Ag(I).Ag(I) separations are 3.909(1) and 3.6831(8) \u00c5 for Y = NO(3)(-) and CH(3)CO(2)(-), respectively. Reactions of Ag(2)(dmb)(2)Y(2) (Y = NO(3)(-), ClO(4)(-)) with LiTCNQ lead to the paramagnetic tetranuclear species [Ag(4)(dmb)(4)(TCNQ)(3)]TCNQ. The structure at 180 K consists of two Ag(2)(dmb)(2)(2+) species (d(Ag.Ag) = 4.113(1) \u00c5 held together by three parallel TCNQ(-)'s, with Ag(+).N&amp;tbd1;C distances ranging from 2.359(5) to 2.787(5) \u00c5. Two of the Ag(+) atoms are tricoordinated, and the other two are tetracoordinated placed within in a centrosymmetric geometry. The three bridging TCNQ(-)'s exhibit interplanar distances of 3.333(1) \u00c5, and the Ag(4) species are packed side-by-side with two adjacent TCNQ(-)'s face-to-face (separation = 3.372(1) \u00c5) forming an infinite pi-stacked chain TCNQ(-)'s. The TCNQ(-) counteranion also exhibits weak pi-contacts via the -CN groups with other counteranions. The magnetic susceptibilities, EPR spectra, and unit cell parameters have been measured as a function of temperature. The magnetic data are best explained by extended chains of antiferromagnetically coupled S = (3)/(2) and S = (1)/(2) centers for the [Ag(4)(dmb)(4)(TCNQ)(3)](+) and TCNQ(-) moieties, respectively. No hyperfine structure has been observed between 106 and 290 K, indicating the presence of rapid exchange in the paramagnetic system.

This can be seen in the following examples: Using the following Octave code, one can easily see the effect of changing the parameters: A = 1; x0 = 0; y0 = 0; sigma_X = 1; sigma_Y = 2; [X, Y] = meshgrid(-5:.1:5, -5:.1:5); for theta = 0:pi/100:pi a = cos(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_X^2) + sin(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_Y^2); b = -sin(2 * theta) / (4 * sigma_X^2) + sin(2 * theta) / (4 * sigma_Y^2); c = sin(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_X^2) + cos(theta)^2 / (2 * sigma_Y^2);",

A 0.08 x 0.24 x 0.24 nm crystal was shown to have space group C2/c, having unit cell dimensions of a = 22.757(5) \u00c5, b = 13.566(3) \u00c5, and c = 12.120(2) \u00c5 and unit cell angles of alpha = gamma = 90 degrees and beta = 109.07(3) degrees with Z = 4. A total of 3195 independent reflections were refined to R = 0.0454. Each Pt(II) site has the anticipated NO(2)Cl square-planar mer coordination. The Pt-N(1) distance (N(1) is the N donor of the hdta(4)(-) ligand) is 2.001(9) \u00c5, only slightly shorter than typical Pt-N distances (2.04-2.09 \u00c5) for sp(3) donors. The Pt-O distances to the coordinated glycinato donors in 1 are 2.012(7) and 2.000(8) \u00c5, values very similar to those of trans-[Pt(gly)(2)] (gly = glycinate). The Pt-Cl distance of 2.310(3) \u00c5 is in the range of 2.27-2.32 \u00c5 observed for other Pt(II)-Cl(-) bonds. The bond angles are close to the ideal 90 degrees or 180 degrees value: angleN-Pt-O = 85.4(3) degrees and 83.2(4) degrees; angleN-Pt-Cl = 176.6(2) degrees. The [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) units are packed in an end-to-end fashion such that the [Pt(II)(iminodiacetate)Cl] headgroups are overlapping. This provides square-planar to square-planar stacking of the headgroups. (1)H and (13)C NMR data are presented which show that the [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) coordination of the solid state is maintained in solution. The coordinated glycinato arms of [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) are equivalent, exhibiting only one AB pattern in the (1)H NMR (H(a), 4.31 ppm; H(b), 3.89 ppm; J(ab) = 16.1 Hz) and one type of coordinated carboxylate ((13)C NMR resonance at 189.7 ppm). Time-dependent (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra show that inosine first displaces only Cl(-) in [Pt(2)(hdta)Cl(2)](2)(-) in solutions up to one inosine per Pt(II) center. A higher concentration of inosines (Ino) results in the displacement of one of the glycinato arms, detectable at 175.0 ppm by (13)C NMR. The sequential nature and binding of two Ino ligands, necessarily cis in [Pt(2)(hdta)(Ino)(4)], mimics the steps necessary to allow major groove-spanning ligation of DNA in the manner of the Farrell-type binuclear platinum(II) amine complexes.",

The average nu(CO) frequencies for each tricarbonyl species reported are compared to those related dianions previously reported in order to gauge the pi-donor character of the different ligands. The (13)C NMR spectrum for each tricarbonyl derivative consists of a single sharp peak for the three inequivalent carbonyls as a result of a low-energy, fast intramolecular exchange process. Both inter- and intramolecular CO-exchange processes have been probed via variable temperature (13)C NMR. In the case of the 16-electron species the geometry of the metal dianion is that of a distorted trigonal bipyramid consisting of three carbonyl ligands and a five-membered chelate ring bound through the pi-donor atoms at an equatorial and an axial position, with the stronger pi-donor atom in the equatorial site. The equatorial site for the most effective pi-donor is preferred over the axial position because the unoccupied d(xy)() orbital lies in the equatorial plane, and may be stabilized via a pi-donor ligand in the equatorial position. The axial position exhibits a filled/filled repulsion as both orbitals available for pi-bonding are filled.",

So X(s) has a zero eigenvalue for some s with 0 < s \u2264 1: X(s)w = 0 with w \u2260 0. By the properties of the quadratic representation, x(t) is invertible for all t. Let Y(t) = L(x(t)2). This is a positive operator since x(t)2 lies in C. Let T(t) = Q(x(t)), an invertible self-adjoint operator by the invertibility of x(t). On the other hand, T(t) = 2X(t)2 - Y(t). So (T(s)w,w) < 0 since Y(s) is positive and X(s)w = 0. In particular T(s) has some negative eigenvalues. On the other hand, the operator T(0) = Q(a2) = Q(a)2 is positive. By the eigenvalue argument, T(t) has eigenvalue 0 for some t with 0 < t < s, a contradiction.",

Only one redox process attributed to the reaction [Ru(II)(NH(3))(4)L(NO(+))](3+) + e(-) right arrow over left arrow trans-[Ru(II)(NH(3))(4)L(NO(0))](2+) was observed in the range -0.45 to 1.20 V for all the nitrosyl complexes. Linear correlations are observed in plots of nu(NO) versus E(1/2) and of E(1/2) versus summation operatorE(L) showing that the oxidizing strength of the coordinated NO increases with increase in L pi-acidity. The crystal structure analysis of trans-[Ru(NH(3))(4)nicNO](2)(SiF(6))(3) shows that the mean Ru-N-O angle is very close to 180 degrees (177 +/- 1 degrees ) and the mean N-O distance is 1.17 +/- 0.02 \u00c5, thus confirming the presence of the Ru(II)-NO(+) moiety in the nitrosyl complexes studied.",

The Pt(II)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Pt(II) separation in the neutral complex [{Pt(bzq)(\u03bc-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-\u03baN,S)}(2)] is 2.910 (2) \u00c5, this being among the shortest observed in half-lantern divalent platinum complexes. Within the complex, the benzo[h]quinoline (bzq) groups lie in close proximity with most C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distances being between 3.3 and 3.7 \u00c5, which is indicative of significant \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The reaction of 1 with halogens X(2) (X(2) = Cl(2), Br(2), or I(2)) proceeds with a two-electron oxidation to give the corresponding dihalodiplatinum(III) complexes [{Pt(bzq)(\u03bc-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-\u03baN,S)X}(2)] (X = Cl 2, Br 3, I 4). Their X-ray structures confirm the retention of the half-lantern structure and the coordination mode of the bzq and the bridging ligand \u03bc-C(7)H(4)NS(2)-\u03baN,S. The Pt-Pt distances (Pt-Pt = 2.6420(3) \u00c5 2, 2.6435(4) \u00c5 3, 2.6690(3) \u00c5 4) are shorter than that in 1 because of the Pt-Pt bond formation. Time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies performed on 1 show a formal bond order of 0 between the metal atoms, with the 6p(z) contribution diminishing the antibonding character of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and being responsible for an attractive intermetallic interaction. A shortening of the Pt-Pt distance from 2.959 \u00c5 in the ground state S(0) to 2.760 \u00c5 in the optimized first excited state (T(1)) is consistent with an increase in the Pt-Pt bond order to 0.5. In agreement with TD-DFT calculations, the intense, structureless, red emission of 1 in the solid state and in solution can be mainly attributed to triplet metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer ((3)MMLCT) [d\u03c3*(Pt-Pt) \u2192 \u03c0*(bzq)] excited states. The high quantum yields of this emission measured in toluene (44%) and solid state (62%) at room temperature indicate that 1 is a very efficient and stable (3)MMLCT emitter, even in solution. The high luminescence quantum yield of its red emission, added to its neutral character and the thermal stability of 1, make it a potential compound to be incorporated as phosphorescent dopant in multilayer organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs).",

Selected spectral features are described. The X-ray structures of Pd(PhA)(2) and Pd(PhB)(2) have revealed trans-planar geometry consistent with metal oxidation state of +2. Bond length trends within the chelate rings are rationalized in terms of steric and electronic factors. In Pd(PhA)(2) a total of 10 ligand pi electrons are present, each formally monoanionic ligand contributing five. Model EHMO studies have revealed that the filled HOMO (a(u)) in Pd(RA)(2) is a bonding combination of two ligand pi orbitals with large azo contributions. The LUMO (b(g)) is roughly the corresponding antibonding combination. The outer pi-electron configuration of Pd(RA)(2) is (a(u))(2)(b(g))(0). Four successive voltammetric responses, two oxidative and two reductive, are observed. The E(1/2) range is -1.3 to +0.8 V vs SCE for Pd(PhA)(2) in a 1:9 MeCN-CH(2)Cl(2) mixture (Pt electrode).

The distorted [FeN(6)] octahedron is formed from four nitrogen atoms belonging to DPEA and two provided by the cis thiocyanate groups. The two pyridine rings of DPEA are in mer positions. Each molecule is linked to its neighbors by hydrogen-bonding interactions as well as by numerous van der Waals contacts supposed to be responsible for the cooperativity of the system. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements (20-290 K) have evidenced a relatively abrupt S = 2 right harpoon over left harpoon S = 0 transition centered at T(1/2) = 138 K. The thermal variation of the high spin state fraction observed by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy is in agreement with that obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements. The fitting of M\u00f6ssbauer and magnetic data with the Ising-like model allowed us to determine the energy gap between the high-spin and low-spin states (Delta(eff) = 835 K) and to estimate the variation of the thermodynamic parameters upon spin transition. The calculated variations of enthalpy (DeltaH = 6.76 kJ mol(-)(1)) and entropy (DeltaS = 49 J mol(-)(1) K(-)(1)) associated with the spin transition are in agreement with those previously observed for iron(II) spin-crossover compounds.

(ii) The electron-donating or -withdrawing properties of the substituent are reflected by the variation of the e(2)qQ parameter, increasing from 1.43 to 1.75 MHz (1) or decreasing to 1.38 MHz (2), and by the nu(+) transition shifting toward higher frequencies from 1.49 to 1.65 MHz (1, 3, 4) or to lower frequencies to 1.29 MHz (2, 5).

The mixed-valence states at various temperatures were also determined by (57)Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of 1 showed a valence-detrapped state at room temperature. With decreasing temperature the spectrum was abruptly transformed into a valence-trapped state around 129 K, well corresponding to the heat-capacity anomaly due to the phase transition (T(trs) = 128.2 K) observed in the calorimetry. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination revealed that 1 has an equilateral structure at 296 and 135 K, and that the structure changes into an isosceles one at 100 K due to the electron trapping. The crystal system of 1 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 20.026(1) \u00c5, c = 12.292(2) \u00c5; at 135 K, a = 19.965(3) \u00c5, c = 12.145(4) \u00c5; and at 100 K, the crystal system changes into triclinic system, space group P&amp;onemacr;, with Z = 2 and a = 12.094(2) \u00c5, b = 12.182(3) \u00c5, c = 12.208(3) \u00c5, alpha = 110.04(2) degrees, beta = 108.71(2) degrees, gamma = 109.59(2) degrees. The X-ray structure determination at 100 K suggests that the electronically trapped phase of 1 at low temperature is an antiferroelectrically ordered phase, because the distorted Fe(3)O molecules, which are expected to possess a nonzero electronic dipole moment, oriented alternatively in the opposite direction with respect to the center of symmetry. On the other hand, no heat-capacity anomaly was observed in 2 between 7 and 300 K, and X-ray structure determination indicated that 2 shows no structure change when the temperature is decreased from 296 K down to 102 K. The crystal system of 2 at 296 K is rhombohedral, space group R&amp;thremacr; with Z = 6 and a = 19.999(1) \u00c5, c = 12.259(1) \u00c5; at 102 K, a = 19.915(2) \u00c5, c = 12.061(1) \u00c5. Even at 102 K the CoFe(2)O complex still has a C(3) axis, and the three metal ion sites are crystallographically equivalent because of a static positional disorder of two Fe(III) ions and one Co(II) ion. The activation energy of intramolecular electron transfer of 1 in the high-temperature disordered phase was estimated to be 3.99 kJ mol(-)(1) from the temperature dependence of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra with the aid of the spectral simulation including the relaxation effect of intramolecular electron transfer.

An unusual feature of the structures is disorder in the C ring, consistent with a two-site occupancy in which the major conformation has the C46 methyl group in the usual position, \"upwardly\" axial, and the C47 methyl group equatorial, while in the minor conformation both are pseudoequatorial, above and below the corrin ring. (13)C NMR chemical shifts of C46, C47, C12, and C13 suggest that the C ring disorder may persist in solution as a ring flip. Since molecular dynamics simulations fail to reveal any population of the minor conformation, the effect is likely to be electronic rather than steric. The axial bond lengths in 10-Cl-MeCbl are very similar to those in MeCbl (d(Co)(-)(C) = 1.979(7) vs 1.99(2); to 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, d(Co)(-)(NB3) = 2.200(7) vs 2.19(2)), but the bonds to the four equatorial N donors, d(Co)(-)(N(eq)), are on average 0.05 \u00c5 shorter. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, d(Co)(-)(C) and d(Co)(-)(NB3) are longer (by 0.10(2) and 0.03(1) \u00c5, respectively) than the bond lengths observed in CNCbl itself, while conversely, the C-N bond length is shorter by 0.06(2) \u00c5, but there is little difference in d(Co)(-)(N(eq)). The Co-O bond length to coordinated water in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is very similar to that found in H(2)OCbl(+) itself, but the d(Co)(-)(NB3) bond is longer (1.967 vs1.925(2) \u00c5), while the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) is very similar. The coordinated water molecule in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) is hydrogen bonded to the c side chain carbonyl oxygen, as in H(2)OCbl(+). NMR observations indicate that the H bond between coordinated H(2)O and the c side chain amide persists in solution. The equilibrium constant, K(Co), for coordination of bzm to Co(III) is smaller in 10-Cl-MeCbl and 10-Cl-CNCbl than in their C10-unsubstituted analogs (181 vs 452; 4.57 x 10(3) vs 3.35 x 10(5)), but could not be determined for 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl because hydrolysis of the phosphodiester is competitive with the establishment of the base-off equilibrium. Substitution of H by Cl at C10 causes the bands in the electronic spectrum of 10-Cl-XCbl complexes to move to lower energy, which is consistent with an increase in electron density in the corrin pi-conjugated system. This increased electron density is not due to greater electron donation from the axial ligand as bonds between these and the metal are either longer (not shorter) or unchanged, and it most probably arises from pi-donation to the corrin by Cl at C10. As the donor power of X increases (H(2)O &lt; CN(-) &lt; Me), the corrin ring becomes more flexible to deformation, and the number of bond lengths and bond angles that are significantly different in XCbl and 10-Cl-XCbl increases; importantly, the C10-Cl bond length, d(C10)(-)(Cl), increases as well. Thus, despite the fact that chlorine is an inductively electron withdrawing substituent, its resonance electron donation is the more important effect on electron distribution in the corrin ring. Mulliken charges obtained from semiempirical RHF-SCF MO calculations using the ZINDO/1 model on XCbl and their 10-Cl analogs at the crystal structure geometry are shown to correlate reasonably well with (13)C NMR shifts and may be used to determine the pattern of electron distribution in these complexes. Substitution by Cl at C10 causes an increase in charge density at Co when X = H(2)O and CN(-), while the charge density on the four equatorial N donors remains virtually unchanged, but a decrease when X = Me, while the charge density on the equatorial N donors also decreases. In response, d(Co)(-)(NB3) increases in the first two complexes but the equatorial bond lengths remain virtually unchanged, while d(Co)(-)(NB3) remains unchanged and the average d(Co)(-)(N(eq)) decreases in 10-Cl-MeCbl. Furthermore, the partial charge on chlorine increases as the donor power of X increases. The small decrease in the pK(a) of coordinated H(2)O in 10-Cl-H(2)OCbl(+) compared to H(2)OCbl(+) itself (7.65 vs 8.09) is due to a decreased charge density on oxygen in 10-Cl-OHCbl compared to OHCbl. The picture that emerges, therefore, is of competitive electron donation by X and Cl toward the corrin system. In 10-Cl-CNCbl, the decrease in the C&amp;tbd1;N bond length as Co-C increases compared to CNCbl suggests that dpi-ppi bonding between cobalt and cyanide is important. (13)C and (15)N NMR observations on 10-Cl-(13)C(15)NCbl are consistent with these effects.",

The three bridging TCNQ(-)'s exhibit interplanar distances of 3.333(1) \u00c5, and the Ag(4) species are packed side-by-side with two adjacent TCNQ(-)'s face-to-face (separation = 3.372(1) \u00c5) forming an infinite pi-stacked chain TCNQ(-)'s. The TCNQ(-) counteranion also exhibits weak pi-contacts via the -CN groups with other counteranions. The magnetic susceptibilities, EPR spectra, and unit cell parameters have been measured as a function of temperature. The magnetic data are best explained by extended chains of antiferromagnetically coupled S = (3)/(2) and S = (1)/(2) centers for the [Ag(4)(dmb)(4)(TCNQ)(3)](+) and TCNQ(-) moieties, respectively. No hyperfine structure has been observed between 106 and 290 K, indicating the presence of rapid exchange in the paramagnetic system.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009&lt;\u200910-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009=\u20090.003) but was unaffected by CO (P\u2009=\u20090.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure.

If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

These highly precise measurements cover the transitions from J = 2 &lt;-- 1 to J = 6 &lt;-- 5 with frequencies ranging from 220 to 661 GHz. For each of the five observed rotational transitions, the narrow linewidths of the saturation dips (about 20 kHz) permitted the resolution of the hyperfine splitting for the first time. This splitting is caused by the (13)C-nuclear spin-rotation interaction yielding a value for the nuclear spin-rotation coupling constant of C(I)((13)C(16)O). If combined with the beam measurements (C(I)((13)C(16)O) = 32.63(10) kHz), a slight J-dependence of the spin-rotation coupling constant can be determined (C(J) = 30 +/- 13 Hz).

This work is the first pure rotational study of this molecule. The radical was created by the reaction of Cl(2) with cobalt vapor. Rotational transitions arising from the Omega=4, 3, and 2 spin-orbit components of Co(35)Cl have been measured, all of which exhibit hyperfine splittings due to the (59)Co nucleus (I=7/2). Transitions arising from the Co(37)Cl species were also recorded, as well as those originating in the v=1, 2, 3, and 4 vibrational states of both isotopomers. The spin-orbit pattern exhibited by the molecule is unusual, with the Omega=3 component significantly shifted relative to the other spin components. In addition, the regular octet hyperfine splittings become distorted above a certain J value for the Omega=3 transitions only. These effects suggest that the molecule is highly perturbed in its ground state, most likely a result of second-order spin-orbit mixing with a nearby isoconfigurational (1)Phi(3) state. The complete data set for Co(35)Cl and Co(37)Cl were fit successfully with a case (a) Hamiltonian but required a large negative spin-spin constant of lambda=-7196 GHz and higher order centrifugal distortion corrections to the rotational, spin-orbit, spin-spin, and hyperfine terms.

The high spectral resolution allowed us to resolve the hyperfine structure in (28)Si(17)O caused by the nuclear electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of (17)O for the first time, and to resolve the much smaller nuclear spin-rotation splitting for isotopic species containing (29)Si. These data were combined with previous rotational and rovibrational (infrared) data to determine an improved set of spectroscopic parameters of SiO in one global fit which takes the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation into account.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The latter measurements include 91 transition frequencies for (28)Si(32)S, (28)Si(33)S, (28)Si(34)S, (29)Si(32)S and (30)Si(32)S in upsilon = 0, as well as 5 lines for (28)Si(32)S in upsilon = 1, with rotational quantum numbers J''&lt; or = 52. The centimetre-wave measurements include more than 300 newly recorded lines. Together with previous data they result in almost 600 transitions (J'' = 0 and 1) from all twelve possible isotopic species, including (29)Si(36)S and (30)Si(36)S, which have fractional abundances of about 7 x 10(-6) and 4.5 x 10(-6), respectively. Rotational transitions were observed from upsilon = 0 for the least abundant isotopic species to as high as upsilon = 51 for the main species. Owing to the high spectral resolution of the FTMW spectrometer, hyperfine structure from the nuclear electric quadrupole moment of (33)S was resolved for species containing this isotope, as was much smaller nuclear spin-rotation splitting for isotopic species involving (29)Si. By combining the measurements here with previously published microwave and infrared data in one global fit, an improved set of spectroscopic parameters for SiS has been derived which include several terms describing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. With this parameter set, highly accurate rotational frequencies for this important astronomical molecule can now be predicted well into the terahertz region.",

Such characteristics associate SiS with the moderate velocity outflow (V approximately 18 km s-1) centered on IRc2 and observed in thermal SiO, the NH3 \"plateau,\" and OH, H2O, and SiO masers.  The column density estimated for SiS in this region is Ntot = 4 x 10(15) cm-2, corresponding to a fractional abundance of f approximately 4 x 10(-9).

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean\u00a0(\u00b1standard deviation) ages: 47.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5 years).

The hyperfine coupling increases linearly with pressure, which we explain using a microscopic model of electron wavefunction distortion mediated by van der Waals interactions between the ni-trogen atom and the cage. Using this model and theoretical estimates of the bulk modulus of isolated fullerene molecules, 10-14 we then estimate the pressure shift and compare it with our experimental results. The predicted shift is smaller than the observed shift, which may indicate contributions beyond the van der Waals interaction as well as uncertainty in the the theoretical bulk modulus. To the best of our knowledge, the value deduced from our model is the first experimental estimate of bulk modulus for an individual C 60 molecule under conditions of hydrostatic pressure.\n\nWe find that the measured linewidth increases nonlinearly with pressure. This is explained by the pressuredependent viscosity of the solvent 15 and its effect on rotational diffusion 16 of fullerene clusters. [17][18][19] At low pressure, the solvent is sufficiently non-viscous that dipoledipole coupling between spins is averaged out by rotation of the cluster. At high pressure, the solvent viscosity increases, leading to an increase in the linewidth towards the rigid lattice limit. 20\n\n\nII. HYPERFINE COUPLING\n\n\nA.

This is because the small sample volume of the pressure cell leads to a low resonator filling factor, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurement. This sample was then injected into an yttria-stabilised zirconia cell attached to a barocycler and loaded into a dielectric resonator (Bruker ER4123D). Measurements were performed at the X band (frequency f \u223c 9.5 GHz) using a Bruker EMXmicro spectrometer. All measurements were performed at room temperature, with sufficient time between increasing the pressure and performing the measurement to allow thermal equilibriation.",

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

By 1920, the existence of electrons within the atomic nucleus was widely assumed. It was assumed the nucleus consisted of hydrogen nuclei in number equal to the atomic mass. But since each hydrogen nucleus had charge +1, the nucleus required a smaller number of \"internal electrons\" each of charge -1 to give the nucleus its correct total charge. The mass of protons is about 1800 times greater than that of electrons, so the mass of the electrons is incidental in this computation. Such a model was consistent with the scattering of alpha particles from heavy nuclei, as well as the charge and mass of the many isotopes that had been identified. There were other motivations for the proton\u2013electron model. As noted by Rutherford at the time, \"We have strong reason for believing",

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

The results obtained so far may be summarized as follows: (i) A variety of intensity, spectral, and anisotropy features suggest that the satellite Triton is important in controlling the outer regions of the Neptunian magnetosphere. These features include the absence of higher energy (&gt;/=150 keV) ions or electrons outside 14.4 R(N) (where R(N) = radius of Neptune), a relative peak in the spectral index of low-energy electrons at Triton's radial distance, and a change of the proton spectrum from a power law with gamma &gt;/= 3.8 outside, to a hot Maxwellian (kT [unknown] 55 keV) inside the satellite's orbit. (ii) Intensities decrease sharply at all energies near the time of closest approach, the decreases being most extended in time at the highest energies, reminiscent of a spacecraft's traversal of Earth's polar regions at low altitudes; simultaneously, several spikes of spectrally soft electrons and protons were seen (power input approximately 5 x 10(-4) ergs cm(-2) s(-1)) suggestive of auroral processes at Neptune.

(iv) Plasma pressures at E &gt;/= 28 keV are maximum at the magnetic equator with beta approximately 0.2, suggestive of a relatively empty magnetosphere, similar to that of Uranus. (v) A potential signature of satellite 1989N1 was seen, both inbound and outbound; other possible signatures of the moons and rings are evident in the data but cannot be positively identified in the absence of an accurate magnetic-field model close to the planet.

Ziman [16] (and possibly others) who had proposed the NPA model as an intuitive physical idea in the context of solid-state physics. The electronic structure of matter is regarded as a superposition of charge densities n j ( r \u2212 R j ) centered on each nuclear center at R j . In other words, if the total charge density in momentum space was n T (k), then this is considered as being made up of the individual charge distributions n j ( k) put together using the ionic structure factor S( k). This was more explicitly implemented in muffin-tin models of solids, or 'atoms-in molecules' models of chemical bonds that were actively pursued in the 1960s, with the increasing availability of fast computers. The NPA model was formulated rigorously within T = 0 DFT by Dagens who showed that it was capable of the same level of accuracy, at least for 'simple metals' as the LMTO, APW or Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker codes that were becoming available in the 1970s [15]. Wigner's T = 0 exchange-correlation (XC) 'functional' in the local-density approximation (LDA) was used by Dagens. In the finite-T NPA that we have used as our \"workhorse\", we solve the Kohn-Sham Mermin equation for a single nucleus placed at the center of a large 'correlation sphere' of radius R c which is of the order of 10r ws , where r ws is the Wigner-Seitz radius per ion.

Although such models have to be derived from variational principles, up to now existing models have not been fully variational. In this paper a fully variational theory respecting virial theorem is proposed-all variables are variational except the parameters defining the equilibrium, i.e., the temperature T, the ion density ni and the atomic number Z. The theory is applied to the quasiclassical Thomas-Fermi (TF) atom, the quantum average atom (QAA), and the superconfigurations (SC) in plasmas. Both the self-consistent-field (SCF) equations for the electronic structure and the condition for the mean ionization Z* are found from minimization of a thermodynamic potential. This potential is constructed using the cluster expansion of the plasma free energy from which the zero and the first-order terms are retained. In the zero order the free energy per ion is that of the quantum homogeneous plasma of an unknown free-electron density n0 = Z* ni occupying the volume 1/ni. In the first order, ions submerged in this plasma are considered and local neutrality is assumed. These ions are considered in the infinite space without imposing the neutrality of the Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell. As in the Inferno model, a central cavity of a radius R is introduced, however, the value of R is unknown a priori. The charge density due to noncentral ions is zero inside the cavity and equals en0 outside. The first-order contribution to free energy per ion is the difference between the free energy of the system \"central ion+infinite plasma\" and the free energy of the system \"infinite plasma.\" An important part of the approach is an \"ionization model\" (IM), which is a relation between the mean ionization charge Z* and the first-order structure variables. Both the IM and the local neutrality are respected in the minimization procedure. The correct IM in the TF case is found to be Z-Z*= integral d3 r[n(r)-n0], where n(r) is the first-order electron density. It is shown that in the QAA case the same IM has to be used and that other IMs lead to unphysical solutions. With this IM R becomes in both cases (TF and QAA) equal to the WS radius and the variational calculation leads to SCF equations in an infinite plasma while n0 (or equivalently Z*) is to be found from the condition integral d3r theta(r-R)Vel(r)=0, where theta denotes Heaviside function and Vel(r) is the SCF electrostatic potential. In the SC case results are similar except that averages over all superconfigurations appear. In the TF case the condition for n0 gives the neutrality of the WS sphere and one gets the classical TF ion-in-cell average atom. The situation is different in the QAA and in the SC cases in which the cavity is not neutral and the SCF potential Vel(r) is not zero outside the cavity. Due to the fully variational character of our approach the expression for the thermodynamic pressure in all cases does not require any numerical differentiation and is consistent with the virial theorem.",

An anti-proton has a negative electric charge, just like an electron, and can be captured in a similar way by a positively charged atomic nucleus. The initial configuration, however, is not stable and radiates energy as gamma rays. As a consequence, the anti-proton moves closer and closer to the nucleus until their quarks can interact, at which point the anti-proton and a proton are both annihilated. This reaction releases a tremendous amount of energy, of which some is released as gamma rays and some is transferred as kinetic energy to the nucleus, causing it to split (the fission reaction). The resulting shower of neutrons can cause the surrounding fuel to undergo rapid fission or even nuclear fusion.",

Electrostatic correction for overlapping pseudocharge densitiesIn ab-initio calculations, even when the pseudopotential approximation is employed, the repulsive energy is still calculated by treating the nuclei as point charges. Since the electrostatic formulation in this work does not make this distinction, there is disagreement with convention when the pseudocharge densities overlap.

The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum total of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons.

Spectral comparison of these three complexes results in the unexpected finding that the dimer emission (575 nm) occurs near that of the nicotinate-containing monomer (580 nm) rather than near the lower energy-emitting state (650 nm) of the acetate-containing monomer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate this unusual emission behavior. The geometries of the dimer and two monomers are optimized in the singlet ground and lowest-energy triplet excited states (LLTS's) to interpret absorption and emission behaviors, respectively. The singlet excited states calculated using time-dependent DFT correlate well with the absorption spectra in the lowest-energy and other major electronic transitions. The energy gaps and low-lying singlet excited states of the dimer are close to those of the acetate-containing monomer. The lowest-energy Franck-Condon triplet excited state of the dimer arising from electronic transitions localized on the acetate moiety is unstable. The next higher Franck-Condon triplet excited state arises from long-range charge transfer transition, and its energy is close to that of the nicotinate-containing monomer. Optimization of the dimer LLTS yields a stable state based on a long-range charge transfer transition involving occupied orbitals partially localized on the bridging nicotinate moiety. The LLTS energies of the dimer and nicotinate-containing monomer are in very good agreement as are the emission energies of these complexes. The correlated spectroscopic and computational results corroborate to the understanding of charge transfer states and transitions toward the development of photosensitive compounds for photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion cells.",

These species were created in an AC discharge of Cr(CO)6 and either methane or acetylene, diluted in argon. Spectra of the CrCCD were also recorded for the first time using deuterated acetylene as the carbon precursor. Seven rotational transitions of CrC were measured, each consisting of three widely spaced, fine structure components, arising from spin-spin and spin-rotation interactions. Eleven rotational transitions were recorded for CrCCH and five for CrCCD; each transition in these cases was composed of a distinct fine structure sextet. These measurements confirm the respective (3)\u03a3(-) and (6)\u03a3(+) ground electronic states of these radicals, as indicated from optical studies. The data were analyzed using a Hund's case (b) Hamiltonian, and rotational, spin-spin, and spin-rotation constants have been accurately determined for all three species.

In spite of multiple quasidegeneracies (particularly for the cases of Sc(2) and Mn(2)), the GVVPT2 PECs are smooth with no discontinuities. Since these molecules have been identified as ones that widely used perturbative methods are inadequate for describing well, due to intruder state problems, unless shift parameters are introduced that can obfuscate the physics, this study suggests that the conclusion about the inadequacy of multireference perturbation theory be re-evaluated. The ground state of Sc(2) is predicted to be X(5)\u2211(u)(-), and its spectroscopic constants are close to the ones at the MRCISD level. Near equilibrium geometries, the 1(3)\u2211(u)(-) electronic state of Sc(2) is found to be less stable than the quintet ground state by 0.23 eV. The Cr(2) PEC has several features of the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) experimental curve (e.g., the pronounced shelf at elongated bond lengths), although the predicted bond length is slightly long (R(e) = 1.80 \u00c5 with cc-pVQZ compared to the experimental value of 1.68 \u00c5). The X(1)\u2211(g)(+) ground state of Mn(2) is predicted to be a van der Waals molecule with a long bond length, R(e), of 3.83 \u00c5 using a cc-pVQZ basis set (experimental value = 3.40 \u00c5) and a binding energy, D(e), of only 0.05 eV (experimental value = 0.1 eV). We obtained R(e) = 3.40 \u00c5 and D(e) = 0.09 eV at the complete basis set (CBS) limit for ground state Mn(2). Low lying excited state curves have also been characterized for all three cases (Cr(2), Mn(2), and Sc(2)) and show similar mathematical robustness as the ground states.

As a close structural analog of a sunscreen agent, MA has a strong absorption due to the S<sub0</sub-S<sub1</sub transition that begins in the UV-A region, with the electronic origin at 28\u2009852 cm<sup-1</sup (346.6 nm). Unlike most sunscreens that have fast non-radiative pathways back to the ground state, MA fluoresces efficiently, with an excited state lifetime of 27 ns. Relative to methyl benzoate, inter-system crossing to the triplet manifold is shut off in MA by the strong intramolecular NHO[double bond, length as m-dash]C H-bond, which shifts the <sup3</supn\u03c0* state well above the <sup1</sup\u03c0\u03c0* S<sub1</sub state. Single vibronic level DFL spectra are used to obtain a near-complete assignment of the vibronic structure in the excited state.

Based on the close correspondence between experiment and theory at the TD-DFT B3LYP-D3BJ/def2TZVP level of theory, the major structural changes associated with electronic excitation are evaluated, leading to the conclusion that the major motion is a reorientation and constriction of the 6-membered H-bonded ring closed by the intramolecular NHO[double bond, length as m-dash]C H-bond. This leads to a shortening of the NHO[double bond, length as m-dash]C H-bond distance from 1.926 \u00c5 to 1.723 \u00c5, equivalent to about a 25% reduction in the HO distance compared to full H-atom transfer. As a result, the excited state process near the S<sub1</sub origin is a hydrogen atom dislocation that is brought about primarily by heavy atom motion, since the shortened H-bond distance results from extensive heavy-atom motion, with only a 0.03 \u00c5 increase in the NH bond length relative to its ground state value.",

During the relaxation, the excited electrons lose their energies through three processes: vibrational relaxation, collisional quenching and internal conversion. Vibrational relaxation is a process that makes excited electrons lose their energies in the form of vibrational energy, whereas collisional quenching is a process that excited electrons lose their energy by colliding with quenchers which are substances that can absorb fluorescence such as oxygen, chloride ions, iodide ions and acrylamide. These two processes result in the excited electrons to relax from higher vibrational state to lower vibrational state of the same excited electronic state. Internal conversion is a process that makes excited electrons on the lowest vibrational state of the higher excited electronic state to lose their energies and goes to the highest vibrational state of the lower excited electronic state. These three processes continue until the excited electrons reach the lowest vibrational state of the lowest electronic excited state. Next, the last interval conversion from this state to the allowable vibrational state of the electronic ground state occurs in two ways: non-radiative and radiative processes. Non-radiative process is a process that the excited electrons lose their energies in the form of thermal energy, whereas radiative process is a process that the excited electrons lose their energies by emitting photon in the form of fluorescence. Fluorescence has wavelength longer than that of electromagnetic radiation due to the loss of energy though vibrational relaxation, collisional quenching and internal conversion.

The extent of exciton delocalization in the two lowest (\u03c0,\u03c0(*)) states of the dimers is determined using the symmetrized one-electron transition density matrices between the ground and excited states, and the electronic coupling is calculated using the delocalization measure and the energy splitting between the states [see F.

In the B-DNA conformation, where the interchromophoric distance is 3.38 \u00c5, our couplings deviate significantly from those calculated with the transition charges, showing the importance of orbital overlap components for the couplings in this conformation. The calculation of the couplings is based on a two-state model for exciton delocalization. However, in three stacks with a purine in the 5(') position and a pyrimidine in the 3(') one (AT, GC, and GT), there is an energetically favored charge transfer state that mixes with the two lowest excited states. In these dimers we have applied a three-state model that considers the two locally excited diabatic states and the charge transfer state. Using the delocalization and charge transfer descriptors, we obtain all couplings between these three states. Our results are important in the context of DNA photophysics, since the calculated couplings can be used to parametrize effective Hamiltonians to model extended DNA stacks. Our calculations also suggest that the 5(')-purine-pyrimidine-3(') sequence favors the formation of charge transfer excited states. ",

We independently pumped at each of these visible transitions to form vibrational wavepackets on the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces, which modulated the ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals, respectively. We found that the ground state wavepacket oscillates with a frequency of 48 cm(-1) when pumping the red peak and 11 cm(-1) when pumping the blue peak. We assign these frequencies to the Ir-Ir symmetric stretch, with the variation in frequency reflecting the variation in metal-metal bond strength in support of our assignment of the blue peak to the longer Ir-Ir bond length conformer and the red peak to the shorter Ir-Ir bond length conformer. When pumping the red peak, we found two modes with frequencies of 80 and 119 cm(-1) in the stimulated emission and only one mode at 75 cm(-1) when pumping the blue peak. We assign the 75-80 cm(-1) frequency to the Ir-Ir stretch and the 119 cm(-1) vibration to the dihedral angle twist in the excited state. The variation in the excited state dynamics does not result from the excitation of different electronic states, but rather from excitation to different Franck-Condon regions of the same electronic excited state potential energy surface. This occurs because of the large difference in ground state molecular structure.

Usually the strongest luminescence of the material is from the lower levels to the ground state. This process is called fluorescence. For instance, in semiconductors, most of the light emitted is at the frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy, i.e. from the bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band. In such systems, more light absorbed by the material, results in more electrons decaying non-radiatively to the lower states, and more luminescence in the emission wavelength. References",

Steady-state absorption and emission measurements were employed for both molecules while a picosecond fluorescence up-conversion technique was used to follow the dynamic behavior of the 2M5M system. The experimental methods were complemented by DFT and TD DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) calculations involving ground and excited-state optimization which in the case of the smaller 2M5M molecule were extended to the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method. The solvent effect is incorporated by applying the polarizable continuum (PCM) model. The data reveal that the 2B5M molecule crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c and its crystal lattice is composed of monomers with intramolecular N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O [2.572(3) \u00c5] hydrogen bonds, connected into a polymer network by weak intermolecular C-H\u2026O [3.2-3.4 \u00c5]-type interactions.

The signals of picosecond fluorescence up-conversion of 2M5M are solvent- and emission-wavelength dependent. The three time components found in a weakly polar isooctane-dioxane mixture have been attributed to solvation dynamics (\u223c500 fs), and to relaxation of N* and PT* forms while in acetonitrile, a very rapid fluorescence decay with a time constant (2.3-4.0 ps) indicative of the presence of the normal (N*) form was observed. Much shorter fluorescence lifetimes in alcohols (a few picoseconds) and in D(2)O (less than 200 fs) than in aprotic solvents suggest that in protic media, the solvent molecules participate in the ESIPT, bridging between the methylamine group and the N-oxide group of 2M5M.",

This indicates that both states have similar geometries. The difference between the calculated (B3LYP-D3BJ/6-311++G(d,p)) and the observed rotational constants is 0.6% or less for both the ground and excited state. This gives confidence that the calculated structures can be used to enhance the structural insight. It is important to highlight that for the excited state all three rotational constants are slightly smaller than those in the ground states. Thus, there is a small increase in the dimensions of the molecule in all directions. This is captured by the calculations and consistent with the expansion of the aromatic ring associated with the pp* transition. 15 For a rigid planar structure, the inertial defect is zero, thus it serves as a measure of a molecule's planarity.

A shortening of the Pt-Pt distance from 2.959 \u00c5 in the ground state S(0) to 2.760 \u00c5 in the optimized first excited state (T(1)) is consistent with an increase in the Pt-Pt bond order to 0.5.

The high quantum yields of this emission measured in toluene (44%) and solid state (62%) at room temperature indicate that 1 is a very efficient and stable (3)MMLCT emitter, even in solution.

In particular, we have constructed the potential energy curves (PECs) with respect to the iron-oxygen distance when removing all water ligands at the same time from the cluster minima and established their correlation to the long-range dissociation channels. Due to the fact that both the second and third ionization potentials of iron are larger than the one for water, the ground-state products asymptotically correlate with dissociation channels that are repulsive in nature at large separations, as they contain at least one H2O(+) fragment and a singly positively charged metal center (Fe(+)). The most stable equilibrium structures emanate, via intersections and/or avoided crossings, from the channels consisting of the lowest electronic states of Fe(2+)((5)D, 3d(6)) or Fe(3+)((6)S, 3d(5)) and six neutral water molecules. Upon hydration, the ground state of Fe(2+)(H2O)6 is a triply ((5)Tg) degenerate one, with the doubly ((5)Eg) degenerate state lying \u223c20 kcal/mol higher in energy. Similarly, the Fe(3+)(H2O)6 cluster has a ground state of (6)Ag symmetry under Th symmetry, which is well-separated from the first excited state. We also examine a multitude of electronically excited states of many possible spin multiplicities and report the optimized geometries for several selected states. The PECs of those states exhibit a high density of states. Focusing on the ground and the first few excited states of the [Fe(H2O)6](2+) and [Fe(H2O)6](3+) clusters, we studied their mutual interaction in the gas phase. We obtained the optimal geometries of the Fe(2+)(H2O)6-Fe(3+)(H2O)6 gas-phase complex for different Fe-Fe distances. For distances shorter than 6.0 \u00c5, the water molecules in the respective first solvation shells located between the two metal centers were found to interact via weak hydrogen bonds. We examined a total of 10 electronic states for this complex, including those corresponding to the electron transfer (ET) from the ferrous to the ferric ion. The ET process is discussed and a possible path via a quasi-symmetric transition state is suggested. ",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$.

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

The p-values of comparing 3Rm, 2.7Rm and 7/3Rm with FFR were 0.004, 0.005 and 0.010, respectively; the r value between 7/3FFRCT and FFR (0.96) was better than that of 3FFRCT (0.95) and 2.7FFRCT (0.95); the 95% LoA between 7/3FFRCT and FFR (-0.08~0.11) was smaller than that of 3FFRCT (-0.10~0.12) and 2.7FFRCT (-0.09~0.11); the AUC and accuracy of 7/3FFRCT [0.962 (0.805-0.999), 96.15%] were the same as those of 2.7FFRCT [0.962 (0.805-0.999), 96.15%] and better than those of 3FFRCT [0.944 (0.777-0.996), 92.3%]. The prediction threshold of 7/3FFRCT (0.791) was closer to 0.8 than that of 3FFRCT (0.816) and 2.7FFRCT (0.787).

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315\u00a0$\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50\u00a0$\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between SAEM and FOCEi using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status. Under the fasted state, the first-order absorption into the central compartment was preceded by zero-order infusion into the depot compartment, whereas for the fed state, the absorption into the depot was instantaneous followed by first-order absorption from depot into the central compartment.

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10\u00a0keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000\u00a0nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions. This paper proposes a back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by the mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA) to construct a prediction model and evaluate the corresponding prediction effect. The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$. The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest. LSCI was used to measure the area of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miarea</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{area}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and the perfusion level of each patient's keloid ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miK</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${K}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ) and normal skin ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" <mml:semantics <mml:mrow<mml:msub<mml:miN</mml:mi <mml:miperfusion</mml:mi</mml:msub </mml:mrow <mml:annotation${N}_{\\mathrm{perfusion}}$</mml:annotation</mml:semantics </mml:math ). The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and pruritus were also used to assess each keloid. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of various internal cytokines in keloids and normal skin. We compared the perfusion and expression levels of intrinsic cytokines between keloids and normal skin. We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).

The RPI had a higher correlation with the pain-VAS, pruritus-VAS, and the expression levels of internal cytokines in keloids than blood perfusion levels and the VSS.

The proposed RPI based on LSCI showed the highest accuracy, unlike the VSS and assessment of perfusion, and can be utilized as a reliable, objective, quantitative, and noninvasive tool to evaluate the severity of keloids.",

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives.

A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV. The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories.

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (Efields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field ${\\mathrm B}_{1}^{+}$of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with \u2113 = 0 transfer but enhances those with \u2113 = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation. Stimulus-induced cortical hyperactivity persisted up to 1.5 h and decayed to baseline after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ indicated by c-Fos expression. The synaptic proteins VGLUT1 and PSD-95, in contrast, were upregulated at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and downregulated at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$, respectively. Spine density and spine head volume were also increased at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and decreased at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$. This specific sequence of events reflects a continuous joint evolution of activity and connectivity that is characteristic of the model of homeostatic structural plasticity. Our computer simulations thus corroborate the observed empirical evidence from our animal experiments.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

In contrast, for the \u2113 = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 \u2212 ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and \u2113 = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors. To account for this, this work proposes a sensor interface with $\\mathrm {C}_{P}$ canceller. By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface. The proposed force sensor offers great potential for real-time force monitoring of cardiovascular surgery.",

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039\u00a0kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57\u00a0$\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mol}/{\\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30\u00a0000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling \u03b2 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer \u2113 = 0 and \u2113 = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases.

To this end, we generated a sample in which all peptides are labeled with the identical 1:1 ratio. We observe that the ratio of the signals in two channels of the mass spec instrument converges to an asymptotic value, just like the fractional outcome of a sequence of coin-tosses converges to a true ratio with the number of tosses. Figure 2A presents a scatter plot where each point represents a single peptide from a dataset of a total of 10534 peptides. The functional form of this dependency for a coin toss represented by a Binomial distribution for the\ncoefficient of variation is \u221a(1 \u2212 )/\n, where p is the ratio and n the number of coin-tosses. In order to treat the MS-signal as an outcome of a binomial process, we need to find a conversion factor from a continuous MS-signal into equivalents of \"coin flips\". We fit a single parameter m as a multiplier to an MS-signal s where n = ms to the binned data (Fig. 2B). When we perform this analysis on an Orbitrap Lumos with 50K mass resolution, we observe a convertion factor of 2.0. When we performed the equivalent experiments on different instruments and resolutions, we observed different values (Table 1). Makarov et al. previously reported that this conversion factor should scale inversely with the square-root of the Orbitrap resolution (Makarov and Denisov, 2009). Our measurements are in rough agreement with this prediction; when we increase resolution from 15K to 120K on the Lumos we expect the conversion factor to reduce by 2.8-fold, we observe a 3.5 decrease. Based on previous reports by the same paper, we likely underestimate the number of actual ions by a small factor. Nevertheless, the good fit to the data (Fig. 2B) indicates that the conversion into pseudo-counts allows us to model the relationship between mass spectrometer signal and measurement noise due to ion-statistics and other noise occurring during data acquisition. For a limited number of cases, we have repeated these measurements for various instruments of the same model and obtained very similar results suggesting that for a given instrument model and resolution the conversion factors are invariant.",

Analysis of several existing data sets reveals that about 80% of respondents start their sequence with Heads. We attributed this to the linguistic convention describing coin toss outcomes as \"Heads or Tails,\" not vice versa. However, our subsequent experiments found the \"first-toss\" bias reversible under minor changes in the experimental setup, such as mentioning Tails before Heads in the instructions. We offer a comprehensive account in terms of a novel response bias, which we call reachability. It is more general than the 1st-toss bias, and it reflects the relative ease of reaching 1 option compared to its alternative in any binary choice context. When faced with a choice between 2 options (e.g., Heads and Tails, when \"tossing\" mental coins), whichever of the 2 is presented first by the choice architecture (hence, is more reachable) will be favored.

Thus, our results show that joint attention is not necessary for the perception of this effect.

The methods are illustrated by creating proton therapy treatment plans for two glioblastoma patients with the clinical goal of sparing the hippocampus and brainstem.

On the other hand, classical physics cannot predict this information when it is created, as manifested in measuring instruments, in quantum experiments, while quantum theory can. In this epistemological sense, this information is quantum. The article designates the discontinuity between quantum theory and the emergence of quantum phenomena the \"Heisenberg discontinuity\", because it was introduced by W. Heisenberg along with QM, and the discontinuity between QM or QFT and the classical physics of quantum phenomena, the \"Bohr discontinuity\", because it was introduced as part of Bohr's interpretation of quantum phenomena and QM, under the assumption of Heisenberg discontinuity. Combining both discontinuities precludes QM or QFT from being connected to either physical reality, that ultimately responsible for quantum phenomena or that of these phenomena themselves, other than by means of probabilistic predictions concerning the information, classical in character, contained in quantum phenomena.

The main outcome was the proportion of \"heads\" coin tosses achieved (out of 300 attempts) by each participant. Each of the participants attempted to flip the coin so as to achieve a heads result. All participants achieved more heads than tails results, with 7 of the 13 participants having significantly more heads results (p&lt;or=0.05).

In this game, participants guess the outcomes of unseen coin tosses after a person in another room (dubbed 'the reporter') observes the coin toss outcomes and then sends reports (which may or may not be truthful) to participants about whether the coins landed on heads or tails. Participants knew that the reporter's interests were aligned with their own (common interests), opposed to their own (conflicting interests) or opposed to their own, but that the reporter was penalized every time he or she sent a false report about the coin toss outcome (penalty for lying).

However, it critically disregards an interesting third outcome: the possibility of the coin coming at rest on its edge. Provided this evident yet elusive possibility, previous works have already focused on capturing all three landing probabilities of thick coins, but have only succeeded computationally. Hence, an exact analytical solution for the toss of bouncing objects still remains an open problem due to the strongly nonlinear processes induced at each bounce.

This is called the multiplicity of a state, and is denoted by \u2126 (omega). For example, if four out of ten blue marbles are on the left side of the box, it does not matter which four these are, you will observe the same state, namely four blue marbles on the left side and six on the right side of the box.\n\nAnother example is coin tossing. If you flip a coin three times and throw two heads and a tail, it does not matter if you throw two heads first and then a tail or first a tail and then two heads. Either way you reach the same state, namely two out of three heads. In the context of protein folding, the multiplicity would indicate the number of conformations in each state (e.g., folded/unfolded). The probability of each state can be calculated by dividing the multiplicity of that state by the sum of the multiplicities of all states in the system (i.e., the total number of ways to arrange the marbles in the box -see Panel \"How to calculate the multiplicity of a state\"):\np A = \u2126 A X \u2126 X (4)\nHow to calculate the multiplicity of a state",

This is a reasonable assumption because even if a set of rules can produce an unbounded number of molecules, no biology will exhibit an infinite set in a cell. Our method bounds the search space of production rules. The method also takes two numbers as input: d is the maximum height of the learned rules and n is the maximum number of them. If the method fails to find production rules, the user may call the method with larger parameters. First, the method initializes S with the set of monomers occurring in \u00b5 and sets w to be the maximum arity of any monomer in S.\n\nWe use templates to model the search space of rules. A template is also a tree that has a depth and the internal nodes of the tree have the same number of children. Two variables label each node of the template. One variable is for choosing the sugar at the node and the other is for describing the 'situation' of the node. The domain of the first variables is S\u222a{\u22a5}.

The parent nucleus is required to recoil, upon emission of an alpha particle, with a discrete kinetic energy due to conservation of momentum. Thus, all of the ionization energy from the recoil-nucleus is deposited in an extremely small volume near its original location, typically in the cell nucleus on the chromosomes, which have an affinity for heavy metals. The bulk of studies, using sources that are external to the cell, have yielded RBEs",

He found that when swiftly-moving alpha particles are allowed to collide with gold atoms, they are sometimes deflected through 180 o , implying that a strong force is at work.

The dominant product channel corresponds to Br(-) + CN, while the second channel correlates to spin-orbit excited Br(*) with CN(-). A larger wavelength dependence of the branching ratio is observed at shorter wavelengths, where the fraction of Br(-) based products ranges from 80% to 95% at 355 nm and 270 nm, respectively. These branching ratios are reproduced and the mechanisms are explored by quantum dynamics calculations based on ground and excited state potential energy surfaces for BrCN(-), evaluated at the SO-MRCISD level of theory. It is found that the electronic states that correlate to the two observed product channels are coupled through the spin-orbit terms in the electronic Hamiltonian. The strength of this coupling displays a strong dependence on the Br-CN angle. Specifically, after promotion to the excited state that is energetically accessible with 430-600 nm photons, it is found that when the wave packet accesses Br-CN separations of between 4 \u00c5 and 6 \u00c5, predominantly the Br(-) + CN products are formed when the Br-CN angle is smaller than 120\u00b0. For larger values of the Br-CN angle, the Br(*) + CN(-) channel dominates. At the shorter wavelength excitation, the dynamics is complicated by a pair of states that correlate to electronically excited CN(*) + Br(-) products that borrow oscillator strength from the bright state, leading to an increase in the amount of Br(-) relative to CN(-).

These so-called fluorophores contain an aromatic system. The emission wavelength is greater than the excitation wavelength, caused by an energy loss. The process of the fluorescence is illustrated by the Jablonski diagram shown in Figure 1. A light quantum of energy hvA supplied by an external source is absorbed by the fluorophore, creating an excited electronic singlet state (S1 or S2). On these energy levels the fluorophores can exist in different vibrational energy levels (v) corresponding to the Franck-Condon-principle. From the higher vibrational level of S1 or S2 the fluorophore is rapidly relaxing to the lowest vibrational level due to internal conversion. A photon with energy hvF is emitted when the fluorophore is returning to its electronic ground state S0. The energy of this emission photon is lower, and therefore of a longer wavelength than the excitation photon. This behavior can be seen in Figure 2, where in the upper left triangle of the spectrum no fluorescence signal can be seen. This so-called Stoke's shift enables the high sensitivity of the fluorescence technique because it allows the detection of emission photons against a low background, isolated from excitation photons [62]. Characteristic features of fluorophores are the quantum yield and the lifetime. The ratio of the number of excited and emitted photons is the quantum yield, and the lifetime is defined by the average time the molecule spends in the excited state before it returns to its ground state [63]. However, the fluorescence yield can be influenced by different effects which involve energy transfer and absorption. For example, the so-called inner filter effects reduce the intensity of the fluorescence measurements when non-fluorescent components of the medium absorb excitation or emission radiation while reducing the fluorescence yield of an observed fluorophore [64]. The excited state fluorescence lifetime also changes with changes in the environment. Furthermore, the culture fluorescence depends on bioprocess variables, such as the optical density (OD), viscosity, pH, the aeration of the bioreactor and a lot of further the fluorescence measurements affecting variables [22].

Usually the strongest luminescence of the material is from the lower levels to the ground state. This process is called fluorescence. For instance, in semiconductors, most of the light emitted is at the frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy, i.e. from the bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band. In such systems, more light absorbed by the material, results in more electrons decaying non-radiatively to the lower states, and more luminescence in the emission wavelength. References",

This is known as an orbital. The further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the more they gain potential energy associated to a determined orbital. Quantum Mechanics explains that orbitals have quantized energy levels and for moving an electron to another level, it has to receive or emit the exact amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the two electronic levels (\u0394E = E 1 -E 0 ). The amount of energy required to move and electron from energy level E 0 to energy level E 1 can be provided by heat due to a collision with other particles or absorb the energy of a photon. In this case, the energy of a Photon (E = h = hc/ ) should be equal to the difference between the orbitals (\u0394E), this is, only a Photon of a particular wavelength is absorbed and can promote that transition. This phenomenon is known as atomic absorption. A more stable electron configuration of an atom is the one with less energy, also known as ground state configuration. The difference of energy between the last full orbital and the next empty orbital of the atom in a ground state is of the same order of magnitude of photons with wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm, this means, photons in ultraviolet regions and visible light of electromagnetic spectrum.

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (light) with matter, in our case proteins. Several closely related events can occur depending on the amount of energy that the radiation carries. In the first example of absorption, electromagnetic radiation is captured by a protein sample, which converts the energy of the photon into internal energy. Atoms within proteins are composed of a nucleus containing neutrons, protons and dispersed electrons. Electrons, however, are not merely floating within the atom but are instead fixed within electron orbitals. There are multiple electron orbitals within an atom, and each has its an energy level associated with it. Since the energy levels of matter are quantised, only light of energy that can cause transitions from one existing energy level to another will be absorbed. The amount of energy carried by a light photon depends on wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy carried by a photon; hence, ultraviolet (UV) light carries more energy than visible light. When a molecule absorbs a photon of the correct energy, an electron is promoted from its ground state to an excited state. This occurs if the energy of the photon, corresponding to the energy gap between the ground state and an empty higher energy level (the excited state). After absorption, the energy is then lost to the solvent as heat (thermal energy) when the electron drops back to the ground state. An absorption spectrum measures the amount of light that passes through a sample at a variety of wavelengths. The spectrum depends on the type and arrangement of atoms in the sample and can make absorption spectra useful for identifying different molecules. In this way, absorption spectroscopy can be used to reveal some very basic information about the structure and conformational states of a protein.\n\n\nBox 2 Properties of Light Box",

They typically contain relatively few atoms, ranging from about 1000 to 100 000. 3 This means that the crystals are large enough to be useful in the laboratory but small enough to exhibit quantum behaviours associated with individual atoms. Movement of electrons is confined in all three directions so tightly that QDs are said to be \"zero-dimensional\". As a result, changing the size of a QD controls how it absorbs and emits energy. This behaviour makes them appealing for a wide range of photonic and electronic applications. A quantum well is a sandwich of thin, stacked slices of semiconductor materials with different bandgaps. The bandgap is the energy required for an electron to jump from one energy level to another. 3 In a quantum well, the central layer has the smallest bandgap, which means that the larger gaps of the outer layers act like barriers, restricting the electrons in the middle one. This structure vertically confines the energy levels of the middle layer in one dimension. By controlling the size of that layer, scientists realized in the 1970s that they could tune the wavelengths-corresponding to colour-of photons emitted by the electrons. When a QD is provided with energy (i.e. it is in an excited state) the electron is boosted to a higher energy level, generating an exciton. When the electron returns to a lower level, the atom emits a photon of light with the same energy that the atom originally absorbed. The biggest QDs produce the longest wavelengths/lowest frequencies, while the smallest QDs make shorter wavelengths/higher frequencies. This indicates that big dots make red light and small dots make blue light, with intermediate-sized dots producing green light (and the familiar spectrum of other colours too). This effect is due to the bandgap size: a small dot has a bigger bandgap (the minimum energy it takes to free electrons so they will carry electricity through a material), so it takes more energy to excite it; because the frequency of emitted light is proportional to the energy, smaller dots with higher energy produce higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. Larger dots have more (and more closely) spaced energy levels, so they give out lower frequencies and therefore longer wavelengths. 19 QDs as a group of materials can have many differing structures and properties based on each component (Fig. 2). 20 They vary in their core and shell composition, in their size and",

Typical CQDs emit visible light ranging from 350 to 650 nm, depending on the precursors used for synthesis.",

The Raman effect should not be confused with emission (fluorescence or phosphorescence), where a molecule in an excited electronic state emits a photon and returns to the ground electronic state, in many cases to a vibrationally excited state on the ground electronic state potential energy surface. Raman scattering also contrasts with infrared (IR) absorption, where the energy of the absorbed photon matches the difference in energy between the initial and final rovibronic states.

Electrons change energy states by either resonantly gaining energy from absorption of a photon or losing energy by emitting photons. In chemistry-related disciplines, one often distinguishes between fluorescence and phosphorescence. The former is typically a fast process, yet some amount of the original energy is dissipated so that re-emitted light photons will have lower energy than did the absorbed excitation photons. The re-emitted photon in this case is said to be red shifted, referring to the reduced energy it carries following this loss (as the Jablonski diagram shows). For phosphorescence, electrons which absorbed photons, undergo intersystem crossing where they enter into a state with altered spin multiplicity (see term symbol), usually a triplet state.

An important part of luminescence phenomena is due to the influence of light (generally visible or ultra-violet light) on matter, such as for instance a molecule, which can emit light at a wavelength different from that absorbed. The classical Jablonski diagram (Figure 1, left part) represents electronic states of a molecule, and the transitions between these electronic states, depending on the energy. When a molecule absorbs light (a quantum of energy), it goes from a fundamental state (S 0 ) to an excited state (S 1 ). Depending on the type of molecules, two main ways can be taken to go back to the ground state: either a nonradiative decay of the energy absorbed, or the emission of fluorescence at a longer, less energetic wavelength. A third possibility (not shown in the Figure) concerns an intersystem conversion towards a triplet state (T 1 ), from which there will be emission of phosphorescence, having generally a lifetime longer than that of fluorescence. This classical one-photon excited fluorescence has led to the design of numerous types of chemical entities since the XIX century. For instance, fluorescein, which is a widely used fluorescent tracer for many applications, was synthesized for the first time in 1871 [1].",

CDs also possess good biocompatibilities and excellent optical properties, 8,9 which are applied for sensing and bioimaging. 10,11 They are expected to replace the traditional semiconductor quantum dots with biological toxicity and environmental hazards, especially CdSe quantum dots owing to a high fluorescence quantum yield. 12 According to the rule of Kasha, the fluorescence emission wavelength of organic dyes and semiconductor quantum dots remains unchanged with the excitation wavelength 13 since the photons are emitted rapidly from the ground-state energy level to the lowest excited-state energy level. The organic dyes hold a narrow excitation wavelength and instability of emission. 14,15 However, the fluorescence behaviors of CDs do not conform to this rule, and they depend on the excitation wavelength. 16 CDs have excellent photostability due to the optical emission mechanism of the carbon core and the surface. 17 When exposed to exciting light for a long time, the luminescence intensity hardly decreases and no light flickers. 18,19 The stable fluorescence behavior of CDs can make up for the shortcomings of organic dyes and semiconductor quantum dots. At present, there are three sorts of fluorescence mechanisms proposed for CDs such as the quantum effect, surface state, and compound radiation of electron\u2212hole pairs. 20,21 The red shift of the emission spectra that are independent of the excitation wavelength may be caused by their size, the amount of graphitic nitrogen, and emission sites. 22,23 On the contrary, CDs have a different surface state with inconformity groups because the fluorescence is dependent on the excitation wavelength. 24 Recently, Jiang had observed that the chemical luminescence of NaIO 4 and H 2 O 2 would be enhanced by CDs due to their self-trap state. 25 The photoluminescence (PL) of CDs could reflect the characteristics of the quantum-confined effect and the surface trap state. 26 However, the PL mechanism of CDs is still a controversial issue and not an accurate conclusion. 27",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between SAEM and FOCEi using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

When the temporal smoothness is suddenly broken, such as when an object is occluded, or some frames are missing in a sequence, the result of these methods can deteriorate significantly. This paper explores the orthogonal approach of processing each frame independently, i.e., disregarding the temporal information. In particular, it tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation: the separation of an object from the background in a video, given its mask in the first frame. We present Semantic One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one shot). We show that instance-level semantic information, when combined effectively, can dramatically improve the results of our previous method, OSVOS. We perform experiments on two recent single-object video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S is both the fastest and most accurate method in the state of the art. Experiments on multi-object video segmentation show that OSVOS$^\\mathrm {S}$S obtains competitive results.",

In this paper, we have developed a state-space framework to sequentially segment the carotid IM borders in each image throughout the cardiac cycle. In this framework, an ${\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{\\infty }}$ filter is used to solve the state-space equations, and a grayscale-derivative constraint snake is used to provide accurate measurements for the ${\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{\\infty }}$ filter. We have evaluated the performance of our approach by comparing our segmentation results to the manually traced contours of ultrasound image sequences of three synthetic models and 156 real subjects from four medical centers. The results show that our method has a small segmentation error (lumen intima, LI: 53 $\\pm\\, 67\\;{\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m; media-adventitia, MA: 57 $\\pm\\, 63\\;{\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m) for synthetic and real sequences of different image characteristics, and also agrees well with the manual segmentation (LI: bias = 1.44 ${\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m; MA: bias = $-$3.38 ${\\mathrm{\\mu }}$m). Our approach can robustly segment the carotid ultrasound sequences with various IM border morphologies, dynamics, and unknown image noise.

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

Furthermore, we expect that plastic surgeons can use models in clinical work to enhance communication efficiency between doctors and patients.

The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01).

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives. Cs and CD measurements were obtained from the left carotid artery. A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV. The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories. Study results demonstrated that the proposed approach has a potential to provide valuable surrogate markers for cardiovascular risk assessment.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009&lt;\u200910-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009=\u20090.003) but was unaffected by CO (P\u2009=\u20090.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines.

The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives. Cs and CD measurements were obtained from the left carotid artery. A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV. The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories. Study results demonstrated that the proposed approach has a potential to provide valuable surrogate markers for cardiovascular risk assessment.",

However, the indirect effects of differences in light requirements on the growth of mid- and late-successional tree species are unclear, and this potential growth effect has not been explained at the transcriptome level. Here, a typical mid-successional dominant tree species, Schima superba Gardn. et Champ, and a typical late-successional dominant tree species, Cryptocarya concinna Hance were used as materials and planted under 100% full light (FL) and 30% FL (low light, LL) to explore the responses of tree species in different successional stages of subtropical forests to different light environments. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the expression changes in genes related to growth and photoprotection under different light environments. The young leaves of S. superba accumulated more malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radicals (${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$) under LL. A lower hormone content (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin) in the young leaves, a weaker photosynthetic capacity in the mature leaves and significant downregulation of related gene expression were also found under LL, which resulted in the total biomass of S. superba under LL being lower than that under FL. The young leaves of C. concinna had less MDA and ${\\mathrm{O}}_2^{{{}^{\\bullet}}^{-}}$, and a higher hormone contents under LL than those under FL. There was no significant difference in photosynthetic capacity between mature leaves in contrasting light environments. Although the biomass of C. concinna under LL was less than that under FL, the height of C. concinna under LL was higher than that under FL, indicating that C. concinna could grow well under the two light environments. Our results describing the acclimatization of light at the physiological, molecular and transcriptome levels are important for a complete understanding of successional mechanisms.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

This model suffers two deficiencies: (a) it does not account for experimental entropy differences of +/-2% among elemental liquids and (b) it implies a value of zero for the transit contribution to internal energy. The purpose of this paper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for entropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of +/-0.1% to the available experimental high-temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two nuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution S_{vib}(T/theta_{0}) , where T is temperature and theta_{0} is the vibrational characteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution S_{tr}(T/theta_{tr}) , where theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each liquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the liquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the V-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to internal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived in a single formula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike. An ab initio calculation of theta_{0} , based on density-functional theory, is reported for liquid Na and Cu. Comparison of these calculations with the above analysis of experimental entropy data provides verification of V-T theory. In view of the present results, techniques currently being applied in ab initio simulations of liquid properties can be employed to advantage in the further testing and development of V-T theory.",

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician. In a cohort of 28 subjects with a history of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, we compared the PeriVib performance with two established threshold sensing systems: (1) a Biothesiometer device and (2) a tuning fork. We found that the sensation threshold estimated by PeriVib correlated well with the Biothesiometer ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.68) but less well with the tuning fork ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.15). Functional gait and balance metrics did not correlate with peripheral neuropathy severity.",

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter \u03b2 2 are 0.50 \u00b1 0.04 [22] and 0.55 \u00b1 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A \u2265 24 and A \u2265 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in \u03b2 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value \u03b2 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to \u03b2 2 , we also show CH predictions with \u03b2 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

Some of the ground-state vibrational frequencies are responsible for the band spacing in the experimental luminescence spectrum, while the atomic displacement between the ground and excited-state geometries is responsible for the intensities ratio. The uranium -halide (\u03bd U\u2212X ), uranium -oxygen(\u03bd s ) symmetrical stretching modes and uranium -oxygen bending mode (\u03bd b ) contribute to the luminescence spectra shape to a large extent, and their values for the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2complexes are listed in Table II. The uranium -oxygen asymmetrical stretching mode (\u03bd a ), which is vibronically silent, is also shown to discuss trends. Using the vibrational perturbation theory [52,53] as implemented in Gaussian 16 [25], we have computed the anharmonic corrections, which turned out to be small, of the order of 5 and 3 cm \u22121 for the ground and excited states respectively (See Table S2 in the ESI).\n\nFor the gas-phase [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2model, the computed \u03bd U\u2212Cl , \u03bd b , \u03bd s and \u03bd a frequencies are smaller in the excited state than in the ground state by 4, 4, 80 and 115 cm \u22121 , respectively. The PBE0 calculations reproduce with an impressive accuracy the measured red shift of the stretching mode, \u03bd s , 82 cm \u22121 , in Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 , and underestimates that for the bending mode, 20 cm \u22121 . The latter discrepancy has negligible impact as the symmetric stretching \u03bd s dominates the vibronic progressions in the luminescence spectra.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

However, the absolute orientations of spins in coordinate space can be crucial in understanding the magnetic properties of materials with unpaired electrons. At low temperature, the spins of a magnetic solid may undergo long-range magnetic ordering, which allows one to determine the directions and magnitudes of spin moments by neutron diffraction refinements. The preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion can be predicted on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations including electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, most chemists and physicists are unaware of how the observed and/or calculated spin orientations are related to the local electronic structures of the magnetic ions. This is true even for most crystallographers who determine the directions and magnitudes of spin moments because, for them, they are merely the parameters needed for the diffraction refinements. The objective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework of thinking about and predicting the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion by examining the relationship between the spin orientation and the local electronic structure of the ion. In general, a magnetic ion M (i.e., an ion possessing unpaired spins) in a solid or a molecule is surrounded with main-group ligand atoms L to form an MLn polyhedron, where n is typically 4-6, and the d states of MLn are split because the antibonding interactions of the metal d orbitals with the p orbitals of the surrounding ligands L depend on the symmetries of the orbitals involved.1 The magnetic ion M of MLn has a certain preferred spin direction because its split d states interact among themselves under SOC.2,3 The preferred spin direction can be readily predicted on the basis of perturbation theory in which the SOC is taken as perturbation and the split d states as unperturbed states by inspecting the magnetic quantum numbers of its d orbitals present in the HOMO and LUMO of the MLn polyhedron. This is quite analogous to how chemists predict whether a chemical reaction is symmetry-allowed or symmetry-forbidden in terms of the HOMO-LUMO interactions by simply inspecting the symmetries of the frontier orbitals.4,5 Experimentally, the determination of the preferred spin orientations of magnetic ions requires a sophisticated level of experiments, for example, neutron diffraction measurements for magnetic solids with an ordered spin state at a very low temperature. Theoretically, it requires an elaborate level of electronic structure calculations, namely, DFT calculations including electron correlation and SOC. We show that the outcomes of such intricate experimental measurements and theoretical calculations can be predicted by a simple perturbation theory analysis. ",

In this paper, we report on the vibrational spectrum of the CoO(4) molecule in its ground and first low-lying excited states. Isotopic substitutions using (16)O(2) and (18)O(2) precursors, as well as (16)O(2) + (18)O(2) and (16)O(2) +( 16)O(18)O + (18)O(2) mixtures in either excess argon or neon, enable demonstration of C(2)(v)() and C(s)() structures for the respective states. CoO(4) is formed following molecular diffusion by complexation of ground-state CoO(2) by an O(2) molecule. The molecule is first formed in the excited state and then spontaneously relaxes to the ground state after remaining in the dark. The kinetics of relaxation can be fitted to a first-order exponential decay with an excited-state lifetime estimated around 23 +/- 2 min in argon and 15 +/- 2 min in neon, indicative of a slow, spin-forbidden process. Population of the excited state is induced by photons around 4250 +/- 250 cm(-1). Experimental results are compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the BPW91/6-311G(3df) level. Electronic and geometrical optimizations were carried out starting from the ground-state precursors (i.e., (3)Sigma(g)(-) for O(2) and (2)Sigma(g)(+) for CoO(2)). Calculations predict a (2)A(2) (C(2)(v)()) ground state and a (4)A' (C(s)()) first excited state 0.37 eV above, close to the 4250 +/- 250 cm(-1) experimental excitation energy. The transition pathway is found to involve two supplementary states with crossed potential energy surfaces (PESs): a (2)B(1) excited state, 0.48 eV above the ground state, reached first through an adiabatic transition with a photon around 4800 cm(-1), and a (4)B(1) transition state into which the system relaxes before finally attaining the (4)A' (C(s)()) excited state. Harmonic frequencies and absolute intensities are also calculated and compared with the experimental data, indicating however that the DFT underestimates the internuclear distances for both configurations. Force and interaction constants were obtained with a semiempirical harmonic force-field potential calculation. They were then used in an empirical rule of plot linking force constants and internuclear distances in order to obtain an estimate of the Co-O bond lengths for each state and are compared to the DFT predictions.",

The potential energy curves of YC+ confirm a previous prediction by Seivers et al. [J. Chem.

The calculated ionization energy of YC is 6.00 eV, while the adiabatic electron affinity is 0.95 eV at the MRSDCI level.

In order to find out the ground state geometries, a large number of initial cluster structures for each n has been searched via total energy calculations. Generally, the ground state structures for the case of n = 1-9 clusters have at least one monovalent O atom, which only binds to a single Ti atom. However, the most stable structure of the n = 10 cluster does not have any monovalent O atom. On the other hand, Ti atoms are at least fourfold coordinated for the ground state structures for n \u2265 4 clusters. Our calculations have revealed that clusters prefer to form three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, all these stoichiometric clusters have nonmagnetic ground state. The formation energy and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap for the most stable structure of (TiO(2))(n) clusters for each n have also been calculated. The formation energy and hence the stability increases as the cluster size grows. In addition, the interactions between the ground state structure of the (TiO(2))(n) cluster and a single water molecule have been studied. The binding energy (E(b)) of the H(2)O molecule exhibits an oscillatory behavior with the size of the clusters. A single water molecule preferably binds to the cluster Ti atom through its oxygen atom, resulting an average binding energy of 1.1 eV. We have also reported the interaction of the selected clusters (n = 3, 4, 10) with multiple water molecules.

Finally, the adsorption of transition metal (TM) atoms (V, Co and Pt) on the n = 10 cluster has been investigated for possible functionalization. All these elements interact strongly with this cluster, and a permanent magnetic moment is induced upon adsorption of Co and V atoms. We have observed gap localized TM states leading to significant HOMO-LUMO gap narrowing, which is essential to achieve visible light response for the efficient use of TiO(2) based materials.

From the configuration and energy of these extrema, different reaction mechanisms are suggested depending on the collision energy. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on these global PESs have been used to estimate reactive cross-sections as functions of the collision energy and thermal rate constant as a function of the temperature. The weighted rate constant for each state, i.e. including the spin-orbit population factor, increases with the temperature contrary to the ground state one.

Descriptions of the photodetachment transition between the Al(3)(-) and Al(3) ground states in terms of natural bond order (NBO) analyses and total electron density difference distributions are discussed. A reinterpretation of the vibrational structure in the resonant two-photon ionization spectrum of Al(3) is proposed, which supports its original assignment as arising from the X (2)A(1)(') ground state, giving an Al(3) bond dissociation energy, D(0)(Al(2)-Al), of 2.403+/-0.001 eV. With this reduction by 0.3 eV from the currently recommended value, the present calculated dissociation energies of Al(3), Al(3)(-), and Al(3)(+) are consistent with the experimental data.",

From collinear two-dimensional scans, several adiabatic and nonadiabatic pathways have been identified. Multiconfigurational single and double excitation configuration interaction calculations show that the adiabatic pathways on a (4)Delta potential surface from O(2)(A' (3)Delta)+H and a (4)Sigma(+) potential surface from O(2)(A (3)Sigma(u) (+))+H are the most favorable, with the zero-point corrected barrier heights of as low as 0.191 and 0.182 eV, respectively, and the reactions are fast. The transition states for these pathways are collinear and early, and the reaction coordinate suggests that the potential energy release of ca. 3.8 eV (larger than the energy required to excite OH to v=10) is likely to favor high vibrational excitation.",

Thus, (CS)4 is predicted to have a different ground state than its lighter congener, (CO)4, which has a triplet ground state, (3)B1u, in which these two MOs are each singly occupied. Here, we report the results of a negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) study of the radical anion (CS)4(\u2022-), designed to test the prediction that (CS)4 has a singlet ground state. The NIPE spectrum reveals that (CS)4 does, indeed, have a singlet ground state with electron affinity (EA) = 3.75 eV. The lowest triplet state is found to lie 0.31 eV higher in energy than the ground state, and the open-shell singlet is 0.14 eV higher in energy than the triplet state. Calculations at the (U)CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//(U)B3LYP/6-311+G(2df) level support the spectral assignments, giving EA = 3.71 eV and \u0394EST = 0.44 eV. These calculated values are, respectively, 0.04 eV (0.9 kcal/mol) smaller and 0.13 eV (3.0 kcal/mol) larger than the corresponding experimental values. In addition, RASPT2 calculations with various active spaces and basis sets converge on a (1)B1u-(3)B1u energy gap of 0.137 eV, in excellent agreement with the 0.14 eV energy difference obtained from the NIPE spectrum. Finally, calculations of the Franck-Condon factors for transitions from the ground state of (CS)4(\u2022-) to the ground ((1)A1g) and two excited states ((3)B1u, (1)B1u) of (CS)4 account for all of the major spectral peaks and nicely reproduce the vibrational structure observed in each electronic transition.

While the ground state of NaIn(4) is also predicted to be a symmetric C(4nu) ((2)A(1)) square pyramid, the ground state of the NaAl(4) cluster is found to have a C(2nu) ((2)A(1)) pyramid with a rhombus base, and the ground state of NaGa(4) possesses a C(2nu) ((2)A(1)) pyramid with a rectangle base. In general, these structures exhibit two competing geometries, viz., an ideal C(4nu) structure and a distorted rhomboidal or rectangular pyramid structure (C(2nu)). All of the ground states of the NaM(4) (+) (M=Al,Ga,In) cations are computed to be C(2nu) ((3)A(2)) pyramids with rhombus bases. The equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies, dissociation energies, adiabatic ionization potentials, adiabatic electron affinities for the electronic states of NaM(4) (M=Al,Ga,In), and their ions are computed and compared with experimental results and other theoretical calculations. On the basis of our computed excited states energy separations, we have tentatively suggested assignments to the observed X and A states in the anion photoelectron spectra of Al(4)Na(-) reported by Li et al. [X. Li, A. E. Kuznetov, H. F. Zheng, A. I. Boldyrev, and L. S. Wang, Science 291, 859 (2001)]. The X state can be assigned to a C(2nu) ((2)A(1)) rhomboidal pyramid. The A state observed in the anion spectrum is assigned to the first excited state ((2)B(1)) of the neutral NaAl(4) with the C(4nu) symmetry. The assignments of the excited states are consistent with the experimental excitation energies and the previous Green's function-based methods for the vertical transition energy separations between the X and A bands.",

The structural properties, relative energies of different structural isomers, and the calculated first vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of different structural isomers for cluster anions FeVS1-3- and FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 3, 4; m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) are investigated at a BPW91/TZVP theory level. The experimental first VDEs for these Fe-V sulfur clusters are reported. The most probable ground state structures and spin multiplicities for these clusters are tentatively assigned by comparing their theoretical and experiment first VDE values. For FeVS1-3- clusters, their first VDEs are generally observed to increase with the number of sulfur atoms from 1.45 eV to 2.86 eV. The NBO/HOMOs of the ground state of FeVS1-3- clusters are localized in a p orbital on a S atom; the partial charge distribution on the NBO/HOMO localized site of each cluster anion is responsible for the trend of their first VDEs. A less negative localized charge distribution is correlated with a higher first VDE. Structure and steric effect differences for FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 3, m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) clusters are suggested to be responsible for their different first VDEs and properties. Two types of structural isomers are identified for FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 4, m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) clusters: a tower structure isomer and a cubic structure isomer. The first VDEs for tower like isomers are generally higher than those for cubic like isomers of FemVnSm+n- (m + n = 4, m &gt; 0, n &gt; 0) clusters. Their first VDEs are can be understood through: (1) NBO/HOMO distributions, (2) structures (steric effects), and (3) partial charge numbers on the NBO/HOMO's localized sites. EBEs for excited state transitions for all Fe-V sulfur clusters are calculated employing OVGF and TDDFT approaches at the TZVP level. The OVGF approach for these Fe/V/S cluster anions is better for the higher transition energies than the TDDTF approach. The experimental and theoretical results for these Fe/V/S cluster anions are compared with their related pure iron sulfur cluster anions. Properties of the NBO/HOMO are essential for understanding and estimating the different first VDEs for Fe/V/S, and comparing them to those of the pure Fe/S cluster anions.",

In the examined region, three Rydberg states of 3p character contribute to the transitions, 2(1)A2(3p(y) &lt;-- pi), 2(1)B1(3p(z) &lt;-- pi), and 3(1)A1(3p(x) &lt;-- pi). The former two states are of mostly pure Rydberg character and exhibit a resolved K structure, whereas the 3(1)A1(3p(x) &lt;-- pi) state is mixed with the valence 2(1)A1(pi* &lt;-- pi) state, which is unbound and is strongly predissociative. Analyses of photoelectron kinetic energy distributions indicate that the ground vibrational level of the 2(1)B1(3p(z)) state is mixed with the 2(1)A2(3p(y)) nu(9) level, which is of B1 vibronic symmetry. The other 2(1)A2(3p(y)) vibronic states exhibit pure Rydberg character, generating ions in single vibrational levels. The photoelectron spectra of the 3(1)A1(3p(x) &lt;-- pi) state, on the other hand, give rise to many states of the ion as a result of strong mixing with the valence state, as evidenced also in the ab initio calculations. The equilibrium geometries of the electronic states of neutral diazomethane were calculated by CCSD(T), using the cc-pVTZ basis, and by B3LYP, using the 6-311G(2df,p) basis. Geometry and frequencies of the ground state of the cation were calculated by CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ, using the unrestricted (UHF) reference. Vertical excitation energies were calculated using EOM-CCSD/6-311(3+,+)G* at the B3LYP optimized geometry. The theoretical results show that the 2(1)A2(3p(y) &lt;-- pi) and 2(1)B1(3p(z) &lt;-- pi) states have geometries similar to the ion, which has C(2v) symmetry, with slight differences due to the interactions of the electron in the 3p orbital with the nuclei charge distributions. The geometry of the 3(1)A1(3p(x) &lt;-- pi) state is quite different and has Cs symmetry. The experimental and theoretical results agree very well, both in regard to excitation energies and to vibrational modes of the ion.",

This study supports that the ground state electronic configuration for VCH(+) is \u20267\u03c3(2)8\u03c3(2)3\u03c0(4)9\u03c3(1) (X(2)\u03a3(+)), and is different from that of \u20267\u03c3(2)8\u03c3(2)3\u03c0(4)1\u03b4(1) (X(2)\u0394) for the isoelectronic TiO(+) and VN(+) ions. This observation suggests that the addition of an H atom to vanadium carbide (VC) to form VCH has the effect of stabilizing the 9\u03c3 orbital relative to the 1\u03b4 orbital. The analysis of the state-to-state IR-UV-PFI-PE spectra has provided precise values for the ionization energy of VCH, IE(VCH) = 54,641.9 \u00b1 0.8 cm(-1) (6.7747 \u00b1 0.0001 eV), the rotational constant B(+) = 0.462 \u00b1 0.002 cm(-1), and the v2(+) bending (626 \u00b1 1 cm(-1)) and v3(+) V-CH stretching (852 \u00b1 1 cm(-1)) vibrational frequencies for VCH(+)(X(2)\u03a3(+)).

Spectral features corresponding to transitions from the anionic ground state to the ground and excited states of the neutral are unraveled and resolved for each species. The EAs of these bromine and iodine oxides are experimentally determined for the first time (except for IO(2)) to be 2.515 \u00b1 0.010 (BrO(2)), 2.575 \u00b1 0.010 (IO(2)), 4.60 \u00b1 0.05 (BrO(3)), 4.70 \u00b1 0.05 (IO(3)), and 6.05 \u00b1 0.05 eV (IO(4)).

Periodate (IO(4)(-)) possesses a very high electron binding energy. Only one excited state feature with 0.95 eV excitation energy is shown in the 157 nm spectrum. Accompanying theoretical calculations reveal structural changes from the anions to the neutrals, and the calculated EAs are in good agreement with experimentally determined values. Franck-Condon factors simulations nicely reproduce the observed vibrational progressions for BrO(2) and IO(2).

The observation of Franck-Condon-forbidden transitions to vibrational levels of the X(+) state of the cation with v(+) \u2265 25 is rationalized by a mechanism involving vertical excitation of predissociative Rydberg states of mixed singlet-triplet character with an A(+) ion core which are coupled to Rydberg states converging to high-v(+) levels of the X(+) state. The same mechanism is proposed to also be responsible for the observation of Cl(+) - Cl(-) ion pairs and quartet states in the photoionization of Cl2.

Photoelectron spectra are obtained at 193 and 157 nm photon energies, revealing very different electronic structures for the Cr versus W oxide clusters. The electron affinity and HOMO-LUMO gap are measured to be 3.68 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.7 eV, respectively, for the Cr(4)O(10) neutral cluster, as compared to 4.41 \u00b1 0.04 and 1.3 eV for W(4)O(10). A comprehensive search is performed to determine the ground-state structures for M(4)O(10) and M(4)O(10)(-), in terms of geometry and electronic states by carefully examining the calculated relative energies at the DFT, CCSD(T), and CASSCF levels. The ground states of Cr(4)O(10) and Cr(4)O(10)(-) have tetrahedral structures similar to that of P(4)O(10) with the anion having a lower symmetry due to a Jahn-Teller distortion. The ground states of W(4)O(10) and W(4)O(10)(-) have butterfly shape structures, featuring two fused five-member rings with a metal-metal multiple bond between the central metal atoms. The much stronger WW bonding than the CrCr bonding is found to be the primary cause for the different ground state structures of the reduced Cr(4)O(10)(0/-) versus W(4)O(10)(0/-) oxide clusters. The photoelectron spectra are assigned by comparing the experimental and theoretical adiabatic and vertical electron detachment energies, further confirming the determination of the ground electronic states of M(4)O(10) and M(4)O(10)(-). The time-dependent DFT method is used to calculate the excitation energies of M(4)O(10). The TD-DFT results in combination with the self-consistently calculated vertical detachment energies for some of the excited states at the DFT and CCSD(T) levels are used to assign the higher energy bands. Accurate clustering energies and heats of formation of M(4)O(10) are calculated and used to calculate accurate reaction energies for the reduction of M(4)O(12) to M(4)O(10) by CH(3)OH, as well as for the oxidation of M(4)O(10) to M(4)O(12) by O(2).

This function poorly reproduces the rotational constants of the lowest and most important puckering states. The microwave spectrum has been reinvestigated and largely extended to include more than 4600 transitions of the ground state and six excited states of the ring-puckering vibration allowing accurate centrifugal distortion constants to be obtained for the first time. A new potential function V(z) = 38.8(z(4) - 0.65z(2)) cm(-1) has been determined. This function yields much better agreement between calculated and observed rotational constants, especially for the lowest puckering states, than the previous function and predicts a nonplanar ring equilibrium conformation. The barrier to ring planarity is determined to be 49(8) J/mol. The ground-state energy level is 35 cm(-1) above the barrier maximum. Theory predicts that three of the five Watson centrifugal distortion constants, \u0394JK, \u0394K, and \u03b4K, should vary with the puckering state, whereas \u0394J and \u03b4J should be unaffected. It was found that \u0394JK and \u0394K indeed behave in the expected manner, while deviations were seen for the three other centrifugal distortion constants. The ab initio methods HF, MP2, CCSD, CCSD(T), and CCSD(T)-F12 with large basis sets as well as several DFT methods were used in an attempt to reproduce the low experimental barrier to the planar ring. Only the MP2 method yielded a satisfactory prediction of the barrier. The CCSD and the CCSD(T) calculations predict a planar ring, whereas the energy differences between a planar and a nonplanar ring obtained in the CCSD(T)-F12 computations are so small that a definite conclusion cannot be drawn.

Irradiation with 100 eV electrons results in electron-stimulated dissociation and electron-stimulated desorption (ESD) of adsorbed water molecules. The molecular water ESD yield increases linearly with water coverage theta for 0&lt; or =theta&lt; or =1 ML and 1&lt;theta&lt; or =2 ML. However, for theta&gt;1 ML, the water ESD yield per additional water molecule adsorbed (i.e., the slope of the ESD yield versus coverage) is 3.5 times larger than for theta&lt;1 ML. In contrast, the number of water molecules dissociated per incident electron increases linearly for theta&lt; or =2 ML without changing slope at theta=1 ML. The total electron-stimulated sputtering rate, as measured by postirradiation temperature programmed desorption of the remaining water, is larger for theta&gt;1 ML due to the increased water ESD for those coverages. The water ESD yields versus electron energy (for 5-50 eV) are qualitatively similar for 1, 2, and 40 ML water films. In each case, the observed ESD threshold is at approximately 10 eV and the yield increases monotonically with increasing electron energy. The results indicate that excitations in the adsorbed water layer are primarily responsible for the ESD in thin water films on TiO(2)(110). Experiments on \"isotopically layered\" films with D(2)O adsorbed on the Ti(4+) sites (D(2)O(Ti)) and H(2)O adsorbed on the bridging oxygen atoms (H(2)O(BBO)) demonstrate that increasing the water coverage above 1 ML rapidly suppresses the electron-stimulated desorption of D(2)O(Ti) and D atoms, despite the fact that the total water ESD and atomic hydrogen ESD yields increase with increasing coverage. The coverage dependence of the electron-stimulated reactions is probably related to the different bonding geometries for H(2)O(Ti) and H(2)O(BBO) and its influence on the desorption probability of the reaction products.",

The ion temperatures and resulting energy distributions are crucial for understanding how well a TELS pulse can simulate an extreme event in a larger, magnetic confinement device. A retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) has been constructed for use with such a transient plasma due to its inexpensive and robust nature. The innovation surrounding the use of a control analyzer in conjunction with an actively sampling analyzer is presented and the conditions of RFEA operation are discussed, with results presented demonstrating successful performance under extreme conditions. Such extreme conditions are defined by heat fluxes on the order of 0.8 GW m<sup-2</sup and on time scales of nearly 200 \u03bcs. Measurements from the RFEA indicate two primary features for a typical TELS discharge, following closely with the pre-ionizing coaxial gun discharge characteristics. For the case using the pre-ionization pulse (PiP) and the theta pinch, the measured ion signal showed an ion temperature of 23.3 \u00b1 6.6 eV for the first peak and 17.6 \u00b1 1.9 eV for the second peak. For the case using only the PiP, the measured signal showed an ion temperature of 7.9 \u00b1 1.1 eV for the first peak and 6.6 \u00b1 0.8 eV for the second peak. These differences illustrate the effectiveness of the theta pinch for imparting energy on the ions. This information also highlights the importance of TELS as being one of the few linear pulsed plasma sources whereby moderately energetic ions will strike targets without the need for sample biasing.",

In a series of extensive experimental attempts, a high-order data set of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) could be collected to a resolution of sin theta/lambda = 1.00 A(-1) at 25 K. This modification contains only minor disorder at the solvent bulk. For methylcobalamin (MeCbl), only a severely disordered modification was found (sin theta/lambda = 1.00 A(-1), 100 K, measured with synchrotron radiation). The already published data set of cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) (sin theta/lambda = 1.25 A(-1), 100 K) was reintegrated to guarantee similar treatment of the three compounds and cut to sin theta/lambda = 1.11 A(-1) to obtain a higher degree of completeness and redundancy. On the basis of these accurate experimental geometries of AdoCbl, MeCbl, and CNCbl, state-of-the-art density functional calculations, single-point calculations, and geometry optimizations were performed on model compounds at the BP86/TZVP level of theory to evaluate the electronic differences of the three compounds. AdoCbl and MeCbl are known to undergo different reaction paths in the body. Thus, the focus was directed toward the characterization of the dative Co-C(ax) and Co-N(ax) bonds, which were quantifed by topological parameters, including energy densities; the source function including local source; and the electron localizability indicator (ELI-D), respectively. The source function reveals the existence of delocalized interactions between the corrin macrocycle and the axial ligands. The ELI-D indicates unsaturated Co-C(ax) bonding basins for the two biochemically active cofactors, but not for CNCbl, where a population of 2.2e is found. This may be related to significant pi-backbonding, which is supported by the delocalization index, delta, of 0.15 between the Co atom and the N atom of the cyano ligand. Considering all results, the inherent electronic differences between AdoCbl and MeCbl are found to be small thus, supporting earlier findings that the interaction with the protein site mainly controls the type of Co-C(ax) bond cleavage.",

When the period of alternation was decreased toward approximately 1 microm, the LC alignment underwent an abrupt transition from inhomogeneous planar to a more uniform configuration with a large pretilt angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). With the aid of a model based on the competition between the Frank-Oseen elastic energy and a phenomenological surface potential of the form W(theta,phi)=(1/2)W((2))(theta) sin(2) theta+(1/4)W((4))(theta) sin(4) theta+(1/2)W(phi) cos(2) theta sin(2) phi(x,y) (where theta and phi are, respectively, the pretilt and azimuthal angles of the LC director and W((2))(theta), W((4))(theta), and W(phi) are constants) that demonstrated good agreement with experiment, we investigated the microscopic origin of the observed transition. It was found that this transition comprises two steps. First, the LC director homogenizes toward the phi=45 degrees azimuthal direction in the plane to relax the elastic energy. The resulting rise in azimuthal anchoring energy subsequently drives the LC to adopt a finite pretilt. The values of the W's deduced from the model reveal that the polar anchoring energy is about approximately 1/10 of the typical values, with the sin(4) theta term dominating the sin(2) theta term.

The emphasis here is on how the reaction probability varies with incident kinetic energy (E(i)=0.4-2.07 eV) and angle of incidence (theta(i)=0 degrees -60 degrees ). The most reactive surface is the substrate underlying the SAMs-SiO(2) with a high density of -OH(a) (&gt;5 x 10(14) cm(-2)), \"chemical oxide.\" On chemical oxide, the dynamics of adsorption are well described by trapping, precursor-mediated adsorption, and the initial probability of adsorption depends only weakly on E(i) and theta(i). The dependence of the reaction probability on substrate temperature is well described by a model involving an intrinsic precursor state, where the barrier for dissociation is approximately 0.2-0.5 eV below the vacuum level. Reaction with the SAMs is more complicated. On the SAM with the unreactive, -CH(3), termination, reactivity decreases continuously with increasing E(i) while increasing with increasing theta(i). The data are best interpreted by a model where the Ti[N(CH(3))(2)](4) must first be trapped on the surface, followed by diffusion through the SAM and reaction at the SAMSiO(2) interface with residual -OH(a). This process is not activated by E(i) and most likely occurs in defective areas of the SAM. On the SAMs with reactive end groups, the situation is quite different. On both the-OH and -NH(2) SAMs, the reaction with the Ti[N(CH(3))(2)](4) as a function of E(i) passes through a minimum near E(i) approximately 1.0 eV. Two explanations for this intriguing finding are made-one involves the participation of a direct dissociation channel at sufficiently high E(i). A second explanation involves a new mechanism for trapping, which could be termed penetration facilitated trapping, where the Ti[N(CH(3))(2)](4) penetrates the near surface layers, a process that is activated as the molecules in the SAM must be displaced from their equilibrium positions.",

The in-plane longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons propagating parallel and perpendicular to the polymer chains were examined. In spite of the strongly first-order nature of the phase transition, both LA velocities exhibit only a broad down step in the temperature range between approximately 100 degrees C and approximately 130 degrees C, depending on the propagation direction, with increasing temperature. The LA phonon width perpendicular to the polymer chains increases with increasing temperature, and exhibits a broad maximum centered at approximately 120 degrees C. On the other hand, the LA phonon width along the polymer-chain axis is much wider than the width perpendicular to the polymer chains, and continues to increase even in the paraelectric phase. Treating the E(u) symmetry electric polarizations (Px,P(y)) of the D6h point group as the macroscopic order parameter, a Laudau free energy was developed to discuss the elastic properties. Using the free energy, we found that the elastic anomalies expected through the electrostrictive couplings between the order parameter and the elastic strains are strongly suppressed by the intrinsic electrical nature of the ferroelectric polymer. For both LA phonons, the temperature development of the phonon frequency and width can be reasonably reproduced by the Cole-Davidson relaxation model for the velocity dispersion with an exponent of betaCD=0.4. The relaxation time was found to obey the Arrhenius law tau=tau(0) exp(DeltaE/k(B)T) with DeltaE=0.55+/-0.01 eV and tau(0)=(4.0+/-0.6)x10(-18) s. At 24.0 degrees C in the ferroelectric phase, the in-plane phonon width anisotropy can be reasonably described by gammaB(straight theta)/2pi=0.18+0.72 sin4 straight theta for the LA phonon and gammaB(straight theta)/2pi=0.02+0.095 sin2 2straight theta for the transverse acoustic phonon, where the phonon propagation angle straight theta is measured from the perpendicular direction with respect to the polymer-chain axis.

An additional analysis showed that the minimum marginal cement thickness, Dm = F, can be obtained for a shoulder preparation and X values of common metal-investment systems by applying a spacer of appropriate thickness on the entire occlusal and axial walls of the die. This renders the preparation of bevels superfluous. The thickness of the spacer should allow for the cement film thickness, roughness of the tooth and casting surfaces, dimensional inaccuracies of the die, and distortions of the wax pattern. If the spacer is thicker than required, a minimum value of Dm is still obtained for preparations without bevels. If the horizontal part of the die shoulder is covered as well with the spacer, a greater spacer thickness is required to obtain a minimum value of Dm than if the spacer extends to the end of the axial walls. In this case the spacer thickness should be greater on the occlusal die wall than on other regions of the die for values of X smaller than 1. The spacer should also be thicker in the occlusal region if restriction of the investment setting expansion by the wax pattern occurs mainly in this region.",

Basic EEG theory says that when a layer of neurons generates an EEG signal, the signal always phase-reverses at some level. Thus, theta waves recorded from sites above and below a generating layer have opposite signs. There are other complications as well: the hippocampal layers are strongly curved, and theta-modulated inputs impinge on them from multiple pathways, with varying phase relationships. The outcome of all these factors is that the phase and amplitude of theta oscillations change in a very complex way as a function of position within the hippocampus.

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

Rotation around the C-C-O-H dihedral affords two conformers in 2-propanol, which gives rise to 13 hydrogen abstraction reaction pathways grouped into three channels, C\u03b1, C\u03b2, and O, depending on the abstraction site.

The SRP-PM6 model captures the energetics of the reaction with higher accuracy than some conventional first-principles methods but is efficient enough to allow for extensive reaction dynamics calculations.

The total ICVT/SCT rate constants of all channels for the two reactions at the MC-QCISDUMP2(full)6-31+G(d,p) level are both in good agreement with the available experimental data, and corresponding three-parameter expressions of k(ICVTSCT) in 220-3000 K are fitted as 6.46 x 10(-15)(T298)(3.60) exp(-386T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) for NH(2) abstraction and 1.04 x 10(-14)(T298)(4.00) exp(-2037T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) for CH(3) abstraction.

This mobile proton may shift from Y to X, and the relative energies of transition states for elimination reactions (Delta) depend on the ability of the X atom to retain this proton. Therefore, Deltagrows on going from Si to C and with increasing numbers of methyl substituents.

The protocol starts with the search and location of the conformers of the equilibrium structures using the TorsiFlex program. By a simple modification of the starting geometry of reactants, a Python script generates the input for the hydrogen abstraction transition states. Initially, the search of the stationary points (reactants and transition states) is carried out at a low-level employing firstly a preconditioned search and secondly a random search. The low-level conformers were reoptimized using a higher level electronic structure method. This information allows the evaluation of the multistructural harmonic-oscillator partition functions, which are corrected for zero-point energy anharmonicity by the hybrid degeneracy-corrected second-order vibrational perturbation theory and for torsional anharmonicity by the multistructural torsional method, as implemented in the MsTor program. The structural information of the stationary points is used by Pilgrim to evaluate the multipath canonical variational transition state theory thermal rate constants with multidimensional small-curvature corrections for tunneling. Therefore, the thermal rate constants include variational (recrossing) and tunneling effects in addition to the effect of multiple conformations on the thermal rate constants. These features grant the applicability of the method to a wide range of temperatures. The method was applied to each of the hydrogen abstraction sites of the four isomers of butanol. The methodology employed allowed us to calculate the thermal rate constants in the temperature range of 250-2500 K and to accurately fit them to analytical expressions. The variety of abstraction sites shows that the protocol is robust and that it can be employed to study hydrogen abstraction reactions in molecules containing carbon and oxygen as heavy atoms.",

Various methods of quantum chemical calculations have been tested to reproduce the observed (1)H and (13)C chemical shifts of the starting sulfides and their oxidation products. It has been shown that the determination of the energy-minimized conformation is a very important condition for obtaining realistic data in the subsequent calculation of the NMR chemical shifts. The correlation between calculated and observed chemical shifts is very good for carbon atoms (even for the 'cheap' DFT B3LYP/6-31G* method) and somewhat less satisfactory for hydrogen atoms. The calculated chemical shifts induced by oxidation (the Delta delta values) agree even better with the experimental values and can also be used to determine the oxidation state of the sulfur atom (-S-, -SO-, -SO(2)-).",

The main sinks of O2 would have been reactions with volcanic hydrogen. The modern volcanic H flux is about H atoms cm\u22122 s\u22121. If the prebiotic atmosphere had a similar volcanic hydrogen flux, then the potential O2 sink would have been a fourth of the hydrogen volcanism, or O2 molecules cm\u22122 s\u22121. These calculated values predict that potential O2 sinks were ~50 times greater than the abiotic source. Therefore, O2 must have been nearly absent in the prebiotic atmosphere. Photochemical models, which do more complicated versions of the calculations above, predict prebiotic O2 mixing ratios below 10\u221211, which is extremely low compared to the modern O2 mixing ratio of 0.21.",

The N-1 adduct, 1,2-dihydroaden-2-yl radical (1), was generated by femtosecond electron transfer to N-1-protonated adenine that was selectively produced by electrospray ionization of adenine in aqueous-methanol solution. Radical 1 is an intrinsically stable species in the gas phase that undergoes specific loss of the N-1-hydrogen atom to form adenine, but does not isomerize to the more stable C-2 adduct, 1,2-dihydroaden-1-yl radical (5). Radicals 1 that are formed in the fifth and higher electronically excited states of DeltaE &gt; or = 2.5 eV can also undergo ring-cleavage dissociations resulting in expulsion of HCN. The relative stabilities, dissociation, and transition state energies for several hydrogen atom adducts to adenine have been established computationally at highly correlated levels of theory. Transition state theory calculations of 298 K rate constants in the gas phase, including quantum tunnel corrections, indicate the branching ratios for H-atom additions to C-8, C-2, N-3, N-1, and N-7 positions in adenine as 0.68, 0.20, 0.08, 0.03, and 0.01, respectively.

It was natural for Korringa to consider how Kasterin\u2019s multiple-scattering equations could be used in the context of condensed-matter physics. On a train ride from Delft to Heemstede, Korringa had the epiphany that the equations could be applied to electrons scattering from a cluster of atoms. Moreover, when the number of atoms increases without bound, the incoming and outgoing waves could be set equal to zero, which yielded a formalism for calculating the stationary states.",

Cuts of the full potential energy surfaces along the stretching and bending coordinates have been presented, together with the vertical excitation spectra. The strong experimentally observed absorption around 395 nm is assigned to the 1 (1)B(2) state, which correlates to ground state products. Absorption at wavelengths shorter than 260 nm is predicted to lead to singlet excited state products, S(2) (a (1)Delta(g))+S((1)D). The spectroscopic properties of the X (3)Sigma(g) (-), a (1)Delta(g), and b (1)Sigma(g) (+) electronic states of the S(2) radical have also been accurately characterized in this work. The investigations of the low-lying electronic states were accompanied by accurate ground state coupled cluster calculations of the thermochemistry of both S(2) and S(3) using large correlation consistent basis sets with corrections for core-valence correlation, scalar relativity, and atomic spin-orbit effects. Resulting values for D(0)(S(2)+S) and SigmaD(0) for S(3) are predicted to be 61.3 and 162.7 kcal/mol, respectively, with conservative uncertainties of +/-1 kcal/mol.

Two laser beams are employed, the first to excite hydrogen atoms from the ground state to the second excited state via two-photon absorption and the second to strongly photoionize the excited atoms. The resulting fluorescence measurements are independent of quenching. A model is presented that assures the viability of PICLS as long as the photoionization rate is greater than or equal to the quenching rate. The model is verified in fuel-lean, stoichiometric, and fuel-rich flat premixed H(2)/O(2)/N(2) flames at pressures of 20 and 72 Torr. Over this range in pressure, the ratio of number densities obtained from PICLS to those calculated from partial equilibrium is constant to within 20%. Most of the error arises from the sensitivity of the partial equilibrium calculat ions to small uncertainties in both the fuel-oxidizer ratio and the measured OH concentration. Because of the quenching-independent nature of PICLS, quantitative fluorescence measurements can be made by calibrating at a single favorable flame condition.",
