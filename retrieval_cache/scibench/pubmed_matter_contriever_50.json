In this Note, we present an experimental setup capable of performing simultaneous XRD and XAS measurements by the application of a pixel-array area detector. For XRD, the momentum transfer in specular diffraction was measured by scanning the X-ray energy with fixed incoming and outgoing x-ray angles. By selecting a small fixed region of the detector to collect the XRD signal, the rest of the area was available for collecting the x-ray fluorescence for XAS measurements. The simultaneous measurement of XRD and X-ray absorption near edge structure for Pr0.67Sr0.33MnO3 film was demonstrated as a proof of principle for future time-resolved pump-probe measurements. A static sample makes it easy to maintain an accurate overlap of the X-ray spot and laser pump beam. ",

However, several experimental reports have demonstrated self-propelled motion with the chemical reaction decreasing the interfacial tension.

In this process, we consider the concentrations of the reactant and product on the interface and of the reactant in the bulk. Our numerical calculations indicate that the droplet potentially moves in the cases of both an increase and a decrease in the interfacial tension.

However, these materials can contain ethanol, which disrupts the operation of humidity sensors. Previously, an indirect and problematic technique based on freezing-point depression measurements was needed to calculate the aw when ethanol was present. We now describe a rapid and accurate method to determine the aw of ethanol-containing samples at ambient temperatures. Disruption of sensor measurements was minimized by using a newly developed, alcohol-resistant humidity sensor fitted with an alcohol filter. Linear equations were derived from aw measurements of standard ethanol-water mixtures, and from Norrish's equation, to correct sensor measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first time that electronic sensors have been used to determine the aw of ethanol-containing samples. Copyright 1999 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Notably, the thermal conductivity shows a surprising increase of ≈3.1% with respect to pure water at dilute concentrations of ethanol (x = 0.025), which suggests a strengthening of H-bond network of water.

We consider the correlation effects between electrons and ions via classical and quantum static local field corrections. The numerical results show that the electron-ion pair distribution function at the origin approaches the maximum when the electron-electron coupling parameter equals unity. The classical result of the Coulomb logarithm is in agreement with the quantum result in both the weak (Γ_{ee}&lt;10^{-2}) and strong (Γ_{ee}&gt;1) electron-electron coupling ranges, whereas it deviates from the quantum result at intermediate values of the coupling parameter (10^{-2}&lt;Γ_{ee}&lt;1).

In addition, a simple fitting law ν_{ie}/ν_{ie}^{(0)}=a(ρ_{Be}/ρ_{0})^{b} is determined, where ν_{ie}^{(0)} is the relaxation rate corresponding to the normal metal density of Be and ρ_{0}, a, and b are the fitting parameters related to the temperature and the degree of ionization 〈Z〉 of the system.

It is found that heat conduction in the complex network is fundamentally different from that of regular lattices. It depends very sensitively on the average degrees of complex networks and the degrees of nodes that are attached to the two heat baths. For example, when the two heat source nodes have the same degree k_{0}, the heat flux reaches a maximum at an optimized value of k_{0} and decreases with the increase of the average degree 〈k〉. In other words, the source nodes with optimal degree k_{0} and the sparse network are more favorable to heat flux.

It is shown that the disorder distribution of internal energies is Gaussian, and the typical sample-to-sample fluctuations as well as the average value scale with the system size L like ∼Llnln(L). In contrast, the specific heat is shown to be self-averaging with a distribution function that tends to a δ peak in the thermodynamic limit L→∞.

In this work, we establish a theoretical model to investigate the effects of size and shape on the cohesive energies of free and embedded nanoparticles based on thermodynamic concepts. It is found that the cohesive energy of free nanoparticles usually decreases as its size decreases. However, there are two distinct variations of embedded nanoparticles in heterogeneous systems. One is that the cohesive energy decreases with the decreasing size, and the other is that the cohesive energy increases as size decreases. The present modeling results and predictions are very consistent with experiments and other existing theoretical models, implying that the model could be expected to be a general approach to understand the cohesive energy of nanomaterials.

Characterization of the local sample temperature and time-dependent response at both low and high temperature demonstrates a testing range of ∼90-475 K and steady-state drift rates less than 0.04 K/min. In situ operation of the tensile testing device employing resistively heated thermal actuators while imaging with an optical microscope enables high-resolution displacement measurements, from which stress-strain behavior of the nanoscale specimens is deduced. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in measuring the temperature dependence of tensile strength in nominally defect-free ⟨110⟩ Pd nanowhiskers.

In the last century, protein extracts of legume seeds were dialysed against distilled water and in some cases small crystals of pure protein appeared. However, those crystals were generally of poor quality with respect to X-ray diffraction. Recently, the crystallization of some of them was improved and the structures of two 7S globulins, phaseolin from Phaseolus vulgaris and canavalin from Canavalia ensiformis, have been determined at 3.0 and 2.6 A resolution, respectively. Efforts to improve the quality of the phaseolin crystals resulted in three new crystal forms which will be discussed in this paper. The only high-resolution X-ray analysis of a seed globulin from legumes is that of narbonin, a 2S protein from Vicia narbonensis. The crystal structure at 1.8 A shows a very compact packing in layers of molecules. The intermolecular contacts include salt bridges and hydrophobic clusters that might facilitate both the aggregation of the molecules and their crystallization. Because the seed globulins appear in large quantities in the protein bodies of the seeds, efficient packing of the molecules similar to the crystal packing can be assumed.",

The known crystal structures represent the most energetically stable packings found. The conformations of the enkephalin molecules in the crystal are not the most stable for an isolated molecule; i.e. intermolecular interactions force the isolated molecule to change conformation in order to achieve a small packing volume and an optimal packing energy in the crystal. It is found that the packing energy of an enkephalin molecule is a reasonably smooth function of its molecular volume in the unit cell, if structures with intermolecular hydrogen bonding are excluded, and is substantially independent of other details of the molecular conformation or of the crystal packing. Hydrogen bonding provides additional stabilization of the crystal structure, and would likely permit crystallization of the system if it is sufficiently dense.

In the presence of seeds with face- and body-centered cubic structures, we find that decreasing the seed-to-seed distance enhances the probability of the crystalline clusters formed on one of the seeds to grow beyond the critical size, thus, increasing the crystal nucleation rates. In contrast, when seeds have an icosahedral structure, the crystalline clusters form mostly in the bulk. The crystal nucleation rate, however, is also determined by the distance between the seeds with regular structure in which the lattice spacing is equal to the bulk lattice constant, pointing to a heterogeneous crystal nucleation that occurs away from the icosahedrally structured seeds. For slightly squeezed seeds, the effects of the presence of seeds with face- and body-centered cubic structures are reduced in comparison to the regular seeds, and we do not see any effect of the presence of the second seed for seeds with squeezed icosahedral structure.",

Using molecular simulation coupled with experiments we have uncovered the molecular processes that give rise to this autocatalytic behavior. The simulations reveal formation of molecular aggregates in solution, which on coming in contact with the surface of the seed undergo nucleation to form new crystallites. These crystallites are weakly bound to the crystal surface and can be readily sheared by fluid, making the seed surfaces available again to repeat the process. Further, the new crystallites on development can in turn serve as seeds. This mechanistic insight will enable better control in engineering crystalline products to design. ",

Using experimentally determined values for the apparent enthalpy and entropy of solution and the effects of a variety of low molecular weight solutes on crystallin solubility, the five classes can be arranged in order of the polarity of their solid phase intermolecular contacts as follows: gamma, high molecular weight beta greater than low molecular weight beta greater than high molecular weight alpha greater than alpha.

Here we use a colloidal model system, which not only allows us to quantitatively control the induced distortions but also to visualize and follow heterogeneous crystallization with single-particle resolution. We determine the sequence of intermediate structures by confocal microscopy and computer simulations, and develop a theoretical model that describes our findings. The crystallite first grows on the seed but then, on reaching a critical size, detaches from the seed.

Both the electron transverse momentum and energy are proportional to the normalized amplitude of laser field (a_{0}) for a fixed value of S.

The laser pulse propagates perpendicular to the magnetic field lines with the polarization chosen such that (E_{laser}·B_{*})=0. The focus of the work is on the electrons with an appreciable initial transverse momentum that are unable to gain significant energy from the laser in the absence of the magnetic field due to strong dephasing. It is shown that the magnetic field can initiate an energy increase by rotating such an electron, so that its momentum becomes directed forward. The energy gain continues well beyond this turning point where the dephasing drops to a very small value. In contrast to the case of purely vacuum acceleration, the electron experiences a rapid energy increases with the analytically derived maximum energy gain dependent on the strength of the magnetic field and the phase velocity of the wave. The energy enhancement by the magnetic field can be useful at high laser amplitudes, a_{0}≫1, where the acceleration similar to that in the vacuum is unable to produce energetic electrons over just tens of microns. A strong magnetic field helps leverage an increase in a_{0} without a significant increase in the interaction length.",

The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$. The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

The colored products are quantified spectrophotometrically at 525 and 520 nm for LD and CD, respectively. The optimization of the experimental conditions is described. The method has been used for the determination of $19.7$ - $69.0$ and $18.1$ - $54.3$ $\\mu$ g mL ${}^{-1}$ of LD and CD, respectively. The accuracy of the method is achieved by the values of recovery ( $100\\pm 0.2$ %) and the precision is supported by the low standard deviation (SD $=0.17$ - $0.59$ ) and relative standard deviation (CV $=0.4$ %- $1.54$ %) values. The second method is based on the formation of ion-pair iodinated inner sphere or outer sphere colored complexes between the LD and triiodide ions at pH 5 and room temperature ( $23\\pm 3^\\circ$ C). This method has been used for the determination of LD within the concentration range $39.44$ - $78.88$ $\\mu$ g mL ${}^{-1}$ with SD $=0.22$ - $0.24$ and recovery percent $=100 \\pm 0.3$ %.

The transferred angular momentum increases almost linearly with the acceleration time t_{a} when the electrons are resonantly accelerated by the laser field. In addition, it is shown analytically that the averaged angular momentum of electrons is proportional to the laser amplitude a_{L}, and the total angular momentum of the accelerated electron beam is proportional to the square of the laser amplitude a_{L}^{2} for a fixed parameter of n_{e}/n_{c}a_{L}. These results are verified by three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations.

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

Here we report a new transition pathway for graphite to diamond under compression combined with shear, based on results from both theoretical simulations and advanced experiments. In contrast to the known model for thermally activated diamond formation under pressure, the shear-induced diamond formation takes place during the decompression process via structural transitions. At a high pressure with large shear, graphite transforms into ultrastrong sp^{3} phases whose structures depend on the degree of shear stress. These metastable sp^{3} phases transform into either diamond or graphite upon decompression. Our results explain several recent experimental observations of low-temperature diamond formation.

Computational Simulation and Experimental Observation.\nThe common opinion that diamond is the stiffest material is disproved by a number of experimental studies where the fabrication of carbon materials based on polymerized fullerenes with outstanding mechanical stiffness was reported. Here we investigated the nature of this unusual effect. We present a model constituted of compressed polymerized fullerite clusters implemented in a diamond matrix with bulk modulus B0 much higher than that of diamond. The calculated B0 value depends on the sizes of both fullerite grain and diamond environment and shows close correspondence with measured data. Additionally, we provide results of experimental study of atomic structure and mechanical properties of ultrahard carbon material supported the presented model. ",

In the seawater the thermal blooming becomes more severe for the wavelength corresponding to the higher absorption coefficient. Furthermore, both the behavior of the thermal blooming effect and the main factor dominating the thermal blooming effect in the shallow sea region are different from those in the deep sea region. In the shallow sea region, the dependence of the thermal blooming on the depth is not monotonic as the time increases. However, in the deep sea region, the thermal blooming effect becomes more severe monotonously as the depth increases.

The resulting contribution of Raman scattering is then compared with experimental measurements of the water-leaving radiance, and the fractional contribution of radiance produced by Raman scattering to the total radiance measured at a given wavelength is determined. The results show that (1) the contribution of Raman scattering to the water-leaving radiance in an ocean of pure seawater is as much as 50-100% larger than earlier predictions, and (2) the Raman contribution does not decay as rapidly with increasing concentrations of chlorophyllouslike pigments C as predicted earlier.

The larger the solar-zenith angle, the less the downward solar irradiance just beneath the ocean surface (i.e., more photons are reflected by the ocean surface), leading to a reduced value of the radiance that is backscattered out of the ocean.

In unlighted water, the MTF decreased relatively slowly with increasing path length and spatial frequency up to 150 c/deg. We interpret this as the result of low-angle forward scattering of light from the target. For diffusely lighted water, the MTF fell much more rapidly with path length, but was nearly independent of spatial frequency. Here, scattering of ambient light into the light path contributes an additional veiling glare or path radiance, which is independent of spatial frequency but degrades the MTF strongly with increasing path length. These scattering processes are independent of wavelength in the visible spectrum. The modulation transfer properties of these waters do not preclude high aquatic visual acuity. However, the useful range of high acuity vision in diffusely lighted water is much less than for unlighted water. This places special requirements upon the design of high-acuity aquatic eyes.",

The colored products are quantified spectrophotometrically at 525 and 520 nm for LD and CD, respectively. The optimization of the experimental conditions is described.

The accuracy of the method is achieved by the values of recovery ( $100\\pm 0.2$ %) and the precision is supported by the low standard deviation (SD $=0.17$ - $0.59$ ) and relative standard deviation (CV $=0.4$ %- $1.54$ %) values.

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

The model encompasses direct intermolecular interactions as well as through-metal interactions and can be solved exactly to yield spectral properties (surface density of states) and transport characteristics (transmission coefficients and current-voltage behavior) for single-molecule junctions and molecular layers. The model is applied to analyzing the effect of intermolecular interactions on the predicted negative differential resistance in metal-molecule-semiconductor junctions (recently observed in scanning tunneling microscopy studies of adsorbates on Si(100)).",

In the model there are two unknown functions: One is $\\sigma(r,t)$ which is the nutrient concentration at time $t$ and radius $r$, and the other one is $R(t)$ which is the outer tumor radius at time $t$. Since $R(t)$ is unknown and varies with time, this problem has a free boundary. Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$.

A model is constructed for the simple case when the source is held constant with respect to time, the decay proportional to the concentration and the diffusion coefficient a constant. From simulation we find a (best) value for the decay constant to be 6 x 10(-5)/sec and for the diffusion constant to be 0.24 x 10(-6) cm2/sec.

The power of this method lies in its simplicity, which allows one to determine D(T) independently of the diffusive model. The results obtained are in very good agreement with those of field gradient NMR methods.",

Since $R(t)$ is unknown and varies with time, this problem has a free boundary. Assume $\\alpha(t)$ is the rate at which the tumor attracts blood vessels and the Gibbs-Thomson relation is considered for the concentration of nutrient at outer boundary of the tumor, so that on the outer boundary, the condition $$\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial r}+\\alpha(t)\\left(\\sigma-N(t)\\right)=0,~~r=R(t)$$ holds, where $N(t)=\\bar{\\sigma}\\left(1-\\dfrac{\\gamma}{R(t)}\\right)H(R(t))$ is derived from Gibbs-Thomson relation. $H(\\cdot)$ is smooth on $(0,\\infty)$ satisfying $H(x)=0$ if $x\\leq \\gamma$, $H(x)=1$ if $x\\geq 2\\gamma$ and $0\\leq H'(x)\\leq 2/\\gamma$ for all $x\\geq 0$.

The metal overlayer is considered in two different structures: where Ag-Ag distances are equal to the value in the bulk solid, and for a slightly expanded lattice in which the Ag-Ag distances are equal to the O-O distance on the MgO(100) surface. The calculated adsorption energy of Ag(100) on MgO(100) is 0.58 eV per Ag interfacial atom; the Ag-O distance is 2.28 A. A small transfer of electrons from MgO to Ag occurs on deposition of the silver overlayer. CO adsorption at an atop Ag site is found to be the most stable for adsorption on the two-layer Ag film and also for adsorption on Ag deposited on the oxide; CO adsorption energies range from 0.12 to 0.19 eV. The CO adsorption energy is reduced for the Ag/MgO system compared to adsorption on the unsupported metal film thereby providing evidence for a direct electronic effect of the oxide support at the metal overlayer surface.

This value decreases to 0.0 for the saturated solution of 21 mol % metal, as all ammonia molecules have then become incorporated into the tetrahedral first solvation spheres of the lithium cations.

By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we find the long-range CDW order is always persisting, and the metallization is instead associated with additional in-gap excitations. Interestingly, the in-gap excitation is near the top of the lower Hubbard band, in contrast to a conventional electron-doped Mott insulator where it is beneath the upper Hubbard band.

Still debated is whether localization occurs via \"trap-digging\", in which the electron carves out a suitable localization site, or by \"trap-seeking\", where the electron prefers to localize at pre-existing low-energy trap sites in solution. To distinguish between these two possible mechanisms, we study the localization dynamics of excess electrons in aqueous NaCl solutions using both ultrafast spectroscopy and mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations. By introducing pre-existing traps in the form of Na<sup+</sup ions, we can use the cation-induced blue-shift of the hydrated electron's absorption spectrum to directly monitor the site of electron localization. Our experimental and computational results show that the electron prefers to localize directly at the sites of Na<sup+</sup traps; the presence of concentrated electrolytes otherwise has little impact on the way trap-seeking hydrated electrons relax following injection.",

This question has not yet been answered satisfactorily. To answer it, we have developed an ab initio potential energy surface (PES) for this dimer at the limits of the current computational capabilities and performed essentially exact six-dimensional calculations of the vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) spectra of NH<sub3</sub-NH<sub3</sub and ND<sub3</sub-ND<sub3</sub, obtaining an unprecedented agreement with experimental spectra. In agreement with other recent electronic structure calculations, the global minimum on the PES is in a substantially bent hydrogen-bonded configuration. Since the bottom of the PES is exceptionally flat, the dimer is extremely fluxional and the probability of finding it in configurations that are not hydrogen bonded is high. Nevertheless, the probability of hydrogen-bonded configurations is large enough to consider the ammonia dimer to be hydrogen bonded. We also show that NFK's inference that the ammonia dimer is nearly rigid actually results from unusual cancellations between quantum effects that generate differences in spectra of different isotopologues.",

As an archetypal hydrogen-bonded system, the properties of ammonia under pressure are of fundamental interest, and compressed ammonia has a significant role in planetary physics. We predict new high-pressure crystalline phases of ammonia (NH(3)) through a computational search based on first-principles density-functional-theory calculations. Ammonia is known to form hydrogen-bonded solids, but we predict that at higher pressures it will form ammonium amide ionic solids consisting of alternate layers of NH(4)(+) and NH(2)(-) ions. These ionic phases are predicted to be stable over a wide range of pressures readily obtainable in laboratory experiments. The occurrence of ionic phases is rationalized in terms of the relative ease of forming ammonium and amide ions from ammonia molecules, and the volume reduction on doing so. We also predict that the ionic bonding cannot be sustained under extreme compression and that, at pressures beyond the reach of current static-loading experiments, ammonia will return to hydrogen-bonded structures consisting of neutral NH(3) molecules.",

Experiments show a special stability for the cluster ion that contains four ammonias: {C(6)H(6)(NH(3))(4)}(+). Calculations provide evidence that the first ammonia forms a weak dative bond to the cyclohexadienyl radical cation, {C(6)H(6)-NH(3)}(+), where there is a transfer of electrons from ammonia to benzene. Additional solvating ammonia molecules form stabilizing hydrogen bonds to the ring-bound ammonia {C(6)H(6)-NH(3)}(+).(NH(3))(n), which cause cooperative changes in the structure of the cluster complex. Free ammonia is a weak hydrogen bond donor, but electron transfer from NH(3) to the benzene ring that strengthens the dative bond will increase the hydrogen acidity and the strength of the cluster hydrogen bonds to the added ammonia. A progressive \"tightening\" of this dative bond is observed upon addition of the first, second, and third ammonia to give a cluster stabilized by three N-(+)H x N hydrogen bonds.

The nanoring system can be driven to rotate by fixed outer nanotubes at room temperature. When placing some atoms at the edge of each outer tube (the stator here) with inwardly radial deviation (IRD), the IRD atoms will repulse the nanoring in their thermally vibration-induced collision and drive the nanoring to rotate when the repulsion due to IRD and the friction with stators induce a non-zero moment about the axis of rotational symmetry of the ring. As such, the nanoring can act as a wheel in a nanovehicle. When the repulsion is balanced with the intertubular friction, a stable rotational frequency (SRF) of the rotor is achieved. The results from the molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the nanowheel can work at extremely low temperature and its rotational speed can be adjusted by tuning temperature.",

We provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We find that due to the layer rotations, the spinors are modified in such way that a repulsive interaction becomes attractive in certain directions. We also find that due to rotations the nodal points become angle dependent. The spinor in layer $ i=2 $ depends on the twisting angle in contrast to the spinor in layer $i=1$. As a result, the physics in the two layers depends on the twist and is identified with a twisted phase. In order to observe the twist we use an interaction term which changes sign. The change from a repulsive interaction to an attractive one gives rise to a one dimensional charge-density-wave. Due to tunneling between the two layers, the proximity of layer $i=1$ induces superconductivity in the charge-density-wave phase in layer $i=2$. This result is obtained by following a sequence of steps: when layer $2$ is rotated by an angle $\\theta$, this rotation is equivalent to a rotation of an angle $-\\theta$ of the linear momentum. Due to the discrete lattice, in layer $1$ the Fourier transform conserves the linear momentum $modulo$ the hexagonal reciprocal lattice vector. In layer $2$, due to the rotation, the linear momentum is conserved $modulo$ the {\\it Moir\\'e} reciprocal lattice vector. Periodicity is achieved at the $magic $ angles obtained from the condition of commensuration of the two lattices.",

Results from time-dependent Hartree-Fock and time-dependent random-phase approximation calculations are compared for 13 systems over a broad range of energies. The timescale for full mass equilibration (∼2×10^{-20}  s) is found to be much larger than timescales for neutron-to-proton equilibration, kinetic energy, and angular momentum dissipations which are on the order of 10^{-21}  s.

These long lifetimes may be observed if the long-lived singlet states are prevented from mixing with rapidly relaxing triplet states. In this paper we provide the detailed theory of an experiment which uses magnetic field cycling to observe slow singlet relaxation. An approximate expression is given for the magnetic field dependence of the singlet relaxation rate constant, using a model of intramolecular dipole-dipole couplings and fluctuating external random fields.",

Our evaluation of the infinite-frequency limit of sound velocity, c_{infinity}, matches with the results obtained in the high momentum transfer limit by inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering. These results strongly support the viscoelastic interpretation of the dynamics of water.

The fundamental expression of $D$D is an improper integral. We show that a change of variable, also used to calculate the astronomical refraction, usually gives a well-behaved integral. In a spherically symmetric atmosphere, this happens when the refraction coefficient exceeds unity on the entire ray, producing a hillingar effect (alias strong looming for an erect image) or superior mirages. We then find a nice expression of ${{{\\rm d}D}/{{\\rm d}{\\alpha _S}}}$dD/dα<subS</sub, which is usually negative. Inverted images (i.e., mirages in the strict sense) show up when ${{{\\rm d}D}/{{\\rm d}{\\alpha _S}}}$dD/dα<subS</sub is positive; for this, we find a necessary condition in each atmospheric model.

Both the electron transverse momentum and energy are proportional to the normalized amplitude of laser field (a_{0}) for a fixed value of S. As a result, the total number of radiated photons scales as a_{0}^{2}/sqrt[S] and the energy conversion efficiency of photons from the accelerated electrons scales as a_{0}^{3}/S.

The focus here is on the case of gravitational scattering of a scalar field mediated by the exchange of virtual Hawking gravitons from a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. Our result is obtained in the context of a worldline effective field theory for the black hole and is valid in the semiclassical limit where the Schwarzschild radius r_{s} is larger than the Planck length 1/m_{Pl}. In addition, we assume that four-momentum exchange q is smaller than r_{s}^{-1} and that the incoming particle has energy larger then the black hole's Hawking temperature. The inelastic cross section we obtain is a new, leading-order quantum gravity effect, arising at the same order in q^{2}/m_{Pl}^{2} as the well-understood one-loop graviton vacuum polarization corrections to gravitational scattering between massive particles.",

This inversion yields internally consistent 0 K enthalpies of formation for the species of the network. The refinement takes advantage of the fact that the accuracy of computed enthalpies depends strongly on the quantum-chemical protocol employed for their determination. Different protocols suffer from different sources of error; thus, the reaction enthalpies computed by them have \"random\" residual errors. Since it is much more natural for quantum-chemical energy and enthalpy results, including reaction enthalpies, to be based on the electronic ground states of the atoms and not on the historically preferred elemental states, and since these two possible protocols can be converted into each other straightforwardly, it is proposed that first-principles thermochemistry should employ the ground electronic states of atoms. In this scheme, called atom-based thermochemistry (AT), the enthalpy of formation of a gaseous compound corresponds simply to the total atomization energy of the species; it is always positive, and it reflects the bonding strength within the molecule. The inversion protocol developed and based on AT is termed NEAT, which represents the fact that the protocol proceeds from a network of computed reaction enthalpies toward atom-based thermochemistry, most directly to atom-based enthalpies of formation. After assembling a database that consisted of 361 ab initio reactions and reaction enthalpies involving 188 species, collected from 31 literature sources, the following dependable 0 K atom-based enthalpies of formation, Delta(f)${H{{{\\rm AT}\\hfill \\atop 0\\hfill}}}$, all in kJ mol(-1), have been obtained by means of NEAT: H(2)=432.07(0), CH=334.61(15), NH=327.69(25), OH=425.93(21), HF=566.13(31), CO=1072.08(28), O(2)=493.51(34), CH(2)=752.40(21), H(2)O=918.05(20), HO(2)=694.53(32), CO(2)=1597.77(40), CH(3)=1209.64(29), NH(3)=1157.44(33), C(2)H(2)=1625.78(40), and CH(4)=1641.68(40), in which the uncertainty values given in parentheses represent 95 % confidence intervals. The average deviation of these values from the well-established active thermochemical tables (ATcT) values is a mere 0.25 kJ mol(-1), with a maximum deviation of 0.7 kJ mol(-1).

Here we report a new transition pathway for graphite to diamond under compression combined with shear, based on results from both theoretical simulations and advanced experiments. In contrast to the known model for thermally activated diamond formation under pressure, the shear-induced diamond formation takes place during the decompression process via structural transitions. At a high pressure with large shear, graphite transforms into ultrastrong sp^{3} phases whose structures depend on the degree of shear stress. These metastable sp^{3} phases transform into either diamond or graphite upon decompression. Our results explain several recent experimental observations of low-temperature diamond formation. They also emphasize the importance of shear stress for diamond formation, providing new insight into the graphite-diamond transformation mechanism.",

Rate constant calculations are made feasible by employing a Monte Carlo based sampling procedure. The QM C probabilities alone are also used to estimate the high pressure CH + H(2) rate constants corresponding to stabilization or CH(3) formation. The rate constants for CH + H(2) --&gt; CH(2) + H reaction in the low pressure limit are obtained by combining the QM C probabilities with a phase space theory (PST) approximation for product formation from the complex. Our results are compared with the experimental results of Brownsword et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 1997, 106, 7662), as well as with purely classical PST calculations. The QM C probabilities are shown to be highly dependent on the initial rotational states of the reactants corresponding to orientational restrictions on complex formation. Consistent with this, our QM C high pressure rate constants for CH(3) formation are lower than the purely classical PST rate constants. These QM C rate constants also are in reasonable accord with experiment. A similar but somewhat more subtle picture emerges regarding the QM C/PST rate constants for CH(2) + H formation.",

The standard (p° = 0.1 MPa) molar enthalpies of formation in the liquid phase of these compounds were derived from the standard molar energies of combustion, in oxygen, at T = 298.15 K, measured by rotating bomb combustion calorimetry. A static method was used to perform the vapor pressure study of the referred compounds allowing the construction of the phase diagrams and determination of the respective triple point coordinates, as well as the standard molar enthalpies of vaporization, sublimation, and fusion for two of the isomers (2,4-DFNB and 3,4-DFNB). For 2,5-difluoronitrobenzene, only liquid vapor pressures were measured enabling the determination of the standard molar enthalpies of vaporization. Combining the thermodynamic parameters of the compounds studied, the following standard (p° = 0.1 MPa) molar enthalpies of formation in the gaseous phase, at T = 298.15 K, were derived: Δ(f)H(m)° (2,4-DFNB, g) = -(296.3 ± 1.8) kJ · mol⁻¹, Δ(f)H(m)° (2,5-DFNB, g) = -(288.2 ± 2.1) kJ · mol⁻¹, and Δ(f)H(m)° (3,4-DFNB, g) = -(302.4 ± 2.1) kJ · mol⁻¹.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P &lt; 10-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P &gt; 0.076) in all groups, as expected.

The relationship between variance ($ \\sigma^{2} $) and mean expression ($ \\mu $) is of paramount importance for investigations into the evolutionary origins and consequences of noise in gene expression. It is often formulated as $ \\log \\left({{{\\sigma}^{2}}}/{{{\\mu}^{2}}}\\; \\right) = \\beta\\log\\mu+\\log\\alpha $, where $ \\beta $ is a key parameter since its sign determines the qualitative dependence of noise on mean. We reveal that the sign of $ \\beta $ is controlled completely by external regulation, but independent of promoter structure. Specifically, it is negative if regulators as stochastic variables are independent but positive if they are correlated. The essential mechanism revealed here can well interpret diverse experimental phenomena underlying expression noise. Our results imply that external regulation rather than promoter sequence governs the mean-noise relationship.",

For materials satisfying the Moss rule, the number of independent ${\\beta \\_{{\\rm do}}}$β_do parameters decreases down to five.

These calculations are more difficult than the calculation of transformed thermodynamic properties from species properties, and they are an application of the inverse Legendre transform. The Delta(f)G degrees values of species of a reactant can be calculated from an apparent equilibrium constant if the Delta(f)G degrees values are known for all the species of all the other reactants and the pKs of the reactant of interest are known. The Delta(f)H degrees of species of a reactant can be calculated from the heat of reaction if the Delta(f)H degrees values are known for all species of the other reactants and Delta(f)G degrees values are known for all species in the reaction.

The inverse Legendre transformation is accomplished by using computer programs to set up the simultaneous equations that involve the Delta(f)H degrees of the species and solving them.

It is especially difficult for RF transmission due to its requirement on both the length and the depth of the ${\\rm{B}}_{1}^{{\\rm + }}$ field. One solution is to use a long dipole to provide continuous current distribution. The drawback is the natural falloff of the ${\\rm{B}}_{1}$ field toward the ends of the dipole, therefore the ${\\rm{B}}_{1}^{{\\rm + }}$ per unit square root of maximum specific absorption rate ${\\rm{(B}}_{1}^{{\\rm + }}{\\rm{/ \\surd SAR}}_{{\\rm{max}}})$ performance is particularly poor toward the end of the dipole. In this study, a segmented element design using forced-current excitation and a switching circuit is presented. The design provides long FOV when desired and allows flexible FOV switching and power distribution without additional power amplifiers. Different element types and arrangements were explored and a segmented dipole design was chosen as the best design. The segmented dipole was implemented and tested on the bench and with a phantom on a 7T whole body scanner. The switchable mode dipole enabled a large FOV in the long mode and improved ${\\rm{B}}_{1}^{{\\rm + }}{\\rm{/ \\surd SAR}}_{{\\rm{max}}}$ efficiency in a smaller FOV in the short mode.",

Two parameters, the proportion $p$ of asymptomatic infected individuals and the proportion $k$ of asymptomatic infectious individuals who can asymptomatically transmit diseases, play major rules in the epidemic dynamics.

These nuclei owe their enhanced stability to closed shells in the structure of both protons and neutrons. However, theoretical approaches to date do not yield consistent predictions of the precise limits of the 'island of stability'; experimental studies are therefore crucial. The bulk of experimental effort so far has been focused on the direct creation of superheavy elements in heavy ion fusion reactions, leading to the production of elements up to proton number Z = 118 (refs 4, 5). Recently, it has become possible to make detailed spectroscopic studies of nuclei beyond fermium (Z = 100), with the aim of understanding the underlying single-particle structure of superheavy elements. Here we report such a study of the nobelium isotope 254No, with 102 protons and 152 neutrons--the heaviest nucleus studied in this manner to date. We find three excited structures, two of which are isomeric (metastable). One of these structures is firmly assigned to a two-proton excitation. These states are highly significant as their location is sensitive to single-particle levels above the gap in shell energies predicted at Z = 114, and thus provide a microscopic benchmark for nuclear models of the superheavy elements.",

This arises from the much shorter lifetime of non-radiative recombination than radiative recombination, wherein photo-carriers tend to decay through non-radiative processes. Herein, a \"molecular state\" near the valence band is successfully introduced into the ${{\\rm MoS}_2}$ monolayer to increase the density of radiative states and speed up the exciton relaxation. This reduces the recombination lifetime of excitons by two orders of magnitude and forms vigorous competition with non-radiative decays. As a consequence, dozens of times enhancement of PL in ${{\\rm MoS}_2}$ monolayers under high excitation power (${\\rm G}\\sim{{10}^{19}}\\;{{\\rm cm}^{- 2}}\\cdot{{\\rm S}^{- 1}}$) is realized.

We prove that in the macroscopic limit by merely allowing the molecular numbers to be infinite, the generalized mesoscopic free energy F^{(meso)} converges to φ^{ss}, the large deviation rate function for the stationary distributions. This generalized macroscopic free energy φ^{ss} now satisfies a balance equation dφ^{ss}(x)/dt=cmf(x)-σ(x), in which x represents chemical concentration. The chemical motive force cmf(x) and entropy production rate σ(x) are both non-negative, and cmf(x)≤σ(x). The balance equation is valid generally in isothermal driven systems and is different from mechanical energy conservation and the first law; it is actually an unknown form of the second law. Consequences of the emergent thermodynamic quantities and equalities are further discussed. The emergent \"law\" is independent of underlying kinetic details.

To improve the accuracy and reliability of our calculations, we combine seeding with the direct computation of the ice-solution interfacial free energy at coexistence using the Mold Integration method. We compare the results with previous simulation work on pure water to understand the effect caused by the solute. The model captures the experimental trend that the nucleation rate at a given supercooling decreases when adding salt. Despite the fact that the thermodynamic driving force for ice nucleation is higher for salty water for a given supercooling, the nucleation rate slows down with salt due to a significant increase of the ice-fluid interfacial free energy. The salty water model predicts an ice nucleation rate that is in good agreement with experimental measurements, bringing confidence in the predictive ability of the model.

An explicit treatment of continuum effects is found to be indispensable. We study the sensitivity of the ^{11}Be spectrum to the details of the three-nucleon force and demonstrate that only certain chiral interactions are capable of reproducing the parity inversion. With such interactions, the extremely large E1 transition between the bound states is reproduced. We compare our photodisintegration calculations to conflicting experimental data and predict a distinct dip around the 3/2_{1}^{-} resonance energy.

Variation of bulk viscosity with temperature is reported in the above-mentioned temperature range and is found to be in a reasonably good agreement with the data available in the literature. Furthermore, variation of bulk viscosity with pressure and volumetric expansion rate is obtained. A weak linear dependency of bulk viscosity with pressure is observed, which increases with temperature.

Here we develop a mathematical model that uses compliance values for the alveoli and upper airspaces, estimated from the literature, to predict volumes of the respiratory system at depth. Any compressibility of the upper airways decreases the volume to contain alveolar air yielding lung collapse pressures 2x that calculated assuming an incompressible upper airway. A simple relationship with alveolar volume was used to predict relative pulmonary shunt at depth. The results from our model agree with empirical data on gas absorption at depth as well as the degree of tracheal compression in forced and free diving mammals.",

The neutron fields considered are monoenergetic neutrons (1 keV-14 MeV) and ISO reference neutron sources 241Am-Be, 241Am-B, 252Cf and 252Cf + D2O. Based on the energy deposited in the gas cavities (tissue-equivalent (TE) propane and H2) of the TEPC, density scaling correction, ${f}_{\\rho }$, to be applied on H2 gas to achieve tissue-equivalence is calculated for the above sources at 1μm site size. The calculated value of ${f}_{\\rho }$ for the ISO-neutron sources is 0.40, which suggests that energy deposition in the gas cavities is predominantly due to crossers. In the case of monoenergetic neutrons, depending upon the energy, ${f}_{\\rho }$ is in the range of 0.11-0.45. The study shows that the TE propane and H2-based microdosimetric distributions are comparable when the density of H2 is scaled appropriately. Mean quality factor $\\overline{Q}$ calculated based on microdosimetric distribution increases initially with neutron energy up to 100 keV and thereafter decreases with energy. Depending upon the neutron energy, TE propane and H2-based $\\overline{Q}$ values are comparable to within 3-15%, and for the ISO sources, the comparison is within 5-8%. For the ISO neutron sources, $\\overline{Q}$ values are in the range of ~10-15.",

The simulation could not be carried to long enough times for the shrinking to reach C60, but they propose reasonably that this shrinking process ultimately forms buckminsterfullerene. However, these simulations do not reveal the force driving the shrinking process. Here, this driving force for shrinking is found to be reactions in which C2 is swapped between fullerenes. The key element is that for typical fullerenes the equilibrium constants for such C2 interchanges are near unity, resulting in expansion of the breadth of the fullerene distribution in an annealing process. When fullerenes of 60 or 70 atoms are populated by shrinking, they fall into the local energy minimum of buckminsterfullerene or D5h C70.

Models of this kind were applied firstly to aliphatic hydrocarbons, secondly to both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, thirdly to a wide range of non-hydrogen-bonding molecules, and finally to a set of 226 organic compounds including 70 containing hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors.

The success of such a simple model implies that the enthalpy of sublimation can be predicted accurately without knowledge of the crystal packing.

On the other hand, the atomistic model takes into account a discrete nature of all the atoms of C(60) explicitly. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble at normal temperature and pressure.

In addition the maxima of electron densities are higher in the [6,6] bonds than in the [5,6] bonds-an important finding with respect to the question of the extent of electron delocalization in fullerenes.",

Optical excitation occurs to excitons whose binding energies decrease with increasing nanotube diameter, and are smaller than the binding energy of an isolated strand of poly-(paraphenylene vinylene). The ratio of the energy of the second optical exciton polarized along the nanotube axis to that of the lowest exciton is smaller than the value predicted within single-particle theory. The experimentally observed weak photoluminescence is an intrinsic feature of semiconducting nanotubes.",
