Mapping Oscillator Strength across Molecular Absorption Spectra.\nThe effectiveness of solar energy capture and conversion materials derives from their ability to absorb light and to transform the excitation energy into energy stored in free carriers or chemical bonds. The Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule mandates that the integrated (electronic) oscillator strength of an absorber equals the total number of electrons in the structure. Typical molecular chromophores place only about 1% of their oscillator strength in the UV-vis window, so individual chromophores operate at about 1% of their theoretical limit. We explore the distribution of oscillator strength as a function of excitation energy to understand this circumstance. To this aim, we use familiar independent-electron model Hamiltonians as well as first-principles electronic structure methods. While model Hamiltonians capture the qualitative electronic spectra associated with \u03c0 electron chromophores, these Hamiltonians mistakenly focus the oscillator strength in the fewest low-energy transitions. Advanced electronic structure methods, in contrast, spread the oscillator strength over a very wide excitation energy range, including transitions to Rydberg and continuum states, consistent with experiment. Our analysis rationalizes the low oscillator strength in the UV-vis spectral region in molecules, a step toward the goal of oscillator strength manipulation and focusing. ",

While the backbone of proteins strongly absorbs at wavelengths shorter than 250 nm (corresponding to photon energies higher than 5 eV), some amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) and nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil) and the corresponding nucleosides/nucleotides show intense absorption bands at longer deep UV (DUV) wavelengths, between 250 and 300 nm (photon energies between 4 and 5 eV). These bands correspond to the pp* transitions of the aromatic rings within these molecules, which are clearly separated from their backbone absorption. Other important molecular cofactors, such as \ue104avins, plastoquinones, thiobases and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, display absorption bands at even longer near UV (NUV) wavelengths (300-400 nm, corresponding to 3.2-4 eV photon energies). In addition, UV absorbing molecules are typically small enough to enable highly accurate computations of their energy level structure and dynamics, allowing the effective benchmarking of computational approaches with experiments. 17,18 This multitude of spectroscopic targets makes 2DES spectroscopy in the UV region (2DUV) a powerful investigation tool for the photophysics and photochemistry of biomolecular processes.",

The model predicts six electronic states in C 2v symmetry, although transitions to the state of A 2 symmetry are electric dipole forbidden. 15 The intense long wavelength band is assigned to two overlapping bands centered at 312 and 286 nm, both of B 1 symmetry. The weaker feature at 250 nm is attributed to unresolved transitions to B 2 and A 1 states. A state of A 1 symmetry is responsible for the intense short wavelength absorption band at 214 nm. Subsequent magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements, however, suggest that the first absorption band corresponds to excitation to states of B 1 and B 2 symmetry and identify the state responsible for the band at 248 nm as A 1 . 16 The MCD measurements also reveal a weak shoulder near the long-wavelength onset of the first absorption band that was attributed to a nominally forbidden transition, most probably a triplet state. 16 Electronic structure calculations on CH 2 I 2 are limited and the predicted electronic state symmetries disagree with the exciton model. Zheng and Phillips used time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to characterize the first five singlet (and triplet) excited electronic states, resulting in assignments that agree with the interpretation of the MCD experiments. 17 More recent calculations have characterized the electronic states using the CASPT2 method 18 and TD-DFT, 19 although only the former study included spin-orbit coupling. Unsurprisingly for a molecule with two iodine atoms many of the excited states have strongly mixed singlet and triplet character. An apparent discrepancy between the CASPT2 and earlier TD-DFT results in the identification of the excited valence states can be attributed to the choice of coordinate system, which switches the B 1 and B 2 labels. Here we adopt the convention established first, in which the C 2 symmetry axis is defined as the z-axis and the y-axis is normal to the heavy atom plane.",

N is considered a quantum number and can be constant and take on only whole integer values. A transition where n=1 is known as a fundamental absorption. These fundamental absorptions are about 100 times less energetic in the NIR region and less energetic means longer wavelength. When n is greater than 1, the transition is known as an overtone. By looking at Equation 2, it is evident that as n increases, the energy to be absorbed also increases. This in turn indicates that shorter wavelengths will need to be absorbed. These absorptions generally occur in the NIR region. Equation 2 predicts fairly well the absorptions of two atoms bonded together (called diatomic molecules), but does not take into account all of the surrounding effects for polyatomic (many atom) molecules, such as overlapping absorption bands or hydrogen bonding. Organic molecules exist in energy states that absorb NIR wavelengths (energies). Metals, such as silver, lead, and most inorganics, cannot absorb NIR light because they have electrons incapable of absorbing NIR wavelengths, therefore there is no interaction to measure. Generally, only organic molecules can absorb wavelengths in the NIR region. It is actually the energy state of a molecule which allows us to perform a measurement with NIR. Now imagine a sample made up of many, many electrons, protons and neutrons. These particles are arranged into atoms, and further into molecules. The sample can be made of different types of molecules, meaning there can be water molecules, protein molecules and so on.

The number of photons absorbed is proportional to the amount of particular type of molecule present in the sample.

The resulting value was not zero and had sign opposite to that of the proton. By the late 1930s accurate values for the magnetic moment of the proton had been measured by the Rabi group using newly developed nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The large value for the proton's magnetic moment and the inferred negative value for the neutron's magnetic moment were unexpected and raised many questions.

Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the last electron added enters an $s$ or a $p$ orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in Figure 3.29. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons for main group elements are those with the highest $n$ level. For example, gallium ( Ga , atomic number 31) has the electron configuration $[\\operatorname{Ar}] 4 s^{2} 3 d^{10} 4 p^{1}$, which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The completely filled $d$ orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons.\n2. Transition elements or transition metals. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added enters a $d$ orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these elements include the $n s$ and $(n-1) d$ electrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements specifies those with partially filled $d$ orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg , as well as $\\mathrm{Cu}, \\mathrm{Ag}$, and Au in Figure 3.29) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer to the entire $d$ block (colored yellow in Figure 3.29), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook.\n3. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an $f$ orbital. They are shown in green in Figure 3.29. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the $(n-2) f$, the $(n-1) d$, and the $n s$ subshells. There are two inner transition series:\na. The lanthanide series: lanthanum (La) through lutetium (Lu)\nb.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

The energy levels of the two particles are similar to that of the hydrogen atom (which is a bound state of a proton and an electron).

Annihilation basics\n\nThe process of electron-positron annihilation is described by quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the nonrelativistic Born approximation, the cross section for annihilation into two photons averaged over the electron and positron spins is (Berestetskii et al., 1982) \n\u03c3 2\u03b3 = \u03c0r 2 0 c v ,(4)\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the two particles. This cross section obeys the 1/v threshold law which describes inelastic collisions with fast particles in the final state (Landau and Lifshitz, 1977). The two-photon annihilation described by Eq. (4) is allowed only when the total spin S of the electron-positron pair is zero. For S = 1 the smallest possible number of annihilation photons is three. The corresponding spinaveraged cross section is (Berestetskii et al., 1982) \n\u03c3 3\u03b3 = 4 3 (\u03c0 2 \u2212 9)\u03b1r 2 0 c v ,(5)\nwhere \u03b1 = e 2 / c (in cgs units) is the fine structure constant, \u03b1 \u2248 1/137. Since \u03c3 3\u03b3 is 400 times smaller than \u03c3 2\u03b3 , positron annihilation in many-electron systems is dominated by the two-gamma process. Numerically, the cross section in Eq. (4) is \u03c3 2\u03b3 \u223c 10 \u22128 c/v a.u. 5 Hence the annihilation rate is usually much smaller than the rates for other atomic collision processes, even at low positron velocities (e.g., thermal, v \u223c 0.05 a.u. at 300 K). When a fast positron, such as that emitted in a \u03b2 + decay, moves through matter, it loses energy quickly through collisions, first by direct ionization, positronium formation and electronic excitation, and then by vibrational excitation and elastic collisions. As a result, the positrons typically slow to thermal energies (i.e., \u223c 25 meV for T = 300 K) before annihilation.",

In quantum mechanics, this emission must be in quanta of light, of frequencies consisting of integer multiples of 1/T, so that classical mechanics is an approximate description at large quantum numbers.

For example, the valence electron configuration of 2p 2 for the carbon atom gives rise to three terms: 3 P < 1 P < 1 D. Spin-orbit interaction between L and S then causes relatively small intervals of each term for different possible values of J.\n\nFor example, the lowest-energy term for the carbon atom can have three possible J values, with the energy-level ordering: 3 P 0 < 3 P 1 < 3 P 2 . It is clear, with this scheme, each electronic state is defined by quantum numbers L, S, and J.",

The calculated wave numbers agree well with the observed harmonic wave numbers with substantially the same accuracy for the compounds of the different groups. The stretching force constants of the CX (X = C, Si, Ge, N, P, As, O, S, Se, F, Cl and Br) single and multiple bonds were obtained. The CX stretching force constants increase with a decrease of the bond lengths as the element X in the same period goes from left to right in the periodic table. The individual intrinsic properties of the CX bonds are lost gradually with increasing the period of the element X. The unified interpretation of Badger's rule has enabled the formulation of a common equation for universal use f = 2.8 R(-3) to relate the force constants f (10(2) N m(-1)) and the reduced bond lengths R (10(-10) m).",

This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 \u00c5 (1.09 \u00d7 10\u221210 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale\u2014C (2.55) and H (2.2)\u2014the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C\u2212H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C\u2013H bonds and C\u2013C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons.",

The aim is to bring the basis functions closer to the final (ro)vibronic wave functions nature. Our methodology is extended to complicated potential energy surfaces, such as quasilinearity or multiequilibrium geometries, by using several free parameters in the basis functions. These parameters allow several density maxima, linear or not, around which the basis functions will be mainly located. Divergences at linearity in integral computations are resolved as generalized Legendre polynomials. All integral computations required for the evaluation of molecular Hamiltonian matrix elements are given for both discrete variable representation and finite basis representation.

This fact is due to the symmetry of the degenerate bending mode with respect to the plane perpendicular to the plane of vibration. We can also note an interesting property of high order force constants containing the bending coordinates, coming from the equivalence of the two bending vibration planes:\nF 2 a ,2 a ,2 a ,2 a = F 2 b ,2 b ,2 b ,2 b = F 2 a ,2 a ,2 b ,2 b /3.\nThe pure vibrational energy levels relative to the ground-state energy level are listed in Tables 3-5 for the molecules HCN, OCS, and HCP, respectively.

The chemical environment greatly influences the formation of new chemical bonds and the best way to highlight this effect is to trace a consequent polyderivatization of complex molecules. In contrast to practical chemistry, for which any particular polyderivative of, say, fullerene C 60 , is not always completely successful hard work, quantum chemistry may deal with a large family of possible polyderivatives much more easily, when, particularly, additional support is provided by a specific algorithm of polyderivative models construction. Quantum molecular theory of fullerenes suggests such an algorithm, which allows tracing the stepwise polyderivatization of the molecules quite successfully [31].

Here, r is the radius of the atom, Z(eff) is the effective nuclear charge, n is the number of atoms of a given element i, and N is the total number of different elements in the molecule. The physical meaning of these two compressibility parameters is examined briefly in this work. A fundamental difficulty with the derivation of the primary relationship beta' = r4/Z(eff) is pointed out. We have investigated the origins of an observed linear variation of Gbeta' with molecular polarizability alpha(mol)' for a series of predominantly organic molecules. We show that a linear correlation is to be expected for a plot of Gbeta' vs alpha(mol)' if certain conditions are satisfied for all members of a given set of molecules. In particular, if the average value of r/Z(eff) for the constituent atoms is similar for each molecule in the series, then a linear variation is to be expected for Gbeta' vs alpha(mol)'.",

The Hubbard model adds an effective electron-electron repulsion when two electrons occupy the same atomic orbital to the familiar H\u00fcckel Hamiltonian. Thus it breaks the degeneracy between excited singlet and triplet states and allows an explicit treatment of electron correlation. We show how to evaluate the parameters of the model from high-level ab initio calculations on two-atom fragments and then to transfer the parameters to large molecules and polymers where accurate ab initio calculations are difficult or impossible. The recently developed MS-RASPT2 method is used to generate accurate potential energy curves for ethene as a function of carbon-carbon bond length, which are used to parameterize the model for conjugated hydrocarbons. Test applications to several conjugated/aromatic molecules show that even though the model is very simple, it is capable of reasonably accurate predictions for bond lengths, and predicts molecular excitation energies in reasonable agreement with those from the MS-RASPT2 method.",

This approach provides a convenient way for prediction of the \u03b3 magnitude of DOVE four wave mixing spectroscopy, an optical analogue to two-dimensional (2D) NMR. Here, by using the Hartree-Fock (HF) method, the density functional theory (DFT) method, and the second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method, we extend our early work from the less anharmonic region &lt;2000 cm(-1) into the more anharmonic region &gt;2000 cm(-1) covering C-H, C-D, and C\u2261N stretching modes of benzene, deuterated benzene, acetonitrile, deuterated acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran. The computed Raman \u03b3 values of these vibrational modes have been determined by using either the 992 cm(-1) Raman band of benzene or the compound's own Raman band (C-C stretch) around 800-1000 cm(-1) as an internal standard. In this more anharmonic region, the HF method with a larger basis set provides the best outputs and the predicted Raman \u03b3 values agree well with experimental values for most of the vibrational modes studied. By choosing a suitable method and basis set, this facile approach could be applied to a broader spectral range for Raman \u03b3 estimation of various materials. ",

For molecular geometries around the equilibrium distance, two features of the wave function contribute to this delocalization: (i) Superposition of atomic orbitals extends the electronic wave function from one atom to two or more atoms; (ii) intra-atomic contraction of the atomic orbitals further increases the inter-atomic delocalization. The inter-atomic kinetic energy lowering that (perhaps counter-intuitively) is a consequence of the intra-atomic contractions drives these contractions (which per se would increase the energy). Since the contractions necessarily encompass both, the intra-atomic kinetic and potential energy changes (which add to a positive total), the fact that the intra-atomic potential energy change renders the total potential binding energy negative does not alter the fact that it is the kinetic delocalization energy that drives the bond formation.

For linearly elastic materials, strain energy is: where \u03c3 is stress, \u03b5 is strain, V is volume, and E is Young's modulus: Molecular strain In a molecule, strain energy is released when the constituent atoms are allowed to rearrange themselves in a chemical reaction. The external work done on an elastic member in causing it to distort from its unstressed state is transformed into strain energy which is a form of potential energy. The strain energy in the form of elastic deformation is mostly recoverable in the form of mechanical work. For example, the heat of combustion of cyclopropane (696 kJ/mol) is higher than that of propane (657 kJ/mol) for each additional CH2 unit.

In this limit, the electrons are confined to specific orbits in the scaled space, yet the uncertainty principle is maintained. A first-order perturbation correction, proportional to 1/D, substantially improves the agreement with the exact ground state potential energy curve. The present treatment is very simple mathematically, yet provides a strikingly accurate description of the potential curves for the lowest singlet, triplet, and excited states of H2.

He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks.

The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

He then proved that for most initial trajectories of the ball, this system is ergodic, that is, after a long time, the amount of that time the ball will have spent in any given region on the surface of the table is approximately proportional to the area of that region. It was the first time anyone proved a dynamic system was ergodic. Also in 1963, Sinai announced a proof of the ergodic hypothesis for a gas consisting of n hard spheres confined to a box. The complete proof, however, was never published, and in 1987 Sinai declared that the announcement was premature. The problem remains open to this day.",

                    "contents": "Monte Carlo studies of the fundamental limits of the intrinsic hyperpolarizabilityChampagne and Kirtman had criticized sum-rule truncation, arguing that the resulting limits may be in error. [8] The later development of the dipole-free SOS expression for calculating the hypoerpolarizability [10] lead to a more rigorous argument of why the original calculations, which appeared to truncate the sum rules, did not violate the higher-level sum rules. [11] A more important concern was the use of the three-level ansatz, which states that the fundamental limits can be calculated by assuming that only two excited states contribute. Given that the sum rules allow transition moments between excited states to be large, and potentially many states can contribute, one might expect that the calculations of the fundamental limit would underestimate the upper bounds. This is clearly not the case. While a system with only two dominant excited states yields the fundamental limit when the ratio of the oscillator strengths to each of the two excited states is chosen appropriately, systems in which many excited states contribute can also reach the fundamental limit. The implication is that all of the large contributions from transitions between excited states cancel.\n\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that when assigning transition moment matrix elements and energies randomly, but under the constraint of the sum rules, values of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability approach unity. This is in contrast to the intrinsic hyperpolarizability, which when calculated from an optimized potential energy function, falls bellow 0.71. The distribution of the values of \u03b2 IN T is found to be well approximated by a cycloid-like function. When the energy-level spacing is weighted in a way that forces the lower energy states to have more closely-spaced energies, the distribution falls below the cycloid function, suggesting that more sparse energy-level spacing of the lower levels yields a larger intrinsic hyperpolarizabilityan observation consistent with past analytical studies.",

The reason is that kT is the typical energy of random motion at temperature T, and when this is smaller than , there is not enough energy to give the oscillator even one quantum of energy. So the oscillator stays in its ground state, storing next to no energy at all. This means that at very cold temperatures, the change in energy with respect to beta, or equivalently the change in energy with respect to temperature, is also exponentially small.

[6,7] Champagne and Kirtman were critical of the accuracy of truncated sum rules. [8] In response, the three-level ansatz was introduced, which states that when a quantum system has a hyperpolarizability near the fundamental limit, the system can be described by a three-level model. [9] Using a new dipole-free form of the sum-over-states expression for the hyperpolarizability, [10] Kuzyk showed rigourously that the three-level ansatz does not demand the sum rules to be truncated. [11] Furthermore, the three-level ansatz with the new dipole free expression was used to calculate the more general fundamental limits of the dispersion of the real and imaginary parts of the hyperpolarizability. [11] This result can be used to study any phenomena that is based on a second-order response. More importantly, since the fundamental limit can be determined at any wavelength, it can be used as an absolute standard for comparing hyperpolarizabilities. In particular, the ratio of the measured hyperpolarizability to the fundamental limit, called the intrinsic hyperpolarizability, can be used to compare the efficacy of any two molecules, independent of their size.",

Attempts to find larger intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities via this method resulted in strange potentials that possessed significantly lower intrinsic values. The potentials that we discovered with the largest intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities resembled simple monotonically increasing half potentials. This motivated us to evaluate power law potentials, with positive exponent, which are found to fall just short of the apparent limit of 0.709 when the power vanishes. It is interesting that varying just one parameter yields an intrinsic hyperpolarizability that nearly spans the full range that is possible.\n\nThough the approach that we developed here is a useful tool for determining a potential energy function from transition dipole moments and energy spectrum, it is telling us that regimes where this technique breaks down are those that obey the TRK sum rules but not the threelevel ansatz. As such, this type of approach may be a more powerful tool in investigations of the structure of the theory of limits for systems at or beyond the limit.

The Bucherer-Langevin model was quickly abandoned, so some experimentalists tried to distinguish between Abraham's theory and the Lorentz-Einstein theory by experiment. This was done by Walter Kaufmann (1901\u20131905) who believed that his experiments confirmed Abraham's theory, and disproved the Lorentz-Einstein theory. But in 1908 Bucherer conducted some experiments as well, and obtained results which seem to confirm the Lorentz-Einstein theory and the principle of relativity. With exceptions like Adolf Bestelmeyer with whom Bucherer had a polemical dispute, Bucherer's experiments were regarded as decisive. But it was shown in 1938 that all those experiments of Kaufmann, Bucherer, Neumann etc. showed only a qualitative increase in mass, but were too imprecise to distinguish between the different models.

In the L-S coupling scheme, for the whole system, the orbital angular momentum vector (with quantum number L) interacts with the spin angular momentum vector (with quantum number S), yielding the total angular momentum vector (with quantum number J), and these three quantum numbers define the electronic states of an atom. On the other hand, in the j-j coupling scheme, each electron's \uf06c and s first combined to give j, i.e., j = \uf06c -\u00bd and \uf06c + \u00bd.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe other three quantum numbers, $n, l$, and $m_{l}$, are properties of specific atomic orbitals that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located. Orbitals are a result of solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for electrons in atoms. The electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states. One is termed the $\\alpha$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being in the positive direction of the $z$ axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number $m_{s}=\\frac{1}{2}$. The other is called the $\\beta$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being negative and $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Any electron, regardless of the atomic orbital it is located in, can only have one of those two values of the spin quantum number.

Indeed, AM1* is an extension of AM1 molecular orbital theory and uses AM1 parameters and theory unchanged for the elements H, C, N, O and F. But, other elements have been parameterized using an additional set of d-orbitals in the basis set and with two-center core\u2013core parameters, rather than the Gaussian functions used to modify the core\u2013core potential in AM1. Additionally, for transition metal-hydrogen interactions, a distance dependent term is used to calculate core-core potentials rather than the constant term. AM1* parameters are now available for H, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Zr, Mo, Pd, Ag, I and Au.

Note that the NDDO approximation is still in effect, and that only a few of the possible TERIs are explicitly computed. The values of the explicit TERIs are scaled using empirically-derived functions to obtain experimentally relevant results. One-center two-electron repulsion integrals (OCTEs) are derived initially to reproduce atomic properties. These values are then fixed and carried forward as further elemental parameterization proceeds. The performance of SAM1 for C, H, O, N, F, Cl, Br, and I was claimed to be superior to other semiempirical methods. Especially noteworthy were the smaller systematic errors for heats for formation. .

II E 1 that makes a combined use of both the AutoCAS functionality described in Sec. II F 2 in order to rationalize the selected active orbital space and the SINGLE_ANISO approach described above to calculate magnetic properties. In particular, we consider the magnetic properties of a hexakisamidouranium(V) complex, [U(NH 2 ) 6 ] -1 , which serves as a model complex for a unique, pseudo-octahedral hexakisamidouranium(V) complex synthesized and experimentally characterized by Meyer et al. 124 The active orbital space consisting of seven electrons distributed in 10 active orbitals, CAS (7,10), is sufficiently small to facilitate a direct comparison of the DMRG-SCF/MPSSI data with the corresponding results obtained from CASSCF/CASSI calculations. Dynamical correlation effects in the MPSSI (CASSI) calculations were taken into account by standard multi-state CASPT2 calculations for the seven lowest-lying electronic states of [U(NH 2 ) 6 ] -1 , which also define the ensemble of states for the preceding stateaveraged DMRG-SCF (CASSCF) calculations. Accordingly, the number of renormalized block states m that determines the accuracy of the DMRG-SCF calculations was chosen such as to exactly reproduce the corresponding CASSCF calculations for each of the active orbital spaces considered in this example. Figure 4 illustrates the state-averaged orbital entanglement diagram obtained by means of the AUTOCAS program based on of Chemical Physics DMRG-SCF calculations with CAS(7,10). Here, orbital Nos. 4-10 correspond to predominantly 5f orbitals of the U central ion while orbital Nos. 1-3 exhibit mainly U 6p character with little contributions from each of the N center of the (NH 2 ) -1 amido ligands. Interestingly, orbital No. 8 (of U 5f \u03b4 character), which displays a seemingly small orbital entanglement, will be automatically included by the automatic selection protocol because it is singly occupied in the electronic ground state. The latter finding is in perfect agreement with conclusions drawn from scalar relativistic DFT calculations for the same model complex. 124 The situation is, however, less clear for orbital",

[6][7][8][9] Although some properties of these systems can be modeled with reasonable accuracy using classical force fields, 10,11 quantum mechanical methods are still essential for many chemically important properties, including excited states and electron transfer. Semiempirical quantum mechanical methods (SEQMs) have experienced a resurgence in recent years because of their capacity to address these challenges at accessible computational costs. 1,[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] SEQMs use low-cost Hamiltonians simplified from Hartree-Fock. The introduction of parameters fit to experimental and high-level computational results has enabled high enough accuracy to provide understanding of chemical properties including thermochemistry, 13,21,22 noncovalent interactions, 13,21,23 excited states, 24,25 pK a , 14,19 magnetism, 26 solvatochromism, 27 and electrochemical formal potentials. 28 The Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model is a semiempirical-like model based on a Hamiltonian simplified from Density Functional Theory (DFT) and has many capabilities similar to those of Hartree-Fock-based SEQMs [29][30][31] ; this work focuses exclusively on SEQMs derived from Hartree-Fock.",

All-electron and pseudopotential calculations are available. Initial VB wave functions can be read from the software XMVB [51]. The parameters in the JVB wave functions are then simultaneously optimized with the linear optimization method in VMC, using an accelerated Metropolis algorithm [52,53]. Once the trial wave function has been optimized, a DMC calculation can be performed within the short-time and FN approximations, using an efficient DMC algorithm featuring very small time-step errors [54]. Typically, we use an imaginary time step of \u03c4 = 0.01 Hartree \u22121 .\n\n\nIII. BENCHMARKING THE VALENCE-BOND QUANTUM MONTE CARLO METHOD\n\nA. Proof of concept: Bond dissociation energy of acetylene One of the first published studies to use ab initio VB trial wave functions in QMC was the study of the C-H bond dissociation of acetylene [55]. While there were earlier QMC studies that used geminals [56] and resonating VB wave functions [57], the study of the bond dissociation of acetylene in Ref. 55 examined the use of chemically interpretable VB trial functions, namely BOVB, in QMC for calculating molecular bond dissociation energies. It was already well known that the accuracy of QMC results could be improved by using multideterminant trial wave functions [58] rather than single-determinant trial wave functions, unfortunately the commonly used complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) and configuration-interaction (CI) expansions usually become unwieldy large for molecules containing more than a few atoms. The localized nature and non-orthogonality of VB orbitals usually allow for wave functions with significantly fewer Slater determinants than CASSCF or CI expansions while providing easy to interpret description of the qualitative nature of the covalent bonds present within the molecules.\n\nThe equilibrium molecular geometries and scaled harmonic zero-point vibrational energies",

It is also quite competitive with a state-of-the-art density functional, \u03c9B97M-V, which is a priori expected to be accurate for the class of systems studied here. These conclusions are summarized in Fig. 5. We thus recommend AFQMC with a simple SD trial for calculations where DFT is expected to struggle (either due to self-interaction error or due to strong correlation) and CCSD(T) is too expensive.\n\n\nB. Non-covalent interaction benchmark (A24)\n\nA24 is a high-quality non-covalent interaction benchmark set composed of 24 small, non-covalently bound complexes. 86 All molecules in the set should be well described by RHF wave functions. For this set we employ RHF wave functions for both CC and AFQMC methods. We also used the counterpoise correction to eliminate the basis set superposition error. The energy scale in this set is quite small, with interaction energies ranging from 1.115 kcal/mol to -6.493 kcal/mol. In Fig. 6, we present the RMSD values of MP2, CCSD, CCSD(T), \u03c9B97M-V, and AFQMC for this set. MP2 has the largest RMSD (1.12 kcal/mol), while CCSD and CCSD(T) are nearly exact (RMSD = 0.05 kcal/mol). \u03c9B97M-V is also very accurate with an RMSD of 0.09 kcal/mol. AFQMC exhibits more sizable errors than do the CC methods, with an RMSD of 0.32(7) kcal/mol. This is about a factor of 4 larger error than \u03c9B97M-V, although still within chemical accuracy.",

Currently, density functional theory is seen to achieve a good balance between efficiency and accuracy in solid-state chemistry. To be specific, density functional theory allows the assignment of signals in nuclear resonance magnetic spectra to specific sites and can help identify overlapped or missing signals from experimental nuclear resonance magnetic spectra. To avoid the difficulties correlated to all-electron calculations, a gauge including the projected augmented wave method was introduced to calculate nuclear resonance magnetic parameters with great success in organic crystals in the last decades. Thus, we developed a gauge including projected augmented pseudopotentials of 21 <id</i elements and tested them on, respectively, oxides or nitrides (semiconductors), calculating chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constant. This work can be considered the first step to improving the ab initio prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance parameters, and leaves open the possibility for inorganic compounds to constitute an alternative standard compound, with respect to tetramethylsilane, to calculate the chemical shift. Furthermore, this work represents the possibility to obtain results from first-principles calculations, to train a machine-learning model to solve or refine structures using predicted nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.",

[40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48] Novel concepts and features emerged from these studies including the regional positron affinities, 41 the positronic bond, 48 and the positive/negative muon's capability/incapability to shape its own atomic basin. 43,45,46 Also, when applied to the purely electronic systems, the MC-QTAIM analysis recovers the results of the QTAIM analysis, demonstrating that the former encompasses the latter just as a special case. 32 In the second and third sections of this chapter, a comparative analysis is also done on the formulation of the QTAIM and the MC-QTAIM and the basic ideas behind these methodologies are articulated. In this articulation a new theoretical ingredient of the QTAIM, i.e. property fluctuation of AIM, is introduced which goes beyond the well-established formalism of the usual particle number fluctuation of AIM. 14,49,50 At the next step this new ingredient will be extended within the context of the MC-QTAIM. Particularly, the original idea of Bader that AIM are somehow \"open\" entities amenable to particle and property exchange, 14 is quantified by this new ingredient in a firm manner. Finally, in the fourth section some future opportunities for theoretical developments of the MC-QTAIM and even beyond are briefly discussed.\n\n\nII.

We consider here a set of 328 ES, that has been divided into three relatively equivalent subsets of 1-3 non-hydrogen atoms (106 ES), 4 non-hydrogen atoms (89 ES) and 5-6 non-hydrogen atoms (134 ES). From these data, it is quite clear that CC3 delivers astonishingly accurate transition energies with MAE below or equal to 0.03 eV for each subset, and no deviation exceeding \u00b10.20 eV. This is inline with several previous benchmarks. 14,18,25,[32][33][34][35] Again, consistently with previous analyses and theoretical considerations (see above), the ADC(2) and CC2 performances are very similar and these second-order methods deliver a global MAE smaller than 0.2 eV, together with negligible MSE for all subsets. This confirms that ADC(2) is indeed a very interesting computational tool thanks to its attractive accuracy/cost ratio. Nevertheless, in par with the above-described conclusions, we found that the performance of ADC(3) is rather average with a significant underestimation (MSE of \u22120.11 eV for the full set) and a MAE around 0.20 eV for each subset. Overall, ADC(3) underestimates transition energies and provides an average deviation of the same order of magnitude as ADC(2) and CC2. Strikingly, the MAE of ADC(3) is basically one order of magnitude larger than the MAE of CC3.",

Bright Wilson, Jr. (Wilson 1962). Wilson asks the rhetorical question, \"Does there exist some procedure for calculating n(r) [for an N -electron system] which avoids altogether the use of 3N dimensional space?\" He then uses a device mentioned earlier (see Section IV) and defines n(r, \u03bb) to be the exact ground state electron density of a many-electron system where the charge of every electron is taken to be \u03bbe rather than e. Using just a few lines of calculation, Wilson shows that the total energy E in Eq. (10) can be written as an integral from \u03bb = 0 to \u03bb = 1 of the sum of the classical Coulomb potentials produced by n(r, \u03bb) at the positions of all the nuclei. [110] From the foregoing, I conclude that no scientists before Walter Kohn in 1963 were even vaguely thinking about using the ground state charge density as a fundamental quantity from which to build an exact theory of a manyelectron system. The idea was not \"in the air\" and all eyes were riveted either on the many-electron wave function, the first-and second-order density matrices, or the Green functions of many-body field theory. The zeitgeist of electronic structure theory was simply not moving in the direction of the electron density function for some particulary well-prepared scientist to exploit and earn the accolades of discovery.",

It is possible to obtain \u03b5 \u03b1 (N \u2212 1/2) without explicitly removing half an electron from the molecule. This is achieved by evaluating the following inner product: 11,12 \n\u03b5 \u03b1 (N \u2212 1/2) = \u03c6 \u03b1 \u2212 \u2207 2 2 + v ext + v H + v XC \u2212 V S \u03c6 \u03b1 .(2)\nHere, we denote the HOMO wavefunction of a system with N electrons as \u03c6 \u03b1 , while the external (v ext ), Hartree (v H ) and exchange-correlation (v XC ) potentials are the contributions to the KS potential. The term V S , called self-energy potential due to its similarity to its electrostatic counterpart, carries the information about the half-ionization. 20 It can be expressed as the difference between the KS potentials of the N and N \u2212 1/2 electron systems, respectively. 11,12 Conceptually, V S is the potential needed to create half a hole in the HOMO. 11,12 A good approximation to V S is to consider it as a sum of the self-energy potentials of its atoms, 12\nV S (compound) \u223c = i V S (f i , atom i ),(3)\nwhere f i is the fractional charge removed from the i-th atom. Each self-energy potential V S (f i , atom i ) is then obtained in a separate calculation, as a difference between the KS potential of the atom and its corresponding ion with charge f i . f i should reflect how much each atom contributes to the HOMO of the actual system. To create the half hole, the total degree of ionization must satisfy i f i = 1/2. Equation (3) enables us to easily obtain the self-energy potential of a system, without half-ionizing it, as just the constituent atoms need to be ionized separately.",

For example, the covalent radius of an aluminum atom $\\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{1}\\right)$ is 118 pm , whereas the ionic radius of an $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}\\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6}\\right)$ is 68 pm . As electrons are removed from the outer valence shell, the remaining core electrons occupying smaller shells experience a greater effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ (as discussed) and are drawn even closer to the nucleus.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.32 The radius for a cation is smaller than the parent atom (Al), due to the lost electrons; the radius for an anion is larger than the parent ( S ), due to the gained electrons.\n\nCations with larger charges are smaller than cations with smaller charges (e.g., $\\mathrm{V}^{2+}$ has an ionic radius of 79 pm , while that of $\\mathrm{V}^{3+}$ is 64 pm ). Proceeding down the groups of the periodic table, we find that cations of successive elements with the same charge generally have larger radii, corresponding to an increase in the principal quantum number, $n$.",

Although neither atoms nor ions have sharp boundaries, they are treated as if they were hard spheres with radii such that the sum of ionic radii of the cation and anion gives the distance between the ions in a crystal lattice. Ionic radii are typically given in units of either picometers (pm) or angstroms (\u00c5), with 1 \u00c5 = 100 pm. Typical values range from 31 pm (0.3 \u00c5) to over 200 pm (2 \u00c5). The concept can be extended to solvated ions in liquid solutions taking into consideration the solvation shell. Trends Ions may be larger or smaller than the neutral atom, depending on the ion's electric charge. When an atom loses an electron to form a cation, the other electrons are more attracted to the nucleus, and the radius of the ion gets smaller. Similarly, when an electron is added to an atom, forming an anion, the added electron increases the size of the electron cloud by interelectronic repulsion.",

The quantity\n\u03be = c (TC) HF \u2212 c (non-TC) HF 1 \u2212 c (non-TC) HF ,(23)\nis then a measure of the enhancement in the compactness of the wave function, going from 0 for no enhancement to 1 if the TC wave function becomes exactly single-determinantal. From the data in Ref. 33, the TC method yields a maximum \u03be = 0.64 for the 18-site two-dimensional Hubbard model. We find that the values of \u03be for atomic and molecular systems are not dissimilar from this; see Table II.  Having established the more compact nature of the CI wave function with the TC Hamiltonian, we deem appropriate to run the TC-FCIQMC calculations using between 10 6 and 10 7 walkers for the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ bases, and between 10 6 and 2 \u00d7 10 7 walkers with the cc-pVQZ basis. In Fig. 9 we plot the resulting TC-FCIQMC energy relative to its corresponding FCI limit, i.e., the initiator error, as a function of n \u22121/3 w for each of the molecules and basis sets considered. As anticipated, the initiator error is to a good approximation pro- portional to n \u22121/3 w , and we expect the extrapolated FCI limits to incur errors no larger than 0.4 mHa as in the non-TC case.\n\n\nNeglecting three-body excitations",

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe now analyze the accuracy of the TC method with tailored Jastrow factors by comparing the convergence of the results as a function of basis set size with non-TC results and with benchmark complete basis-set limit (CBS) values from Refs. 49-51.\n\nIn Table VI we list the total energies that we obtain for each system and basis set. We find the TC total energies to be remarkably accurate already at the cc-pVQZ basis set level, differing by less than 2 mHa per atom from benchmark CBS values, while the non-TC total energies still miss the benchmarks by 25-30 mHa per atom with the cc-pV5Z basis set, and 20 mHa per atom at the cc-pV6Z level. The TC total energies exhibit slight non-variational convergence, with the atomic energies reaching values 0.5 mHa below the benchmark before increasing again towards it for larger basis-set sizes. While non-variationality is not a desirable feature in a method, the amount by which the TC results dip below the basis-set limit is sufficiently tiny for this issue to be entirely ignored in practice.\n\nFrom a chemical perspective, relative energies are more important than total energies. The atomization energies of the C 2 , CN, N 2 , and O 2 molecules obtained from the total energies in Table VI are given in Table VII and plotted in Fig. 10. Again, we find that the TC results exhibit much faster convergence with basis-set size than their non-TC counterparts, with TC atomization energies being chemically accurate with respect to the CBS benchmarks already at the cc-pVTZ basis-set level, matching the accuracy of non-TC atomization energies obtained using the cc-pV5Z basis set. The TC method therefore provides an advantage of about two cardinal numbers for the computation of relative energies.\n\nThe application of the TC method to quantum chemical methods in general could be presumed to be problematic because any theoretical guarantee of cancellation of errors in energy differences disappears with the introduction of separately-optimized Jastrow factors for each system. However, the fact that in our results the relative energy converges at smaller basis-set sizes than the total energy implies that substantial error cancellation is at play in practice. We take this as evidence that the TC method with tailored Jastrow factors does not fully suppress advantageous error cancellation from the underlying methodology.",

In addition, results of the FCCR method are included, which in its most recent incarnation may too be used in combination with either MP or EN perturbation theory for correcting for operations outside a primary CC excitation manifold. 322 The left panel of Figure 1 shows the convergence of both the variational (dashed lines) and perturbatively corrected (solid lines) SCI results with an increase of the primary correlation space. On the basis of these results, it is observed how the profiles of the variational CIPSI, ASCI, and SHCI results all resemble each other, while the corresponding iCI results differ somewhat from this trend. Upon adding the PT2 correction, however, the four sets of results start to coincide. The differences (or lack hereof) in-between the methods are further accentuated in the right panel of Figure 1, which further illustrates one of the key premises on which modern SCI operate, namely, the empirical observation that the total energy often changes with the magnitude of the perturbative correction (i.e., upon reductions to the sec-   Figure 2 as only a limited number (4) of FCCR data points have been published to date. 322 We next turn to stochastic rather than deterministic approaches to FCI. In FCIQMC theory, the FCI wave function is sampled by a QMC propagation of the wave function in the many-electron Hilbert space, with an aim at projecting out the FCI ground state. The wave function coefficients are then simulated by a set of walkers which are allowed to evolve over imaginary time. Its initiator (i-FCIQMC) and adaptive shift 324 (AS-FCIQMC) formulations are these days used to mitigate the fermionic sign problem, albeit at the expense of an initiator bias in the wave function propagation, and most recently extensions have further been proposed to take advantage of perturbation theory, 325,326 akin to what was discussed in the context of SCI and FCCR above. On par with SCI, FCIQMC may predominantly be classified as a method intended for performing a focussed sampling of the FCI wave function.\n\nHowever, a fundamental conceptual distinction exists between these two classes of methods.",

Second, for all members of the series C n H n+2 up to n = 40, the preceding DFT calculation (performed using the PySCF package35,36 ) is significantly more expensive than the subsequent p-DFT/MRCI calculation.The ratio of the two timings does decrease with increasing system size.

However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time. This is because it was assumed that the charge carriers were much heavier hydrogen or nitrogen atoms. Schuster's estimates would subsequently turn out to be largely correct.

This method of tracking corresponds to minimizing the stored energy in an elastic solid or the dissipated energy in a viscous fluid. Our energy-minimizing approach extends the advantages of particle tracking to situations where particle imaging velocimetry and digital imaging correlation are typically required. This approach is much more reliable than the standard squared-displacement minimizing approach for spatially-correlated displacements that are larger than the typical interparticle spacing. Thus, it is suitable for particles embedded in a material undergoing large deformations. On the other hand, squared-displacement minimization is more effective for particles undergoing uncorrelated random motion. In the ESI, we include a flexible MATLAB particle tracker that implements either approach with a robust optimal assignment algorithm.

Three hundred thirty mainly strong lines are assigned to pure rotational transitions in the (100), (001), and (020) vibrational states. These lines, which involve significantly higher rotational energy levels than were known previously, are assigned using high-accuracy variational calculations. Transitions in (020) are assigned up to Ka = 18, compared with the maximum Ka of 10 known previously. Crossings of vibration-rotation energy levels result in the observation of extra intensity-stealing transitions. In particular, this leads to the assignment of (020)-(100) and (100)-(020) rotational difference band transitions in addition to the conventional pure rotational lines in (020) and (100) states. These extra lines increase the number of transitions and they are likely to complicate the pure rotational water spectrum in higher excited vibrational states to an even greater extent. A few lines from our previous work on the pure rotational spectrum of hot water in the (000) and (010) vibrational states are also reassigned and some further assignments are made.

The observed transitions were analyzed together with hitherto unassigned transitions from measurements between 78 and 118 GHz. About 1900 rotational transitions of OCCCS in the vibrational ground state and in 13 excited bending states could be assigned, the latter including the eighth, ninth, and tenth excited state of the low-lying bending mode nu(7) as well as the second excited state of the bending mode nu(6). Besides the determination of effective constants for these newly identified vibrational states, our data also served to considerably improve the effective constants for some of the bending states already characterized in previous publications.

Molecules with cancelation between hyperfine structure and rotational intervals\n\nConsider diatomic molecules with the unpaired electron and the 2 \u03a3 ground state. Examples of such molecules include LaS, LaO, LuS, LuO, and YbF [73]. The hyperfine interval \u2206 hfs is proportional to \u03b1 2 ZF rel (\u03b1Z)\u00b5g nuc , where F rel is an additional relativistic (Casimir) factor [75]. The rotational interval \u2206 rot \u221d \u00b5 is roughly independent on \u03b1. If we find a molecule with \u2206 hfs \u2248 \u2206 rot , the splitting \u03c9 between hyperfine and rotational levels will depend on the following combination \u03c9 \u221d \u00b5 \u03b1 2 F rel (\u03b1Z) g nuc \u2212 const .\n\nRelative variation is then given by\n\u03b4\u03c9 \u03c9 \u2248 \u2206 hfs \u03c9 (2 + K) \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b1 + \u03b4g nuc g nuc + \u03b4\u00b5 \u00b5 ,(40)\nwhere the factor K comes from variation of F rel (\u03b1Z), and for Z \u223c 50, K \u2248 1.

A band with an origin at 15151.33 cm \u22121 (660.01 nm) was assigned as the 0\u22120 band of system VIII. Subsequently, Effantin et al. 21 were able to assign this band as the [15.63]6\u2212(1)5 transition. Kaledin et al. 22 also reported a band head for the 1\u22120 band of system VIII at 15946.7 cm \u22121 (627.09 nm). The system VIII 0\u22120 band was observed in the present work, and the fitted molecular constants were in good agreement with the literature values. However, the band at 15946.7 cm \u22121 was not present in our data for the jet-cooled molecule. Instead, we found an \u03a9\u2032 = 6 \u2212 \u03a9\u2033 = 5 band at 15924.23 cm \u22121 with upper and lower state The uncertainties in parentheses are those obtained from the rotational line fitting. The absolute uncertainties are 0.1 cm \u22121 .  In their SEVI study, Babin et al. 16 found 10 bands of NdO with internal energies above 10,000 cm \u22121 that could be correlated with transitions observed by means of optical spectroscopy. None of these assigned upper states were more than 16,800 cm \u22121 above the NdO X(1)4 v\u2033 =0 level. A further ten bands were observed in the 16 Kaledin 27 used a LFT model to predict the energies of NdO states in the 0\u22123 eV range (0\u221224,200 cm \u22121 ), providing the only published predictions for states above 10,000 cm \u22121 . A striking feature of this calculation is the fact that there are very few states at energies that could be the upper levels for transitions emitting in the green spectral range. The predicted states are mostly clustered below 17,000 (588.2 nm) or above 20,500 cm \u22121 (487.80 nm) (see Tables 1 and 3 of ref 27. We could not find convincing correlations between the states seen above 16,800 cm \u22121 and the LFT predictions. In cases where the energies were similar, there was disagreement for the \u03a9 assignments.",

                    "contents": "Hydrogen Atom and One-Electron Molecular Systems in a Strong Magnetic Field: Are All of Them AlikeIt is well known that studies in a strong magnetic field are very complicated for several reasons. Perhaps, the most serious, conceptual reason is related to the fact that the bound states are of a weakly-bound-state nature (the binding energies are much smaller than the total ones). The perturbation theory in powers of B is fast divergent and thus cannot be used. Asymptotic expansions at B = \u221e have extremely complicated form but, usually, have no domain of applicability inside non-relativistic considerations. For example, it can be easily checked that at an extremely strong magnetic field near the edge of applicability of non-relativistic approximation B = 10000 a.u.(= 2.35 \u00d7 10 13 G) [27], the ionization energy E b calculated numerically differs by 300% (!) from the value obtained using the leading term in asymptotic expansion\nE asymp b = 1 2 log 2 B ,\nwhere E b is given in atomic units as well as B (see [6]). Another example is given by the ratio of the binding energies of H + 2 and H ++ 3 . Asymptotically, for B tending to infinity, this ratio should be 1/2.25 . However, the numerical results at B = 3 \u00d7 10 13 G [5] give \u2248 1 for this ratio. Therefore the only methods which can be used are either numerical or variational. For B 10 11 G, to the best our knowledge, the numerical methods were used for the hydrogen atom only (see, for example, the excellent early review [7], the book [8] and recent review articles [9,10]). Usually, these methods are very slow-convergent and extremely difficult to implement. The most popular method to study one-electron molecular systems is the variational method (for review, see [11]). However, the use of the variational method is associated with a difficult procedure of minimization and, sometimes, with numerical calculation of multidimensional integrals with high accuracy, which can also be quite cumbersome. In any case, the calculations are made for some particular values of magnetic field. It seems natural to create some approximate expressions valid for all magnetic fields, even having not high accuracy, in order to make at least rough estimates.",

Then the picture of a nucleus as a drop of incompressible liquid roughly accounts for the observed variation of binding energy of the nucleus: Volume energy. When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. So, this nuclear energy is proportional to the volume. Surface energy. A nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area. Coulomb energy.

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

This has important implications. It shows that even for the fairly simple system of water in water second-order perturbation or, equivalently, assumption of Gaussian-fluctuation statistics, allow only crude descriptions of the actual thermodynamics. This also affects the potential usefulness of linear continuum models of electrostatics, 2,9,[27][28][29][30] which by design do not go beyond a quadratic behavior. However, when calculating free-energy differences, continuum models usually compare approximate representations of physical states rather than performing an expansion around a single state. This can explain their success of giving at least approximately correct free-energy values even in the presence of strongly non-linear dependencies in a corresponding system of atomic resolution. 9 In addition to the failure of the simple Gaussian model, expansions around only a single state using higher-order cumulants are expected to fail. 31 Increasing the order of the perturbation requires accurate information about the poorly sampled tails of distributions. This merely reflects the difficulty to extrapolate to states that strongly differ in their structure and fluctuation statistics. Interpolation on the other hand is in general a much simpler task and allows more accurate predictions. In this work we effectively combine the information of two states to derive a polynomial expression for the chemical potential.\n\nAn important point concerns the treatment of electrostatic interactions in computer simulations of systems under periodic boundary conditions. With respect to system-size dependence and electrostatic model, we obtain consistent results using Ewald summation and a generalized reaction-field model. But consistency is only achieved if self-interactions are included. These self-interactions arise naturally when effective potentials are used for the Coulomb interactions. We made similar observations in previous studies of the chemical potential of ions. 3,10 Adding self-terms to the energies acts as an effective correction for effects of a finite system size.

However, if the lower state is in an inner shell, a phenomenon known as the Auger effect may take place where the energy is transferred to another bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum. This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon. There are strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light\u2014however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes. See also",

Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum.

When Schr\u00f6dinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schr\u00f6dinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

We emphasize thatF +D is the key quantity that determines the stability and working efficiency of the water wheel, see[41]for further discussions.InFig 2,we also simulate the energy transfer between electrons and nuclei after a vertical excitation to an excited electronic state in a two-level model diatomic molecule (details can be found in the supplemental material[41]). This is related to the early stage of a bond-breaking process[42], particularly the reaction pathways of small molecules[43], or the redistribution of energy of DNA and RNA[3,4]. Here we idealize the two BO surfaces as harmonic potentials with an avoided crossing in the region R = 0.5 \u2212 1 Bohr. As illustrated inFig 2(a), after vertical excitation from the equilibrium position of the lower surface, the nuclear wave packet \u03c7 starts propagating on the upper one. If we neglect the coupling of the two surfaces, \u03c7 undergoes perfect harmonic oscillations around R = 0.5 Bohr with a time period T 0 = 13.6 fs. However, because of the coupling of the surfaces, the nuclear",

In the simplest beta decay, neutrons are converted to protons by emitting a negative electron and an antineutrino. This is always possible outside a nucleus because neutrons are more massive than protons by an equivalent of about 2.5 electrons. In the opposite process, which only happens within a nucleus, and not to free particles, a proton may become a neutron by ejecting a positron and an electron neutrino. This is permitted if enough energy is available between parent and daughter nuclides to do this (the required energy difference is equal to 1.022 MeV, which is the mass of 2 electrons). If the mass difference between parent and daughter is less than this, a proton-rich nucleus may still convert protons to neutrons by the process of electron capture, in which a proton simply electron captures one of the atom's K orbital electrons, emits a neutrino, and becomes a neutron.",

Informally, these states correspond to a whole number of wavelengths of the wavefunction along a closed path (a path that ends where it started), such as a circular orbit around an atom, where the number of wavelengths gives the type of atomic orbital (0 for s-orbitals, 1 for p-orbitals and so on).

CONCLUSIONS\n\nThere are several conclusions to take out of the challenge.We start by the most obvious lessons.Some of the composite methods suggested in the past need to be revised, with the underlying optimization procedures brought up to date.The CBS-QB3 structures showed large deviations from the remaining sets, more than likely due to the lack of dispersion corrections in the optimization step.This brings us to the second, rather clear observation, that the dispersion-corrected density functionals show a remarkable performance in structure optimizations.These include B3LYP-D3, \u03c9B97xD, and PBE0-D3 which have much lower computational costs than other alternatives but only a marginal effect on the relative energies (see Fig. 5).This, of course, only holds if the final energies are computed at a suitable theory level.Most submissions applied CCSD(T) or approximations/variations thereof.Whereas there is a satisfactory convergence for relative electronic energies using such CCSD(T)-based methods and also for harmonic ZPVE corrections, attempts to treat the ZPVE beyond the harmonic approximation lead to surprisingly large deviations.This either points at important and challenging anharmonic effects for the investigated systems or else may indicate a limited robustness of such attempts.\n\nVibrational spectroscopy alone was not enough to characterize the OH-O dimer.Considering the uncertainty in the conformational temperature and the integration of the measured absorption bands ratio, it was not even absolutely clear whether an OH-O dimer would be more stable than an OH-\u03c0 structure.However, it did provide from the start a rather strict test.Across the series, the energy difference between OH-O and OH-\u03c0 dimers should be lower than 1.5 kJ/mol.Most of the entries combining at least hybrid functionals with dispersion corrections for the optimization and a CCSD(T) energy estimate were able to meet this criterion.Even when crossing anharmonic vibrational frequencies with the measured data, the structure assignment was not totally clear.However, it was possible to further reduce the energy window.The criteria could be further tightened if the correct OH-O conformer were to be identified, e.g., by microwave spectroscopy. 13Experimentally, it should also be possible (given enough time) to further reduce the error bar in the measured intensities.",

The breakdown of the mean absolute deviations for B3LYP with G4MP2 as a function of size of the molecule and type of molecule is given in ESI Fig. 1. \u2020 The error increases slightly with size of molecule. In addition, the B3LYP results in this \ue103gure indicate that the molecules containing \ue104uorine have much larger deviations with G4MP2 than those not containing \ue104uorine.\n\nThe database of G4MP2 enthalpies of formation provides a source of data for the derivation of accurate energies of millions of reactions involving organic molecules up to nine heavy atoms. To illustrate this we have calculated some energies for \ue103ve different types of reactions from the G4MP2 energies and tabulate them in Table 3. These include (1) alcohol oxidation, (2) alkane oxidation, (3) ether hydrolysis, (4) hydrogenolysis, and (5) carbonyl reduction. Energies for all of these types of reactions are expected to be accurate to about 1 kcal mol \u00c01 based on the accuracy of the G4MP2 energies. In addition to the reaction energies that can be derived, the large database of enthalpies of formation also provides a basis on which to assess existing or newly measured enthalpies of formation. The method by which the enthalpies of formation can be obtained from the database of G4MP2 energies 33 is described in the ESI. \u2020\n\n\nV. Conclusions\n\nEnergies for the $133 000 molecules in the GDB-9 database, containing organic molecules having nine or less atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and \ue104uorine as well as hydrogen atoms, have been calculated at the G4MP2 level of theory.

In this example, 50 calculation output files (25 Gaussian geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations with 25 corresponding ORCA single point calculations) are used to create the data in Table 1 and graphed in Figure 2. All raw data was taken from a 2018 study 14 , and is freely accessible through a Zenodo repository 15 . Each point in Figure 2 represents a unique conformer's Gibbs energy. The Boltzmann-weighted values are shown as dashes connected by the curved profiles. Optimizations were done with \u03c9B97X-D/6-31+G(d) 16 implemented in Gaussian using an \"ultrafine\" pruned (99,590) integration grid. Considering solvent effects of the reaction, calculations were run with the SMD solvation model 17 using ethanol, and the concentration of each substance was set to 1.0 M for further thermochemical calculation. GoodVibes allows for solvent media corrections to entropy based on select solvent standard state concentration 18 , which was applied to ethanol in this case.\n\nThermochemistry is evaluated at a temperature of 80\u00b0C (353.15 K) in accordance with experimental conditions (the temperature assumed in the original calculations does not influence the results from GoodVibes). These values are corrected using the quasi-harmonic approximation proposed by Grimme. One conformer of intermediate II in the 'Py' pathway has a small imaginary frequency of 2.9 cm -1 , which was \"inverted\" to a real value 2.9 cm -1 , as done in previous works to small imaginary frequencies, typically under >i50 cm -114,19 .",

This is critical to a mechanistic study of the kinetics involved, as well as the viability of various crystalline polymorphs based on the gas-phase conformers. We have used existing knowledge of basic cyclooctane chemistry to survey all possible HMX conformers based on its fundamental ring structure. After studying what geometries are possible after second-order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT(2)) geometry optimization, we calculated the energetics using coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T))/cc-pVTZ. These highly accurate energies allow us to better calculate starting points for future mechanistic studies. Additionally, the plethora of structures are compared to existing experimental data of crystals. It is found that the crystal field effect is sometimes large and sometimes small for HMX.",

It stands for Zerner's Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap, as it was developed by Michael Zerner and his coworkers in the 1970s. Unlike INDO, which was really restricted to organic molecules and those containing the atoms B to F, ZINDO covers a wide range of the periodic table, even including the rare-earth elements. There are two distinct versions of the method: ZINDO/1 \u2013 for calculating ground-state properties such as bond lengths and bond angles. It refers to a SCF (RHF or ROHF) calculation with the INDO/1 level as suggested by Pople, which provides the reference state MO coefficients. Ground-state dipole moments and ionization potentials are in general very accurate. Geometry optimizations are erratic, what prompted Zerner's group to improve the performance of the code in the late 1990s",

At temperatures around or below room temperature the case for using path integral sampling is particularly compelling. Figure 5, shows the dramatic change in the computed radial distribution functions of different phases of solid hydrogen, using DFT combined with the PI+GLE method [131]. Quantum fluctuations substantially smooth out structural correlations, and it is clear that only a simulation that includes them will be able to be in agreement with the experimental structural and thermodynamic properties. The use of colored-noise thermostats combined with PIMD have made it possible to reach an accurate description of these fluctuations with a reasonable computational effort, without having to compromise on the accuracy of the underlying potential energy surface. The possibility of directly using ab initio potentials, and even to couple quantum Monte Carlo and PIMD [? ], is particularly appealing in applications to exotic states of matter, for which the development of empirical potentials that can span multiple phases is particularly challenging.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning a few recent studies that have used PIMD without utilizing acceleration schemes, as they underscore the urgency of making quantum simulations of nuclear degrees of freedom more affordable. For example, PI simulations have been crucial in determining the impact of NQEs on the delocalization of H atoms and their diffusivity in proton conducting media such as triflic acid hydrates [134] and concentrated phosphoric acid [135,136], as well as in perovskite oxides [137] and metals such as iron [138], and on Ni surfaces [139]. Simulations of crystals in high-pressure conditions, such as the high-temperature superconducting SH 3 phase of hydrogen sulfide [140,141], is another field in which accessible and accurate modelling of NQEs will increase significantly the predictive power of atomistic simulations.\n\n\nOUTLOOK AND ONGOING CHALLENGES",

However, this also implies that the system sizes included in such an extrapolation have to be large enough to sample sufficiently short wavevectors in reciprocal space where the structure factor approaches q \u2192 0 linearly.The extrapolation of the (cT) correlation energy contribution for lithium shown in the main article, employs an (N atoms ) \u22122/3 fit and system sizes of 128 and 208 atoms.We note, however, that the (cT) correlation energies obtained for smaller systems deviate from the employed extrapolation law.To estimate the remaining uncertainty in the thermodynamic limit extrapolation of the (cT) energy we have performed the following analysis based on the UEG.Fig. 4 depicts the (cT) correlation energies of the UEG for a range of electron numbers at a density corresponding to r s =3.2.This density and the employed basis set sizes are identical to the calculations for lithium.Our findings indicate that the difference between thermodynamic limit extrapolations employing the (N ) \u22122/3 fits and system sizes corresponding to",

In table 4 we report the values of the variational parameters obtained minimizing a linear combination of the local energy and its variance over a set of different protons and electrons configurations. Typically 1000 configurations have been used, by saving a configuration after 10 or 20 protonic steps during a previous run. We also studied the relative importance of the different terms in the trial wavefunction by performing calculations with partially improved wave functions. In Figure 6 we compare the pair correlation functions for the various calculations in table 4. No significant difference is observed in the electron-electron and in the proton-proton pair correlation functions among different forms of the trial function.

Although SCI approaches initially appeared 17 almost 50 years ago with the method of CI by perturbative selective iteration (CIPSI), 17,18 there has been a resurgence of interest 19 in recent years, in part, spurred by the intervening development and success of FCIQMC, which has resulted in various different flavors of SCI-for instance, the original CIPSI, but also stochastic heat-bath CI (SHCI), [20][21][22][23] adaptive CI (ACI), 24 adaptive sampling CI (ASCI), 25 , iterative CI with selection (iCI) 26,27 (a relative of the previous iterative CI (ICI) 28,29 ), and probably many other variations.\n\nThe crux of SCI is performing first the aforementioned selection step of choosing important determinants, followed by a second step of forming the matrix of the Hamiltonian in this space of selected determinants and diagonalizing it, typically using a standard approach (such as, again, the Davidson method). These steps, determinant selection followed by large-matrix diagonalization, are then repeated until the resulting SCI energy (and/or wavefunction) converges to within some threshold, though that convergence is not necessarily monotonic. SCI methods, therefore, perform many steps of explicit large matrix formation and diagonalization, though the matrix is orders of magnitude smaller than the FCI matrix. This is an important distinction between SCI and the work of Rolik et al. along with the work of this paper: here there is no explicit large matrix diagonalization.",

The static correlation in active spaces up to this size can hence be resolved, while dynamic correlation has to be treated a posteriori. Luckily, QC-DMRG allows for an efficient extraction of the two-body RDM (2-RDM) [122,124]. The 2-RDM is not only required to calculate analytic nuclear gradients [102,151], but also to compute the gradient and the Hessian in CASSCF [53]. It is therefore natural to introduce a CASSCF variant with DMRG as active space solver, DMRG-CASSCF or DMRG-SCF [123,124,126]. Static correlation can be treated with DMRG-SCF. To add dynamic correlation as well, three methods have been introduced. With a little more effort, the 3-RDM and some specific contracted 4-RDMs can be extracted from DMRG as well. These are required to apply second-order perturbation theory to a CASSCF wavefunction, called CASPT2, in internally contracted form. The DMRG variant is called DMRG-CASPT2 [138,149,151].\n\nBased on a CASSCF wavefunction, a configuration interaction expansion can be introduced, called MRCI. Recently, an internally contracted MRCI variant was proposed, which only requires the 4-RDM [150]. By approximating the 4-RDM with a cumulant reconstruction from lower-rank RDMs, DMRG-MRCI was made possible [150].\n\nYet another way is to perform a canonical transformation (CT) on top of an MR wavefunction, in internally contracted form. When an MPS is used as MR wavefunction, the method is called DMRG-CT [129,130,143].\n\n\nExcited states",

The CEIMC distribution has more molecules and they are more tightly bound. The discrepancy between CEIMC and LDA in the intramolecular portion of the curve has several possible causes. On the CEIMC side, it may be due to lack of convergence or to the molecular nature of the wave function, which does not allow dissociation. The shift of the molecular bond length peak can be accounted for because LDA is known to overestimate the bond length of a free hydrogen molecule [40] which would account for the shifted location of the bond length peak.

We see in Figure 9 that, although MCCI does much better than CISDT for a similar number of determinants, we cannot reach CI(4) accuracy now that the FCI space is very large even with this smaller cutoff. We contrast this with the results for the smaller basis in Figure 7 where an accuracy slightly higher than that for CI(4) could be achieved by MCCI with a cutoff of 10 \u22124 . It is worth noting that the CI(4) calculation for cc-pVDZ has become large with 2.8 million determinants, which, together with not much multireference character, suggests that the better performance of CI(4) should be expected here.\n\nWe also compare the use of CSFs with SDs. Figure 10 shows that fewer configurations are needed for a given error when using CSFs rather than SDs. However, CSFs are not necessarily improving the trade-off between size and accuracy in terms of SDs.

Comparison is not only related to the difference between HF and self-consistent DFT approximations, but also for the density of other methods such as MPn and CASSCF. [58] Very little insight can be gained for improving functionals from such plots, due to the complexities of the relation between densities and potentials, as well as that between potentials and energy functionals. Because most good XC energy approximations yield good densities in most calculations, despite their very poor approximate potentials, it is very difficult to trace the effects of a good energy approximation in the (often) tiny differences in densities.

The aim of these calculations was twofold. First, to test the scaling of DMRG [4] and second, to demonstrate its superiority with respect to standard post-HF approaches (full CI, QCISD or QCISD(T)). The main disadvantage of post-HF solutions (apart from their scaling) is the lack of at least one of the main feature of DMRG: size consistency and variational character. The only theoretical approach which fulfills all these requirements is presently full CI. For example, CID or QCISD methods are variational but not size consistent.

Panel (a) plots the error-i.e., the deviation from the exact FCI result-as a function of runtime for three different choices of the \u03b4-threshold parameter, as described in reference to Figs. 3 and 4. For all three choices, the figure shows smooth monotonic convergence to chemical accuracy, and then to an order-of-magnitude or two beyond chemical accuracy for the smaller \u03b4s.\n\nOf course, the main focus of this work is on doing the minimal amount possible to just achieve chemical accuracy and panel (a) of Fig. 6 illustrates that this is indeed accomplished in 1 second for this system. These calculations were performed on an Intel Core i7-11800H laptop processor with 8 cores running at a base clock of 2.3 GHz. In comparison, the calculation for H 2 O from Ref. 8 took around 450 seconds. This was in 2008 on a server-grade AMD Opteron processor with a single core probably running at2.4 GHz. Given the similar clock speeds, the timing difference is obviously not attributable solely to the different processors, despite having 8 cores in the newer model.\n\nLikewise, Fig. 1 has already shown the timings and memory footprint of a state-of-the-art, but conventional, FCI calculation for this system (H 2 O, 19 orbitals). It was run on the same consumer-grade Intel Core i7 model using the Psi4 quantum chemistry program, 35 giving a runtime of about 210 seconds per iteration. With conventional FCI, however, chemical accuracy is reached in only 3 iterations, so at about 630 seconds of runtime, see Fig. 1, this is probably comparable to Ref. 8's method but still several orders of magnitude more expensive than the truncated Davidson method presented here, even when, for this simple system, memory-constraints are not an issue.",

For ion center A, Stuttgart PPs have the general form,\nV PP A = \u2212 Q A r + \u2211 l j=l+1/2 \u2211 j=|l\u22121/2| n \u2211 k=1 B k l j exp(\u2212\u03b2 k l j r 2 )P A l j ,(32)\nwhere Q A is the ion charge (nuclear charge minus number of core electrons),P A l j are projectors for orbital and total angular momentum with respect to the atomic center A. There are typically n=2 or 3 projectors (index k in Eq. 32) for each angular momentum l. This leads to improved scattering properties and transferability, similar to augmented planewave (PAW), ultrasoft (US) [42], and multiple-projector norm-conserving Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials [43]. The parameters B k l j and \u03b2 k l j were fit to reference data consisting of all-electron 4-component, multi-configurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) total energy calculations for about 100 relativistic states with the Breit interaction included perturbatively. The accuracy of the fit was reported as 10 \u22122 eV, with maximum deviations of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 eV [39]. As improved all-electron relativistic treatments are developed, emerging new energy-consistent PPs [44] can be easily incorporated into the same framework.\n\nThese small core PPs correspond to large active valence spaces. For the Bi atom, for example, the PP treats 23 valence electrons. For the initial applications of the method in this paper, we used a frozen-core transformation in the target systems to effectively transform these to large-core PPs, similar to previous scalar relativistic only CCSD(T) calculations which also used Stuttgart PPs [37,38,40]. Only the valence s and p electrons are explicitly treated at the many-body level, while all semi-core electrons are frozen at the scalar relativistic HF/DFT level of theory. The frozen orbital procedure we used is briefly discussed next.",

These are combined with the molecular data in Tables IX and X to calculate the atomization energies for the molecules in the G1 set, which are shown in Table XII and compared there to other benchmark simulations. For the cc-pVDZ results (columns 2 and 7), we compare with results from CCSDTQ [78]. These comparisons are necessarily indirect, since different geometries were used between the two sets of results, and the ASCI results are all electron. However the difference in geometries are not so large. Surveying the full set of molecules, we find less than 1 kcal differences between atomization energies. For the cc-pVTZ results (columns 4 and 9), we compare to benchmark complete basis set (CBS) frozen core results [78,79]. Again the comparison is not direct, but it is clear that the atomization energies are trending in the right direction in comparison to the CBS limit. To demonstrate the similarity of geometries between the different calculations, in Table XIII we present results of ASCI with perturbation corrections for selected molecules using the geometries from Feller et. al. [78]. These can be compared with the corresponding energies from Table IX and X to estimate the energy difference between the two sets of geometries and confirm the similarity.\n\nIt is also interesting to compare with recent auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo results (AFQMC) that are now able to calculate the G1 set [42]. AFQMC is accurate on many of these systems, but loses accuracy in certain situations such as for ionic systems like LiF and NaCl. This is likely due to deficiencies in the current trial wave functions used in AFQMC. See Ref. [42] for more details. Further comparisons between these methods will be interesting in the future. We also note that recent work on DMRG has also added perturbative corrections to that methodology [86,87], although it is not clear whether the largest simulations required for the G1 set are feasible with DMRG, even with perturbation theory improvements. Entanglement in chemical systems can be quite large even in systems in which the many body interactions are not necessarily strong, and is thus a problem for efficient simulation with DMRG.",

Core excitation energies\n\nTo examine if our SLC hybrid functionals also improve upon the other functionals for core excitation energies, we take the 38 core excitation energies of 13 molecules from Ref. [114], containing a total of 15 core\u2192valence and 23 core\u2192Rydberg excitation energies for the firstand second-row nuclei (from the 1s core orbitals). In conventional TDDFT, the calculations of core excited states can be prohibitively expensive, owing to the large number of roots required to obtain the high energy core excited states. Following Besley et al. [114], we perform TDDFT calculations using the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) [137] within a reduced single excitation space (which includes only excitations from the core orbitals of interest) [140], to reduce the computational costs of core excitation energies. The calculations are performed with the 6-311(2+,2+)G** basis set and EML(100,302) grid.\n\nFor the core excitation energies (see Table IV), PBE, LC-\u03c9PBE, and \u03c9B97 perform very poorly, while \u03c9B97X, \u03c9B97X-D, and \u03c9B97X-D3 only have minor improvement, due to the small fraction of HF exchange in the SR region. By contrast, SLC-PBE-D3 and SLC-B97-D3 perform comparably, slightly improve upon SLC-LDA-D3, and significantly outperform PBE, LC-\u03c9PBE, the \u03c9B97 series, and perhaps, other LC hybrid functionals adopting a small fraction of HF exchange in the SR region. For the core excitation energies, the statistical errors associated with SLC-PBE-D3 and SLC-B97-D3 are about one order of magnitude smaller than those associated with PBE, LC-\u03c9PBE, and the \u03c9B97 series! Therefore, the inclusion of a very large fraction of HF exchange at small interelectronic distances is also important for accurately describing core excitation energies.

Since the INDO Hamiltonian was not previously implemented within MOPAC, all of the capabilities discussed here are new to MOPAC. The key advances over the CNDO/INDO code are: 1. MOPAC2016 includes more advanced SCF algorithms than are available in the CNDO/INDO code. By incorporating INDO into MOPAC2016 in a way that harnesses these algorithms, I have enabled SCF convergence for systems much larger than were feasible within CNDO/INDO. 2. I have also implemented the COSMO implicit solvent model for INDO ground states and INDO/CI excited states. I previously implemented COSMO for INDO/CIS in unreleased code; 27 the COSMO correction for INDO ground states is adapted from subroutines within MOPAC, and the excited-state COSMO corrections involve new subroutines. The extension of this COSMO correction to INDO/CISD and INDO/MRCI excited states is new to this work.2.1 | INDO/S HamiltonianSince the INDO/S Hamiltonian has been described in detail many times, 43,48,50,61 I provide here a brief summary of the method. I focus here on closed-shell systems; the equations for open-shell systems are analogous. The INDO/S formalism is based on INDO/1, with parameters set to reproduce spectroscopic properties. 43,48 As in other SEQMs, INDO/S treats only the valence electrons explicitly within a minimal Slater basis set. The s and p basis functions consist of a single Slater function; the s and p Slater functions use the same exponent (\u03b6 s = \u03b6 p ). The d basis functions consist of a linear combination of two Slater functions.

Despite the fact that the three states lie in close proximity of each other, MBE-FCI succeeds in distinguishing between them. In relation to the troublesome dipole moment for the first excited state, this is also the result in Fig. 2 for which the largest discrepancy with respect to i-FCIQMC is observed. In order to determine a more accurate value of \u00b5 1 , more walkers would need be employed in i-FCIQMC and a more conservative screening protocol would need be used in the context of MBE-FCI (as for LiH in Fig. S3 of the SI). Finally, consumed core hours are presented in Table 2. As for LiH, these results once again convincingly illustrate the efficacy of the MBE-FCI method as well as the low penalty associated with computing dipole moments over correlation and excitation energies. In summary, we have reported on a new extension of MBE-FCI theory to molecular firstorder properties, valid for both ground and excited states. The performance of the resulting implementation has been verified through calculations on the first three roots of the LiH and MgO diatomics by comparing our results to state-of-the-art i-FCIQMC. On the basis of the proven accuracy and efficacy, we foresee that MBE-FCI has the potential to act as a new near-exact benchmark method for first-order properties of small-to modest-sized molecular systems in the years to come. Although the theory depends on a choice of reference space that necessarily encompasses the main determinant(s) of the target state, we are currently working on automatic selection procedures that will allow for the black-box division of a system's total set of MOs into optimal reference and expansion spaces. \n\n\nSupporting Information",

Improving the trial wave function as discussed in the previous subsection worsen the agreement. The opposite behavior is observed at T=5000 K where the better agreement between PIMC and CEIMC is observed with the improved wave function (SJE3B in the Figure). We interpret this behaviour as follows: at lower temperature the improved trial wave function (18) provides the \"correct\" electron-proton correlation (through the combined effect of the optimized Jastrow and the electron-proton backflow, see the discussion relative to Figure 6 in the previous subsection). At this temperature the electronic thermal effects on the electron-proton correlation are quite small and the electronic ground state as provided by CEIMC is quite accurate. Instead at higher temperatures electron-proton scattering is influenced by excited electronic states which are not considered in the CEIMC method. As a result the electron-proton pair correlation function shows a weaker correlation near the origin and it is in better agreement with the CEIMC result with the Slater-Jastrow trial function rather than with the CEIMC result for the improved trial function.\n\n\nHydrogen equation of state and solid-liquid phase transition of the protons\n\nWe present in this subsection, results for the equation of state (EOS) of hydrogen in the metallic phase including the solid-liquid transition of protons. These results are preliminary in various respects. Firstly, the electrons are treated at the variational level and no use of Projection/Diffusion Monte Carlo was attempted. Secondly, the protons are considered as classical point particles although it is well known that zero point motion at such high pressure can be significant (at least around the phase transition). Finally, we have data at a single density (r s = 1) and for a single system size, namely N e = N p = 32 (compatible with the fcc lattice) and we cannot address, at this stage, the issue of the relative stability of different crystal structures. Nonetheless, we believe these results are interesting because they show the applicability and provide a benchmark of the method.",

First, we start with a Hartree-Fock based DMFT Hamiltonian which avoids the double counting problems of the commonly employed DFT-DMFT scheme. Second, we have investigated the truncated configuration interaction (CISD) as an impurity solver. The CI hierarchy avoids the sign problem inherent to Monte Carlo solvers in DMFT, and allows a systematically improvable approach to the exact solution. Conversely, the DMFT framework enables even truncated CI to be extended to the infinite crystal. In the simple but challenging cubic hydrogen model we find that CI at the singles and doubles level already reproduces the structure of the density of states in the various electronic regimes with near perfect accuracy. Finally, we have carried out an investigation of some numerical aspects of the DMFT procedure, including convergence of the self-consistent cycle and convergence of properties with respect to the bath discretisation. We find that modest bath sizes, easily accessible to the CI solver, already produce converged results.\n\nThese investigations should be viewed as first steps and there are many avenues to develop these ideas. For example, the Hartree-Fock starting point in DMFT treats long-range Coulomb interactions at only the mean-field level, neglecting long-range screening. Quantum chemical perturbation techniques may be useful in treating these additional interactions and may prove complementary to current Green's function treatments of screening [8,31]. Also, there is a wealth of quantum chemical wavefunction approximations that could be combined with the DMFT framework, the most obvious example being coupled cluster theory, which should prove advantageous over configuration interaction as the number of impurity orbitals increases.\n\nAdditionally, the main ideas in this work, in particular, the use of quantum chemical Hamiltonians and solvers, are not limited to the single orbital DMFT that we have used to study cubic hydrogen. Their combination with multi-orbital and cluster versions of DMFT [17,[49][50][51] should be investigated. Finally, the possibility of using DMFT in finite systems, either within the standard DMFT formalism [52,53] or through a true finite DMFT formalism [21], or the use of DMFT ideas with quantum variables other than the Greens function are further intriguing possibilities for the future.\n\n\nVI.

Besides Lagrange multipliers \u03b5 \u03ba appear, which surprisingly approximate the quasi-particle band structure of sp metals as (from a conceptional point of view) illegitimate children of the KS-DFT (W. Kohn). But for semiconductors their KS-DFT band gaps are too small and for heavy-fermion systems the experimental effective masses are much larger than the KS-DFT ones. DFT goes beyond the correlation neglecting Hartree-Fock approximation. It is well-tried and widely used for both finite and extended (metallic and semiconducting/insulating) systems, cf. e.g. [4]. The interconnections between DFT and CC theory are studied (R.J. Bartlett at [18]). Activities are going on trying to remove deficiencies and failures of this method (e.g. the van-der-Waals interaction [68], the problems listed under (d), the asymptotic behavior of the XC potential [69]), and to generalize it, e.g. DFT for MR cases (A. Savin at [18]), time-dependent DFT [70] and its relation to QPT [71], DFT for excited states [72], DFT for transport properties [73]. In particular the originally used LDA [based on the HEG and being the Thomas-Fermi approximation on a higher level] is modified (i) by climbing the 'Jacob's ladder' via GGA and Meta-GGA up to Hyper-GGA, which are non-empirical approximations for E XC [\u03c1 1 ] designed for molecules and solids [74], (ii)",

The underlying method of CI+MBPT treats the valence-valence electron correlations using CI and incorporates core-valence interactions using MBPT. Recently the particle-hole CI+MBPT formalism has allowed important hole-excitations to be treated using CI [9], however there are computational constraints on its implementation. The size of the Hamiltonian matrix generated in the CI routine increases dramatically with the addition of more electrons which in turn places heavier demands on computational recourses. Moreover, accurate spectra calculations require the CI basis set to be large enough for saturation of the CI wavefunction. Consequently, the time and memory needed to diagonalise the CI matrix can exceed the supercomputer capacities typically available to atomic physicists before saturation is achieved. This paper presents a way of minimising the computational resources needed for CI calculations. The \"emu CI\" method (Sec. II B) can be implemented directly within existing CI+MBPT programs without sacrificing accuracy of results. We have tested the convergence of the method on the 5-valence-electron system tantalum with atomic number Z = 73, and compared our results with usual CI+MBPT and existing experimental data. We then calculate the spectra and isotope shift constants for tantalum's superheavy analogue dubnium (Z = 105) and estimated uncertainties. The method we present may allow for more accurate structure calculations in atoms with many valence electrons without the need for major modifications to existing code.\n\nTo date, it has been assumed that increasing the CI basis set will result in the calculated atomic spectra converging to a value close to the experimental data. Due to computational limits, the assumption that CI converges at large basis sets has not been tested. The emu CI modification allows for the CI basis set to be increased to very large sizes.",

The results of iteration 9 from panel (a) are chosen as representative, which are seen in panel (b) to take about 10 seconds to generate (per geometry). Visually, the results from iteration 9 match the FCI results for all bond lengths, whereas, the results from CC theory do not quite accomplish the same. The CCSD results are off by some margin at equilibrium, but the errors grow substantially as the bond is stretched, finally giving a spurious peak in the PES near the dissociation limit. The unphysical peak is a consequence of the refer-ence Hartree-Fock (HF) determinant being generated by an restricted HF (RHF) calculation in a situation where the dissociation products are two radicals. Accordingly, panel (c) also shows the CCSD result when the calculation is based upon an unrestricted (spin-polarized) HF (UHF) solution, in which case the correct dissociation limit is reached, but the errors in the bond-breaking region (and at equilibrium) remain. To investigate the remaining error, Psi4 was run at the higher CC3 level of theory. With an RHF reference, CC3 gave results in good visual agreement with FCI at equilibrium and through the bond-breaking region (and in agreement with 9 iterations of the present approach) but, as with CCSD, it gave spurious results near dissociation. Running CC3 based on a UHF reference again cured the problem at dissociation, but it caused a slight worsening of the result in the bond-breaking region, as can be seen from visual inspection panel (c).",

The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since there is a constant probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to p, so the correlations fall off exponentially.

Transient Electron Localization\n\nThe importance of nonadiabatic electron behavior has become increasingly obvious with time-resolved examination of electron dynamics occurring in the CREI regime, where the quasi-static description of electron behavior has proven incomplete [38].In fact, time-resolved studies of ionization in H 2 and electron behavior therein demonstrated not only that ionization was enhanced but also that the timing of peak ionization could be changed: at laser parameters supporting nonadiabatic behavior, ionization no longer occurred with maximum amplitude near the electric field peak.Instead, several discrete bursts of ionization occurred throughout each half-cycle of the driving laser field (see Fig. 5, [39]).\n\nAnalysis of the time-dependent electron density distribution in H 2 illustrates that bursts of ionization are accompanied by a transient electron localization upon alternating nuclear centers several times per half-field cycle of the driving laser field [38][39][40][41].This dynamic drives population toward the uphill potential well, from which it can be efficiently and rapidly ionized.This dynamic is highly sensitive to the strength and frequency of the electric field used.Different wavelengths or field strengths result in different numbers of localizations during each half-laser cycle, so that selection of the appropriate wavelength enables the localization of the wavefunction counterintuitively and predominantly on the uphill well, reminiscent of the modulated charge distribution described in [22].",

According to classical ideas, the fact that an accelerating charge loses energy by radiating implied that an electron should spiral into the nucleus and that atoms should not be stable. This problem of classical mechanics was nicely summarized by James Hopwood Jeans in 1915: \"There would be a very real difficulty in supposing that the (force) law held down to the zero values of . For the forces between two charges at zero distance would be infinite; we should have charges of opposite sign continually rushing together and, when once together, no force would tend to shrink into nothing or to diminish indefinitely in size.\" The resolution to this puzzle came in 1926 with Schr\u00f6dinger's famous equation.

We study how this feedback of the quantum system on the classical system influences the shape of two-dimensional spectra. We show that the feedback leads to the expected Stokes shift of the energy levels in the quantum system. This subsequently leads to changes in the population transfer between quantum sites, which in turn influence the intensities of the peaks in two-dimensional spectra. The obtained spectra are compared with spectra calculated using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion method which is exact. While the spectra match perfectly for short waiting times, clear differences are found for longer waiting times. This is attributed to a violation of detailed balance between the quantum states in the Ehrenfest method.

These phases are identified by means of an operator C[over ^], which is a constant of motion in only one of them. Hence, the ESQPT critical energy splits the spectrum into one phase where the equilibrium expectation values of physical observables crucially depend on this constant of motion and another phase where the energy is the only relevant thermodynamic magnitude. The trademark feature of this operator is that it has two different eigenvalues \u00b11, and, therefore, it acts as a discrete symmetry in the first of these two phases. This scenario is observed in systems with and without an additional discrete symmetry; in the first case, C[over ^] explains the change from degenerate doublets to nondegenerate eigenlevels upon crossing the critical line. We present stringent numerical evidence in the Rabi and Dicke models, suggesting that this result is exact in the thermodynamic limit, with finite-size corrections that decrease as a power law.",

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

Exploring, theoretically, black body radiation he effectively introduced the novelty that light was quantized (in units now called photons) (Planck, 1899). A single photon carries the energy E = h\u03bd, where \u03bd is the frequency of the oscillating photon field and h, or = h/2\u03c0, 3 is a universal constant with the dimension of action or angular momentum. Planck did not yet recognize in 1900 the importance of for the inner dynamical structure of atoms. Albert Einstein (1879Einstein ( -1955 postulated that photon absorption and emission is also a quantized process where one electron absorbs one photon and vice versa (Einstein, 1905). His simple collision model between photons and electrons delivered thus from the kinematics of the emitted electrons an experimental approach to determine , and explained the physics of the photoelectric effect.

This is related to the early stage of a bond-breaking process [42], particularly the reaction pathways of small molecules [43], or the redistribution of energy of DNA and RNA [3,4]. Here we idealize the two BO surfaces as harmonic potentials with an avoided crossing in the region R = 0.5 \u2212 1 Bohr. As illustrated in Fig 2(a), after vertical excitation from the equilibrium position of the lower surface, the nuclear wave packet \u03c7 starts propagating on the upper one. If we neglect the coupling of the two surfaces, \u03c7 undergoes perfect harmonic oscillations around R = 0.5 Bohr with a time period T 0 = 13.6 fs. However, because of the coupling of the surfaces, the nuclear wave packet splits into two branches as it goes through the avoided crossing. One branch stays on the upper surface while the other transfers to the lower one accompanied by energy transfer from electrons to nuclear kinetic energy. This process also breaks the time periodicity because the split wave packets feel the gradients (forces) of two different BO potentials. This is also reflected in Fig 2(c), where the rate of change of T n,marg and T n as functions of t deviate from periodic behavior when t > T0 2 . Here we focus on two points, t = T0 8 and t = 5T0 8 , roughly corresponding to the first two maxima. As shown, there is a significant decrease in dT n,marg /dt from t = T0 8 to t = 5T0 8 . To understand this change, we use our identity (19) and rewrite it as\ndT n,marg dt = \u222b |\u03c7(R, t)| 2 F (R, t)v(R, t)dR,(25)",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

The FTs show how macroscopic irreversibility arises from time reversible microscopic equations of motion: time-reversed trajectories do occur, but with increasing system size they become vanishingly rare, and the second law in its conventional form emerges. In his celebrated monograph \"What is life?\" (21), Schroedinger emphasized the importance of inverted motion saying: \"The true physical picture includes the possibility that even a regularly going clock should all at once invert its motion and, working backward, rewind its own spring -at the expense of the heat of the environment-.\" At least 6 other FTs have been reported, and differ by the details of the system's dynamics (stochastic vs. deterministic), nature of the thermostat, and initial conditions (equilibrium or nonequilibrium steady state) (22).

Consider a system kept in contact with a bath at who derived the corresponding FT for the case of a system, initially in thermal equilibrium, that is driven out of equilibrium by the action of an external agent (BoxRef-c). Let xF(s) denote a nonequilibrium process that starts at equilibrium in state A, lasts for a time t , and ends in a nonequilibrium state at B. We will call this the forward process. Let us now consider the reverse process were the system starts at equilibrium in state B and ends in a non equilibrium state at A. The nonequilibrium protocol for the reverse process xR(s) is time-reversed respect to the forward one, xR(s) = xF(t-s) so both processes last for the same time t. Let PF(W) and PR(-W) stand for the work probability distributions along the forward and reversed processes respectively. In such conditions the Crooks FT (CFT) applies,",

This is usually done system by system. A natural question to ask is if there is a one-to-one correspondence between unit vectors and physical states, meaning that if every unit vector corresponds to a physical system. This is resolved by the following corollary that is a primary ingredient for quantum computation theory (see Ref. [22] Chapter 7).\n\nCorollary 1 All unit vectors of a finite Hilbert space correspond to possible physical states of a system.\n\nUnit vectors are also called pure states. If we know the pure state of a system, we have all physical information about it, and we can calculate the probabilistic outcomes of any potential measurement (see the next postulate). This is a very improbable situation as experimental settings are not perfect, and in most cases, we have only imperfect information about the state. Most generally, we may know that a quantum system can be in one state of a set {|\u03c8 i } with probabilities p i . Therefore, our knowledge of the system is given by an ensemble of pure states described by the set {|\u03c8 i , p i }. If more than one p i is different from zero the state is not pure anymore, and it is called a mixed state. The mathematical tool that describes our knowledge of the system, in this case, is the density operator (or density matrix).\n\u03c1 \u2261 i p i |\u03c8 i \u03c8 i |.(1)\nDensity matrices are bounded operators that fulfil two mathematical conditions 1.

Rather than postulating them and investigating the consequence of each definition, as is customary, here we adopt a bottom-up approach and construct the entropy expression within the microcanonical formalism upon two fundamental thermodynamic pillars: (i) The second law of thermodynamics as formulated for quasistatic processes: \u03b4Q/T is an exact differential, and (ii) the law of ideal gases: PV=k(B)NT. The first pillar implies that entropy must be some function of the phase volume \u03a9. The second pillar singles out the logarithmic function among all possible functions. Hence the construction leads uniquely to the expression S=k(B)ln\u03a9, that is, the volume entropy. As a consequence any entropy expression other than that of Gibbs, e.g., the Boltzmann entropy, can lead to inconsistencies with the two thermodynamic pillars. We illustrate this with the prototypical example of a macroscopic collection of noninteracting spins in a magnetic field, and show that the Boltzmann entropy severely fails to predict the magnetization, even in the thermodynamic limit. The uniqueness of the Gibbs entropy, as well as the demonstrated potential harm of the Boltzmann entropy, provide compelling reasons for discarding the latter at once.",

It also lent credence to statistical mechanics, which had been controversial at that time, as well. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists debated whether atoms were real entities. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope.

It applies to systems composed of many particles, however, we are seeing that one can formulate laws of thermodynamics when only a small number of particles are interacting with a heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we find that for processes which are approximately cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a different form compared to the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but an entire family of constraints. We find a family of free energies which generalize the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law relates to one of these, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. We find three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are relevant for small systems, and also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics are unified in this framework, with the first law defining the class of operations, the zeroth law emerging as an equivalence relation between thermal states, and the remaining laws being monotonicity of our generalized free energies.

According to the exponential relaxation observed for many phenomena, this distribution is known to approach the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at high temperature. Indeed, the probability that a white stretch contains precisely \u03b5 \u2021 beads follows a geometric law plus 1, such that the (\u03b5 \u2021 + 1)th bead to be drawn should be black. Hence, Fig.2 and whose maxima are precisely obtained when \u03b5 = \u03b5 \u2021 . This simple probability distribution indeed approaches the Boltzmann's one when \u03b5 is large enough.

Probability distribution of particles with energy \u03b5 \u2021 , when increasing the mean energy per particle \u03b5 (that is to say the temperature). and given that\nP (\u03b5 = \u03b5 \u2021 ) = \u03b5 1 + \u03b5 \u03b5 \u2021 1 1 + \u03b5 (15) illustrated inP (\u03b5 = \u03b5 \u2021 ) \u223c e \u2212 \u03b5 \u2021 \u03b5 1 \u2212 e \u2212 1 \u03b5 (16)\u221e j=0 e \u2212 j \u03b5 = 1 \u2212 e \u2212 1 \u03b5 \u22121 (17) one obtains P (\u03b5 = \u03b5 \u2021 ) \u223c e \u2212 \u03b5 \u2021 \u03b5 \u221e j=0 e \u2212 j \u03b5(18)\nwhich is similar to the celebrated formula of Boltzmann, obtained using the entropy maximizing procedure and which predicts that the probability that any particle has an amount of energy E i is\nP (E i ) = e \u2212\u03b2E i / n j=0 e \u2212\u03b2E j(19)\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/k B T and the denominator is the canonical partition function summed over the n possible microstates [13].

For small systems, the simple geometric plus 1 law of Eq.(15) is preferable. The value of the rate constant of Eq.(13) obtained using the simple necklace toy model, is also very similar to the transition-state rate derived from a Hamiltonian, described for example in [5].",

The C8 and C10 are used for the smooth connection at Rout. For the others we introduce values to be consistent with ab initio results and the asymptotic atom pair correlation. The rovibrational level for the desired quantum state v', N'=J' +/ \u2212 1/2 and F 2/1 is calculated by solving the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation for such a potential. The eigen energy replaces the one of the Dunham description in the matrix in Table 1. Using in total 9 potential parameters instead of 11 Dunham parameters we obtain a good fit with a standard deviation of \u03c3=0.012 cm \u22121 which is equal to the one with the pure Dunham approach. The differences of the two rovibrational ladders as function of N' undulate around zero with an amplitude of about 0.01 cm \u22121 but increase to larger values for high N', which is probably related to the high order centrifugal distortion function constructed by the Dunham approach. We should mention that the other molecular parameters are also slightly changed by the simultaneous fit of all parameters directing to the correlation between all parameters which is different in both approaches. The parameters from the potential approach are given in the appendix.",

We compare our results with calculations from the literature in Table 2. The present calculations were carried out assuming C 2v symmetry, as in past studies. The obtained geometries and energies agree well with the past calculations. Among the states we calculated, we found that the lowest 1 2 B 2 and the highest 1 2 A 2 excited states are both linear, and the intermediate 1 2 B 1 has a bent geometry, with a wider Li-H-Li angle than in the ground state geometry. Our excitation energies are in best agreement with the values of Allouche et al. [9] for the 1 2 B 2 and 1 2 B 1 , and differ by only 630 cm \u22121 from the UMP2 values of Fang et al. [8] over a 17,428 cm \u22121 transition. The present equilibrium Li-H bond length is longer in these states than those in the past studies, except the value of Talbi et al. [6].

The distribution of the calculation points in the parameter space is shown in Figure 1, with the points colored according to the absolute energy value. About half of the points are chosen according to uniform random number generator in the range, and the others are concentrated near the global minimum energy point according to Gaussian distribution. Additionally, several hundred calculation points are added near the minimum energy path (MEP) from the global minimum energy point to the barrier to the linear conformation. Figure 2 shows the statistics on the number of calculation points against the energy measured from the global minimum energy at intervals of 100 cm \u22121 .

If the temperature is low enough, that may be the case for practically all molecules. One then says that those degrees of freedom are \"frozen\".

These modes are often coupled to nearly degenerate overtone and combination bands, greatly complicating the interpretation of the spectra. When molecules or clusters contain multiple XH groups, assigning spectra is difficult, especially when multiple conformers are present. We consider approaches appropriate for addressing these difficulties, focusing on systems with more than 15 atoms. At this size, the densities of states of these fundamentals are sufficiently high that it is not possible to calculate eigenstate-resolved spectra. Nonetheless, combining perturbation theory, empirical scalings of vibrational frequencies, and variational treatments of reduced dimensional Hamiltonians, one can identify and model the vibrational coupling pathways that influence observed spectral features.

The calculation of the multidimensional Wigner integrals is made feasible by the introduction of a local harmonic approximation. A systematic analysis has been performed of the temperature and mole-fraction dependences of the VER rate constant, as well as the relative contributions of centrifugal and potential forces, and of different types of quantum effects. The results were found to be in very good quantitative agreement with experiment, and they suggest that this semiclassical approximation can capture the quantum enhancement, by many orders of magnitude, of the experimentally observed VER rate constants over the corresponding classical predictions.",

In a nutshell, the 2PT approach for rigid polyatomic molecules 22 describes decompositions of the translational and rotational VDoS of a liquid into two separate additive contributions, I trans/rot HS (\u03bd) and I trans/rot HO (\u03bd). These describe the VDoS of slow diffusive and fast vibrational degrees of freedom, respectively. The former are modeled in terms of a hard sphere (HS) fluid model constructed from the particle density and diffusion coefficient observed in the liquid (the zero frequency response of the VDoS). The VDoS of the HS model can be described by an analytical function, which includes structural relaxation processes also at nonzero frequencies. This analytic HS-model VDoS is then subtracted from the total VDoS of the liquid, leaving a remaining partial VDoS with no diffusive contributions at zero frequencies, which is then modeled analytically as a continuous set of harmonic oscillators (HO). In this approach, the HS model thus effectively describes diffusive motion and anharmonic effects that would not be included in a purely harmonic treatment.\n\nThe partition function and entropy of (1) the HS model for diffusive translational degrees of freedom and (2) the HO model for vibrations can both be expressed analytically. To express the entropy of diffusive rotational degrees of freedom, the hard sphere model is replaced by a rigid rotor (RR) expression. 22 This leads to a molecular entropy expression in terms of a sum of weighted integrals of the VDoS for the distinct degrees of freedom",

We benchmark VHCI on four molecules with 12-48 degrees of freedom and use anharmonic potential energy surfaces truncated at fourth and sixth orders.

Using Jacobian operations and Maxwell relations, the isothermal compressibility (\u03ba T ) can be related to adiabatic compressibility (\u03ba S ), and the heat capacity at constant volume (c V ) to the heat capacity at constant pressure (c P ) (equation (5)) [1]. An analogous mathematical approach used in thermodynamics to develop equation (5) will be used later on. In this work, all these equivalent mathematical relations will be derived for a molecular system where the fundamental equation is the potential energy of the molecule and the independent variables are the nuclear normal coordinates and the elements of an external uniform electric (or magnetic) field vector. Similar equalities are formulated from mixed third-order partial derivatives of the energy and other Legendre representations. The obtained relations carry practical uses in alternative and faster ways of computing properties used in vibrational spectroscopy and electrodynamics such as the Stark and Zeeman Tuning Rates, permanent dipolar moments and polarizabilities. In most cases, these parameters can be obtained by means of these novel relations without the application of an external electric or magnetic field during their computation, thus reducing the cost of the calculation. Furthermore, relations obtained by Jacobian operations show other connections between these electrodynamics parameters.",

The calculated and available experimental thermodynamic data for zero point energy, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity are compared. It is found that the anharmonicity and coupling of molecular vibrations can play a significant role in predicting accurate thermodynamic quantities.

The basic assumption is that each vibration can be treated as though it corresponds to a spring. In the harmonic approximation the spring obeys Hooke's law: the force required to extend the spring is proportional to the extension. The proportionality constant is known as a force constant, k. The anharmonic oscillator is considered elsewhere. By Newton's second law of motion this force is also equal to a reduced mass, \u03bc, times acceleration. Since this is one and the same force the ordinary differential equation follows. The solution to this equation of simple harmonic motion is A is the maximum amplitude of the vibration coordinate Q. It remains to define the reduced mass, \u03bc. In general, the reduced mass of a diatomic molecule, AB, is expressed in terms of the atomic masses, mA and mB, as",

It is called the \"vibrational mean field configuration interaction\" (VMFCI) method, and consists in performing vibrational configuration interactions (VCI) for selected modes in the mean field of the others. The same partition of modes can be iterated until self-consistency, generalizing the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) method. As in contracted-mode methods, a hierarchy of partitions can be built to ultimately contract all the modes together. So, the VMFCI method extends the traditional variational approaches and can be included in existing vibrational codes based on the latter approaches. The flexibility and efficiency of this new method are demonstrated on several molecules of atmospheric interest.",

This argument cannot be directly applied to the photoelectron spectrum of the hydrated electron. It would paint the picture of the hydrated electron as a structureless entity coupling randomly to a surrounding nearequilibrium bulk liquid. In reality, the hydrated electron consists of the electron itself and the cavity where it resides. From all we know, the vertically ionized state of the hydrated electron, i.e. the empty cavity, is far from any equilibrium structure of the liquid. This could easily give rise to a pronounced vibrational progression in the (genuine) binding energy spectrum of the hydrated electron, especially in the OH-stretch vibration of the water molecules coupling most strongly to it. The central limit theorem describes the inhomogeneous broadening of a transition within a certain limit, but not such homogeneous structures of a transition. Therefore, the central limit theorem cannot predict whether the genuine band shape for excitation in the UV is Gaussian or not.\n\nThe recent work of Suzuki and coworkers [3,4] shows experimentally that the genuine binding energy spectrum for excitations in the XUV (27.9 and 29.45 eV [3]) is indeed Gaussian. The genuine binding energy spectrum, however, depends on both the initial and the final state of the photoionization transition. Therefore, the observation of a Gaussian band shape for XUV excitation cannot predict the band shape for UV excitation. Note that the \"retrieval method\" in refs. [3,4] does not allow to deduce the genuine band shape either. It just makes the ad-hoc assumption that the band shape is independent of the excitation energy. Thus, it is clear that for UV excitation there is so far no demonstration and no firm argument of a single Gaussian genuine band shape -contrary to ref. [1].",

Consistent with this, the kinetic energy implied by Eq. (24) is correct only for independent and non-interacting electrons. This was the key to progress because the Hohenberg-Kohn analysis implied that the kinetic energy of a strictly noninteracting system of electrons is also a functional of the density. If we call this functional T S [n], ordinary quantum mechanics specifies that [103] \nT S [n] = N k=1 \u03c6 * k (r) \u2212 2 2m \u2207 2 \u03c6 k (r) dr.(27)\nThe path was now open for Sham to derive the Hartree equations from a density functional point of view (Kohn 2001a). He chose the approximate total energy functional\nE H [n] = T S [n] + v(r) n(r) dr + e 2 2 n(r) n(r \u2032 ) |r \u2212 r \u2032 | dr dr \u2032 ,(28)\nand minimized it with respect to a density assumed to have the form in Eq.

We proceed in the following manner. First of all we fix an electric field value corresponding to some negative electric charge concentration n in the well 1. Then we evaluate the hole tunneling rate and give a starting value to the electron tunneling rate (for instance that obtained for n 1 = n) so we can deduce some charge concentrations by Eq. (8). From these concentrations we evaluate a new electron tunneling rate by Eq. (6) and from that new charge concentrations. After few iterations, the electron tunneling rate and the charge concentrations converge to the solution corresponding to the value of the electric field fixed at the beginning. At this point we compare the values of the tunneling current densities. If J e > J h the electric field is increased, if J e < J h the electric field is decreased. The procedure is repeated until the steady-state condition J e = J h is reached. Note that the existence of the ambipolar regime does not rely upon the value of the excitation intensity, i.e. G 1 and G 2 . However, the value of the electric field established in the steady state strongly depends on the excitation intensity.",

One way to think about this fact is that the electron states near the top of the band have negative effective mass, and those near the bottom of the band have positive effective mass, so the net motion is exactly zero. If an otherwise-almost-full valence band has a state without an electron in it, we say that this state is occupied by a hole. There is a mathematical shortcut for calculating the current due to every electron in the whole valence band: Start with zero current (the total if the band were full), and subtract the current due to the electrons that would be in each hole state if it wasn't a hole. Since subtracting the current caused by a negative charge in motion is the same as adding the current caused by a positive charge moving on the same path, the mathematical shortcut is to pretend that each hole state is carrying a positive charge, while ignoring every other electron state in the valence band.",

At its introduction in 1981, the QH method was successfully applied to simple molecular systems with only one highly occupied energy well, and fluctuations were analyzed in a system of internal bond-angle-torsion coordinates. However, more recent studies have applied the QH method to complex biomolecular systems and have relied upon Cartesian coordinates. The present study evaluates the accuracy of the QH method through comparisons with more detailed methods. The chief findings are that the QH method can markedly overestimate the configurational entropy for systems with multiple occupied energy wells and that such errors tend to be magnified by the use of Cartesian coordinates instead of bond-angle-torsion coordinates.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom. Bohr won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to our understanding of the structure of atoms and how that is related to line spectra emissions.",

HCTH/ 147@3-21G, for example, denotes an HCTH functional fit- ted to the 147 set with a 3-21G basis set. The first column contains the rms energy error of the functional for the atomization and dissociation energies, electron affinities, proton affinities, and ionization potentials in the 147 Set. The second column displays the sum of all the gradients calculated at the equilibrium geometry in atomic units. The gradients have been shown to correlate with the accuracy of the bond distances and angles obtained. 8,11 The third column is the square of all the errors in the exchange-correlation potential contributions. All three errors are actually fitted according to Eq. 4. In the fourth column, we evaluate Q, which is the sum of all three weighted errors with uniform weights rather than \u2340:\nQ\u03ed750\u03eb \u035a m n E \u0351 E m exact \u03eaE m K\u03eaS \u0352 2 \u03e9500\u03eb \u035a l,X n G \u0369 \u202b\u05e5\u202cE l K\u03eaS \u202b\u05e5\u202cX \u036a 2 \u03e9 \u035a j, n v \u0375 \u0351 v j, ZM P \u03e9k j, \u03eav j, K\u03eaS \u0352 2 j, 2/3 dr. \u03515\u0352\nSince all three contributions are important and the GGA functionals have been fit to a value similar to Q, it is probably the most important diagnostic.

Bethe was able to derive the Lamb shift by implementing the idea of mass renormalization, which allowed him to calculate the observed energy shift as the difference between the shift of a bound electron and the shift of a free electron. The Lamb shift currently provides a measurement of the fine-structure constant \u03b1 to better than one part in a million, allowing a precision test of quantum electrodynamics.
