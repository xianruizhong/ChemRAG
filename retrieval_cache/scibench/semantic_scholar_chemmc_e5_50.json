The de Broglie relation p = m n v = h/λ was used to determine h/m n = λv for the neutron by measuring both its de Broglie wavelength λ and corresponding velocity v. More specifically, the de Broglie wavelength, λ ≈ 0.25 nm, of slow neutrons was determined using back reflection from a silicon crystal, and the velocity, v ≈ 1600 m/s, of the neutrons was determined by a special time-of-flight method.

We assume a Gaussian temporal pulse shape, characterized by a full width at half maximum (FWHM), a laser wavelength λ, and a laser fluence F , as described in Appendix B. In agreement with experiments done in Ref. [9], here we choose λ = 400 nm, FWHM = 150 fs, and we consider two fluences, F = 50 and 170 J/m 2 , respectively. For a critical look on (further) approximations made within the TTM, which we test here, a few details should be mentioned. Notably, the C el,ph in Eqs. (2) and (3) are electron and phonon heat capacities, κ el is the electronic heat conductivity, and g is the electron-phonon-coupling constant. The choice of the latter is described in Appendix B. The phonon heat capacity C ph is calculated using the Debye model [36] for the Cu crystal, also described in Appendix B. The T el dependence of the electronic heat capacity C el is usually approximated in a free-electron, Sommerfeld model as linear,\nC el (T el ) = γ el T el ,(4)",

Experiments are being arranged to test this point.It may be mentioned that from the point of view of energy transfer the fact that the surface of the metal is composed of micro-crystals does not matter. So long as the mechanism is one of diffraction, it does not make any difference in what direction the atoms are diffracted. On the other hand in Stern's experiments any micro-crystalline structure or variation of crystalline orienta tion in the surface would diminish the intensity of the reflected and diffracted beams, and, therefore, we should expect that values of the fraction/deduced from diffraction experiments would be smaller than those deduced from experiments on accommodation coefficients.\n\n\nm = mass of gas atom, M = mass of solid atom, (3 = (M2 + m2)/(M -j-m)2.

To calculate this coefficient, we need the photo-ionization cross section and the EUV energy. The cross section is taken from Saito and Suzuki [3]. The spectrally resolved EUV pulse energy is calculated from the relative EUV spectrum recorded by Kieft [18] and a wavelength integrated energy measurement of the EUV source (53 µJ per pulse). This results in a linear coefficient of 2 × 10 16 m −3 Pa −1 , which corresponds well with the experimental value (1.4 × 10 16 m −3 Pa −1 ). When we decrease the EUV energy by a factor 3 to 17 µJ, the theoretical coefficient also decreases by a factor 3 due to the linear dependence on the EUV pulse energy. This is also observed experimentally (a factor 2.8 ± 0.8).",

( 92)) as the QD potential.We solve Eq. ( 91) by expanding the wave function Φ n in the Fock-Darwin basis (Darwin, 1930;Fock, 1928).The eigenenergies and eigenfunctions are determined by diagonalizing the matrix within the Fock-Darwin basis.Figure 2 (a) compares the energy levels of the infinite and finite parabolic potential.From Figs. 2 (a) and (b) we can see that the ground state (0, 0) and the first excited state (0, ±1) of the finite parabolic potential are not very different from the infinite parabolic potential for R 0 =2.37 a 0 ,w h e r e a 0 = √ h/m * ω 0 .However, the state (1, 0) is quite different for the two potentials.We also see that the finite parabolic potential with R 0 = 2.37a 0 supports three discrete levels only.\n\n\nElastic scattering",

The wave nature of electrons was experimentally confirmed by the first electron diffraction measurements on crystals in 1927 [Davisson1927, Thomson1927], followed by the first gasphase electron diffraction measurements in 1930 that demonstrated the successful molecular structure retrieval of carbon tetrachloride, CCl4 [Mark1930]. In these early electron diffraction measurements, the interatomic distances were initially determined by measuring the positions of the maxima and minima on the interference pattern [Wierl1930], before the more direct method of Fourier-transforming the interference signal was adopted soon afterwards to obtain a radial distribution function that is related to the probability distribution of interatomic distances [Pauling1935]. In this radial distribution function, the centre of the peaks represents the average internuclear distance value, whilst the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) corresponds to its vibrational amplitude [James1932]. Gas-phase electron diffraction has successfully identified the static structures of neutral molecules [Allen1950, Sciaini2011, Centurion2016], molecular ions [Turman1968], stable [Bohn1967] and unstable [Schäfer1968] free radicals, and conformers in conformational mixtures [Hassel1943, Bastiansen1946, Mirono1985].",

We used weaker field intensity E 0 than in Ref. [28]; −1.54 and −1.48 V/cm, that is, the laser intensity of 1.12 × 10 14 and 1.08 × 10 14 W/cm 2 , as these values were found to be just above and below the threshold of ionizing trajectories for the present model. The positive direction of the field was defined to be that from Li to H. Here, the Li-H bond length was set to be 2.3 bohr following Ref. [28]. At t = 0, the LiH molecule is in the singlet ground state. We added the Lorentz force from the electric field to the equations of motion (6) for the WP center. Figure 3 displays the ionizing and non-ionizing (bound) trajectories of the WP center and width. In the initial time up to ∼5.7 fs, both the ionizing and bound trajectories of the WP center mostly follow the time profile of the laser field, except the small hump at t = 3.2 fs. Then, the ionizing trajectory starts to oscillate in an amplitude as large as 12 bohr, recombines to the molecule, and dissociates after 10 fs. Associated with this large amplitude oscillation of the WP center, the WP width broadens when the WP center departs from the molecule, and spreads to the free electron state. In the bound trajectory, the WP center remains around the molecule, but the oscillation amplitude of ∼5 bohr is about twice the Li-H bond length of 2.3 bohr. Figure 4 displays the Fourier transformed dipole acceleration that gives the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectrum [29,30]. For comparison, the result from the TD-CASCI of Ref. [28] is included. The present results do not exhibit clear plateau and cut-off that are considered to be the characteristics of the laser-induced HHG spectra.

( 1), Fowler proposed a method to determine work function.The method is well known as Fowler plot [3].For the relation between the yield of photoelectron emission and photon energy Bouwman and Sachtler [4] adopted an approximated equation:\nI = M (hν − ϕ) 2 2k 2 .

The work function changes observed following potassium deposition on a clean Rh(111) surface were reported previously [49]. The work function of Rh decreased linearly with K exposure up to ΘK ~ 0.15, (Δϕ = −3.5 eV. Further K deposition led to a slight increase (0.5 eV) in (Δϕ. The large linear decrease in the work function at low potassium coverages indicates the formation of a species with high dipole moment; the formation of an ionic K. Above ΘK = 0.15, a strong dipole-dipole depolarization starts to compensate the effect of the increasing K concentration, (formation of metallic potassium). Independently of the potassium coverage the adsorption of FA at 300 K resulted in work function increases ( Figure 5A). The extent of increase is proportional with the K coverage. Heating of the coadsorbed layer resulted in a complex picture ( Figure 5B). A decrease in the work function corresponds to the desorption and decomposition of adsorbed HCOOH species. Above 600 K the work function started to increase slowly. The original value for the clean Rh surface was attained only above 900-1000 K. \n\n\nWork Function (∆φ) and UPS Measurements",

By definition, work function is assume to be the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a solid surface to vacuum instantaneously and defined as follows [13],\nφ = V e(+∞) − E F(10)\nwhere, E F and φ correspond to the Fermi level and work function, V e(+∞) is the electrostatic potential of an electron distant from the surface which we can consider to be zero i.e., V e(+∞) = 0. Hence, the work function is numerically equal to the Fermi level energy, φ = − E f . The field emission characteristics of the nanosheet are altered by varying work function which may consequently end up in changing the gate voltage. This is well explained by the Richardson-Dushman equation [58], The change of work function after adsorption can be calculated by the following formula [59]:\nj = AT 2 e (− φ/kT)(11)Δφ = φ f − φ i φ i × 100%(12)",

Therefore, in the majority of ribosome models derived from conventional data collection used for X-ray structures, metal ions are usually assigned as magnesium-the best-known RNA-stabilizing atom. Consequently, the local chemical environment of the metal ions was interpreted from the point of view of octahedral coordination.\n\nAnomalous X-ray diffraction is a very well established tool to determine and localize ions in three-dimensional structures 48,49 . Every chemical element displays a characteristic set of absorption edges in the X-ray range, corresponding to the binding energies of electrons (K, L, M electron shells corresponding to K-, L-, Medges). The anomalous signal from atoms of the element under investigation changes drastically across its absorption edge. Hence, peaks in the anomalous difference Fourier map from measurements on the high-energy side, which are not present in data on the low-energy side, reveal the atomic positions of the anomalous scatterers. The majority of synchrotron beamlines for macromolecular crystallography are optimized for the 6-17.5 keV X-ray range 50 . However, to detect and measure the anomalous signal from potassium around its K-edge (E = 3.608 keV) access to lower energies is necessary. The long-wavelength beamline I23 at Diamond Light Source is currently the only synchrotron beamline for macromolecular crystallography covering the energy range around the potassium K-edge. Experiments at long wavelengths have a number of obstacles to overcome: mainly large diffraction angles and absorption from air in the beam path, the sample mount, solvent around the crystal and the crystal itself. Beamline I23 has been designed to address these challenges by operating in a vacuum environment with a multi-axis goniometer and a large semi-cylindrical area detector 51 .",

To shift an ionization threshold, the kernel would need to be complex, with a branch cut at the position of the KS threshold. This is not the case for the first ionization threshold, but is for all higher ionizations. On the other hand, since we show that, typically, the oscillator strength of the KS system is corrected by TDDFT, this means that, at the threshold, the Hartree-XC kernel must have some non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements. To understand this, [11] showed that, in the absence of off-diagonal matrix elements, the KS oscillator strengths are unchanged by the action of the kernel. In this paper we will show the answer to the title question is no. To prove that the KS oscillator strength doesn't have to be exact at the ionization threshold, we only need to provide a counter-example, so we study the helium oscillator strength spectrum in this paper. The helium atom is the simplest multi-electron system, and thus a theorists' favorite. Fig. 1 shows the photoabsorption spectrum of Helium near the ionization threshold(24.6 eV), and the two curves are of the real helium and of the exact ground-state KS helium. Fig. 1 suggests the answer to the title question is no, but there could conceivably be near-degeneracies near the ionization threshold, and we wish to demonstrate that the oscillator strength curve can be expected to be smooth near the ionization threshold explicitly. Hence we use a fit to explicitly show that the oscillator strength curves of the real helium and the KS helium are smooth across the ionization threshold, showing there are no near-degeneracies at the threshold. This allows the comparison of the value of the oscillator strengths at the ionization threshold of these two systems, showing that the difference between the spectra near the threshold of KS and real systems is inherent. Since our purpose is to understand the difference between KS system and the real system, the fit is not done to the data points but to the general properties, such as the oscillator strength sum rules. We test our fit on the hydrogen oscillator strength spectrum, and then apply the fit to KS helium, real helium, and the result of using approximated TDDFT on the exact ground-state KS spectrum.\n\n\nII.

The twofold difference is an artifact of the choice to use the citrine/ECFP ratio in the calculations, as shown by Krezel and co-workers for FRET sensors in general (59). Whereas metal binding is not necessarily directly coupled to a conformational change, this does seem to be true for the lighter Ln III ions binding to LanM, and data below suggest it is also the case for Mn II binding to LanM variants (vide infra). Therefore, the FRET ratio changes are directly tied to the conformational changes in the Mn II -binding domains and likely to Mn II binding itself-an important observation for the interpretation of selectivity trends in our sensors.",

Series: Materials Science and Engineering 1008 (2020) 012032 IOP Publishing 1\nFor pure metals aluminum and magnesium and for chemical compounds Al3Mg, Al2Mg, AlMg and AlMg3 with crystallographic orientations (100), (110) and (111) the work function is calculated from the first principles in the framework of the density functional theory. It is shown that the dependence of the work function on the magnesium concentration in aluminium is nonlinear. The reasons for the work function differences of chemical compounds depending on the crystallographic orientation are analysed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWork function is the important emissivity characteristic for the cathodes that operate on the basis of thermionic and field emission, photo-and ion-induced electron emission phenomena. The lower work function the higher emission currents the cathode is able to produce. The emission ability of a cathode depends on the material from which it is made. For this reason, the cathode materials must have a low work function.\n\nOne of the ways to reduce the work function of the cathode is to introduce into the cathode material chemical elements with a low work function. In a rough approximation, the integral work function is the sum of the work function of chemical elements, taking into account the areas they occupy on the emitting surface of the cathode. Meanwhile, the introduced chemical elements can form chemical compounds with the cathode material, so that the work function of the compounds can be a nonadditive sum relative to the work function of the cathode elements. In particular, such non-additive behavior of mechanical properties is observed in in-situ metal-matrix composites [1][2][3][4][5][6]. For a reasonable choice of the combination of chemical elements in the cathode material, it is necessary to know the work function of the cathode chemical compounds.",

For the present AuNP monolayer, the absorption is determined by FDTD simulations and shows high absorption at 488 and 532 nm and low absorption at 633 and 785 nm (see Supporting Information 2e), which affect k in the hot carrier and thermally influenced reactions.

For any interacting electronic problem, the exact ground-state KS system is described by the KS equations [2]:\n− 1 2 ∇ 2 + v s (r) ψ i (r) = ǫ i ψ i (r),(1)\nwhere\nn(r) = N i=1 |ψ i (r)| 2 .(2)\nHere and unless otherwise noted, we use atomic units so that energies are in Hartrees and distances in Bohr radii. The KS orbitals and eigenenergies are denoted as ψ i (r) and ǫ i , and v s (r) is the KS potential, which can be separated into 3 pieces: external, Hartree, and exchange-correlation(XC) potential [2,3]. The exact dependence of the XC contribution on the density is unknown and many approximation schemes are available, but in this article we use the exact value [9]. This is calculated by first obtaining the accurate density from a quantum Monte-Carlo calculation, then inserting the density into the KS equations and finding the potential that gives this density. [9] The absorption spectrum in terms of photoabsorption cross section σ is defined as below [14]:\nσ(ω) = 2π 2 c q f q δ(ω − ω q ) + σ cont (ω),(3)\nwhere q denotes bound-to-bound transitions from state i to state f, f q is the oscillator strength of transition q, and σ cont which begins at ω = I is the spectrum of the continuum region. For bound-to-bound transitions, the oscillator strengths are defined as:\nf q = 2ω q | Ψ f |r| Ψ i | 2 .(4)\nAs defined in Eqn. (3), the spectrum comprises the discrete bound-to-bound transitions and the continuous bound-to-continuum transitions. We defineσ(ω) as the analytical continuation of σ cont (ω) for ω < I. This can be found easily by considering the bound oscillator strength as a continous function of ω q , yielding [14] σ\n(ω) = f (ω)/ dǫ dn ǫ=ω−I .(5)",

Похожие результаты были получены и для диплоидных дрожжевых клеток -при снижении концентрации цисплатина с 835 до 167 мкмоль/л для обеспечения максимального синергического эффекта необходимо было уменьшать действующую температуру, при которой происходило облучение, от 52,5 до 50,5 oС соответственно. Эти данные показывают, что чем меньше концентрация цисплатина, тем меньшее значение применяемой температуры будет обеспечивать заданное значение коэффициента синергизма.

We now focus on how this unique solution can be computed.For convenience, we drop the subscript θ from Q n,θ and denote this matrix as Q n in this section.Observe that matrix Q n is singular (as Rank(Q n ) = n − 1) and usually very large in size.This poses difficulties in solving (3.31) with standard large-scale linear solvers that are currently in use (see Section 3.4).To overcome these issues, we solve the Poisson equation (3.31) using the Basis Function Method (BFM) which we describe next.This method is approximate in nature, but it is computationally very feasible and it often yields a very accurate estimate of the solution of the Poisson equation.",

In this expansion, K 1 and the µ n ) are to be extracted from S(q, τ ) via non-linear least sqare fitting methods, e.g., the simplex algorithm.\n\n(There are two very different classes of simplex algorithm. The useful one here is the Nelder-Mead [27] functional minimization approach. The other simplex approach is Dantzig's linear programming method [28].) The first three K n are the same as the first three µ n , but the higher-order K n and µ n are different.\n\nBefore the series are truncated, equations 11-13 are all ways to write g (1) (q, τ ) as a convergent exact power series, using expansion coefficients that are readily described in terms of the Laplace transform A(Γ) of g (1) (q, τ ). The infinite series are therefore appropriate to describe an arbitrary A(Γ). Some truncated series may have numerical stability issues if τ covers a wide range of times; the Frisken expansion of eq. 13 avoids these. Under practical conditions, one fits the complete g (1) (q, τ ) or S(q, τ ) to eq. 11, eq. 12, or eq. 13 while varying N upwards from 1, and uses the smallest N such that further increases in N do not substantially improve the quality of the fit.",

This recovers exactly the expansion in Eq. (6.4) of Ref B. The asymptotic expansion is evaluated at N + 1 rather than at N in the regular EM formula. This confers two distinct advantages: For a given order, our errors are typically much smaller when the index is increased by 1, and secondly, since the order of optimal truncation is πN , by evaluating at N + 1, three additional orders are added to the optimally truncated series, with their concommitant improvement in accuracy. We note that one need only evaluate each contribution in Eq. 59 at the upper end. Taking N = 0 and subtracting then yields S N , guaranteeing correctly its vanishing for N = 0. Thus we have recovered the main one-dimensional result of Ref B without need for (but also missing the elegance of) regularizing sums as N → ∞. Eq. 59 can be applied directly to finite wells, such as PT or the truncated linear half-well of Ref. [81]. We show some results from the summation formula for the linear half well in Fig. 5 for N = 1, where E 1 = 1 . The summation formula is less accurate than the original formula for M = 0, but is much more accurate even for M = 3 (by two orders of magnitude). More importantly, its optimal truncation is at 6, producing almost 3 orders of magnitude in improvement, i.e., going from milliHartrees to microHartrees errors! To see that this is due to our evaluation at N + 1, in Fig. 6 we add in the second eigenvalue and the second sum, E 2 = 1 + 2 . Its error curve is almost identical to that of the summation formula for the first level. Of course, the summation formula for the 2nd level has leaped ahead again, with errors of nanoHartrees at the optimal truncation of M = 9! Finally, we attempt to show the error in the 6th level in Fig. 7. The black line here is for the error in individual level, and so matches the purple line of Fig. 5. But the blue line is the error in the summation formula, which",

Having taken for the particle's mass 1g and for its velocity 100 m/s, we obtain for the rate of phase change at reflection, values of the order of 10 23 radians per second. The precise values, coming from the difference function in equation (11) , depend on the distance from the barrier and from the starting point of the particle.\n\nThe acquisition by classical systems of very large phases within a very short time period is likely to be quite general. It is expected that it is rooted in the reciprocal relations between the two quantities (moduli and phases) or, equivalently, in the circumstance that they are parts of the same analytic function. Thus as the logarithm of the modulus increases (numerically), then so does the phase.\n\nWhile it is of a speculative nature, one would imagine a similar phenomenon to occur during a wave-function collapse. It is widely held that the collapse is caused by a (phase-) decoherence process, which takes place while the quantum component is coupled to (entangled with) the classical component (e.g. ref. 11). On the basis of our results that the sudden switching from one (positive mean momentum) state to another (negative mean momentum) state by a macroscopic object causes the sudden acquisition of a large phase, we might expect a similar phase-increase to occur in the macroscopic part of the combined quantum-classical system. A tiny variation in this macro-phase will suffice to cause decoherence in the total wave -function. However, a detailed description of this process requires further work, probably through use of one the proposed models for decoherence 11 .\n\n\nReferences",

As a consequence such low mass ρ's may propagate to the vacuum without collisions and radiate dileptons for a long time in the vacuum since their lifetime, given by the inverse 2 pion decay width, is very long in the vacuum for low invariant mass. This 'artefact' is enhanced by the dilepton radiation probability which -due to the virtual photon propagator and a phase-space factor -is ∼ M −3 . As a consequence the mass differential dilepton spectrum shows a large peak close to M = 2m π (cf.

It has been shown that under circumstances that are realizable for an electron, reciprocal relations hold between the phase and the modulus of the scattered particle's wave function. This supplements our previous demonstrations of the existence of reciprocal relations for localized, bound states 8−10 . In those publications we have noted some other relations that connect the phase with modulus, in particular, the equation of continuity. However, this equation is a partial differential equation and does not uniquely reconstruct the phase, even when the modulus is completely given. Thus, even for a problem in only one spatial dimension, the addition to the position-derivative of the phase of a quantity φ(t)/|ψ(x, t)| 2 , where φ(t) is arbitrary, will satisfy the continuity equation, while in higher dimensions a much larger family of functions will do so. In contrast, the reciprocal relations give the analytic part uniquely from the modulus.\n\nThe physical basis for these relations was elucidated in 14,15 , as being due to the lower-boundedness of the energies. When the analyticity requirements are not fully satisfied, e.g., through there being nodal points in the wave function, the phase is still obtainable from the modulus, the latter being given as function of the complex time. When the analytic properties postulated in this article hold fully, it is sufficient to know the modulus as function of real time, i.e., along the real t-axis.\n\nIn this paper we have obtained threshold relations which delimit the straightforward application of the reciprocal relations. It will be of interest to extend the theory to three dimensional scattering problems, to finiteheight barriers and to other cases.\n\nFor a (rigid) molecule impinging on an infinite barrier, we have found that one should expect zeros of the \"difference function\" in the lower-half of the complex time-plane, such that additional (so called, Blaschke) terms are required to correlate the modulus with the phase changes.\n\nWhen the barrier is not infinite, the algebraic, image wave-function solution used in this work is not applicable. For that situation we have developed a method that employs a transfer matrix for each momentum state and we are in the process of obtaining results from this method.",

Indeed, in the percolation picture, the infinite cluster sustaining diffusive motion always coexists with bounded regions, in which particles might be indefinitely trapped with nonvanishing probability. It follows that, even in the diffusive regime, the self ISFs and the non-Gaussian parameter never actually fully relax to zero. These phenomena have been analyzed in detail in the case of the Lorentz gas, [89][90][91][92] where it could be shown that the MCT predictions give a fairer description of the dynamics if assessed against that of the particles confined to the spanning cluster only. 62 A similar rule of thumb probably applies to the present class of systems as well.",

Three types of wp's are considered, representing an electron, a molecule and a classical object. We derive a threshold criterion for the values of the dynamic parameters so that reciprocal (Kramers-Kronig) relations hold in the time domain between the log-modulus of the wp and the (analytic part of its) phase acquired during the reflection. For an electron, in a typical case, the relations are shown to be satisfied. For a molecule the modulus-phase relations take a more complicated form, including the so called Blaschke term. For a classical particle characterized by a large mean momentum (hK >>h trajectory length (size of wave−packet) 2 >>> h size of wave−packet ) the rate of acquisition of the relative phase between different wp components is enormous (for a bullet it is typically 10 14 GHertz) with also a very large value for the phase maximum.\n\nBackground and Introduction\n\nTextbooks of quantum mechanics contain accounts of the impingement of a freely moving one-dimensional particle on a finite-or an infinite-height barrier (e.g., ref. 1) Some further developments in ref. 2 and more recently in ref. 3 derived the intensity or modulus of the particle beyond a barrier. In some of these works the particle is modelled by a incoming plane wave with a given momentum. Other related works are ref. 4 and, on the experimental side, ref. 5. In so much as at some later stage in this study we obtain the location of the zeros of the reflected wave, we note the recent interest in the distributions of zeros (nodes) of a (chaotic) wave 6,7 in the coordinate space.",

Propagators at negative imaginary timesThe quantum-mechanical imaginary-time propagator can be written in the eigenbasis of the HamiltonianĤ n ,and the flux autocorrelation function (equation (2.7)) can similarly be written aswhere for brevity we have taken t = 0. Using the relations τ R = βh − τ and τ P = τ , both sums are absolutely convergent[104]when 0 < τ < βh, and, while the right-hand side of equation (A1) for n = P diverges when τ < 0, equation (A2) remains well-defined, at least in some cases[42]. This implies the existence of an analytic continuation of equation (A1) that is also valid at negative imaginary time, as we will now show. First, consider the short-time propagator[6]where we replace τ n with z to indicate that the time variable can be complex. The expression is singular at z = 0, which explains why its series representation in equation (A1) diverges for τ n < 0[105]. Crucially, equation (A3) is defined for any z, not just Re z > 0 and hence constitutes the short-time limit of the desired analytic continuation. To go beyond the short-time limit, consider the composition property of the propagator[6],where the integration contour is defined such that the relation holds. For simplicity, we set z = z = z/2. For Re z > 0, the standard integration bounds of ±∞ are suitable, but for Re z < 0, we must find an alternative. In what follows we take z → 0, and consider x − x ∼ O(z 1/2 ). The latter is imposed because K n (x , x , z) will shortly appear in an integral for which contributions from larger displacement amplitudes are vanishingly small in the specified limit (see ch.

Continuing to picture this ensemble as a swarm of trajectories evolving in phase space, f (Eq. 45) can be viewed as a number density, which simply counts how many trajectories are found in the vicinity of z at time t; while g 0 (Eq. 49) can be interpreted as a mass density, if we imagine that each realization carries a fictitious, time-dependent mass exp[−βw 0 (t)]. Eq. 51 then has the following interpretation: when the initial conditions are sampled from equilibrium, the \"mass density\" of trajectories remains constant in time, even as the \"number density\" evolves in a possibly complicated way. Thus while the number of trajectories found near a given point z changes with time, these fluctuations are balanced by the evolving statistical weights (fictitious masses) of those trajectories, in precisely such a way as to keep the local mass density constant.",

T 0 was measured as ∼ 10 MeV. Koppe assumed that even the projectile (α-particle) can not remain stable [1]. Therefore, pair production is likely [2]. \"pairdegeneracy\" [2] or \"Vacuum dissociation\" [3] was principally investigated from electron-positron pair production. Koppe assumed that the same considerations make it possible to apply this in meson-pair production [1] and expected a very small number of produced mesons.\n\nThe electron (produced particle) gas can be treated as cavity radiation with a concrete energy density relating radiation loss to cross-section of excited nuclei σ.

The emissivity ϵ (λ, T) describes the spectral emittance of a blackbody as a function of wavelength and temperature, whereby the limit ϵ (λ, T) = 1 represents the case of an ideal blackbody radiator. Typical blackbody emitters are the Nernst glower and the globar, whereby either a ceramic rod (e.g., SiC) or a tungsten filament, respectively, are resistively heated.\n\nEven though thermal emitters are inexpensive, the emitted radiation-central wavelength and radiant intensitycan only be controlled by the temperature of the emitter element. Figure 1 shows the blackbody radiation of an ideal emitter and the temperature dependence of the emitted radiation in terms of wavelength. This dependence renders thermal emitters for specific applications in the fingerprint region (e.g., 6-15 µm) of limited utility, as for this spectral regime a thermal emitter would have to be operated at room temperature, and thus would have only low emissivity. To overcome these limits, one may refer to Kirchhoff's law of radiation. Kirchhoff's law states that the emissivity of a blackbody radiator at a given temperature and wavelength is equal to the ratio of emissivity ϵ and absorptivity α at that same wavelength and temperature constant:\n\nwhere R is the reflectivity, T the transmissivity and θ the angle of incidence of the light. Thus, following from Kirchhoff's law an adequate absorber must also be an adequate blackbody emitter, which can be exploited for the development of advanced thermal emitters. Despite evident progress in light source technology, a large number of the systems reported to date are based on either a change of a specific property of a natural material or a temperature change, and are, therefore, limited by operation at high temperatures, a limited operating frequency, or a slow modulation speed.",

The fundamental reason for this is the fact the high-frequency (optical) AC conductivity, or equivalently the optical constants n, k, which determine the emissivity, are not known for material at WDM conditions. An attempt to improve the situation by simultaneously measuring emission at many wavelengths (multi-wavelength pyrometery) (Dewitt, 1998;Ni et al. 2008;Ni et al. 2011) does not solve the problem because there is a new unknown emissivity E(λ) at each new wavelength λ and there always N+1 unknowns, where N is the number of direct measurements. Thus from the mathematical point of view, multi-wavelength pyrometry cannot produce a unique temperature. If emissivity is not measured and there is no information about its behavior, experimenters can assume a linear or quadratic dependence of E(λ) on wavelength λ and optimize this \"gray-body\" fit to the multifrequency emission measurements. The temperature produced by this fit is often reported as the temperature \"observed\" in the experiment.\n\n\nReal-world example of \"blind\" curve fitting.",

Studies of the integral effects of nonequilibrium radiative processes on radiative transfer have shown that the effect of the nonequilibrium in the radiative processes increases with the adiabatic temperature T a of the flame; this is also confirmed by the present spectral measurements of the nonequilibrium OH emission. The values of λmax can be used for determining the spectra (wavelength dependence) of the vibrational temperatures . In the faint nonequilibrium emission bands, the spectral transmission λ → 1 and small values of (1 − λ ) cannot be observed experimentally. In that case, the vibrational temperatures obtained for the fainter bands can be used to find the spectral absorption coefficients and integral intensities of the faint emission bands whose absolute emission spectra have been recorded by measurement devices. In order to determine the degree of nonequilibrium of the OH group emission, their transmission spectra were measured under the same conditions as those for measuring the emission spectra. The structure of the transmission spectra correlates with the structure of the emission spectra. The resulting spectral variations in λ and λmax ( fig. 17) are rapidly varying. The degree of variation in the 281-296 nm range is slightly higher than in the 306-328 nm range. The maximum value of λmax for T=2380 K is 100. In the 306-328 nm band, λmax reaches 50 ( fig. 17). It should be noted that the spectral dependences of λ for different temperatures are essentially different. From our standpoint, the reason for this is that it is impossible to make the conditions for obtaining the emission and transmission spectra completely identical, since they have were not recorded simultaneously. The existence of a spectral variation in λmax indicates that the vibrational temperature may depend on the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. In addition, the shape of the spectrum lines may have an effect on the value of λ . Turbulent inhomogeneity during burning of the flame may also have some effect on λ . For practical calculations it is appropriate to introduce the average degree of nonequilibricity max and the absolute spectral intensities of the nonequilibrium emission from the hydroxyl group have been used to determine the spectral absorption coefficients and the integrated absorption intensity of the OH for the",

These include uncertainty in the density of mercury, about 20 ppm; in the gravitational constant, about 10 ppm, and in the end standards, about 2 ppm.\n\nThe original plan for the NBS gas thermometer was to measure the ratio of the pressures generated in the gas thermometer at two temperatures, one of which would approximate the ice point (later refined to the more precise triple point of water). By fixing the number of moles of gas involved and using the ratio technique, Stimson and his colleagues planned to employ a more advanced form of eq (3) to evaluate the unknown temperature in thermodynamic terms, relative to the first. Initial NBS discussions probed the possibility of using a gas-bulb material made of an alloy whose thermal expansion might be nearly zero over a limited range of temperature. They also considered the relative advantages of utilizing a working gas of known non-ideality, versus the technique of making measurements over such an extended range of filling pressures that an extrapolation to zero pressure might be valid.

The pump light is from a frequency-doubled Q-switch Nd:YVO 4 laser operating at 532nm, with pulse energy of 30µJ, and the pulse duration of 15ns. At repetition rate of 1kHz, the average power is 30mW. The PPMgOLN crystal comprises three sections with poling periods of 8.5 µm, 9.0 µm, 10 µm and 10.5 µm. The length of the crystal is 20mm. A home-made high-temperature oven is used to control the temperature of PPMgOLN crystal. It consists of a temperature stabilized Silicon Nitride ceramic crystal mount with build-in resistive heater and temperature sensor, which is calibrated to be of ∼0.1 o C accuracy. An enclosure is used to form a 20mm gap with still air around the mount and ensure its temperature uniformity, which is measured to be better than 0.2 o C. The wavelength of the signal radiation from the OPO is measured by the OSA (ANDO AQ-6315A) with an accuracy of 0.05nm. As for idler, it is calculated theoretically based on the energy conservation condition equation (1). As shown in Figure 1, the output spectral tuning range could be largely extended by elevating the crystal temperature.

Rare-earth Nd-Fe-B magnets show the highest (BH) max of 59 MGOe at room temperature [1], which is much larger than 5.4 MGOe for the most widely used low energy ferrite magnets [2].Although the Nd-Fe-B magnets exhibit desirable magnetic flux density (B), intrinsic coercivity (H ci and (BH) max ), a large negative temperature coefficient of H ci , a low Curie temperature (T c ) of 523 K [3] and limited supply are the critical drawbacks that need to be addressed.Motors for electric vehicles (EV) must reliably operate at temperatures up to 473 K. Therefore, the usage of Nd-Fe-B magnets is limited to a lower temperature than 473 K, due to their negative temperature coefficient of H ci and low Curie temperature.On the other hand, low temperature phase (LTP) MnBi shows a positive magnetic anisotropy coefficient [4][5][6] resulting in H ci of about 1.5 T at 300 K and 2 T at 400 K [5].The high H ci of LTP MnBi helps to make it usable at the operating temperature of the motor.The directionally-solidified LTP MnBi shows a remanent magnetic flux density (B r ) of 0.8 T and (BH) max of 17 MGOe at 290 K [7].However, arc-melted and mechanically-milled LTP MnBi powder shows a low B r of 0.7 T and (BH) max of 11.00 MGOe [8] and B r of 0.7 T and (BH) max of 11.95 MGOe [9] at 300 K.

Theoretically, the |sin | signal should oscillate between 0 and 1; however, this only occurs at the zero-birefringence point and the amplitude of the oscillations decreases above and below this. A similar effect has been measured in LT, LNT and other crystals that contain very small domains, which tend to scatter the light (Glazer et al., 2010).

Both Newton-Gauss and Levenberg-Marquardt, algorithms commonly used least-square optimization algorithms (Ni et al. 2008;), lead to the same results. The 2400 K fit is in much better agreement with the thermodynamic analysis but is not such a nice fit to the measured spectrum from a statistical point of view. However, it is important to note that the emissivity E(λ) resulting from the 2400 K fit (Figure 3b) is very much like the emissivity of normal Au in this spectral range (Watanabe et al. 2003), while the emissivity inferred from the high-temperature fit in Figure 2b has the opposite curvature.\n\nThe summary of the comparison is that the beautiful fit in Figure 1a is a 7200 K blackbody source times the emissivity of Fig. 2b. The less beautiful fit in Figure 3a is a 2400 K blackbody times the emissivity of Figure 3b. But for two good reasons -the total energy available and the shape of Figure 3b -the second fit is much more likely to be correct. The important lesson is that, generally speaking, the accuracy of temperature determination has no relation to the accuracy of the fit to spectral data. One cannot measure the accuracy of a temperature extracted from conventional pyrometry by the -4quality of the curve-fit to the spectrum: looking only at Figure 1a, it would look like 1% precision, but seeing the whole picture, the temperature error from Fig. 1a is ~ 50 %!\n\n\nPolarization of self emission as a key to solve the ambiguity problem",

OUR SUN'S INSOLATION\n\n\"Is the near infrared [aka visible infrared: 740 nm to 3000 nm], actually part of what is called thermal radiation?\" Interestingly, near infrared emission and adsorption are often attributed to changes in a molecule's rotationalvibrational movement, which implies some sort of thermal energy. Of course, our new understanding poises the question \"is this in excess of the thermal signature that is generally subtracted as a blank in a spectrometer?\" It seems logical. Fig. 1. Sketch illustrating the differences in our Sun's spectral irradiance at the top of the atmosphere versus at sea level. Notice how the curve flattens out as the wavelengths become longer. Fig. 1 shows our Sun's irradiance versus wavelength, i.e., blackbody curve for T=5,700 K. It is accepted that our Solar radiation is; 5% ultraviolet (300-370 nm), 43% visible (370-740 nm), and 52% infrared [13]. Note that, Fig. 1 only shows up to the near infrared (740-3,000 nm), with the thermal infrared starting at 3,000 nm, i.e., extending to the far right.\n\nConsider the near infrared spectral irradiance, as is witnessed at sea level. It roughly approximates a \"decreasing linear\" function of increasing wavelength. However, the requirement for the Rayleigh-Jean's approximation as ascribed by ℎ ≪ is not valid for most of the near infrared. It can be shown that ℎ ≈ when, λ ≈2,500 nm =2.5μm. I.e., the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation when applied to our Sun's insolation only becomes valid when λ>2.5μm.\n\nAccepting that λ > 3μm = 3,000 nm constitutes the majority of thermal energy that is witnessed here on Earth, may help explain why system's thermal energies here on Earth tend to be directly proportional to temperature. When viewed in Fig. 1, it visually appears irrelevant.\n\n\nIX. COMPARING SUN'S INFRARED TO VISIBLE",

Arguably at such temperatures the energy associated with the surrounding atmosphere will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a system at 300 K radiates thermal centered blackbody energy, which disperses into the atmosphere, whose thermal radiation energy is clearly a linear function of temperature.\n\nSimilarly, the kinematic energies of the atmospheric gases are influenced by their absorption of the surrounding atmosphere's thermal radiation. This occurs even though they are not necessarily in a fully enclosed system, as is used to calculate their heat capacities and their relations to kinetic theory. This applies whether it be the traditional, or the more exacting kinetic theory developed by this author [11,12].\n\nInterestingly, at T=3 K, the blackbody radiation is dominated by microwave radiation, which is not exactly what one considers, as being true/pure thermal energy. It becomes increasingly obvious that as T→0, any clear relationship between temperature and thermal energy density will be lost.\n\nOf interest, the traditional assertion is that the heat capacities are not constant for all temperature regimes, e.g., heat capacity falters as T→0. One can now consider that it is not the notion of heat capacity that falters, rather it is our concept of temperature that collapses. Of course, this raises the question of, \"when is a system's temperature no longer directly proportional to its thermal energy density?\" At this time, the answer is really a guess, 10 K, 100 K, 250 K. Clearly, the relationships between the thermal energy density, and blackbody radiation is not the same for all temperature regimes.\n\n\nXIII. IMPLICATIONS TO GLOBAL WARMING\n\nThis author has previously challenged traditional assertions concerning climate change [10]. \"Does what was discussed herein change our modelling for global warming?\"\n\nConsider that our Sun's insolation is better depicted by Fig. 2, than Fig. 1. Therefore, the Sun's insolation is actually dominated by thermal photons, that being at infra-red frequencies. Such thermal photons are readily adsorbed and then radially re-radiated by most all of our atmospheric gases, including the so-called greenhouse gases.",

It is observed that at high frequency, the material shows an almost temperature-independent behavior. Thus, the capacitance of the bulk is almost independent of temperature and slight increment observed is due to ion migration. There are no peaks observable either, resulting in non-Debye behavior which is in contrast to earlier results. It is possible that the ratios of the ions in this composition may be responsible for absence of relaxation behavior.

The temperatures for the two directions are always close, so we take the geometric mean T = T 2/3 ρ T 1/3 z . Figure 13(a) shows the temperature versus I 00 together with the Doppler temperature given by equation (14). At full intensity (I 0 00 ), the temperature is 13 mK, which is 17 times higher than expected from equation (14). The temperature decreases as the intensity decreases, reaching a minimum at 9 mW/cm 2 where it is 960 µK, 4 times the Doppler temperature. When the intensity is reduced below 9 mW/cm 2 , the temperature increases again. According to equation (13) the temperature is related in a simple way to the scattering rate and the damping constant. Since we have measured T , R sc and β across a wide range of intensities, we can test whether this relation is accurate for our MOT. Using linear interpolations over the measured values of R sc [ figure 8(a)] and β [ figure 11(a)] at various intensities, and equation (13), we obtain the expected temperature shown by the dashed line in figure 13(a). This shows exactly the same intensity dependence as we measure. The temperature found from equation (13) is higher than the Doppler temperature because the damping constant is smaller than predicted. The measured temperature is higher again, by a factor of 2 for intensities below 10 mW/cm 2 and by a factor of 3 at higher intensities. This shows that the diffusion constant is higher than that given by equation (12). This might be due to dipole force fluctuations which are not included in equation (12). We note that excess heating at high intensity is also seen in atomic MOTs [25,26] and various explanations have been given such as the effect of coherences between excited state sub-levels [27] and transverse intensity fluctuations of the MOT beams [28]. Figure 13(b) shows how the temperature depends on ∆ 00 at both high intensity (400 mW/cm 2 ) and low intensity (4 mW/cm 2 ).

To obtain measurements that were consistent with the NBS gas thermometry. they each utilized the NBS determinations near 457 °C as reference temperatures.\n\nBecause of the difficulty involved in performing spectral radiation thermometry at temperatures as low as 457 °C, experimental uncertainty at that temperature is considerably larger than it is at higher temperatures; furthermore, systematic errors in \"low-temperature\" radiation thermometry become increasingly difficult to evaluate. Since in principle gas thermometry can provide reference temperatures substantially above 457 °C that are referred to the principal KTTS defining temperature at 0.01 °C, it was desirable to continue study of the KTTS by gas thermometry at temperatures above 457 °C. A further advantage to be gained by such a step is that an extended range of the KTTS would be explored by two methods that possess intrinsically different systematic errors, allowing better evaluation of the uncertainty of thermodynamic temperatures throughout the overlapping range. For these reasons, R. E. Edsinger and the present author recently undertook experiments that continued the work of Guildner and Edsinger to up temperatures as high as 660 °C.\n\nSome of the apparatus built at the NBS for gas thermometric studies above 500 °C was described by Guildner and Edsinger in 1982 [28]. It was necessary to modify that equipment in the course of using it to determine the difference r(KTTS)-^(IPTS-68) from 230 to 660 °C in the most recent experiments. It also proved desirable to modify the furnace used for the determination of thermal expansion; the gas bulb; the gas-bulb thermometers; the method used in purifying the ''He working gas; and the technique for tracking the \"counterpressure.\" No changes were required in the manometer.\n\n\nHigh-Temperature Furnace",

Therefore, it can be stated that the increase in submillimeter power is mostly spent on increasing the volume of the plasma torch.It is also worth underlining that the obtained values of the gas temperature are an integral average value of the gas temperature in the plasma filaments and the surrounding plasma halo.Based on the literature data on the filamentation mechanisms of microwave discharges [17], we can assume that the gas temperature in the plasma filaments significantly exceeds the gas temperature in the plasma halo.The power absorbed by the plasma was measured in the regimes described above.",

Photo-electric action suggested by Vegard (£ Phil. Mag.,' pp. 581, 585) may probably be ruled out in an Arctic night, so that \" cosmic rays \" must be relied on. Now, it may readily be shown that [3-rays are likely to vaporise any crystal they strike. For a (3-ray that is to excite a crystal to emit one quantum of 5578 must lose for that purpose alone a minimum of 2 • 2 volts of its energy : since 5 per cent, efficiency is uncommonly high for exciting (by impact) any radiation in any other solid, it is reasonable to sup pose that for every quantum emitted, about 45 volts will be used up merely in heating the crystal. 45 volts corresponds to 1 *72.10~18 cal., and the latent heat of evaporation of a crystal of 632 molecules is 1 ' 75.10~18\n\ncal., or probably less, in view of its very small radius, and of the fact that 842E is a maximum for the heat of sublimation.* Thus a 5 per cent, efficiency will result in an allowance of \" one crystal one quantum,\" so that unless the excitation conditions are totally different from any hitherto experienced the chances are against the possibility that a crystal could emit more than a very few quanta. The same objection may be urged even more strongly against a-rays. If we endeavour to avoid the difficulty by supposing that the crystals are large and multiply-charged, we have to suppose there are fewer of them if the volume charge is to remain small, but in any case every electron that helps to lift solid nitrogen can only lift enough to emit one quantum of 5578. Thus the volume charge necessary to support a good auroral display would inevit ably be very large.",

As indicated earlier, some sources were too weak to fit the hyperfine components (G37.38−0.09, G37.53−0.11 and G42.43−0.26) and consequently, their optical depths of the (1,1) main hyperfine component are unknown. For these sources, T ex is assumed to be 4.1 K (which is the mean excitation temperature of the other sources).\n\nIn determining the kinetic temperatures from eq. (A10), we used collision coefficients from Danby et al. (1988) who provide the coefficients for different values of T k . We iterated the procedure until the value adopted for T k (used to obtain collision coefficients) was consistent with that derived from eq. (A10).\n\nThe derived values of the physical parameters of the sources are listed in Table 2. Only sources with at least 4σ detections of at least two NH 3 transitions are shown in Table 2. In all cases, uncertainties in the physical parameters are derived by propagating the uncertainties in the variables (the 10% uncertainty in flux calibration is added in quadrature to the formal uncertainty of the main beam antenna temperatures in Table 1) of the relevant equationsi.e. if y = f (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ), then\nσ 2 y = n i=1 ∂f ∂x i 2 σ 2 x i(1)\nassuming that the different variables are uncorrelated (which is not strictly true, but is a good approximation for our purpose). The exception is for kinetic temperatures corresponding to T R21 greater than ∼ 25 K since the behavior of T k becomes highly non-linear at that point (see Figure 2a of Walmsley & Ungerechts 1983). For these cases, the uncertainties in T k are calculated by estimating the kinetic temperature corresponding to T R21 ± σ T R21 in eq. (A10). The uncertainties in the physical parameters are typically dominated by the uncertainty in the optical depth of the (1,1) main hyperfine component.",

The CO 2 gas is heated using a cylindrical cell made of solid Cu, which incorporates a 4 mm long nozzle of 0.6 mm diameter. The cell itself has an internal diameter of 10 mm and a length of 12 mm, with a quartz fibre. The cell is heated by wrapping a resistive coaxial sheath wire around it, and can reach temperatures up to about 850 K. A magnetic shield, placed around the cell, prevents the field generated by the heater, around which there is wrapped a pipe with flowing water that provides an outer cooling jacket, from penetrating into the interaction region. A thermocouple was set in to a small hole on the cell, and can serve to monitor the cell temperature. From an earlier experiment [12] that produced a gas phase C 60 beam, it has been confirmed that the gas temperature of the cell can be estimated approximately to be the same as that for the CO 2 beam at the collision centre (~1.5-2 mm from the cell nozzle exit). While sweeping the electron impact energies over the range 1-9 eV, the excitation function experiments were carried out at the respective energy loss values of 0.083 eV and -0.083 eV and at the scattering angles of 30°, 60°, 90° and 120°. Furthermore they were measured at the temperatures of 300, 550 and 750 K. Our experimental results therefore include cross sections from a variety of initial states whose populations depend on the Boltzmann distribution (see Table 1). The result of this process is thus, at each , an unresolved absolute excitation function for the (010)* (000) and (020)*(100)* (010)* superelastic transitions, and an unresolved absolute excitation function for the (000) (010) and (010)* (020)(100) inelastic transitions. We attempt to uniquely deconvolve their respective contributions by using the following assumptions in conjunction with a least squares fit. In the deconvolution, in all relevant cases, we assume that the Principle of Detailed Balance [13] holds. This assumption is expected to be valid, following the work of Johnstone et al. [6]. In the case of the bending mode this means that the condition:",

This is a relevant value for several reasons. First, the quantum is within the same order of magnitude as the essential bond strengths within water associated with proton movements and with the hydrogen bond which determines the majority of aqueous properties. Secondly, the gravitational force between two potassium ions separated by the distance (11 nm) reflecting the density of the layer of these ions that defines the resting membrane potential, is (6.2 •10 -26 kg) 2 divided by (1.1 •10 -8 m) 2 multiplied by G (6.67•10 -11 m 3 kg -1 s -2 ), or, 4.1 •10 -46 International Letters of Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy Vol. 21 N.

They found clear evidence of peak emissions of photons with wavelengths ~270 nm within the exclusion zones adjacent to various hydrophilic surfaces. This empirical observation is congruent with the intrinsic force associated with the product of viscosity and the diffusivity ratio for the magnetic moment of the proton and charge developed in the present paper.\n\nFor example, when the force (7.87•10 -11 N) associated with the product of the viscosity of water and the ratio of the magnetic moment to unit charge of the proton is applied across a plasma membrane (assuming 10 nm) the energy would be 7.87 •10 -19 J or a frequency equivalence, when divided by Planck's constant (6.626•10 -34 J•s -1 ) of 1.19•10 15 Hz. Assuming c, the velocity of light in a vacuum, the peak wavelength would be ~252 nm. This is within measurement error and statistical dispersions for the ranges of experimental temperatures that were reported by Chai et al [9] to be emitted from exclusion zones along hydrophilic surfaces. More precisely, if the functional width of the membrane were 9.3 nm the peak wavelength would be ~270 nm, which was their empirical result. This solution, if valid, would couple quantum phenomena (by Planck's relations) to the fundamental units (the proton magnetic moment and charge) to the wavelength of electromagnetic energy (light) emitted by water molecules within this particular organization.\n\n\nINTERACTIONS WITH APPLIED MAGNETIC FIELDS",

According to traditional estimates the magnetic energy within a medium is: (2), where the total energy from the medium strength field (6•10 -8 T) in a 1 cc (10 -6 m 3 ) volume of water would be 1.4•10 -15 J. This is well within the range of measurement error. Although clearly other experiments would be required to establish causality the convergence of the quantitative values for energy suggests the photon emissions reflected the Hamiltonian, the total energy within the system, from the exposure to the magnetic field. The 10 nm shift is consistent with the more quantum-like phenomenon described by Del Giudice and Preparata [14]. They pursued the concept that above a given atomic density and below a specific temperature the Dicke Hamiltonian relation exhibited a spontaneous phase transition. Within this Superradiant Phase Transition (SPT) large classical electromagnetic fields become contained within arrangements of atomic \"networks\" and oscillate in phase with the atomic transitions between these specific states and the ground state. According to Del Giudice and Preparata, the energy gap between N, two-level atoms is described as E = h•c•λ -1 , where h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light and λ is wavelength. Within the \"coherent domain\" whose width is λ, the two atomic systems vacillate between the two states in phase with the oscillation of the coherent electromagnetic field.

If the electromagnetic field is \"trapped\" within the coherent domain one would 6 ILCPA Volume 21 expect more photon transmission and greater scatter to shift to the lower wavelengths as photons intrinsic to the water aggregates shift between states. This interpretation is consistent with the observations. If an effect is coupled to fundamental physical processes, then coupled intrinsic patterns should emerge. Spectral analyses of the variations in photon emissions through the water that had been exposed to the magnetic fields revealed spectral power densities that peaked at spectral frequencies ~0.1 and 0.2. These results are shown in Figure 2. The actual wavelength is obtained by dividing 1 by the spectral frequency; these values are 10 nm and 5 nm, respectively. The results indicate that there is a relative peak in spectral power density of the photon transmission through the water exposed to these magnetic fields that occurs every approximately 10 nm and 5 nm.\n\nThe latter value approximates Del Guidice and Preparata's [14] derivation that the radius R of the coherent domain within which an \"evanescent electromagnetic wave pulsates with the frequency ώ\", is = 3/8•λ, effectively one-half a wavelength. In Figure 2, water that was exposed to the higher intensity (4 to 12 µT indicated by small dotted line) displays a clear rise, peak and fall in spectral density around 5 nm.\n\n\nRELATIONSHIPS TO ASTROPHYSICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL PARAMTERS\n\nIf the properties of water are derived from the basic properties of protons then these essential features of matter should reflect the characteristics contained within the entire universe. To paraphrase Ernst Mach, any change within local matter should be influenced by or could possibly reflect the entire universe. There are quantitative estimates to support this supposition.",

Such problematic issues also exist in physical chemistry. Here are some examples. The analysis of kinetics of various physical and chemical processes shows that in some cases the direct addition of velocities, kinetic or energy characteristics is performed, in others-their reciprocals are added. In particular, such supposition is confirmed by the formula of electron transport possibility due to the overlapping of wave functions 1 and 2 (in steady state) during electron-conformation interactions:\n1 2 1 2 1 2 WW W W W ∞ = +(1)\nEquation (1) is used when evaluating the characteristics of diffusion processes followed by non-radiating transport of electrons in proteins [1].\n\nAnd also: \"From classical mechanics it is known that the relative motion of two particles with the interaction energy U(r) takes place as the motion of material point with the reduced mass µ: 1 2 1 1 1 m m µ = + (2) in the field of central force U(r), and general translational motion-as a free motion of material point with the mass: 1 2 m m m = + (3) Such things take place in quantum mechanics as well\" [2]. At the same time, the problem of quantum-wave dualism is still not completely solved, though the application of de Broglie equation allows defining the manifestation borders of such phenomena. But which property predominates depends on the process conditions. And it is quite complicated to define in advance which part of them will operate in each particular case, although it is known that the wave picture is more often takes place at low energies, and corpuscular-at high ones.",

First it is the quantum of energy associated with the resting membrane potential produced by the electrical force between potassium ions each separated by about 11 nm over the surface of the membrane [2]. Second, this magnitude defines the energy associated with the effects of the net change in voltage of an action potential (~1.2•10 -1 V) on a unit charge.\n\nThird, the energy is within measurement error for the second shell hydrogen bonds (2.6 kcal•M -1 ) that have been shown to be primarily contributory to the capacity for proton mobility [3] within water.\n\nAs aptly articulated by Decoursey [3] the proton is unique among cations because it is interchangeable with the protons that form water. Consequently water maintains its structure while the constituent protons move through space and time. This capacity is coupled to a very small concentration of free protons (H 3 O + ), the hydronium ion, particularly in physiological systems. Whereas the concentration of H + in water is 110 M, the concentration of hydronium ions is ~40 nM. Only one proton in about a billion comprises H 3 O + at any given instant [3].\n\nThe average life time of the H 3 O + ion has been estimated by more than a dozen researchers to range between 0.24 to 3 ps with a median of ~1 ps. When this temporal parameter (10 -12 s) is multiplied by the ratio of the proton's magnetic moment and charge (0.88•10 -7 m 2 •s -1 ), the resulting area is 8.8•10 -20 m 2 , or 2.97•10 -10 m (0.297 nm).\n\nThe actual distance between water molecules is usually measured as 2.9 A or 0.29 nm. In other words, the duration of the hydronium ion is coupled to the diffusivity of the dynamics of H 2 O.\n\nProton mobility in water, which is ~3.6•10 -7 m 2 •V -1 •s -1 [3], has been shown quantitatively to be related to the movement of photons through tissue, including the human brain [4] through a Grotthuss chain-like effect associated with free protons.",

One of the experimental study about 10 Be is Lapoux et. al. [13] in which they measured the elastic cross section for 10 Be and 11 Be projectiles on proton and 12 C targets at 39.1 MeV/nucleon and 38.4 MeV/nucleon, respectively, and these data was investigated using the microscopic Jeukenne-Lejeune-Mahaux nucleon-nucleus potential for proton target and framework of folding model for C target. Unlike the other studies, [20,21] in order to be more physical and reliable, the potential parameters describing the interaction between the core and the target are adjusted to the elastic scattering data at 39.1 MeV/nucleon energy [13]. Our obtained values of the potential depth parameters are shallow compared to their potential. We use the experimental β 2 quadrupole deformation value, which is -0.6 [43], for the first (2 + ) excited level of 12 C, which is 4.4 MeV. Also, in order to take into account the non-elastic contributions caused from the interactions at surface region, additionally one can add the surface term into the effective potential. This potential is sometimes referred as surface term, derivative of Woods-Saxon potential form, DPP and VCP, and can be obtained by different methods. The parameters of DPP can be obtained from microscopical [44][45][46] or phenomenological [47][48][49][50][51][52][53] calculations by fitting to the experimental data. For 10 Be+ 12 C, we used a phenomenological DPP obtained from the fit process to the experimental data combined with a volume term. Obtained results for this elastic scattering and the optical potential parameters used in this calculation are given in 2 and Table I, respectively.

Since we have assumed that the particles have non-relativistic momenta, a common choice for the cutoff is the rest mass energy of the particles. An infra-red cutoff, as needed in relativistic QED, is, however, no longer necessary. 22 The interaction between charged particles and photons leads to a stable theory with a finite amount of soft (ω k → 0) photons (at least for the ground state). 22 The explicit interaction with the photons, on the other hand, makes it necessary in general to work with bare electronic and nuclear/ionic masses m and M l , respectively. That is, the masses in Eq. (37) are not the observable masses that one uses in quantum mechanics. The physical masses of the particles in quantum mechanics are recovered from non-relativistic QED by tracing out the photon part which leads, e.g., for the electronic mass to m e = m + m ph 22,94,95 as also highlighted in the introduction. Here the photon contribution m ph is due to the electromagnetic energy that is created by the charged particle itself. When considering the dispersion of a free particle in non-relativistic QED, we realize that the bare mass is necessarily smaller than in quantum mechanics, i.e., m ph > 0. This is because the free charged particle generates extra energy due to coupling to the photons when having nonzero momentum and is thus effectively slowed down, i.e., the electron is dressed by the photon field (see also Fig. 1 for an artistic view on dressed particles in QED). We will give an explicit expression for the photonic mass (of single particles in the dipole approximation) and comment on further implications of this mass renormalization below in Sec. 3.3. Irrespective of the specific choice of (the positive and finite) bare mass, however, the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian has some very nice properties. It is self-adjoint, 22,96 which guarantees that we can uniquely solve the corresponding static and time-dependent Schrödinger-type",

We have noticed that the averaged resonance widths of D 1 (2420) listed arXiv:2007.02263v2 [hep-ph] 10 Jul 2020 in Particle Data Group (PDG) are 25±6 MeV for charged state and 31.7±2.5 MeV for neutral state [37], which are very close to experimental widths of 24.8 ± 3.3 ± 11.0 MeV of Z c (3885) ± [11] and 24.8 ± 5.6 ± 7.7 MeV of Z c (4025) ± [12]. In addition, the processes e + e − → (DD * ) ± π ∓ and e + e − → (D * D * ) ± π ∓ are measured at center of mass energy of 4.26 GeV by BE-SIII [11,12], which is below the thresholds of both channels DD 1 (2420) and D * D 1 (2420). Since the measuring energy, 4.26 GeV, is close to the threshold of D ( * )D * , we can expect to see a reflection phenomenon of D 1 (2420) with peaks. The above properties indicate that the P-wave charmed meson D 1 (2420) is an excellent candidate for providing a possible universal non-resonant explanation to Z c (3885) and Z c (4025).

In practice, however, such test-particles do not scatter often enough to reconstruct the vacuum spectral function when propagating out of the nucleus. As a consequence such low mass ρ's may propagate to the vacuum without collisions and radiate dileptons for a long time in the vacuum since their lifetime, given by the inverse 2 pion decay width, is very long in the vacuum for low invariant mass. This 'artefact' is enhanced by the dilepton radiation probability which -due to the virtual photon propagator and a phase-space factor -is ∼ M −3 . As a consequence the mass differential dilepton spectrum shows a large peak close to M = 2m π (cf.

In other terms, the Einstein spontaneous decay rate Γ, which is larger the higher the photon frequency, is taken as a vertical transition in analogy to the way that the 'reflection principle' is applied [27].

This means that changing only η i 1 may not improve the model to fit experimental data unless more adjustable parameters are introduced to model the Born energy more accurately as proposed in [43]. The formula (43) shows that the principal determinant of ionic activity is the concentration-dependent Born radius R Born\ni (C B i ) since γ DHP F i is very sensitive to R Born i (C B i )\nthat is an atomic distance from the singular charge q i δ(r − 0) of the ion, which is infinite at 0 and thus critically affects γ DHP F i . The secondary determinant is the hydration shell radius R sh i that lumps short-range ion-water interactions into a single physical length. The last part of ionic activity is extracted to the symbol Θ that accounts for ion-ion correlations (l c ) and long-range electrostatics (l DP F ) via the eigenvalues λ 1 and λ 2 in (21) and (39).\n\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS",

In particular, its frequency must be approximately equal to the frequency of the vibrational motion in the LIP. Otherwise, the correlation between the motion of the electron driven by the field, and that of the protons, oscillating in the potential, is not perfect. In this scenario, the LAMB dynamics is that of an electron moving along with one proton as the bond stretches, and hopping to the other proton as the bond compresses. Basically, we have a proton loosely attached to an Hydrogen. Depending on the phase of the electric field, the Hydrogen and proton exchange their role. It is crucial that the bond is maximally compressed when the amplitude of the oscillating electric field is zero as otherwise the electron cannot hop from one proton to the other, leading to dissociation.\n\nWe have shown that the electron-nuclear correlation is an essential condition to create large-amplitude oscillating dipoles. Although in principle any superposition of electronic states of different parity, such as Ψ(z, R, 0) = ϕ(R, 0) ψ BO 1 (z; R) + ψ BO 2 (z; R) / √ 2, induces an oscillating dipole, the dipole in this case quickly decays due to the dephasing of the nuclear and electron motion [99]. Alternatively, a high frequency laser pulse can be used to drive the electron in the ground state creating a fast oscillating dipole, but this dipole can only be small as the excursion length of the electron in the field (the displacement that the electron can reach before the electric field changes its sign) is necessary small in the ground potential under optical driving frequencies. For lower frequencies the excursion length and the induced dipole could be larger, but tunneling ionization dominates [100].\n\nIn summary, we have shown that in order to create an oscillating electric dipole in a homonuclear diatomic cation without an oscillating driver one needs (i) to break the symmetry of the system and (ii) to sustain highly correlated electronic and nuclear motion, which are guaranteed by the LAMB dynamics.\n\n\nCONTROL OF PHOTODISSOCIATION BY SHAPING TWO DISSOCIATIVE POTENTIALS",

The addition of steepest descents to the initial steps and to the subspace neglected by Newton's method with SVD seems to be advantageous for the molecular systems we investigated.\n\nWe could calculate accurate harmonic vibrational frequencies and anharmonicity constants of diatomic molecules by fitting QMC results to the Morse potential, achieving excellent agreement between QMC calculations and experiment for these vibrational parameters. \n\n\nai )r n ka ij .\n\nFIG. 2 :\n2The energy of BH at rexp at various stages of parameter optimization.

These are similar to, but larger than, the corresponding values for the principal series of helium singlets which are 2S = 32032*51, 2P == 27175*17, 3P = 12100*56, 4P = 6817*21, 5P = 4367*45.\n\nIf this arrangement of the bands were correct, it would form a very interesting counterpart to Part V, in which the conclusion was reached that the band systems there dealt with had a main electronic structure closely resembling that of the principal series of helium doublets. I t seems very doubtful, however, if this arrangement is correct. The final vibrational differences of the Q (1) lines of the present bands are identical with the corresponding terms for the initial states of the Lyman bands (Dieke and Hopfield's B states) to the accuracy of the ultra-violet measurements. The ultra-violet data for lines other than Q (1) are not available at present, so that it is not certain the states are the same. However, the identity of the final states with Dieke and Hopfield's B states is confirmed by the values got for the heats of dissociation. If the states are the same, the present final electronic term 33727-12 should be equal to the differ ence between the ionisation potential of H 2 = 128800 and Dieke and Hopfield's electronic term B -A = 91562. This difference is 37238 and is much too large. I shall reconsider the matter in the next section.\n\n\nThe Heats of Dissociation, etc.",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

The estimates in this and previous papers from the electron terms all come con sistently low, and I wonder if the value of the heat of dissociation of normal H 2 may not be a little higher than the value found by Langmuir, or, alterna tively, the spectroscopic value of the ionisation potential of H2 might be a little under the experimental value 15-9 volts. Even so, the utmost that could be allowed in this way is probably about 5000 wave-numbers, which would still be insufficient to bridge the discrepancy. This brings us back to the difficulty that the calculated 2S term 33727 is too low to agree with the apparent identity of the final states with Dieke and Hopfield's B states. If their corresponding electronic term 37238 is used instead of 33727, the values in brackets inTable VIII are obtained. The value of the heat of dissociation 24746 is now just about as much below the value estimated from the vibration term data as these estimates from the electronic term data generally seem to run. These difficulties can be avoided by the following re-arrangement of the bands, which, however, can only be regarded as provisional at this stage. I still take the strong A band system as a 3 -> 2 electron transition, but I take out the 0B0, 0Bj, 0B2 and 0B3 bands and the C fragment and assume the jB0, jB,, -jB2 and jB3 lines to be respectively the 0B0, qBj, 0B2 and 0B3 lines of the 4 -> 2 electron transition bands. The electron levels now proposed are shown diagrammatically, but not to scale, in Diagram II. The three lowest levels are the A, B and C levels of Dieke and Hopfield, and the others give the surface of the molecule corresponding to the ionisation potential of normal H 2 and the levels for the new 0B0 Q (1) (jBq Q (1) ofTable VI) and the 0A0 Q (1) lines. The higher levels are getting near the ionisation potential limit, and it is not surprising if they are not found.In what follows the experimental value 128800 of",

                    "contents": "Hydrogen Bands in the Ultra-Violet Lyman RegionIn a recent paper E. E. Witmerj* describes a series of bands which he ascribes to the hydrogen molecule. These bands, which he calls the Lyman bands, were first observed by Lyman, who already in his book ( cit.) mentions some of the bands. In discharges in argon containing a trace of hydrogen the ordinary hydrogen many-lined spectrum is weakened very much and the Lyman bands dominate the spectrum between 1050 A and 1700 A. According to Witmer, these bands are due to changes in the total (electronic) quantum number nt from 2 to 1 together with changes in the vibrational quantum number n from 0 to 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . 11 respectively. Witmer has not published the details of his measurements of the bands, and a comparison between the Lyman bands and the present bands can only be made by means of the reproduction of the bands in his paper. It is, however, clearly seen that the Lyman bands Nos. 0, 1, 2, 3 are not observed among the stronger lines on my plates ( figs. 1 and 2), and it is doubtful whether they are present at all. It is difficult to recon cile this absence with the observation of Lyman ( . tit., p. 79) that some of the other bands (Nos. 7,8,9,10) are readily seen among the lines of the many-lined spectrum in pure hydrogen. On the other hand, several of the stronger lines of figs. 1 and 2 are present on the reproduction in Witmer's paper. We may therefore conclude that the Lyman bands are due to a manner of excitation of the molecule, the probability of which is very small in discharges in pure hydrogen, but when hydrogen is present as a trace in argon, this probability is greatly enhanced. Compare Witmer (loc. tit.) and also J. Franck and P. Jordan.* If the bands are described as Q-branches, the value of the constant c in Table III indicates that there is a large difference of the moment of inertia in the initial states and in the end states. The other description of the bands as consisting of several branches gives a value of the moment of inertia in the initial states Ia = about 7 • 10-41 and in the end states l e -2 to",

Owing to the uncoupling complications, however, the true values of these quantities are not known with any accuracy, and I am inclined to think th at a better guide to the value of w0 -xiv0 is got by subtracting the Q 2 lines of the 1' -> 0\" and 0\" -> 0\" bands. This gives 2142-05 for 4 1VF -j-4 and 2099-22 for 3 X B and these compare with 2244 for 3 3II0i6 and 2213-5 for 4 3n a 6. This value is very satisfactory as these quantities for 3 X B, 4 X B, etc., on the one hand and for 3 3II, 4 3IT, etc., on the other should converge towards the value 2220 of rv0 -xw0 for H 2+ as the principal quantum number n goes to infinity.",

Uncertainty in absolute frequency determination\n\nThe absolute frequency of the CW light is calibrated by mixing this light with the output of a frequency-comb laser and counting the resulting beat frequency f beat . The frequency f CW is then obtained by the relation\nf CW = n · f rep + f 0 + f beat ,(2)\nwith n the mode number of the frequency comb that is nearest to the frequency of the CW light, and f rep and f 0 the repetition and the carrier-envelope offset frequencies of the frequency comb, respectively. f rep is tunable over a small range around 250 MHz and f 0 is locked at 40 MHz. We infer that the sign of f beat is positive from the observation that f beat increases when the CW laser is scanned towards higher frequency. Likewise, the sign of f 0 is positive from the observation that f beat increases when f 0 is decreased. The beat note is averaged over a period of 100 ms. On this time scale, the accuracy of the Rb-clock standard is 10 −10 , equivalent to 150 kHz at the used frequencies. This uncertainty enters separately in each data point taken in a frequency scan. As each scan is approximately 1000 data points, this uncertainty averages out. The integer mode number n is determined by measuring the transition frequency of the R 2 (0) transition in 12 C 16 O using the frequency comb at different repetition frequencies and then determining at which transition frequency these three measurements coincide. This method gives an unambiguous transition frequency provided that the change in repetition frequency is much larger than the measurement uncertainty [24]. In our case this condition is well met as the uncertainty between two consecutive measurements is on the order of 500 kHz, while the repetition frequency of the comb is varied by 2 MHz. The absolute value obtained for the R 2 (0) transition of 12 C 16 O is used to calibrate a wavelength meter (Burleigh WA-1500, 30 MHz precision) on a daily basis. This wavelength meter is then used to determine the mode number for the measurements of the other transitions.\n\n\nE. Doppler effect",

At a detuning of the 313 nm cooling laser of −300 MHz, and using a few mW of laser power (corresponding to ∼ 80 times the saturation intensity), such a 'secular scan' shows up as a peak in the 313 nm beryllium fluorescence versus rf frequency (Fig. 3). In Appendix B we show that the area under this peak, A, scales with the number of HD + ions, although not linearly. We define a spectroscopic signal as the relative difference between the areas of the initial and final secular scan peaks:\nS = A i − A f A i(7)\nRepeating this procedure for all 140 pre-selected frequencies of the 782 nm laser while recording fluorescence traces with both the PMT and EMCCD camera, we obtain a spectrum consisting of 1772 data points (ν j , S j ) (with j = 1 . . . 1772).\n\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n\nSpectral lineshape model\n\nIn order to determine the hyperfine-less rovibratiotional (0,2)→(8,3) transition frequency, ν 0 , we need a realistic lineshape model which includes the relevant physics present during REMPD. Here the aim is to obtain a spectral lineshape function in which all effects are parameterized. Parameter values are estimated by independent means where possible, or included as a fit parameter otherwise. Importantly, the fit function will contain a variable ν − ν 0,fit , where ν 0,fit is a fit parameter from which we later deduce the value of ν 0 . Before fitting, the (ν, S) data are corrected for reactions with background gas (primariliy H 2 ). This procedure is described in Sec. 4.5.",

The laser was locked on the a 1 component of the R(37)16-1 transition. The R(37)16-1 transition was selected because it is close to the 1 S 0 -3 P 0 optical clock transition of Yb and is well isolated from other iodine lines (as shown Fig. 1). The a 1 hyperfine component was selected because it is the closest to the Yb optical clock transition of all the hyperfine components of the R(37)16-1 transition. The measured frequency of the R(37)16-1:a 1 hyperfine transition is 518304551833 kHz. This was calculated from 1000 pieces of beat frequency data, where each piece was measured with a 1-s gate time by a frequency counter. The frequency reproducibility due to the process of locking and unlocking the laser is the main contributor to the measurement uncertainty, and was investigated to be ~ 2 kHz. The accuracy of the H-maser of the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) was calibrated by the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and confirmed to be better than 1×10 -14 during the measurement.\n\nThere is another frequency uncertainty factor and this results from the frequency shift caused by possible cell contamination. An international investigation shows that this could add an uncertainty of 5 kHz to measurement results [13]. In this measurement, we used an iodine cell that had been used in international comparisons and had shown an agreement of better than 2 kHz with cells from other institutes. \n\n\nDiscussion and conclusion",

The lattice retro-reflector is anti-reflection coated at 578 nm with a reflectivity of < 1 % at this wavelength. The probe linear polarization is aligned with the lattice polarization and to the vertical bias magnetic field using the same Glan-Thompson polarizer. The frequency of the probe light is controlled by a double-pass AOM placed before the fiber link to the atoms (clock AOM in fig. 2). Probe intensity is actively stabilized. During the interrogation a 0.14 mT magnetic field is applied leading to a 290 Hz Zeeman shift of the two π-transitions from the unperturbed one ( fig. 3). Pulsing of the clock laser is achieved by detuning the applied frequency by 1 MHz. A π pulse is applied for a Rabi time of 60 ms. Mechanical shutters stop all other laser beams during spectroscopy.\n\nThe resulting excitation fraction is then destructively detected and normalized applying three resonant pulses at 399 nm and by collecting the atomic fluorescence with the PMT. The detection beam has a power of 2.5 mW, a waist of 0.5 mm and it strongly saturates the 1 S 0 -1 P 1 transition. For each pulse the PMT signal is digitally integrated for 2 ms. The first pulse measures the population in the 1 S 0 state. The second one reveals the background signal from scattered light and excited hot background gas atoms. A third 399 nm pulse then reveals the atoms that had been excited during the Rabi spectroscopy after repumping the atom population of the 3 P 0 state over the short-lived 3 D 1 level back to the 1 S 0 . For this task we use a commercial pigtail distributed feedback laser emitting at 1389 nm. The 10 mW output beam of the repumper laser is focused on the atoms thus broadening the 3 P 0 -3 D 1 transition to 300 MHz. Active frequency stabilization is not required and the population transfer efficiency is 90 % after 6 ms. We use the fluorescence from the three pulses to digitally calculate the normalized excitation fraction and the total number of atoms.",

To generate the UV laser radiation, a continuous-wave single-mode tunable IR diode laser (power 30 mW, wavelength 782 nm) is pulse amplified using three successive dye cells operated with the dye Styryl 11 and pumped with the second harmonic (532 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser. The output (1 mJ/pulse) of the dye amplification stages is frequency doubled with a BBO crystal, and the doubled light, with a wavelength of ∼391 nm, is mixed in another BBO crystal with the fundamental IR laser output to get the desired UV radiation. The vacuum wavenumber of the UV laser radiation is determined from the wavenumber of the IR radiation, which is measured using a wavemeter (accuracy 3σ ; 200 MHz). The He Rydberg atoms (n=30 or 45) are detected by field ionization with a pulsed electric field of 2 kV cm −1 , which also extracts the He + ions toward a detector consisting of a pair of microchannel plates in chevron configuration. The joint effects of the laser bandwidth and Doppler broadening led to single transitions having full widths at half maximum of 0.007 cm −1 .

From the uncertainty principle, if the electron wave function were to be squeezed into a small area described by Eq. 3, the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron would increase. In other words, as the electron goes through the contact, it could change momentum due to the uncertainty principle. As a result, Vk ;α;p is nonzero in general fork ≠p. Furthermore, if the contact size were to increase (larger uncertainty in position), the uncertainty in momentum would decrease. Therefore, Vk ;α;p fork ≠p becomes smaller and smaller as the contact size increases. We consider two extreme cases. First, if V ðrÞ = δðr −r 0 Þ, which corresponds to the case for STM, Vk ;α;p = 1. This case means that an electron with momentumk has an equal probability of changing momentum top after going through the delta-function point contact. On the other hand, for the planar tunnel junction (large contact regime), we assume that the matrix elements of electrons tunneling throughout the entire interface are the same; that is, V ðrÞ = V for r z = 0. In this case, because the uncertainty in the position of the interface is infinite, the uncertainty in the in-plane momentum is zero. Therefore, we have Vk ;α;p ≠ 0 only if the inplane momentum is conserved ðk k =p k Þ. This limit gives us the wellknown tunneling model.",

The uncertainty in the measured photon energy is given by the manufacturer as 0.041 μeV (10 MHz). As mentioned above, we have investigated the possibility that the interaction with the laser light affects the velocity distribution of the circulating ions and hence the measured threshold value. We only used measurements with laser powers in a region where no power dependence was found. To be conservative, however, we add uncertainty of 0.062 μeV ( \n\n\nFine-structure splitting\n\nIn addition to the electron affinity, the photodetachment threshold corresponding to the binding energy of the upper fine-structure level 2 P 1/2 is also investigated. The number of ions in the excited level present in the ion beam is smaller than the number of ions in the ground state. This, in combination with a smaller photodetachment crosssection 42 , gives a very small photodetachment signal close to the threshold. Therefore, a slightly higher laser power of 215 mW is used to obtain enough signal. The measurement procedure is simpler than for the ground state since no depletion with the high-power laser is needed. Instead, the photon energy scan is started 10 s into the storage cycle and three scans over the threshold are performed before changing to the other laser propagation direction. Ten However, these calculations are more than 10 years old and, since then, much development regarding theoretical models and computing power has taken place.",

An additional uncertainty of 0.21 μeV (50 MHz) is added due to the high laser power used while scanning. The resulting uncertainty is then 0.29 μeV (70 MHz). This gives an excited state binding energy of 1.439,157,53(29) eV. The fine structure splitting is the difference between this binding energy and the electron affinity, and the result is 0.021,955,44(30) eV.DiscussionIn this work, we present a method for high-precision measurements of photodetachment threshold energies of negative ions. The method is demonstrated with a measurement of the electron affinity of oxygen, resulting in a statistical uncertainty of 11 MHz and a final electron affinity uncertainty of 21 MHz. The results are compared to previous experimental electron affinity measurements inFig. 5. The most recent, previous measurements agree with our measured value of 1.461,112,972(87) eV22,40 . However, the present result has a significantly reduced uncertainty. The value reported by ref.39, obtained by the laser photodetachment threshold spectroscopy technique, differs by about 3.4 μeV, which is significantly more than expected from their stated uncertainty.Negative ions have the remarkable property of being weakly bound systems largely dominated by electron correlation. Therefore, electron-affinity calculations represent one of the most challenging situations for atomic structure theory. For example, variational approaches such as configuration-interaction or multiconfigurational Hartree-Fock (MCHF) methods typically require convergence of the absolute energies of the involved atomic eigenstates, something which is rarely achievable in practice. Instead, one has to rely on the relative convergence between the neutral atom and the negative ion. Balancing the complex correlation model of the negative ion with that of the neutral atom poses a major theoretical undertaking and the model can easily converge to the wrong results. Several computations of the oxygen electron affinity, based on various theoretical approaches are available in the literature, e.g., refs. 44-48. The study byGodefroid and   Fischer, based on the MCHF method with relativistic Breit-Pauli corrections, reports a value for",

The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16.

Indeed, the suggested TB potential is designed to describe the standard singlecavity, as the electron is kept close to its fixed center by the confining potential. Even if quantum dynamics leads to the opening of the second void the electron would not be able to migrate there. Moreover, it has been suggested that since the TB is based on the Hartree-Fock theory, comparing it to our ML-MP2 method would reveal the effect of electron correlation. In fact, in the TB potential only the water-electron interactions are based on Hartree-Fock theory, whereas water-water interactions are outsourced to an empirical force field. Thus, there is no clear physical interpretation of potential differences between the TB and ML-MP2-based simulations.\n\nIf the authors of the TB model had made it openly and readily available, in the spirit of open science promoted by this Journal, it would have made sense to run a quick test to satisfy the curiosity of the reviewer. Since that is not the case, and embarking in a new implementation would require disproportionate effort and risks leading to results that are affected by coding errors, we stand by our choice not to perform these additional calculations. Ultimately, our simulations provide semi-quantitative accuracy against a number of experimental probes, which is, in our opinion, a vastly more stringent test than the comparison between two approximate methodologies.\n\n3) I still didn't understand the response about whether the PIMD trajectories are part of the NN training set or not.

I had through the PIMD was added only to the NN simulations? The distinction is important because the authors claim to see large differences in behavior with PIMD vs. classical nuclei, but if the NN potential doesn't 'know' about PIMD nuclei, how can it predict the correct behavior?

As pointed out in the present work, condensed-phase MP2 simulations by Rybkin and coworkers (Ref. 13) put the final nail in the proverbial coffin of the non-cavity model, as summarized in Ref. 2, but these simulations are limited to a few picoseconds at tremendous computational expense. Here, the authors have significantly extended the timescale and furthermore facilitated a quantum treatment of the nuclei by using machine learning to convert the condensed-phase MP2 data into an affordable force-field-like representation.\n\nWhat I like about this work is that it succeeds both as a theoretical methods paper and as a chemical physics paper. On one level, I think this is a great demonstration of the combination of cutting-edge (but exceedingly expensive) ab initio theory, with machine learning techniques, to really do great simulations of a system that is very challenging for theory. At another level, there is a nice confirmation of the localization dynamics (essentially complete within 1 ps) that had been inferred from other simulations and from THz spectroscopy experiments, but is nice to see here from a very high level of theory.\n\nThere are a few things that I think should be revised by the authors, largely related to the tone of how certain ab initio methods are described, but these are easily addressed and I wholeheartedly support publication of this work in Nature Communications.\n\n\nIssues for revision:",

In theory, the NN potential knows about how local polarizability of the water affects the O-H vibrational frequency, but whether this information is properly transferred to the classical (or PIMD) proton dynamics through their VAC is unclear to me, particularly given the fact that the simulation appears not to reproduce the experimental frequencies, either for pure water or the electron. Really this needs to be a normal mode analysis, and it's unclear how simply taking the VAC weights/ignores the normal modes that would be displaced upon excitation, which is what the resonance Raman experiment actually measures. The authors show only the centroid frequency and not the full line width/shape for the experiments for bulk water, which would be a helpful comparison, as would overlaying the Tauber/Mathies experimental Raman spectrum of the electron. The fact that the first-shell water vibrations are redshifted is at least encouraging, but without a better match to experiment or a better justification of this way of estimating the vibrational spectrum, it seems like this might be better relegated to the SI.  In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed some of my concerns, but the main issue that I have with the paper remains unaddressed: the authors propose a radical new picture of the hydrated electron (occasional dual cavity structure) without any demonstration of how such a structure is compatible with known experimental observables, namely the absorption spectrum exhibiting a single featureless peak, and the lack of persistent Polarized Transient Hole Burning (PTHB) spectrum. From the authors' rebuttal it appears that they misunderstood the nature of the anisotropy that PTHB measures (more details below), and so they don't seem to have appreciated the importance of this observable. I want to give the authors one more chance to address the electronic spectroscopy (and I note that I was not the only reviewer to request it), but if they insist on not computing absorption and PTHB spectra [even though the former has been done at the TDDFT level over 10 years ago: <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> <b>132</b>, 10000 (2010)], then I cannot recommend the manuscript for publication in Nature Communications.

If one assumes that the same θ current occurs in the φ intersection, the charge is the same in either kind of intersection with the plane. The change in the orientation of the intersection from θ to φ like, accompanied with the 50:50 stochastic process is reveling in regard with the uncertainty principle. The θ orientation is what produces the sinusoidal electric field pattern printed in the plane and it is the way to know the momentum of the particle with precision. However, to do so the particle is in two places of the plane at the same time, therefore, the measurement of its exact position is even nonsensical. It is pure non-local to produce the wave that leaves in the plane. The stochastic change to the φ intersection stops the particle being non-local, to occupy just one place in flatland, thus its position can be measured very precisely but in doing so, it stops also to produce the sinusoidal pattern, ergo its momentum is completely unknown and there is no way to avoid this, because it is a particle-space intrinsic property. Fig. 12 and 13 show, clearly, that simple symmetry will explain zero and 100 • / • correlation experiments, respectively. On Fig.14, however, it is clear that knowing the position, i.e. φ like intersection with the plane of the up-going accelerated, retained or even stopped electron makes a lost in its identification in 2D space, as well as the information about its momentum, as discussed before. Therefore, the act of measuring the position of the up-going particle, affects the original entanglement and the precision in the measurement of the system total momentum; making it impossible to deduce, with precision, the momentum of the up-going particle by subtracting the momentum of the down-going particle from the system total momentum. Ergo, the EPR paradox is solved without the \"spooky action at a distance\" [26], i.e., uncertainty prevails no matter the arrangement of the experiment, because it accompanies the particle wherever it goes.",

This remark applies also to the following investigations of radiative processes, although, for definiteness, it is convenient to think in terms of the normal frame of reference, this being the one in which the resultant momentum of the systems and the radiation taking part in an encounter is infinitesimal.\n\n\n* § 4.

Now there is a problem here because in Bohr theory when an electron comes in from infinity it has to radiate half its energy to enter into orbit.There was no evidence for any such radiation and the electron would have needed to have twice the energy to start with.However, there were some theorists including Sommerfeld who had an explanation that the electron could be captured if it had a velocity equal to what it was going to have in orbit.\n\nThere were other disturbing facts.The peaks were 0.01 V wide; the fields in the tube were not that accurate.In addition, scanning the entire voltage range in such small steps would take a long time.Well, Davis and Barnes explained, they didn't quite do it that way: they found by some preliminary work that they did check with the Bohr orbit velocities, so they knew where to look.Sometimes they weren't quite in the right place, so they explored around and found them.Their precision was so good they were sure they could get a better value for the Rydberg constant (known then to 1 part in 10 8 ).\n\nThen Langmuir visited Columbia.The way the experiment was done was that an assistant named Hull sat opposite to Barnes in front of a voltmeter, that had a scale that went from 1 to a thousand volts and on that scale he was reading 0.01 V.The room was dark, to see the scintillations, and there was a light on the voltmeter and on the dial of the clock that Barnes used to time his measurements.",

For the same accurate potential, the L2 norm density error used in this work is orders of magnitude smaller than the L1 norm used in other methods such as that of Ref. 32. The convergence thresholds of 10**(-5)e**2 and 10**(-6)e**2 used in the paper are probably equivalent to the L1 norm error of ~0.01e, which is much greater than the values used in Refs. 32 and elsewhere. It is very misleading to claim \"unprecedented\" L2-norm errors when most readers familiar with the problem are thinking in terms of L1 norms. 3. The authors attempt to use Gaussian basis-set densities to produce xc potentials that do not oscillate and decay as -1/r. Such attempts are misguided because Kohn-Sham potentials corresponding to Gaussian densities in the basis-set limit must oscillate and increase as r**2 at large r, as shown in Refs. 31 and 32. Any potential from a Gaussian density that does not oscillate (at least near the nucleus) or does not blow up is not the exact answer to the inversion problem. 4. The proposed method gets rid of the oscillations by \"adding a small correction, Delta rho(r), to rho_data(r), so as to correct for the missing cusp at the nuclei\" (eq. 6). In other words, the \"solution\" is to fudge the input density. This is hardly \"an advance that is likely to influence thinking in the field\". Moreover, the principle of this correction is clearly inspired by the trick of Ref. 33, a fact that is not acknowledged. 5. The authors apply the following adjectives to describe their method: \"rigorous\", \"unambiguous\", \"unprecedented\", etc. None of these characterizations is justified. Modifying an input density is neither \"rigorous\" nor \"unambiguous\". Convergence with respect to the L2 norm of 10**(-6)e**2 is anything but \"unprecedented\", especially after rho_data is \"corrected\". Wobbly potentials seen in Figs. 5 and 6c are poorer than could be obtained by other methods. 6. The general idea of using constrained optimization for mapping densities to xc potentials is not new.

We note that although 0.89 still seems a big overlap, it already means the physical picture is no longer right in this system. If we consider an overlap larger than 0.98 to be reasonably good, then in the short time scale of 100 fs, the adiabatic approximation works relatively well, and in a longer time scale, it cannot match quantum dynamics anymore. The amplitude overlap roughly describes how good the nuclear density is, and we can see that it oscillates between approximately 1 (indicating that the wave packet S20 positions are roughly the same and most errors are in momentum) and the value of the total wave function overlap (indicating that most errors lie in the wave packet description in the real space). Then we investigate a more sensitive property: the variance of position. It roughly tells how delocalized the wave function is and is heavily influenced by quantum interferences. Now we can see in Figure S3 that even within the first 100 fs, the adiabatic CMES-MD is already much different from quantum dynamics with an oversimplified dynamics picture and no interference, which is not surprising considering the classical treatment as well as the adiabatic approximation.\n\nIn summary, CMES-MD can approximate quantum dynamics in a relatively short time scale, but it can be quite different from the quantum dynamics in a longer time scale.\n\n\nEquation 12, together with d x / dt = p /m, forms the equations of motion for CMES-MD.

In a series of papers  and Pachucki and Yerokhin (2009, 2010a, but see also Pachucki and Sapirstein (2010) and Sapirstein (2010), have significantly advanced the theory of these transitions in both helium and light helium-like ions. Based on this work, the theory is now complete to orders mα 7 and m(m/M )α 6 (m the electron mass and m/M the electron-alpha particle mass ratio), previous disagreements among calculations have been resolved, and an estimate of uncertainty due to the uncalculated mα 8 term has been made. Indeed, the uncertainty of the theoretical expression for the ν 02 transition, which is the most accurately known both theoretically and experimentally, is estimated to be 1.7 kHz, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 5.3 × 10 −8 or 2.7 × 10 −8 for α. Nevertheless, even if an experimental value of ν 02 with an uncertainty of just a few hertz were available, the uncertainty in the value of α from helium fine structure would still be too large to be included in the 2010 adjustment In fact, the most accurate experimental value of ν 02 is that measured by Smiciklas and Shiner (2010) with an uncertainty of 300 Hz, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 9.4 × 10 −9 or 4.7 × 10 −9 for α. As given by Pachucki and Yerokhin (2011b), the value of α obtained by equating this experimental result and the theoretical result is α −1 = 137.035 9996(37) [2.7 × 10 −8 ], which agrees well with the two most accurate values mentioned at the start of this section but is not competitive with them.",

PIMD models quantum motion of nuclei within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The regions of the phase space sampled by quantum dynamics are slightly different from the classically sampling regions (normally they are also larger). Therefore, we append our \"classical\" dataset with snapshots taken from PIMD. Thus, the final training dataset includes the phase space accessed by both classical and quantum dynamics, and our NN potential is able to handle the energetics and forces which are needed to propagate molecular dynamics simulations.\n\nIn Figure 1, the authors show the base results of the simulations. It's clear from Figs. 1b/c that the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects makes a huge difference, presumably from the presence of the 'double-cavity' trajectories. The double-cavity is such an extraordinary claim that it needs extraordinary evidence to support it. The simplest evidence would be the UV-Visible absorption spectrum. My glance at Fig. 1b suggests that the snapshots with small radius of gyration and small energy gap would lead to features in the absorption that likely would not mesh with experiment. I understand that the spectrum is not readily available from the simulations, but there are many things the authors could do to approximate it, e.g., using TD-DFT to estimate the excited-state energy gap and transition dipoles on a handful of uncorrelated configurations. The authors already have run DFT calculations to visualize the spin density, so this would not be an unreasonable amount of work. Or even more simply, approximating the absorption spectrum by binning the energy gaps and assuming the Condon approximation, just to get a rough sense of the peak position and width. If the authors could show that inclusion of nuclear quantum effects actually brought the calculated spectrum into better agreement with experiment, I'd be jumping up and down about publishing this work. As-is, I'm skeptical. The authors could also comment on whether their calculated spectrum is homogeneously broadened, as shown by experiment (my guess is that the separate populations of the double cavity and single cavity configurations would be inhomogeneously broadened based on the time scale over which they persist in Fig. 1a, and this would be contrary to experiment).",

Indeed, the directional quantization effect becomes nicely visible in 10 keV/u He 2+ +He collisions where the momentum pattern of the emitted electrons with respect to the nuclear scattering plane was measured by recoil-ion He 2+ -electron coincidence. The scheme of the experiment is shown in Figure 15. The total nuclear angular momentum vector (approximately 10 4 ) points in a direction perpendicular to the nuclear scattering plane. The projections (Figures 16+17) show the intensity distributions of the emitted electrons for the regions within in the dotted lines ( Figure 16).\n\nSince electrons from different molecular orbitals can be promoted to the same final momentum state, one final structure in the momentum distribution can be a mixture of two different angular momenta. During the slow collision process the electronic orbits form so-called quasi-molecular states. Electrons can be promoted during the collision process from one quasi-molecular orbital to another one, where also angular momentum is transferred from the nuclear motion to the electronic motion but strictly conserving angular momentum during the collision process from one attosecond to the next one.\n\nTotal angular momentum has no uncertainty with ongoing collision time. The electrons promoted to continuum (free ionized electrons) must be all in well-aligned angular momentum states or mixtures of them and must show directional quantization. In Figure 16 the electron emission pattern for distant collisions, i.e. small nuclear deflection angles (< 1.25 mrad, large impact parameter) are shown. The left hand side presents the electron momentum distribution in the nuclear scattering plane. The momenta are plotted in units of the projectile velocity and the colors reflect the intensities. The right hand side shows the electron momentum distribution structure perpendicular to the scattering plane, which can be explained by the promotion of electrons from the 2pπ u quasi-molecular state to the continuum.",

A thorough analysis of systematic effects points out that the total uncertainty is 1.1 p.p.b., and the result (ν 0 = 383, 407, 177.38(41) MHz) differs by only 0.6 p.p.b. from the theoretically predicted value (ν th = 383, 407, 177.150(15) MHz). A large contribution to the systematic uncertainty is the effect of chemical reactions in the Coulomb crystal, of which the 1σ uncertainty is 0.61 p.p.b (0.23 MHz). This effect, which had not been recognized before, causes a nonthermal velocity distribution that can be approximated by a q-Gaussian function, and which significantly influences the accuracy of laser spectroscopy of composite lineshapes in the presence of strong saturation and depletion of the HD + sample. This is a situation regularly encountered in laser spectroscopy of Doppler broadened transitions in finite samples of trapped molecular ions.\n\nThe agreement between experimental and theoretical data has several implications. First, it enables a test of molecular theory at the 1-p.p.b. level, and a test of molecular QED at the level of 2.7 × 10 −4 , which are the most stringent tests performed so far. Second, it allows us to put new bounds on the existence of hypothetical fifth forces, and put new limits on the compactification radius of higher dimensions, as described in detail in [3,4,11]. Third, the result presented here can be used to obtain a new value the proton-to-electron mass ratio with a precision of 2.9 p.p.b. [11], for the first time from molecular spectroscopy as proposed already four decades ago [5].",

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter. Y/n. This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

In reconstructing the argument of Tung et al. [32], we found that the rela-  tivistic (-0.0026 cm −1 ) and radiative (0.0010 cm −1 ) corrections of the first rotational interval of H 2 [5], rather than the first vibrational interval, were used to scale the relativistic correction of the first vibrational interval in 3 He 4 He + (-0.006 cm −1 ) [35]. When we scaled the relativistic (-0.0234 cm −1 ) and radiative (0.0213 cm −1 ) corrections of the (ν, J) : (0, 0) → (1, 0) interval in H 2 [5], we found a correction of 0.0005 cm −1 , or 15 MHz, for this interval in 3 He 4 He + . Following the argument of Tung et al., we scaled the relativistic and radiative corrections of the rotational states of H 2 [5] by the factor 3.9. The results are displayed as the dashed line in Fig. 6. The scaled corrections appear to account for the discrepancies between experimental and calculated rotational term values reasonably well up to N + = 11, but rapidly become inadequate beyond N + = 11. Further work is required to understand the origin of this discrepancy. It is conceivable that the approximate treatment of the nonadiabatic correction through R-independent reduced masses in Ref.

How to evaluate if the measurement uncertainty really covers all uncertainty that is associated with the analytical procedure? Considering that, many laboratories frequently underestimate or less frequently overestimate uncertainties on its results; this paper presents the evaluation of estimated uncertainties on two ICP-OES procedures of seven metal measurements according to GUM approach.

This allowed us to increase the number of pseudo-states to 1,254 and thereby also consider ionization with excitation to the n = 3 states of He + . Figures 1 and 2 show a comparison of our predictions with directly measured cross-section ratios [5] for ionization without excitation and ionization with excitation to He + (3s+3p+3d). The agreement with the experimental data is excellent for both symmetric (Fig. 1) and asymmetric (Fig. 2) sharing of the excess energy between the two outgoing electrons. Normalizing to the well-known results for ionization without excitation will then allow for the determination of absolute cross sections for this process [6].     \n\n\nThis work was supported by the United States National Science Foundation under grants PHY-1212450 and PHY-1430245, and the XSEDE allocation PHY-090031.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1TDCS ratio for electron impact ionization of helium with the residual ion left in either the 1s ground state or the excited n = 3 states.

The Hartree-Fock 1s, 2s and 2p tabulated orbitals of Clementi and Roetti [40] were used together with the n=3 orbitals of the N 2+ ion determined by energy optimization on the appropriate hole-shell state   Table 2 gives designation of the resonances 1 -7 , using the atomic structure code CIV3 [41]. The n=3 correlation (pseudo) orbitals are included to account for core relaxation and additional correlation effects in the multi-configuration interaction wavefunctions. All the N 2+ residual ion states were then represented by using multi-configuration interaction wave functions. The nonrelativistic R-matrix approach was used to calculate the energies of the N + bound states and the subsequent PI cross sections. PI cross sections out of the 1s 2 2s 2 2p 2 3 P ground state and the 1 S, 1 D along with the 1s 2 2s2p 3 5 S o metastable states were then obtained for all total angular momentum scattering symmetries that contribute. All our PI cross sections were determined in LS -coupling with the parallel version [39] of the R-matrix programs [36,37,38] and 390 levels of the N 2+ residual ion included in our close-coupling calculations. Due to the presence of meta stable states in the beam, PI cross-section calculations were performed for both the 1s 2 2s 2 2p 2 3 P ground state and the 1s 2 2s 2 2p 2 1 S, 1 D and 1s 2 2s2p 3 5 S o meta stable states of the N + ion. Here again, in order to compare directly with the experimental measurements made at 300 meV and 60 meV the R-matriix results were convoluted with gaussian functions of FWHM of 300",

A partition function Q is defined as where E i is the energy of the state i. The state i is characterized by its configuration, term, quantum number for its total orbital momentum j and quantum number of the z-projection of its orbital momentum m j . The number of bound m j states for the ion is ρ. For almost all practical cases the energy splitting due to external electric or magnetic fields is very small compared to the k B T factor, that is why the energy is considered degenerate with respect to orientation of the angular momentum. Because of this degeneracy, the following simplified form for the partition function is used in astrophysics\nQ = ρ i=0 e − E i k B T ,(15)Q = µ i=0 g i e − E i k B T = µ i=0 (2J i + 1)e − E i k B T ,(16)\nwhere the states i now are characterized only by configuration, term and the quantum number J. The number of bound i states are now µ and g i is the number of possible projections of the total orbital momentum and is called the statistical weight of the state i. The observed levels are mostly tiny fractions of all bound levels when calculating the partition functions, that is why computational atomic codes, such as the Cowan code [5], are needed to obtain the energies to calculate the partition function. Following is a four-step description of how the formula for the statistical weights can be used to estimate partition functions. (1) Determine the highest value of n for the bound Rydberg states, n h . There are some methods for determining n h in the literature [3]. (2) \n\nwhere |Ψ oth | is the cardinality of the set of bound states ψ oth i , and g oth i and E oth i are the corresponding statistical weights and energies. The energy E R is the energy of the highest excited bound Rydberg levels.\n\n\nSummary",

Once a Λ is emitted, the residual nucleus 12 Λ B, which has the largest probability in the dynamical stage, will be excited less than 25 MeV, depending on the energy of the emitted Λ. These excitation energies are comparable to the nucleon and Λ separation energies and therefore a single emission is enough to bring the residue into the particle stable regime. The abundant single hypernuclei which are produced from 12 Λ B, 11 Λ B, 11 Λ Be, 9 Λ Be, 8 Λ Li, and 5 Λ He, have their stable decay partners with small separation energies from 12 Λ B, S n = 12.6 MeV, S p = 14.1 MeV (AMD calc.), S t =15.8 MeV, S α = 13.2 MeV, and S( 5 Λ He)=16.9 MeV, respectively. In AMD-QL, 10 Λ Be has also a relatively large probability of 1.52%, which is produced through one-nucleon emission from dynamically produced 11 Λ B and 11 Λ Be, and deuteron emission from 12 Λ B. The dominance of heavier single hypernuclei, which mainly decay in non-mesic ways, explains again why we frequently see those events with large energy release without pion (8 events out of an average of 31.1).",

In the bottom-right panel, we compare the results of AMD and AMD-QL (g0 = 0.5) with the Cascade results starting from pure compound nucleus formation 13 N * (dotted line). The maximum impact parameter is taken to be 6.5 fm, which corresponds to a cross section of 1300 mb. The error bars indicate the experimental values. 36) seems that the experimental data 36) is reasonably reproduced. However, in the preequilibrium dynamical stage, which is described by AMD, the fragmentation hardly occurs. One nucleon emission from 12 C, inelastic excitation of 12 C, and formation of the compound nucleus 13 N * are dominant, and most of the intermediate-mass fragments are formed at the statistical decay stage, as already discussed by Takemoto et al. 38) This description may not be reasonable by the following two reasons. First, the survival probability of the compound nucleus 13 N * at the end of dynamical simulation seems too large. The life time of the compound nucleus 13 N * at E * = 43.5 MeV is around τ ∼ 65 fm/c in Cascade, and the compound-nucleus formation cross section is at most 300 mb, assuming that the grazing impact parameter of around 3 fm. Therefore, at the time t = 200 fm/c when the dynamical calculation ends, around 5% of the compound nuclei 13 N * can survive, which corresponds to 15 mb by using the above estimate and well below the calculated value with AMD (∼ 50 mb). The second is the lack of the preequilibrium emissions. Basically Cascade describes low-energy statistical decay of equilibrated excited nuclei and the angular distribution of the ejectiles is isotropic, or at least forward-backward symmetric. However, at these incident energies the fragment angular distribution shows strong forwardbackward anisotropy, as shown in the 9 Be/ 11 B + p experimental data, 39) caused by direct-like fragment production.",

In order to keep dead-time and other corrections to a manageable size, we had to limit our counting rate, which naturally limited the number of decay γ-ray events we could collect in a week-long measurement. The next largest uncertainty arises from contaminants in the collected samples. It is a measure of the precision we have achieved with this measurement, that the quantification of impurities, which totaled no more than 0.35% of each sample (see Sec. III D 1), was the second largest source of uncertainty. Following this in importance, were the uncertainties attributed to the determination of γ-ray intensities relative to that of the well-determined 1567-keV peak, and the correction to account for coincidence summing with annihilation radiation. Both were dependent on our necessarily constrained counting rate.\n\nAll four of these contributions to the uncertainty budget depend on conditions that specifically apply to our measurement conditions and can be regarded as statistical. The remaining five are inherent to our basic equipment and techniques; we regard them to be systematic. With the exception of the uncertainty associated with our HPGe detector efficiency, all are very much smaller than the statistical uncertainties.\n\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\n\nA. Superallowed decay branch\n\nOur measurement of the branching ratio for the superallowed 0 + → 0 + β transition from 38 Ca is the first ever made. Several branching-ratio measurements for the Gamow-Teller branches have previously appeared in the literature [5,19,20], but all were normalized to a calculated ratio for the superallowed branch based on the expected constancy of the superallowed F t values 1 . We are now able to test that assumption for this decay.",

A few thousand events were generated for each value of the strength parameter g 0 . In the case of AMD-QL, we have taken the effects of intrinsic distortion of wave packets into account at the end of the reaction by the imaginary-time evolution given in Eq. (3 . 15). In this procedure, we have ignored those events in which the total energy expectation value has not reached the specified energy E 0 . In the statistical decay stage, the fragment mass and isotope distributions are determined essentially by the Q values of the decay, the Coulomb barrier, and the spin-degeneracy factor. Therefore, we have used the experimentally known hypernuclear binding energies, if available. If not, the separation energies calculated by using the AMD wave functions are adopted. On the other hand, the fragment excitation energies used as the inputs for the statistical decay are calculated by subtracting the calculated ground-state energies in order to avoid the spurious effects arising from the difference between the calculated binding energies in the model space and the experimental values.\n\nIn Fig. 4, we show the calculated single and double hyperfragment mass distribution in Ξ − absorption reaction at rest on 12 C with AMD and AMD-QL combined with Cascade. For the single-hyperfragment mass distribution, the situation is similar to the case of the 12 C+p reaction: With AMD, we only obtain formation of the 12 Λ B * compound nucleus by one Λ evaporation in the dynamical stage. Almost all the single-hyperfragments are formed through the statistical decay of 12 Λ B * and 13 ΛΛ B * .",

In Fig. 3, we show the results of the AMD-QL (plus Cascade) calculation for the fragment mass distribution of 12 C + p at 45 MeV with g 0 =0.1 ∼ 0.5. After the statistical decays we cannot see significant differences among the results of the AMD and AMD-QL calculations, and all of them well reproduce the data. However, the mass distribution at the dynamical stage (histograms in Fig. 3) changes drastically when the value of g 0 is changed. As the fluctuation strength is increased from g 0 =0 (AMD) to g 0 = 0.5, the compound nuclear survival probability decreases and dynamical fragmentation (mainly to α+ 8 Be and 3α) occurs more frequently. We should note that AMD-QL can describe fragmentation to intermediate-mass fragments at low excitation before statistical decay by the effects of fluctuations around classical paths given by Quantal Langevin force. So, the mass distributions before and after Cascade become closer, and direct production of ground-state fragments is partly described with AMD-QL. On the basis of this analysis of proton-induced reactions, we find the range g 0 ≤ 0.5 for the fluctuation strength parameter is suitable for reproducing the fragment mass distribution after Cascade. In addition, from the consideration of the life-time of compound nuclei and the necessity of preequilibrium fragment emission, the values around g 0 ∼ 0.5 seems preferable.\n\nIt is also possible to describe the reaction 12 C + p at 55 MeV with the same value of the strength parameter g 0 . Detailed analysis of proton-induced and heavyion reactions with AMD-QL will be reported elsewhere. §4.

                    "contents": "Assessment of the beta-delayed proton decay rate of 11Be-The performed here analysis shows that it is very difficult to explain the reported in Ref. [13] t Be→βp = 1 × 10 6 s half-life as being due to beta-delayed proton emission process. There are reports [17,18] suggesting problems with the experiment and highlighting some of the same issues. In order to observe such rate, even for structurally favored superallowed states such as isobaric analog, the Q-value for the beta decay has to be over 100 keV, more likely over 150 keV. This leaves very little energy for the subsequent proton decay and the resulting proton decay width is expected to be much less than a fraction of 1 keV. At the same time, all states in the region of interest are expected to have significant alpha decay width, likely about 100 keV, and certainly more than 1 keV. The predominant alpha decay is expected to further reduce chances of seeing a beta-delayed proton decay by at least one or two orders of magnitude. The competition with alpha branch narrows the list of possible intermediate states in 11 B to those with spin-parity 1/2 + . The shell model maybe rather uncertain in the prediction of energies but it describes well known states above and below the region of interest; and both versions considered predict nearest 1/2 + state about an MeV higher. We conclude that the reported half-life for the beta-delayed proton decay t Be→βp = 1×10 6 s is virtually impossible to explain with some of the best and most reliable theoretical models. Using Fig. 2 we estimate that even if there is an intermediate state that facilitates the beta-delayed proton decay it is unrealistic to expect the half-life shorter than 10 8 s. However, it is most likely that such process proceeds virtually giving half-life of the order of 10 10 s. Our evaluation of the principal contribution from the isobaric analog state gives t Be→βp = 2.6 × 10 10 s, which is consistent with other theoretical estimates. * * * This material is based upon work supported by the US Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics under Award No. de-sc0009883.

(1) of course refers only to the β particles emitted from 38 Ca. However, the number we obtain from our β detector includes not only the β's from 38 Ca but also those from its daughter 38 K. In addition there are other much smaller contributions, including those from any weak impurities that remain in the collected samples. We deal first with the impurities.\n\n\nImpurities\n\nBased on the spectrum of reaction products detected at the MARS focal plane (see Sec. II), we determined the initial intensity of weak contaminants; then we used the SRIM code [14] to calculate the energy loss each would experience in passing through the degraders, and thus derived the amount of each that would be collected in our tape. Expressed as a percentage of the 38 Ca deposited, we found the initial intensities in the tape to be: 37 K -0.02(1)%; 36 K -0.03(2)%; 35 Ar -0.20(10)%; 34 Ar -0.07(2)%; and 34 Cl -0.03(1)%. Naturally, each of these activities has a different half-life, and some populate βdecaying daughters as well. All this information is well known, though, so we have used it to calculate that the total of all impurities contributed 0.58(30)% to the total number of β's recorded during the counting period.\n\nMost of these impurities have only very weak branches to γ-emitting states so, for them, there is no evidence available to corroborate these calculations. The decay of 36 K is the sole exception: Its β decay leads to the emission of a 1970-keV γ ray 82% of the time [15]. This γ-ray peak is weakly present in our β-coincident γ-ray spectrum, allowing us to determine the ratio of its area to that of the 1567-keV γ-ray peak from 38 Ca decay. The result, though imprecise, is consistent with the relative intensity obtained from the MARS focal plane spectrum.\n\n\nParent β-decay fraction",

Since the half-lives of 38 Ca and 38m K are well known [1,16,17], the ratio of their activities can easily be calculated if the 38 Ca implantation rate is known as a function of time during the collection period [17]. To enable this calculation, we recorded the time profile of ions detected by the scintillator at the exit of MARS for each individual cycle. A typical result for a single run, comprising 2,277 cycles, appears as Fig. 6. Before making the calculation, though, we need to correct, if necessary, for three more small effects: lator. This does not matter for annihilation radiation, which can be thought of as a surrogate for a β particle, since it would not alter the efficacy of Eq. (1). However it does matter for the transition γ rays in cases where they are detected but the corresponding β particle that feeds the transition is not. Using EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulations, we determined that 0.043(4)% of the total counts in the β detector are γ rays of this type. We reduced the recorded number of counts in the detector by this factor.\n\n(ii) The decay of 38m K includes a weak 0.033(4)% γ-ray branch to the ground state of 38 K [1], so the number of observed β's must be less than the total decays of 38m K by that amount. We apply this correction.\n\n(iii) Although the E βmax for 38m K decay is less than it is for the superallowed transition from 38 Ca, the other lower-energy branches from 38 Ca act to offset the efficiency difference that would otherwise be expected (see discussion in Sec. III C). As a result, the total efficiency for observing β's from 38m K is very nearly the same as it is for observing them from 38 Ca. Nevertheless, the remaining 0.025% efficiency difference was incorporated.",

Being defined through equation (5), the optical depth at a given energy is sensitive to the concentration of a chemical species, and its ability to interact with radiation in that energy range. In the topmost layers, the Lyman−α line central frequency is optically thin. This line turns into thick (τ 1) at P ∼ 5 × 10 −7 bar. When the pressure reaches the 10 −5 bar level, the optical depth has increased of about 4 orders of magnitude, because of the rising densities of molecular species (see the upper plateau in the dissociation rates, Figure 4a). From this location on, Lyman−α radiation is virtually extinct, see Figure 5b in which it is shown the pressure at which a photon of a given energy reaches the apical value of τ = 100. Higher energy photons e.g., E = 14 eV a value slightly larger than the energy threshold of atomic hydrogen ionization, present optical depths increasing rapidly up to pressures at which molecular species begin to form, P ∼ 10 −5 bar.

(25)\nThe maximal J M value in the sum is determined as the J -value for which the repulsive rotational term at the end grid point R N is equal to the energy E T , which follows J M ≈ R N 2µE T and J M = N.The last sum in the relation in Equation (25) contains contributions to the P, Q, R branches of the spectra for ∆J = −1, 0, 1, respectively.For each J value in Equation ( 25), there are N energies and wave functions in the lower Λ and upper Λ electronic states, and consequently, N 2 transitions between the ro-vibrational states of the lower and upper electronic state.Each transition \"i\" is defined by numbers (v i , v i , J i , ∆J i ) and the number of transitions is M = 3N 3 , where factor 3 is because of the P, Q, R branching.",

For a typical excited state energy of 2 eV and width 100 meV , the onset is about 50 meV from the peak, leading to a fractional error of 2.5 %. For functions that vary as the fifth power of the energy, this contributes an error of less than 15 %the low end for the experimental uncertainty of the more accurate nonlinear-optical measurements. So, in using the peak values to obtain the energies, our calculations have an uncertainty of about 15 %; and, the positions of the peaks in our dispersion plots could be off by about 50 meV .\n\n\nA. Influence of the number of electrons\n\nA simple consequence of the Thomas-Khun sum-rules is that the two-photon cross-section of a molecule depends quadratically on the effective number of electrons. With the aid of the sum-rules one can rewrite γ T K3 I as:\nγ T K∞ I = e √ 2m 2 N 2 ef f E 5 10 Φ,(32)\nwhere Φ is a dimensionless function that depends on the energy ratios, the transition dipole moment ratios and the inverse radiative lifetimes but does not depend on N ef f . This is a general result that applies to molecules with any number of levels. Eq. 32 together with Eq. 1 predict a quadratic dependence on the effective number of electrons for the TPA cross-section: Fig. 9 shows a plot of the TPA cross-sections of the different molecules as a function of N 2 ef f . The data follow an approximately linear relationship, indicating that even though the performance of a molecule is dictated by many factors, it correlates with the square of the effective electrons. Note that while this scaling appears to be approximately universal for the molecules studied, it may not hold in other classes of molecules.     \nδ(ω) ∝ E 2 20 E 5 10 N 2 ef f Φ.(33)\n\nB.

( 5) can be used to extract information about the ground potential.One of the most popular method is the Birge-Sponer treatment. 13his approach requires the subtraction of energies for transitions originating from the same excited vibrational level into ground states of successive vibrational indices v : ∆ν v = νv ,v − νv ,v +1 .Then, Eqs. ( 2) and ( 5) yield\n∆ν v = G v +1 − G v = ω 0 − 2ω 0 x 0 (v + 1) . (7)\nThis expression indicates that the energy spacings are fairly constant at low v , but reduce gradually at high v , up to a maximum level v max corresponding to the dissociation energy D e .Based on this argument, the students plot ∆ν v = ∆G v versus (v + 1) and fit it with a straight line.Then, the fundamental frequency ω 0 is the intercept of the ∆G v axis, and the anharmonic term ω 0 x 0 comes from the slope of the line.The dissociation energy D 0 with respect to the zero-point level is simply given by the area under the linear plot in the interval (0, v max ).Because ∆ν 0 ≈ ω 0 whereas ∆ν vmax → 0, the zero-point dissociation energy\nD 0 /hc = ω 2 0 /4ω 0 x 0 .(8)\nCombining with Eq. ( 5), the students can furthermore calculate the dissociation energy D e relative to the equilibrium point (that is, the bottom of the potential well) as shown in Fig. 1:\nD e hc = G 0 + D 0 hc = 1 2 ω 0 − 1 4 ω 0 x 0 + ω 2 0 4ω 0 x 0 .(9)\n\nIII.

Thus, it might be possible to get a first answer, if mass scaling is applicable in the case of potassium at the present level of accuracy. At a first glance the obtained standard deviations are below 1.0, see section IV. Thus the evaluation is within the reported experimental accuracies. However, looking more closely to the deviations of the highly precise Feshbach resonances, where a magnetic field uncertainty of 0.05 G relates to an uncertainty in the order of 100 kHz in the frequency scale, the fit for 40 K 2 is excellent, but the scatter between the deviations for 39 K 2 is fairly large and for such small set of data too often at the limit of the experimental accuracy. This is not so obvious in the published fit of Ref. [13], because they used the less precise data of 40 K from Ref. [9] in their fit. We also would like to note, that the standard deviation, given as reduced χ 2 with the value 0.52 is probably in error, we obtained with their data 1.04. Also for some data of the few photoassociation measurements on the isotope 39 K the deviations come close to the reported experimental uncertainties. Thus we would like to recommend new experiments for getting improved results from twocolor photoassociation, which are presently reported with a 40 MHz uncertainty limit, and to extend the measurements of Feshbach resonances, for which we will make predictions below (Fig. 3). In the same spirit we prepare presently high precision molecular beam studies on potassium as we performed in the case of Na 2 [28,29] some years ago. All this together might give the proper limit for mass scaling, i.e. of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, for the ground states of potassium atom pairs. For the excited asymptote s + p we already reported an experimental evidence of necessary corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [31].",

G(to-tOo).To obtain the decay we should then calculate IFT(E(,o))I = and finally Fourier transform this quantity to obtain a spectrum of the beats in the decay\"",

While the ground state solution can, by the minimum energy principle, be identified as the one with the lowest energy, 70 an analogous method cannot be used for tracking excited state solutions. 38,53 In previous work, 53 we demonstrated that the mean-field solution for the doubly excited state of ethylene giving the best description of the energy curve along the double bond torsion can be identified based on the conservation of the saddle point order as the wave function undergoes symmetry breaking. This approach provides a guiding principle for targeting a specific solution during the exploration of an excited state potential energy surface for atomic dynamics. A second remaining issue is problematic convergence on a high-order saddle point, especially when wave function relaxation leads to large rearrangements of the orbitals, as can be the case for charge transfer excitations.

This does not generally guarantee a closed equation of motion for the single-particle KS density matrix of the mixed state [6].\n\nAs mentioned previously, our aim is to describe the decay of excited electrons bound to a He nucleus. The electrons are prepared in some initial excited state, and evolve into the ground state as a result of the stochastic interaction with an environment, that, quite generally, can be thought of as a boson field. The precise form of the operatorV which causes this behavior would, in general, depend on the detailed model of the environment. Here we choose the simplest possible operator, whose matrix elements are [21]\nǫ i |V |ǫ j = 1/ √ τ t d if i = 0, and 0 < j < M 0 otherwise,(5)\nwhere |ǫ i is an eigenstate of the ground-state KS Hamiltonian in the absence of the interaction with the bath, ǫ i is the corresponding eigenvalue, and the upper limit M is a given integer representing the number of states we keep in the simulation. (In the present case we have kept M = 15 states.) The parameter t d gives the timescale over which the decay will occur, with larger values of t d leading to longer decay times [22]. In the following we have chosen t d = 1 fs. The operatorV defined this way ensures that the stochastic Schrödinger equation (4) is independent of the magnitude of τ . Clearly, the above operator reduces the projection of a wave-function from the states {|ǫ 1 , |ǫ 2 . . . |ǫ M−1 }, and increases the projection onto the ground state |ǫ 0 . Physically, it describes energy relaxation and dephasing.",

CONCLUSION\n\nAfter publishing a description for the ground state potential for the region from 4 to 11Å and the vibrational interval from v ′′ = 0 to 48 in [10], for the present paper we concentrated our work on the asymptotic levels of this state. By applying the same spectroscopic method but improving the detection scheme, increasing the signal averaging time and selecting appropriate excited rovibrational levels to reach the long range regime we were able to observe levels with v ′′ up to 60, while v ′′ = 62 would be the last existing one for low J ′′ . This allowed us to extend the potential region up to an internuclear distance of 23Å from our data set.\n\nIncluding the term energies of the v ′′ = 62, J ′′ = 0 and J ′′ = 2 levels measured by photoassociation [15], we were able to derive the long range coefficients C 6 , C 8 and C 10 . By taking the C 8 coefficient from theory [12,13], which has in our modeling a larger uncertainty than the theoretically calculated C 8 coefficient, we derived an internally consistent set of the remaining two coefficients C 6 and C 10 . This leads to a further reduction of the uncertainties in the calculation of the scattering lengths for all combinations of natural abundant isotopes of Strontium. We were also able to give a reliable value for the dissociation energy D 0 of the X state.",

In this work, we present new experimental data on the E(v = 3, J = 52, 53) state lifetime of the diatomic iodine. Our experimental lifetime value is slightly lower than the measured lifetime of the higher vibrational E(v = 49) state [31]. However, within the errors, we conclude that the lifetime is not significantly affected by the ion pair potential. Lifetimes or decay rates as well as Doppler free linewidths may reveal the nature of the states involved by the scale of these quantities in relation to the long range interatomic interactions. For instance, in strontium ultracold homonuclear molecules, the short lifetime of the 1 u state implies that the state is equivalent to a two body superradiant state [47]. On the other hand, measurements of a long sequence of lifetimes as a function of (v, J) can reveal scaling laws in these quantities. Recently published articles reported a strong dependence of molecular lifetime on rovibrational level's wavefunctions [33,34]. This work will be followed by making series of lifetime measurements as a function of vibrational or rotational quantum numbers in diatomic molecules.\n\nFigure 1 :\n1(Color online) Partial potential energy curves of molecular iodine and doubleresonance excitation scheme are shown.

The RMS energy uncertainty is given by:\n∆E = kT 2 C v(1)\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C v is heat capacity [1,2,3]. One can estimate the heat capacity using the equipartition theorem. By analogy to the Debye theory of heat capacity of crystals, at room temperature we can assume that most of the vibrational degrees of freedom of a large protein molecule are low frequency modes and can therefore be considered to be fully thermally active. Each oscillator will contribute to the heat capacity, and there are three oscillators per atom. If the molecule contains vibrationally active atoms the equipartition theorem [3] predicts a heat capacity of C v = 3kN . Since we are dealing with large ions we ignore the fact that there are three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, which would effectively reduce by a count of six. After some substitutions and algebra we have:\n∆E = √ 3N kT(2)\nConsider an averagine molecule with chemical formula C 9877 H 15517 N 2715 O 2955 S 83 . In counting atoms to generate a value for N we exclude hydrogen atoms, because they are associated with high frequency modes which, generally speaking, are not thermally activated at ambient temperatures. We therefore calculate by counting the number of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms in the molecule, giving a value of N = 15, 630.\n\nSubstituting this into the Eq. (2) and assuming T = 300 we estimate the thermal energy uncertainty for a single ion to be ∆E = 8.97 × 10 −19 J. Using the relationship between mass and energy from special relativity E = mc 2 we calculate the energy uncertainty to be equivalent to a mass uncertainty of ∆m = 9.98 × 10 −36 kg or ∆m = 6.00 × 10 −9 Da.",

Quantum mechanically, of course, this system has no bound states, only metastable states, which decay unimolecularly by tunneling through the barriers. Waite and Miller 5 have calculated the energies and lifetimes (the inverse of the unimolecular decay rate) of the individual metastable quantum states of the system, and Figure 1 shows a sample of their results. Because of the C3 symmetry of the system, the calculation is carried out separately for states of A symmetry (solid circles in Figure 1), A2 symmetry (open squares), and E symmetry (open circles). The solid line in Figure 1 is the result given by standard statistical theory, i.e., microcanonical transition state theory, 6\nk(E)= 3 P[E-Vo-(n +1/2)hto*]/[2,rrhp(E)] (2.2)\nHere P is the one-dimensional tunneling probability as a function of the energy along the reaction coordinate, to*= x/g is the frequency of the \"activated complex\", p(E) the density of reactant states, and the factor of 3 is due to the three equivalent transition states. The first thing that one observes in Figure 1 is that the statistical approximation to the rate constants (i.e., Eq. 2.2) is quite good for the A1 and E states, even in the low energy region below --0.11\n\nwhere the classical mechanics is essentially completely quasi-periodic.\n\nOn closer inspection one does see some mode-specificity in the A and E states, i.e., some dispersion about the average curve, but this is more pronounced at higher rather than lower energies. To the extent that there is any trend at all, therefore, it is opposite to what one would predict on the basis of the quasi-periodic/chaotic character of the classical mechanics. The appearance of some degree of modespecificity at high energies is perhaps understandable in that even if the various degrees of freedom are strongly coupled, states with most of the energy in the reaction coordinate will decay essentially instantaneously (i.e., within one vibrational period) while those with most of the energy in inactive modes will require at least a few vibrations for the energy to flow into the reaction coordinate.",

We show that some of these results appear questionable and in a few cases even clearly unreliable, a fact which may also affect the prediction of collision cross sections based on such data. Our analysis uses Quantum Defect Theory scaling laws and is supported by variational R-matrix calculations. Some simple recipes are discussed, which may help users of ab initio quantum chemistry packages to assess the quality of their results.\n\nUncertainty estimates in theoretical calculations and modeling are becoming an important issue in present-day Atomic and Molecular Physics, both in spectroscopic and collisional applications [1]. Until recently, numerical theoretical data were typically published either in graphical form or as extensive data tables, usually without much indication as to their expected uncertainty. New theoretical data were compared to theoretical or experimental results available in the literature, and the agreement between the new results and existing data was then taken as an indicator of the accuracy of the results obtained.\n\nTo some extent the comparison of new data with previous ones may indeed serve as a rough measure of the uncertainty. However, when new calculations are presented for which no previous results exist to compare with, it is desirable to provide estimated uncertainties or error bars along with the data. Such estimates are important when experimental work based on high quality theoretical predictions is carried out, and they may become crucial, for instance when theoretical and experimental data are combined in metrology.\n\nThe present contribution deals with first principles calculations of highly excited molec-ular electronic states in instances where spectroscopic level accuracy is needed to interpret levels and transitions observed in high-resolution spectroscopy. Specifically we present a critical review of selected published quantum-chemical calculations of Rydberg and doubly-excited Born-Oppenheimer electronic states of diatomic hydrogen H 2 and the helium hydride ion HeH + , which serve here as benchmark systems for homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules in general.",

A very rough estimate of the factor q can be done in the following way. For the ground state of atomic Cs the q-factor is about 1100 cm −1 , which is close to 1 4 α 2 Z 2 ε 6s , where ε 6s is the ground-state binding energy. If we assume that the same relation holds for the electronic transition in molecule, we get |q| ∼ 1 4 α 2 Z 2 ω el,0 ∼ 120 cm −1 . Using this estimate and Eq. (59) we get:\nδω ≈ −240 δα α − 1600 δµ µ ,(60)\nwhere we assume that relativistic corrections reduce dissociation energy of the molecule, so q is negative. This estimate shows that the experiment with Cs 2 is mostly sensitive to variation of µ.",

This is the case in many relevant situations, where these processes are on the nanosecond timescale, compared to a few femtoseconds that are needed to find well resolved spectra. While such coupling between ground and excited electronic states can be directly treated using the decomposition into pure states and propagating via NMQSD in the full electronic Hilbert space, presumably the dyadic equation will need major modifications.\n\nWe demonstrated the applicability of our schemes explicitly using the HOPS formulation of NMQSD. It should be noted that our equation are formulated for arbitrary temperatures. Within HOPS there are different ways how to incooperate temperature either in the hierarchy 36 or in additional stochastic processes. 31 Because our schemes propagate single trajectories subject to noise, it is straightforward to account for the effect of the static disorder induced by the inhomogeneity of the environment without much additional computational cost. Since the HOPS provides efficient treatment of the environmental degrees of freedom and furthermore one propagates vectors instead of matrices the propagation schemes offer promising techniques to simulate absorption spectra of large molecular aggregates with complicated structured environments. Our dyadic HOPS equation is also an important step towards application of HOPS for non-linear spectroscopy. \n\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY\n\nFurther data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n\nAppendix A: Linear absortion using HOPS without noise\n\nIt is demonstrated in Ref. 36 that for the calculation of absorption spectra, one can propagate the linear HOPS equation (Eq. 13) without noise, i.e. with all z t,n = 0.

As mentioned above, a balanced treatment of excited states with different character is highly desirable. Moreover, chemically accurate excitation energies (i.e., with error smaller than 1 kcal/mol or 0.043 eV) would be also beneficial in order to provide a quantitative chemical picture. The access to other properties, such as oscillator strengths, dipole moments, and analytical energy gradients, is also an asset if one wants to compare with experimental data. Let us not forget about the requirements of minimal user input and minimal chemical intuition (i.e., black box models are preferable) in order to minimize the potential bias brought by the user appreciation of the problem complexity. Finally, low computational scaling with respect to system size and small memory footprint cannot be disregarded. Although the simultaneous fulfillment of all these requirements seems elusive, it is useful to keep these criteria in mind. Table 1 is here for fulfill such a purpose.\n\nBefore detailing some key past and present contributions aiming at obtaining highly accurate excitation energies, we start by giving a historical overview of the various excitedstate ab initio methods that have emerged in the last fifty years. Interestingly, for pretty much every single method, the theory was derived much earlier than their actual implementation in electronic structure software packages and the same applies to the analytical gradients when available.\n\nThe first mainstream ab initio method for excited states was probably CIS (configuration interaction with singles) which has been around since the 1970's. 8 CIS lacks electron correlation and therefore grossly overestimates excitation energies Table 1: Formal computational scaling of various excited-state methods with respect to the number of one-electron basis functions N and the accessibility of various key properties in popular computational software packages. The typical error range for single excitations is also provided as a qualitative indicator of the method accuracy.\n\n\nMethod",

The first method is to vary the binding energy for the descriptor (C, H, and O) on Ni(111) in RMGs' input file, which is described in (12).\n∆E AX Ni = ∆E AX Pt + γ (∆E A Ni + δE A Ni ) − ∆E A Pt(12)\nThe second approach is to assume that the DFT derived binding energy for the descriptor is correct and the heat of formation of the adsorbate in the Pt(111) database is varied, resulting in\n∆E AX Ni = (∆E AX Pt + δE AX Pt ) + γ ∆E A Ni − ∆E A Pt(13)\nThe first method would automatically account for the correlation between the heats of formation, which means that e.g., if the binding energy of C * is increased, the resulting values for CO * and HCO * are increased, which agrees with the d-band model. S19 Whereas the first method is easy to implement and accounts for correlation, it has a severe drawback because the uncertainty is scaled with the LS relation. If we perturbed the binding energy with ± 0.3 eV, C * would have an uncertainty of ± 0.3 eV because γ = 1 but the physisorbed species would not be uncertain at all since γ = 0. This premise is not valid. When we decrease the binding energy of C by 30 kJ mol −1 , the CO binding energy will be decreased by the same amount. On top of that, there can be a small uncertainty but this will describe the general trend. Therefore, we choose the latter method within this work. Figure S11 illustrates the quasi-random sampling and the correlation between the adsorbates according to the LS relations. The three descriptor species H * , C * , and O * are uncorrelated and the quasi-random numbers fill the entire uncertainty range. The uncertainty domain for the C-O parameter space is illustrated in Figure S11a, which shows the uniform distribution inside the boundaries of [-0.3 eV, 0.3 eV]",

To account for the continuous increase in the value of the specific heat with rise of temperature at high temperatures, the diatomic gas molecule must be imagined to be elastic. In order to deduce theoretical expressions for the temperature variation of the specific heat, assumptions have to be made and arbitrary constants have to be chosen to obtain as satisfactory an agreement as is possible between the results calculated from the proposed theory and those experimentally obtained, and a reasonable criticism of all theoretical developments would be that the resulting expression for the temperature variation of specific heat becomes more and more empirical in character as the number of assumptions made in its deduction is increased. It will suffice to draw attention to such assumptions as the a priori probability of various quantum states (Reiche and others), the law of force between the nuclei (Kemble and van Vleck), which have been proposed but which have not given theoretical results § in good agreement with experimental values. * * * § During the past two years a very interesting theoretical explanation of the variation of heat capacity of hydrogen with temperature has been developed from the application of the new mechanics in the study of band-spectra data. Heisenberg* suggested the existence of two kinds of molecules of hydrogen, symmetrical and antisymmetrical, according to the direction of nuclear spin, in order to explain intensity variations in the band spectrum. Horif deduced that the molecules with antisymmetrical wave functions were three times as numerous as the symmetrical ones. By assuming this ratio and th at there were no transitions from one molecular state to another during the short time taken in determining a specific heat experimentally, Dennison | was able to apply statistical theory to ordinary hydrogen (which must be considered as a gas in a state of metastable equilibrium as regards the distribution of molecular energy, i.e., a mixture of two distinct gases-Fowler), and obtained theoretical values in excellent agreement with the experimental results below 300°.

Kam can disentangle the orientational disorder (see Kirian, J. Phys.B: At.Mol.Opt.Phys., 45, 223001 (2012)).This requires a coherence width shorter than the distance between molecules.If the plan is for a coherent beam whose size is about equal to that of one molecule (\"isolated molecules\"?), using a pulsed photoeld source and lenses to demagnify the beam to nanometer dimensions, then there will not be much signal, or even one scattered electron per picosecond, despite the high elastic cross section (see question 609).",

Levitation techniques have an increasing interest in recent years as important tools for scattering experiments. The main reasons for this interest are the low background signal, the purity of the sample and the possibility of performing experiments with small amounts of samples. In particular, we have shown that diffraction experiments are possible on D4, D1B and D22 with samples of only a few tens of mg. Among the different containerless methods, aerodynamic levitation combined with laser heating has proved to be a powerful and versatile technique for studying the structure, dynamics, and macroscopic properties of high-temperature liquids including insulating compounds (glasses, ceramics, and oxides) and metallic materials. The use this techniques is mainly adapted for studies of materials above the melting point and in the supercooled state condition maintaining a high degree of control in temperature. In particular, the atomic structure of liquid materials can be determined by measurements of the structure factor S(Q) and calculation of the corresponding pair correlation function g(r), as reported in this paper. The acoustic levitation is originally designed for the investigation of supercooled liquids and aqueous solutions in the temperature range from about −40 C to +40 C. This temperature range covers the supercooled region for water and many salt and biological solutions. By eliminating contact with container walls, sources of heterogeneous nucleation are avoided and it often becomes possible to cool liquids substantially below their equilibrium melting point. Here we show that this technique can be also adopted for powder diffraction with a small amount of sample in the beam obtaining good data quality necessary to make the data refinement. In particular, we have shown that diffraction experiments are possible on D4, D1B and D22 with samples of only a few tens of mg. The high adaptability on different neutron instruments of the levitation devices presented in this article offers the possibility to combine different neutron techniques. This is a very important point for an exhaustive analysis of materials based on multi-techniques and multi-scale approach.\n\n\nthis work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

This has been compounded by observations of specific X-ray damage to the crystallized protein (for an early example, see Helliwell, 1988). Conducting crystallography at physiological temperatures has then become an objective, but what about radiation damage being much greater at room temperature? Neutron macromolecular crystallography (nMX), whilst pursuing protein structures with experimentally determined protonation states, has also automatically yielded room-temperature structures. Given also that projects succeed in obtaining neutron beam time only when all other methods (X-ray, electron or NMR based) have failed, it is clear that in structural biology there is an improved strategic importance of the nMX method. Indeed, nMX has seen a sustained growth in the number and scope of instruments, and of the software and methods employed, at neutron sources (see, for example, Blakeley & Podjarny, 2018). Furthermore, the new X-ray lasers yield X-ray diffraction data at room temperature and before radiation damage can kick in: the 'diffract before the sample is destroyed' approach (Neutze et al., 2000). Synchrotron facilities are now also adopting the X-ray laser method of 'serial femtosecond crystallography' for the delivery of streams of micrometre-sized samples and thereby are also yielding results at physiological temperatures, albeit not free of radiation damage as at X-ray lasers (see, for example, Schlichting, 2015). An amazing accomplishment, to my mind, is the room-temperature crystal structure of the 30S ribosome using the Stanford Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS; Dao et al., 2018). However, the use of streams of micrometre-sized crystals raises the question of variations in these samples of the biological molecules.",

Advanced facilities that have developed for macromolecular deuteration now permit the production of suitably labelled protein crystals on a routine and reliable basis 16 . It should be noted that this method may provide a useful complement to X-ray anomalous phasing approaches -particularly where structure determination at room or physiological temperature is advantageous 25 . In the current study the anomalous scatterer was introduced in the metal chelating site using chemical reagents to remove the native iron prior to isomorphous replacement with the 113 Cd isotope. In future studies one can envisage the soaking of anomalous scatterers into macromolecular crystals in a way that is routinely used in X-ray diffraction studies (see for example 26 and references therein). Anomalous protein phasing work using X-rays can be delicate when carried out at room temperature, and neutron approaches, for which radiation damage effects are essentially negligible, provide a way of tackling these problems. Experiments close to physiological temperatures can highlight structural differences induced by cryo-cooling, and which may be more representative of in vivo structures and their resulting functionalities. This is reflected in the recent upsurge of interest in room temperature structures stimulated by FEL studies, including the work of Lui et al. who determined a GPCR crystal structure at room temperature 27 . This structure showed distinct thermal motions and residue conformations different to the cryo-cooled structure. The confluence of new spallation neutron sources, high-performance detectors and ready access to perdeutered proteins is paving the way to practical perspectives for neutron phasing methods. The impact of this approach is likely to be greatly enhanced by the fact that time-of-flight measurement at spallation neutron sources will, in a single experiment, provide diffraction data over the whole wavelength range accessible to a given instrument. Plots of the real (b') and imaginary (b\") components of the neutron scattering length for selected isotopes are provided in Fig. 3, highlighting the availability of an anomalous signal across neutron wavelength ranges. This offers key advantages given that anomalous differences will de facto be available over a wide wavelength range encompassing the resonance energies of isotopes that are relevant for the study of biological crystals.",

The vibrational spectra, like those of KHCO 3 , are consistent with adiabatic separation and asymmetric double-wells for the OH stretch modes (νOH). 10,11,13 In addition, the spectra reveal a phenomenon that is not observed for KHCO 3 : the thermal population of a state at hν l = (54 ± 6) cm −1 is correlated with the interchange of single and double CObonds (tautomerism), occurring without any change of the proton states. 10 This is consistent with markedly different timescales for tautomerism ( Fig. 1, I) and adiabatic interconversion of protons (Fig. 1, II), hereunder referred to as \"interconversion\" for short. By analogy with the popular \"phonon-induced tautomerism\", 6 it was conjectured that hν l could be a phonon such that the ground state should correspond to the preferred tautomer at low temperatures and the excited states to a mixture of both tautomers sharing the same νOH states. 10,17 However, neutron diffraction studies by Wilson et al. 7 report a temperature law for the proton-site occupancy factor (H-SOF) that is at variance with both the proposed model and NMR/QENS data. For example, the estimated R-SOF at 20 K is ≈ 13% instead of ≈ 0 given by the other techniques.

Since neutron diffraction data sets were not collected at temperatures of 30, 50, 75 and 100 K, these data points are absent in the comparison with high-resolution X-ray and TLS+ONIOM results. The TLS+ONIOM approach confirms that individual displacements of hydrogen invarioms are distinguishable mainly at temperatures below 100 K. Rotational disorder cannot be predicted from this approach, whereas it is also detectable in the neutron data at higher temperatures. Good agreement of neutron diffraction and the TLS+ONIOM approach is found for the temperaturedependent ratio of hydrogen U iso or U eq and the parent atom, which also agrees rather well with the X-ray results in Fig. 3. However, at higher temperatures HAR and neutron diffraction show a trend that deviates from the other methods, with the ratio being higher than 1.5, whereas the ratio is smaller in invariom refinement. This is probably due to the predicted/ constrained hydrogen positions in invariom refinement, which impose a beneficial limit on the flexibility of the structural model here. Since the rigid-body fit in the TLS+ONIOM approach is based on the invariom results, a similar temperature dependence to that in invariom refinement is observed.\n\nA comparison of Figs. 3 and 4 indicates an overall surprisingly good agreement for each curve of H-U iso /X-U eq versus temperature over the whole range, especially when taking into account that different methods/experiments were used. All four methods consistently indicate that at very low temperatures the ratio H-U iso /X-U eq can be as high as four, e.g. for H atoms attached to an sp 3 C atom with three non-H-atom neighbours (corresponding to AFIX 13 in SHELXL). Moreover, all four methods consistently confirm (or reproduce in the case of TLS+ONIOM) the temperature dependence that is predicted from equation (1). Conventional IAM structure determinations employing riding hydrogen constraints -and likewise models with aspherical scattering factorsshould therefore take the temperature-dependent ratio into account.\n\n\nConclusion and outlook",

As the ordered phase occurs at ~ 0.6K, a dilution fridge is required to cool the sample significantly below this temperature. The high-quality polycrystalline powder sample has been sealed in the thin-wall vanadium can with helium gas added as a heat-exchange media. This approach has been proven to be an efficient way for providing temperature equilibrium across the sample and vanadium can [16]. The diffraction data obtained in the experiment demonstrate very good angular coverage and data quality (low noise and background). Another important achievement is the highlevel temperature stability at the refrigerator's base temperature which remained ± 0.1 mK during the whole measurement.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe ISIS facility carries on an internal development program intended to gradually substitute all conventional cryogenic systems with cryogen free systems preferably based on PTR. Here we discuss operational experience and first scientific results obtained in a neutron beam line experiment where very low temperature sample environment has been provided by a KelvinoxVT ® dilution refrigerator insert accommodated in a newly developed top-loading cryogen-free cryostat. The system demonstrated high long time stability performance with a base temperature of 36 mK. High resolution neutron diffraction data have been obtained in the experiment. From a user perspective, the system offers operating parameters very similar to those of standard Orange cryostats but without the complication of cryogens.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1Cooling of the cryostat down to base temperature: (a) time dependence of temperature at the VTI exchanger; (a) time dependence of the mixing chamber temperature.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2Time dependence of the mixing chamber temperature.

For β (3) , we also choose a linear temperature dependence, β (3) (T ) = 9.3422 − T 1700 , which enhances non-cubic contribution to the potential energy at higher temperatures. We show that such a temperature-dependent parameterization can account for several experimental observations which cannot be described by the previous temperatureindependent parameterization. We note that the present parameterization of the relevant parameters can be improved by taking more realistic temperature dependence of the relevant electronic structures obtained from accurate many-body electronic structure calculations such as DFT+DMFT. However, the latter shall be left for future studies.\n\nCompared to the previous temperature-independent study [6], we include many more atoms in a three-dimensional periodic cell and allow much more time for the system to achieve better thermal-dynamical equilibrium. Specifically, we use 6 × 6 × 6 supercell (864 atoms) for the δ phase and 8 × 8 × 8 supercell (1024 atoms) for the ε phase. The number of atoms is fixed during the MD simulations. We run the MD simulation for 450 ps to allow the system to arrive at good thermal-dynamical equilibrium and use the next 50 ps to compute the average values of relevant physical quantities such as volume. We have kept other aspects of the MD procedure the same as in Ref. [6], such as dynamic periodic boundaries and constant temperature and pressure control techniques. We shall not repeat the details of the MD procedure here.\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nUsing the proposed temperature-dependent parameterization, we performed the MEAM + MD calculations to compute several physical properties, including the volume, bulk moduli and phonon density of states.",

Neutron diffraction experiments provide benchmark values. 'Invariom' and 'Hirshfeldatom' aspherical-atom refinements with high-resolution X-ray diffraction data yield very similar results, with the invariom model using constrained hydrogen positions giving a more consistent result, but the Hirshfeld-atom model being closer to neutron diffraction at higher temperatures. Implementing restraints in the TONTO program would therefore be useful. Furthermore, experimental findings can be well reproduced by the TLS+ONIOM approach. Here a single quantum chemical MO/MO cluster calculation is combined with a temperaturedependent rigid-body fit of the non-hydrogen ADPs from aspherical-atom X-ray refinements. All methods show that the ratio of H-U iso=eq /X-U eq , which is usually assumed to be 1.2 or 1.5 independent of temperature, is frequently more than twice as high at lower temperatures. Fixed values of 1.2 or 1.5, as usually used in conventional spherical-atom 'IAM' refinements, are therefore underestimating the relative displacement of H atoms at cryogenic temperatures. Since all methods used here consistently show or reproduce that the H-U iso=eq / X-U eq ratio is temperature dependent, the effect should be taken into account in low-temperature structure determina-Acta Cryst.

The final result for the critical temperature dependence on concentration 1,2 can be approximately written in the following form:\nT c ≃ x (1 − x) W,(1)\nwhere W is a bandwidth. In what follows we adopt the variational mean field theory scheme for the DE model via degenerate orbitals 10 in order to verify the validity of the two-band approach 11,12 near the CMR region. In the DE model within the two-band scheme, there is no electron-hole symmetry, which means that the Curie temperature is non-symmetric with respect to substitution x → 1 − x. Since for the small concentrations percolation effects play an essential role 11,13 , we will be primarily concerned with obtaining the value for the Curie temperature near the CMR region (x ∼ 0.3). As we will see, the approach we are using works well and recovers the right numerical value for the Curie temperature in units of hopping amplitude the value for which in the two-band model for manganites has been estimated in 12 . The relative simplicity of present approach also allows us to consider a problem of suppression of the ferromagnetic transition by the superexchange interaction [14][15][16] .",

In that case, the vibrational temperatures obtained for the fainter bands can be used to find the spectral absorption coefficients and integral intensities of the faint emission bands whose absolute emission spectra have been recorded by measurement devices. In order to determine the degree of nonequilibrium of the OH group emission, their transmission spectra were measured under the same conditions as those for measuring the emission spectra. The structure of the transmission spectra correlates with the structure of the emission spectra. The resulting spectral variations in λ and λmax ( fig. 17) are rapidly varying. The degree of variation in the 281-296 nm range is slightly higher than in the 306-328 nm range. The maximum value of λmax for T=2380 K is 100. In the 306-328 nm band, λmax reaches 50 ( fig. 17). It should be noted that the spectral dependences of λ for different temperatures are essentially different. From our standpoint, the reason for this is that it is impossible to make the conditions for obtaining the emission and transmission spectra completely identical, since they have were not recorded simultaneously. The existence of a spectral variation in λmax indicates that the vibrational temperature may depend on the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. In addition, the shape of the spectrum lines may have an effect on the value of λ . Turbulent inhomogeneity during burning of the flame may also have some effect on λ . For practical calculations it is appropriate to introduce the average degree of nonequilibricity max and the absolute spectral intensities of the nonequilibrium emission from the hydroxyl group have been used to determine the spectral absorption coefficients and the integrated absorption intensity of the OH for the",

Starting from the elastic limit, lim ∆ * →∞ T max = 198T (0), the maximum temperature decreases as ∆ * decreases as would be expected since lower values mean that more atoms can participate in inelastic collisions. A minimum is reached near ∆ * = 40 where T max ∼ 47T (0). It is interesting that at this minimum in T max (∆ * ), one has ∆/T max ∼ 1 so that the cooling that occurs is maximal according to eq. (19). For smaller values of ∆ * , the maximum temperature increases until at ∆ * = 1 the maximum temperature is 284T (0) or about 50% higher than in the elastic, ∆ * = 0, case. This is due to the fact that as ∆ * is lowered, the speed of the shocks continues to decrease and the density behind the shocks continues to increase leading to large pressure gradients when the shock focuses The full lines are for the elastic gas and the broken lines for the inelastic gas.\n\nwhich leads to the elevated temperatures. This interpretation is supported by the fact that eliminating the divergence of the pressure at high densities by setting χ (n) → χ (n(0)) in the evaluation of the pressure eliminates the increase in maximal temperature as ∆ * decreases to one. That only leaves the question as to why the shock slows down. To answer that, the calculations were repeated with all transport properties and the pressure are evaluated using the expressions for an elastic gas so that the only effect of the inelasticity is through the cooling rate. The result is that the shocks are still slow and that the qualitative behavior of the maximal temperature is unchanged leading to the conclusion that the slowing of the shock is solely due to the ξ 0 term in the heat equation.",

The only information that this calculation gives us is that electrons are projected from the dark space into the gas in the remainder of the tube, with energies of this order and greater energies. In the experiments carried On the Evolution out the conditions lay between the limits indicated in the following The average energy with which the electrons are projected through the gas probably corresponds to considerably higher temperatures than these. The upper limit to this energy is fixed by the total voltage drop. This would correspond to temperatures of 6,700,000° and 21,000,000° respectively.\n\nThe changes which give rise to the large evolution of energy in giant stars certainly take place in those of type M. For these, according to Eddington's theory of the internal constitution of stars,* the maximum temperature at the centre is 1,400,000°. For giant stars of type F, in which the changes still occur, the maximum temperature is 6,590,000°. These figures show that the energies of the electrons in the discharge tube were such that the effect might have been expected to take place.\n\nThe order of effect to be expected cannot be estimated. The energy radiated by a giant star amounts to roughly 200 ergs per second per gramme mass of star. We do not know how much of this mass is hydrogen. The mass of hydrogen present in the discharge tube of volume 70 c.c. would be 00000042 grin, at a pressure of 0-5 mm. of mercury. Assuming that the star consists wholly of hydrogen, and that the same figure, namely, 200 ergs per second per gramme, which applies to all giant stars, also applies to the discharge tube, the energy evolved by these changes would be 8 x 10~4 ergs per second. This would be about 10\"11 of the heat evolved by the passage of the discharge. We see, therefore, that the negative result of this experi ment does not in any way affect the hypothesis put forward by Eddington as to the origin of stellar energy.\n\nAnother point that should be mentioned is that, if the close combination of an electron and a hydrogen nucleus did occur, the energy evolved might not appear directly as heat, but might come out in the form of a very penetrating 7-ray, which would escape detection in ordinary experiments.",

We can naturally perform a calculation for this quantity, as we will do below. However the necessary ingredients to obtain numerical results, namely band structure informations and mostly renormalization due to the interactions, are not precisely known. Moreover λ i (0) is found by performing an averaging over the whole Fermi surface. Hence its physical content is essentially unrelated to the other ingredients of Eq. (12) for which only the vicinity of the nodes is relevant : they give a very local information while λ i (0) contains a global one. Therefore we might just take λ i (0) from experiment itself, which gives [9] the currently accepted values of λ a (0) = 1600Å and λ b (0) = 1000Å. This is all the more reasonable as one sees that our result is fairly sensitive to the value of λ i (0) since it comes in the third power.",

Φ can be approximated as\nΦ ∼ = N 2 K − N K 2 − N K N π ,(10)\nfor N π ≫ N K which holds for sufficiently low temperatures. (We also assume here that N 2 K − N K 2 is not larger than N 2 π − N π 2 .)

(3), a plot of the temperature (T) versus the thermal energy (U) for various values of Breit-Wigner width (Γ) is shown in Fig. 28 for A=93 and level density parameter = A/8. The standard statistical model result corresponds to Γ=0. We find that for large values of Γ, the calculated temperature becomes very large for small values of U, but as U increases, the calculated temperatures comes down quickly and approaches the statistical model values. In the case of the emission of the lithium fragments from the compound nucleus 105 Ag (E X =76 MeV), we are dealing with the average thermal energy of the residual nuclei (U∼35-40 MeV) and in order to explain our slope anomaly corresponding to the experimentally obtained values of T, we shall need Γ ∼100 MeV. Somewhat smaller values (Γ ∼50-80 MeV) would be required to explain slope anomalies of other heavy ion spectra. These results imply prompt breakup of lithium, beryllium etc. in the vicinity of the nuclear and Coulomb field of the residual nucleus. Since the lithium nucleus is expected to break apart most promptly compared to carbon, boron or beryllium, the Breit-Wigner width of the dinuclear state comprising lithium and the residual nucleus should be the largest resulting in the highest temperature of the lithium spectrum and largest departure from the standard statistical model prediction (based on sharp Breit-Wigner states), as observed experimentally. On the other hand, the temperature of the alpha spectrum should agree with the prediction of the standard statistical model, because of the expected small Breit-Wigner width of the dinuclear state comprising an alpha and the residual nucleus due to the stability of alpha nucleus in the vicinity of the nuclear and Coulomb field of the residual nucleus.",

This temperature was derived from a least squares fit of the flatfield corrected spectral data to a molecular band model for the ∆υ = 1 AlO band (B 2 Σ + → X 2 Σ + transition). The intensity of each ro-vibrational line was calculated using parameters (such as rotation-vibration line energy levels and Einstein A coefficients (A ij )) which were derived from direct numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation by Patrascu et al. 38 A Lorentzian line width function was applied to each transition line, and the lines were summed to simulate the spectrum of interest using a procedure described by Dong et al. 39 AlO emission observed in the field immediately after the burst could not be fit due to detector saturation. However, at ∼2 to ∼4 ms after the burst, AlO emission (B 2 Σ + → X 2 Σ + ) was prominent and the detector was not saturated. Using a flat-field corrected field spectrum, simulations were performed to determine a spatially and temporally integrated temperature. It was first necessary to use a polynomial fit to subtract the blackbody background. Two temperatures of 2509 K (91%) and 6822 K (9%) were found to best fit the blackbody emission; possibly accounting for the explosive temperature, with high temperature contributions from solar reflection and shocked air. When fitting the full B 2 Σ + → X 2 Σ + ∆υ = -3 to ∆υ = +3 emission, the program and least squares fitting used to fit the laser ablation-generated AlO, was modified to account for AlO self-absorption within the macroscale, approximately 10 m diameter, plume. After consideration for self-absorption, the emission intensity for each ro-vibrational line is:\nI = I 0 exp (−τ)(3)\nWhere I 0 is the simulated emission intensity of molecular lines before self-absorption, and τ is the optical depth of the absorbing layer at the line center, calculated as: 40",

This reflects the fact that at very low temperatures, ∆ * → ∞, very few collisions occur with enough energy to be inelastic while at very high temperature, ∆ * → 0, the loss of energy during inelastic collisions is of no physical importance since it represents a vanishing fraction of the total energy of each atom. Both of these limits can therefore be viewed, in some sense, as \"elastic\" limits although in neither case can one say that only elastic collisions occur and it is to be expected that in both of these \"elastic\" limits, all thermodynamic and transport properties will be those of an elastic gas since the energy dissipation plays no role.

Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

The radiation temperature of the CMB is T CMB = 2.728 K(1+z) such that T CMB is greater than about 30 K at z > 10. Hence, early molecular gas clouds cannot cool to the characteristic temperatures of present-day star-forming regions (∼ 10 K) even if molecules such as CO and H 2 O act as efficient coolants. If the minimum gas temperature is a critical physical quantity that determines the characteristic masses of stars, then the transition from high-mass Pop III to the lower-mass Pop II mode may be gradual and regulated by the CMB temperature (Schneider and Omukai, 2010).",

J. StarkJ and Hardtke § also observed this line as a doublet 7 = 5564*oA, intensity 6, and 7 = 5 5 5 9 -5 A, intensity 6, and among many other lines one at 7 = 5617*oA, intensity 3. These lines were brought out very strongly by canal-ray excitation. Apart from the line 7 = 5617A, it does not seem possible as yet to identify the lines observed by us with any known lines or bands in the nitrogen spectrum. If the lines observed by us with nitrogen do belong to the line-and band-spectra of nitrogen, the question may be asked, why these lines came out so intensely and brilliantly while other lines of nitrogen in this region quoted by Stark and others were not found. This provides a field for some interesting speculation. For the argon line, 7 =5648-3, observed by us, we cannot as yet put forward an adequate explanation. The argon line 7 =5607*41, which we observed, completely dominated the whole spectrum, and in any analysis of the argon spectrum this wave-length would consequently merit special consideration. It would appear to be iden tical with that given by Kayser and by Eder and Yalenta at 7 = 5607*41. Runge first ascribed the green auroral line to krypton, and later Stark|[ ascribed it to the line-spectrum of nitrogen. Vegard, in his recent work, maintains that it has its origin in solid nitrogen. The authors believe that the origin of the line is still unknown, unless it be subject to temperature variations in wave length. The view of Babcock^[ that it is due probably to some light element in the upper atmosphere merits consideration.

To account for the continuous increase in the value of the specific heat with rise of temperature at high temperatures, the diatomic gas molecule must be imagined to be elastic. In order to deduce theoretical expressions for the temperature variation of the specific heat, assumptions have to be made and arbitrary constants have to be chosen to obtain as satisfactory an agreement as is possible between the results calculated from the proposed theory and those experimentally obtained, and a reasonable criticism of all theoretical developments would be that the resulting expression for the temperature variation of specific heat becomes more and more empirical in character as the number of assumptions made in its deduction is increased. It will suffice to draw attention to such assumptions as the a priori probability of various quantum states (Reiche and others), the law of force between the nuclei (Kemble and van Vleck), which have been proposed but which have not given theoretical results § in good agreement with experimental values. * * * § During the past two years a very interesting theoretical explanation of the variation of heat capacity of hydrogen with temperature has been developed from the application of the new mechanics in the study of band-spectra data. Heisenberg* suggested the existence of two kinds of molecules of hydrogen, symmetrical and antisymmetrical, according to the direction of nuclear spin, in order to explain intensity variations in the band spectrum. Horif deduced that the molecules with antisymmetrical wave functions were three times as numerous as the symmetrical ones. By assuming this ratio and th at there were no transitions from one molecular state to another during the short time taken in determining a specific heat experimentally, Dennison | was able to apply statistical theory to ordinary hydrogen (which must be considered as a gas in a state of metastable equilibrium as regards the distribution of molecular energy, i.e., a mixture of two distinct gases-Fowler), and obtained theoretical values in excellent agreement with the experimental results below 300°. Dennison's curve is practically coincident with my own over this temperature range. McCrea, § following a suggestion due to B. H.

This recovers exactly the expansion in Eq. (6.4) of Ref B. The asymptotic expansion is evaluated at N + 1 rather than at N in the regular EM formula. This confers two distinct advantages: For a given order, our errors are typically much smaller when the index is increased by 1, and secondly, since the order of optimal truncation is πN , by evaluating at N + 1, three additional orders are added to the optimally truncated series, with their concommitant improvement in accuracy. We note that one need only evaluate each contribution in Eq. 59 at the upper end. Taking N = 0 and subtracting then yields S N , guaranteeing correctly its vanishing for N = 0. Thus we have recovered the main one-dimensional result of Ref B without need for (but also missing the elegance of) regularizing sums as N → ∞. Eq. 59 can be applied directly to finite wells, such as PT or the truncated linear half-well of Ref. [81]. We show some results from the summation formula for the linear half well in Fig. 5 for N = 1, where E 1 = 1 . The summation formula is less accurate than the original formula for M = 0, but is much more accurate even for M = 3 (by two orders of magnitude). More importantly, its optimal truncation is at 6, producing almost 3 orders of magnitude in improvement, i.e., going from milliHartrees to microHartrees errors! To see that this is due to our evaluation at N + 1, in Fig. 6 we add in the second eigenvalue and the second sum, E 2 = 1 + 2 . Its error curve is almost identical to that of the summation formula for the first level. Of course, the summation formula for the 2nd level has leaped ahead again, with errors of nanoHartrees at the optimal truncation of M = 9! Finally, we attempt to show the error in the 6th level in Fig. 7. The black line here is for the error in individual level, and so matches the purple line of Fig. 5. But the blue line is the error in the summation formula, which",

(iii) The observed error is influenced by the particular initial condition examined. (iv) The maximum value of closure for the Pe = 10 case was less than 10 %, and the error rapidly decreased (within τ * < 5) to less than 5 %. (v) The maximum value of closure was of the order of 10 %-12 %; this was observed for Pe = 100.\n\nOverall, these results seem encouraging and reasonable. The comparison of the averaged result with the numerical results (described below) provide further evidence that the approximation is valid for the Péclet numbers considered here. For larger Péclet numbers, the error associated with the approximation given by (8.3a) tends to increase. For such cases, it may become necessary to solve the closure problems associated with b and Φ numerically without neglecting terms (an example of the numerical computation of s * is discussed in § 9 and in appendix A § A.6).\n\nOn the basis of the numerical results and the discussion above, it is possible to specify more useful constraints to increase the range of validity of the analysis. We suggest slightly more liberal constraints of the form\nPe a L 0 = O(1), (8.6a) a L 0 < 1, (8.6b)\nwhere is a unitless parameter; for our analysis ≈ 1.

Our constraint is identical to theirs when the left-hand side of (8.6a) is multiplied by a factor of = 1/2.2, lending further support of these slightly more liberal constraints in practice. We note that in the case of Taylor (1954), the value of = 1/4 was adopted; when fixing the value a/L 0 ≈ 1/10 as approximated by Taylor (1954), equations (8.6a)-(8.6b) are also consistent with that work.\n\n\nComputation using the upscaled balance equation",

Because the ratio is well behaved, the Taylor series expansion converges very quickly (Figs. 7 and 8). Although the real spectrum will have an XAFS oscillatory component of approximately zero at high energies, the software will be more or less robust in extracting this, but it will have no significant effect on the relative magnitude of oscillatory corrections in the result.

This is proven by the expansion to second order in the denominator, which yields a cubic equation. The convergence appears complete.

We also see that the errors aren't affected by the choice of solar normalization, since the solar terms are no longer part of the equation. Meaning, if we say that we have [Q/H] = 0.0 ± 0.05 dex, that is the same as saying A(Q) = 7.46 ± 0.05. Therefore, the errors would be the same for [Q/H] and A(Q). Taking this a step further, we propagate the errors for two elements in dex-abundance-notation, namely Eq. 15. The standard method for propagating errors is to convert the total uncertainty to fractional uncertainty for both elements in the numerator (num) and denominator (denom) and then add those fractional uncertainties in quadrature: (δ num /num) 2 + (δ denom /denom) 2 , per Taylor (1997, their Eq. 3.47). We therefore add the error in quadrature in order to get the fractional error of the molar ratio Q/R: (10) \nδ Q * R * = δQ * |Q * | 2 + δR * |R * | 2 = ln\nWe note that while Eq. 20 is nearly identical to Eq. 6 presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018, since ln(10) ≈ 2.303), the results from Eq. 6 were treated as full uncertainties in moles when in reality the equation calculates fractional or percentage errors. As a result, the error values provided in Table 5 of Hinkel & Unterborn (2018) were all overreported. Therefore, it is our intention that the detailed walk-through presented here that resulted in Eq. 20 will supersede what was presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018).\n\n\nEXAMPLE CASE",

In addition, the inner series in µ has to produce values that do not increase too strongly with increasing ν, because otherwise the right-hand side of (5.5) diverges for every |x| > 0. In the case of an essentially arbitrary function F (x), these two conditions are not necessarily satisfied. It is also easy to show that the convergence of the Laguerre expansion for F (x) with respect to the norm of the Laguerre-type Hilbert space L 2 e −x x α (R + ) defined by (C.3) does not imply the convergence of the inner series over µ on the right-hand side of (5.5) for every ν ∈ N 0 .",

The leading correction is always given by the end-point contribution near x = N . Thus, choosing our upper end-point as N + 1/2 always eliminates that contribution, simplifying the result.

This recovers exactly the expansion in Eq. (6.4) of Ref B. The asymptotic expansion is evaluated at N + 1 rather than at N in the regular EM formula. This confers two distinct advantages: For a given order, our errors are typically much smaller when the index is increased by 1, and secondly, since the order of optimal truncation is πN , by evaluating at N + 1, three additional orders are added to the optimally truncated series, with their concommitant improvement in accuracy. We note that one need only evaluate each contribution in Eq. 59 at the upper end. Taking N = 0 and subtracting then yields S N , guaranteeing correctly its vanishing for N = 0. Thus we have recovered the main one-dimensional result of Ref B without need for (but also missing the elegance of) regularizing sums as N → ∞. Eq. 59 can be applied directly to finite wells, such as PT or the truncated linear half-well of Ref. [81]. We show some results from the summation formula for the linear half well in Fig. 5 for N = 1, where E 1 = 1 . The summation formula is less accurate than the original formula for M = 0, but is much more accurate even for M = 3 (by two orders of magnitude). More importantly, its optimal truncation is at 6, producing almost 3 orders of magnitude in improvement, i.e., going from milliHartrees to microHartrees errors! To see that this is due to our evaluation at N + 1, in Fig. 6 we add in the second eigenvalue and the second sum, E 2 = 1 + 2 . Its error curve is almost identical to that of the summation formula for the first level. Of course, the summation formula for the 2nd level has leaped ahead again, with errors of nanoHartrees at the optimal truncation of M = 9! Finally, we attempt to show the error in the 6th level in Fig. 7. The black line here is for the error in individual level, and so matches the purple line of Fig. 5. But the blue line is the error in the summation formula, which",

It typically occurs for stretched molecules or for extended basis sets with high exponents. To avoid laborious summations in such situations we present a large β asymptotic expansion of the functions I ln . The derivation begins by rewriting Eq. (35) as a difference of two integrals over the intervals [0, ∞] and [1, ∞]. In the first integral one needs to exchange the variables to βx and subsequently expand the Gaussian function under the integral sign in power series. The remaining integral can be recognised as the Legendre function of the second kind Q n by means of the analytic continuation. This finally leads to the asymptotic formula for the first part\n∞ 0 x l i n (βx) e −αx−γx 2 ∼ 1 β l+1 ∞ k=0 γ β 2 k Q (l) n α β ,(40)\nwhere the subscript in Q n denotes differentiation with respect to the main argument.

We also see that the errors aren't affected by the choice of solar normalization, since the solar terms are no longer part of the equation. Meaning, if we say that we have [Q/H] = 0.0 ± 0.05 dex, that is the same as saying A(Q) = 7.46 ± 0.05. Therefore, the errors would be the same for [Q/H] and A(Q). Taking this a step further, we propagate the errors for two elements in dex-abundance-notation, namely Eq. 15. The standard method for propagating errors is to convert the total uncertainty to fractional uncertainty for both elements in the numerator (num) and denominator (denom) and then add those fractional uncertainties in quadrature: (δ num /num) 2 + (δ denom /denom) 2 , per Taylor (1997, their Eq. 3.47). We therefore add the error in quadrature in order to get the fractional error of the molar ratio Q/R: (10) \nδ Q * R * = δQ * |Q * | 2 + δR * |R * | 2 = ln\nWe note that while Eq. 20 is nearly identical to Eq. 6 presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018, since ln(10) ≈ 2.303), the results from Eq. 6 were treated as full uncertainties in moles when in reality the equation calculates fractional or percentage errors. As a result, the error values provided in Table 5 of Hinkel & Unterborn (2018) were all overreported. Therefore, it is our intention that the detailed walk-through presented here that resulted in Eq. 20 will supersede what was presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018).\n\n\nEXAMPLE CASE",

Однако в настоящее время защитным титром антител по данным ИФА официально принято считать 1:100 и по реакции нейтрализации -1:10 [2,12].",

Assuming an initial elemental 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the local ISM equal to 441, for a typical cloud age around 3-610 5 years and a total density of N(H2) = 210 4 cm -3 , the model leads to some nitrogen fractionation, with 14 N/ 15 N ratios around 400 for most of the species (N2H + , NH3, HCN, CN, …) and 360 for HNC. This depletion induced fractionation effect for nitrogen is only efficient because atomic nitrogen is relatively unreactive in the gas-phase (Daranlot et al. 2013, Daranlot et al. 2012, Daranlot et al. 2011, so that sticking onto grains is the dominant loss process. Although the difference of the accretion rate between 14 N and 15 N is small, the effect is large enough to remove a few tens of percent more 14 N atoms from the gas-phase when the accretion time reaches 4  10 5 years. As the remaining atomic nitrogen in the gas-phase is depleted in 14 N, all nitrogen bearing species formed through gasphase chemistry will reflect these higher 15 N levels with various values depending on the individual formation mechanisms (such as N + CH → CN + H for example). Although the calculated 14 N/ 15 N values for NH3, HCN, HNC, CN and HC3N are lower than those obtained in earlier models they are still above the observed values shown in Table 1. The effect is not very large for evolved clouds because for cloud chemical ages in the range 3-610 5 years, most of the nitrogen has already been removed from the gas-phase. So even if the gas-phase is depleted in 14 N, the 14 N/ 15 N fraction for species formed on grains is close to or slightly above the elemental 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the local ISM. Desorption mechanisms will release 14 N-bearing molecules back into the gas-phase resulting in a reduction in the gas-phase fractionation levels for",

Models of interstellar chemistry are unable to induce nitrogen fraction in cold molecular clouds as exchange reactions for 15 N are mostly inefficient. Here, we developed a new gas-grain model for nitrogen fractionation including a thorough search for new nitrogen fractionation reactions and a realistic description of atom depletion onto interstellar dust particles. We show that, while dense molecular cloud gas-phase chemistry alone leads to very low fractionation, 14 N atoms are preferentially depleted from the gas-phase due to a mass dependent grain surface sticking rate for atomic nitrogen. However, assuming an elementary 14 N/ 15 N ratio of 441 (equal to the solar wind value), our model leads to only low 15 N enrichment for all Ncontaining species synthesized in the gas-phase with predicted 14 N/ 15 N ratios in the range 360-400. Higher enrichment levels can neither be explained by this mechanism, nor through chemistry, with two possible explanations. (I) The elementary 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the local ISM is smaller, as suggested by the recent work of Romano et al, with an hypothetic 15 NNH + and 15 NNH + depletion due to variation of the electronic recombination rate constant variation with the isotopes. (II) N2 photodissociation leads to variable nitrogen fractionation in diffuse molecular clouds where photons play an important role, which is conserved during dense molecular cloud formation as suggested by the work of Furuya & Aikawa.\n\nINTRODUCTION",

They obtained some 15 N fractionation due essentially to the isotope selective photodissociation of N2, whereas chemistry is inefficient. As we consider Av = 10 in our study we cannot reproduce such effects. In their work, they consider the difference in the adsorption rates for 14 N and 15 N. However, in their model this effect is likely to be significantly smaller than the 15 N atomic enrichment in the gas phase due to the photodissociation of N 15 N. This is because N is depleted onto grains when Av is in the 0-2 range where isotope selective photodissociation of N2 is at work and very efficient. However, Lawson et al. (2011) showed that the DR of N2H + , 15 N2H + and N2D + have notable differences (more than 20%) between 300 K and 500 K, the DR reaction of N2H + being more efficient that the DR reactions of 15 N2H + and N2D + . However, that result does not necessarily mean that the DR reactions of N 15 NH + and 15 NNH + are less efficient than N2H + at low temperature due to their complexity. Indeed, the difference in ZPE may favor intercrossing curves between the ions and the neutral for 15 NNH + and N 15 NH + leading to an unexpected increase at low temperature. Experimental measurements of the DR rates of 15 NNH + and N 15 NH + are clearly needed but higher DR rate constants for N 15 NH + and 15 NNH + than the equivalent N2H + one could be possible. If the DR reactions of N 15 NH + and N 15 NH + are more efficient than the N2H + one, the N2H + /N 15 NH + and N2H + /N 15 NH + ratios will increase above and beyond the input nitrogen isotope ratio value. When gas-phase CO is low, the main loss for N2H + is DR. Then, if the rate constants for the DR of 15 NNH + and N 15 NH + are more efficient than the",

The dominant form of nitrogen in diffuse clouds is the atomic form with a small fraction of the molecular form (Viala et al. 1986;Knauth et al. 2004). In dense molecular clouds, atomic N is (at least in part) converted into gaseous and icy molecules (e.g., Herbst & Klemperer 1973;Hily-Blant et al. 2010), but the primary form of nitrogen is not well constrained. Gas-ice astrochemical models often predict most nitrogen is present as NH 3 ice and N 2 gas and ice (e.g., Daranlot et al. 2012;Chang & Herbst 2014).\n\nObservations have revealed that N-bearing molecules in prestellar cores are enriched in or depleted in 15 N depending on molecules.

Note that some care is required for the interpretation of the enrichment of 15 N in HCN and HNC as pointed out by Roueff et al. (2015); the N/ 15 N ratios of these molecules were derived from 13 C species assuming the elemental 12 C/ 13 C ratio.

However, the PAMPRE nitrogen isotopic data may give new constraints for nitrogen isotopic modeling in Titan's atmosphere, knowing that nitrogen isotopic composition of Titan's aerosols has not been measured yet. N 2 photodissociation and self-shielding isotopic effects calculated by Liang et al., 2007 resulted in a factor of ~ 2.4 too large 15 N/ 14 N ratio for HCN ( 15 N/ 14 N = 4.35 10 -2 , Liang et al. 2007) compared to the observations ( 15 N/ 14 N = 1.79 ± 0.26 10 -2 , Vinatier et al. 2007). These authors thus suggested that an additional source of unfractionated atomic nitrogen, produced by ion/electron-impact induced N 2 dissociation was required to counterbalance the too large effect of self-shielding. Isotopic effects described in the present study may contribute to counterbalance the calculated self-shielding 15 N-enrichment. We can roughly quantify by a simple mass balance calculation the importance of KIF for nitrogen isotopes in Titan's atmosphere. Assuming a -20‰ isotopic kinetic effect with 10 % of electron-impact dissociated N 2 on the dayside (Lavvas et al. 2011) and 100% of electronimpact dissociated N 2 on the nightside, such a calculation provides a final 15 N/ 14 N ratio of 2.25 10 -2 . Hence, the discrepancy between the HCN isotopic ratio calculated by the selfshielding model and the measured one is reduced by factor 2. This demonstrates that KIF may play a role in the nitrogen isotopes balance in Titan's atmosphere; yet, such a calculation stays a rough quantification and should be taken carefully.

The corresponding reaction rate constants have been implemented in the KIDA chemical data base (Wakelam et al. 2013), and we updated our chemical network accordingly. We also include the reactions discussed in Loison et al. (2014) in their study of HCN/HNC chemistry. We explicitly include deuterium, 13 C, and 15 N molecular compounds in our chemical network. The reactions displayed in Table 1, have been included, which allows us to test the hypothesis of a constant 12 C/ 13 C isotopic ratio to derive the 14 N/ 15 N ratio in C 15 N containing molecules. We take the role of the ortho/para ratio of molecular H 2 into account in the H 2 D + + H 2 and 14 N + ( 15 N + ) + H 2 chemical reactions in an approximate way: we did not compute the full ortho/para equilibrium as in the models of Flower et al. (2006), Pagani et al. (2011), Faure et al. (2013) and instead introduce it as a model parameter, which can be varied. Faure et al. (2013) have found a value of 10 −3 for temperatures below 15 K. Apart from exchange reactions, reactions involving isotopic molecules are assumed to have the same total rate constant as those involving the main isotope except for the reaction of 15 N + with H 2 /HD/D 2 . The various reaction channels are obtained from statistical considerations, in the absence of experimental information. We restrict carbon-containing molecules to three carbon atoms, nitrogen-containing molecules to two nitrogen atoms, and consider full deuteration as in our previous studies (Roueff et al. 2005). Within these constraints, the number of species considered in the model is 307 linked through more than 5400 chemical reactions. We consider two different models as displayed in Table 4.

The reaction time required for NO-NO 2 to reach isotopic equilibrium was estimated using the exchange rate constants in a simple kinetics box model (BOXMOX; Knote et al., 2015). The model predicts that at typical NO x concentrations used during the chamber experiments (7.7-62.4 nmol mol −1 ), isotopic equilibrium would be reached within 15 min (see Appendix B). Since the sample collection usually started 1 h after NO x was well mixed in the chamber, there was sufficient time to reach full isotope equilibrium. The isotope equilibrium fractionation fac-tor (α(NO 2 -NO)) is then calculated to be\nα(NO 2 -NO) = [ 15 NO 2 ][ 14 NO] [ 14 NO 2 ][ 15 NO] = R(NO 2 ) R(NO) ,(1)\nwhere R(NO, NO 2 ) are the 15 N/ 14 N ratios of NO and NO 2 .

Photodissociation of N 2 is subject to self-shielding. Because N 15 N is much less abundant than N 2 , N 15 N needs a higher column density of the ISM gas for self-shielding. As a result, in some regions, N 15 N is selectively photodissociated and then N 2 is depleted in 15 N, while atomic N is enriched in 15 N. Heays et al. (2014) developed a gas-phase astrochemical model of a molecular cloud, considering both isotope selective photodissociation of N 2 and isotope exchange reactions for 15 N fractionation. They found that the isotope selective photodissociation is at work only in the limited regions, where the interstellar UV radiation field is not significantly attenuated and the transition from atomic nitrogen to N 2 occurs. In these regions, N 2 and N 2 H + are depleted in 15 N, while nitriles are enriched in 15 N. Note, however, that prestellar cores typically have higher density (>10 5 cm −3 ) and higher A V (>10 mag for a dust continuum peak) compared to their cloud model. Thus it seems difficult to explain the depletion of 15 N in N 2 H + in the framework of the present gas-phase chemical network.",

Combining the expressions for the CH:CH 2 and the CN:HCN ratios, there follows the inequality\nx(N) = n(N)/n(H 2 ) ≤ 100 n(CH) n(CH 2 ) x(e) R(CN : HCN) ,\nwhere x(e) denotes n(e)/n(H 2 ) and R(CN : HCN) is the measured value of the CN:HCN ratio. The inequality arises from neglecting the destruction of CN by oxygen in reaction (7). We adopt n(CH)/n(CH 2 ) ≈ 1 and estimate x(e) from , where n 5 is n(H 2 ) in units of 10 5 cm −3 . From Table 3, we infer a typical value of 2 for R(CN : HCN) and conclude that the fractional atomic N abundance n(N)/n H 1.25×10 −6 . This value is considerably less than the cosmic nitrogen abundance (n(N)/n H = 7.9×10 −5 ; Anders & Grevesse 1989) and implies that there is only a small fraction of elemental nitrogen in gaseous atomic form. Although some approximations were made when deriving this value (such as n(CH)/n(CH 2 ) ≈ 1), our more precise and complete chemical modelling has confirmed that this estimate is essentially correct as long as the total gaseous nitrogen abundance is n(N)/n H ≤ 10 −5 (see Fig. 7). It follows that most of the elemental nitrogen must be in the form of gaseous N 2 or N-bearing solid compounds (e.g. NH 3 or N 2 ices). Indeed, for n(N)/n H ≤ 10 −5 , steady-state models suggest that most of the nitrogen is in ices (see Section 6 as well as the discussion of Maret et al. 2006).\n\nAn analogous inequality, in terms of the measured CN:HCN ratio, can be derived for the fractional abundance of atomic oxygen, x(O). However, it is a much weaker constraint than the limit on x(N). Other observables, such as NO, provide stronger constraints on the fractional abundance of atomic oxygen (see A07).",

First, the utility of a mass spectrometer is based on its ability to distinguish molecules based on the mass and the charge of the ions they generate in an ion source. The principle that makes HRMS compared to conventional \"unit\" resolution mass spectrometry really useful is rooted in atomic physics with regards to the distinct nuclear binding energy of each isotope of every element, the mass defect 5 : the difference between the exact mass and nominal mass. With carbon-12 set at 12.00000 Da (where Da = Daltons, units designated one twelfth the mass of carbon-12), the exact mass of nitrogen-14 is 14.00307 Da. The mass defect for nitrogen-14 can then be calculated as 14.00307-14.00000= 0.00307. The exact masses, mass defects, and relative abundance for the most pertinent isotopes of common organic elements are in Table 1. It is important to note that in mass spectrometry when referring to elemental isotopes that they are typically stable isotopes-hence when a method is developed that utilizes an isotopically-labeled analogue of an analyte the heavy are C-13, not C-14; hydrogen atoms are typically replaced with deuterium, not trititum. However, as is listed in Table 1 there is a natural abundance of heavy stable isotopes for a given element and that abundance will determine the isotopic distribution. Mass spectra can be difficult to interpret. Their interpretation is best facilitated when considering both the calculated mass defect of a peak as well as the presence of other peaks nearby. Interferences observed in method development may be part of the isotopic cluster of a compound with a different monoisotopic mass-the mass of a molecule that consists of the most abundant isotopic species of each element (e.g. C-12, H-1, N-14, etc.). The analytical consequence of each elemental isotope having a slightly different mass defect is that if the m/z of an analyte can be accurately measured, then the exact molecular formula can be determined computationally, provided the measurement was done with sufficiently high resolution. This is a distinct mechanism for analytical specificity from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), whereby",

To do this, each isotopologue was considered independently. For the dideuterated isotopologue, the molecular ion is m/z = 30 and the only contribution to the abundance at m/z = 30 is the dideuterated ethylene. The fragments of C 2 H 2 D 2 in which one H atom is lost will contribute to the abundance at m/z = 29. Because C 2 H 2 D 2 has 2 H atoms and 2 D atoms, the probability that it will lose one H atom (when it fragments by the loss of one H or D) is 1/2. Therefore, the contribution from C 2 H 2 D 2 at m/z = 29 (C(29, C 2 H 2 D 2 )) is 1/2 multiplied by the probability of losing one H/D (F (27, C 2 H 4 )), thus C(29, C 2 H 2 D 2 ) = A(30) × 1 2 F (27, C 2 H 4 ).

The abundance in the mass spectrum at m/z = 29 is due to the molecular ion of C 2 H 3 D and also the fragmentation of C 2 H 2 D 2 in which it has lost one atomic mass unit (amu). Similarly, the abundance at m/z = 28 is due to the molecular ion of C 2 H 4 , the fragments of C 2 H 3 D that have lost one amu, and the fragments of C 2 H 2 D 2 that have lost two amu.

The increased sensitivity and high spectral resolution of millimeter telescopes allow the detection of an increasing number of isotopically substituted molecules in the interstellar medium. The 14 N/ 15 N ratio is difficult to measure directly for molecules containing carbon. Aims. Using a time-dependent gas-phase chemical model, we check the underlying hypothesis that the 13 C/ 12 C ratio of nitriles and isonitriles is equal to the elemental value. Methods. We built a chemical network that contains D, 13 C, and 15 N molecular species after a careful check of the possible fractionation reactions at work in the gas phase. Results. Model results obtained for two different physical conditions that correspond to a moderately dense cloud in an early evolutionary stage and a dense, depleted prestellar core tend to show that ammonia and its singly deuterated form are somewhat enriched in 15 N, which agrees with observations. The 14 N/ 15 N ratio in N 2 H + is found to be close to the elemental value, in contrast to previous models that obtain a significant enrichment, because we found that the fractionation reaction between 15 N and N 2 H + has a barrier in the entrance channel. The high values of the N 2 H + / 15 NNH + and N 2 H + /N 15 NH + ratios derived in L1544 cannot be reproduced in our model. Finally, we find that nitriles and isonitriles are in fact significantly depleted in 13 C, thereby challenging previous interpretations of observed C 15 N, HC 15 N, and H 15 NC abundances from 13 C containing isotopologues.\n\nIntroduction",

This leads to lower 14 N/ 15 N ratios for species formed in the gas-phase in dense molecular clouds (CN, HCN, HNC) than the solar wind reference value (441 ± 2.5 (Marty et al. 2010) corresponding to the nitrogen reservoir of the prestellar cloud). However, mass dependent sticking rate cannot explain 14 N/ 15 N ratios as low as those listed in Table 1, except when larger uncertainties than those reported in the literature are considered. Nevertheless, considering a lower initial elemental 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the local ISM, around 300 from (Romano et al. 2017), the inclusion of mass dependent accretion for N atoms results in agreement with most observations for CN, HCN, HNC, HC3N and NH3 (except HCN and HNC in B1 and HC3N in L1544, values shown in Table 1), the average for all these observations being equal to 312  48, but also for HC5N (Taniguchi & Saito 2017).\n\nThe comparison with previous studies is not obvious due to the large differences between models. The low nitrogen fractionation induced by chemistry is similar in Roueff et al. (2015) despite the large differences in models (no grain chemistry in Roueff et al. (2015) and substantial differences in the chemical networks). The low fractionation is due in both cases to the absence of efficient fractionation reactions. Wirström and Charnley (2018) found some nitrogen fractionation in their recent work. In their model, NH3 in the gas phase shows some 15 N depletion due to specific reactions of 15 N + in conjunction with a large gas phase N2",

The two observations are consistent, and the onlypossible solution, giving a vertical angle of 120°, is obtained when a valence force system is applied to the fundamental frequencies allotted as in Table I, which incorporates the present results and those previously obtained with the prism instrument. In P art II the centre of band F was given as 2499 cm.-1, being the minimum between the supposed P and R branches ; the present value of 2492 cm. or 4*014 [x, is probably correct to within 0*001 (x. For band E, the difference between the original determination of 2305 cm.-1, and that given above, is too large to be accounted for by ordinary experimental erro r; a distuibing fact is that an almost equal lack of agreement appears in the 4*6 p band for CS2.

The profile of this band suggests that it could be made up of two contributions: the more intense seems to be located close to the excitation profile of the (29 1 , 29 1 ) band, while the weaker part extends across the (14 2 , 14 2 ) region; there is only the faintest trace of activity at the 11 1 excitation position. Being so low in wavenumber, there are not too many viable (v, m) = 0 assignments that match both the excitation and emission wavenumbers. To this end we can rule out the following possibilities on the basis of the expected position of the S 1 level, even though the corresponding S 0 level would be at about the correct wavenumber: 20 3 m 3(−) , 20 1 m 8 , and 18 1 m 1 .

The 19 1 m 5 level would have the same symmetry as 29 1 m 1 and so would potentially be a candidate via an interaction with that level.

Its contour as determined with slit widths of 50 A., or 3*5 cm.-1, is shown in fig. 4 ; it has P and R branches, with a separation of slightly more than 13 cm. the values for the bands at 11-4 and 6-57 g, in Part III* were 13 and 12 cm.-1 respectively.

The discrepancy is too great either to arise from incomplete separation of the branches, or an increase in the effective moment of inertia owing to the vibrations of the constituent massive particles. The probable explanation is a coupling between oscillation and rotation such as Teller and TiszaJ invoked to explain similar inconsistencies in the line separa-tions observed in certain bands of tbe metbyl balides. Inconstancy in P and R branch separations is even more marked in the infra-red spectrum of C 02 and probably arises from the same cause.

The associated ZEKE band would be expected at ∼ (222 + 189 = 410 cm −1 ), and indeed we suggested this as an assignment of the observed broadish band at ∼ 400 cm −1 in Ref.

The 20 2 m 6(+) level has the correct symmetry to interact with the 14 2 m 0 level, which would involve a v = 4, m = 6 interaction. Hence, there is a mechanism by which the 20 2 m 6(+) band can gain intensity from 14 2 m 0 that is consistent with the presence of the weak part of this band at the 14 2 excitation position and the ZEKE spectrum of Ref.

Of course, m 6(−) can only interact with 14 1 m 0 but the corresponding band was noted as being too weak to see [16]; however, the difference in transition wavenumber is expected to be similar at ∼ 3.6 cm −1 . The fact that the 14 2 and 14 1 m 6(−) states are close to coincident in S 1 suggests that the interactions between ZOSs in the two different wavenumber regions are different.\n\n\nSpecific features 3.4.3.1. Additional features around the (14 2 , 14 2 ) band.\n\nWhen we look at the (14 2 , 14 2 ) (v, m) = 0 band in more detail -see Figure 8(b) -we can see indications of two other contributions that are located close to the 29 1 excitation energy: (399, 818) cm −1 (labelled A) and (399, 829) cm −1 (labelled B). The 14 2 m 0 and 14 2 m 1 origins are located at 822.8 and 823.5 cm −1 according to GL [16] but the two bands are not separable with our resolution. Assuming that the two extra bands indeed arise from exciting 29 1 , suggested assignments are (29 1 m 1 , 29 1 30 1 m 4 ) and (29 1 m 1 , 14 1 29 1 m 1 ). These extra features are evident in Figure S4 of Ref. [16], but the higher wavenumber emission band (A) was associated with oand m-isomers of the 13 C pFT isotopologue, with the lower one (B) not being assigned, the profile of band A suggests the isotopomer assignment is the more reliable [45].",

Although the band at (398,576) cm -1 could be assigned as (14 2 , 20 4 ) or (29 1 m 1 , 20 1 29 1 m 1 ), it seems to be located close to centre of the 14 1 m 6(−) band; additionally, the DF spectrum suggests 14 1 involvement, and so an assignment to (14 2 m 1 , 14 1 20 1 m 2 ) fits best. The 2D-LIF band at 600 cm −1 can be assigned to the totally-symmetric level 14 1 20 1 m 3(+) -this must arise from FC activity, which is consistent with its similar profile and excitation position to the 14 2 and 14 1 m 6(−) bands.\n\nThere are various assignments for the emission band at 703 cm −1 . A number of these can be excluded on the grounds that they do not fit the position of an expected (v, m) = 0 band, or are not expected to have significant FC activity: 20 3 m 7 , 18 1 m 6(±) , 20 4 m 5 , 30 2 m 5 and 17 1 m 2 . Our favoured candidates for the emission are 14 1 20 2 m 1 and 14 1 20 2 m 2 . Although the former is the best fit on the grounds of expected wavenumber, we cannot exclude the latter since there is significant lowering of some of the m = 2 levels in the S 1 state arising from vibtor interactions [16].",

If one tube is displaced a little from this position, as in fig. 6, then the beam of light A, A, which is arranged to impinge symmetrically on the slit, is displaced as a t B, B.

Any displacement of the image, therefore, means th at the energy reaching the slit is liable to vary if the end-plates of the two tubes are not in exactly the same positions relative to the slit.

In the case illustrated in fig. 7, where three points a, 6, c are close together on the energy curve of the source of radiation, a value d may be taken to represent the small difference in galvano meter deflection due to imperfect alignment of one of the tubes. Then the fraction of the total energy gained or lost by this defect in alignment is given by and , which are nearly constant values. The effect of this on an absorption band in the region a, b, c is to produce a slight apparent alteration in the intensity of the band. If, however, the energy is varying rapidly, as in fig. 8, or if the radiation suffers selective absorption in any part of the optical train (e.g., a quartz prism at 2*95 p, where there is compara tively large absorption) the circumstances are different. In this case, suppose the tubes are again out of adjustment so as to give the difference of deflection d' as",

The measured N 2 1s-* spectra are plotted in Fig. 6. The ratio of total yield between the first valley at 400.8 eV and the third peak at 401.2 eV is a sensitive measure of the overall energy resolution where lower values indicate better energy resolution (Chen & Sette, 1989). The advantage of the valley-to-peak (v/p) ratio over curve fitting is that it is independent of the calibration of the energy scale and less susceptible to correlations between fit parameters. For a quantitative measure, the spectrum is modeled with the sum of seven Voigt profiles and v/p is compared with the measurement. The basic parameters for the model spectrum, the natural line width of 113 meV FWHM and peak positions, are taken from the literature (Kato et al., 2007).

However, under low excitation power densities, efficient UC emissions can only be generated by very few RE ions, such as Er 3+ , Ho 3+ and Tm 3+ . This is due to the ladder-like arrangement of their energy states and good match with commercially available high-power diode lasers (Fig. 1). For example, Er 3+ ions have mainly three UC emissions bands, including two green emission bands at around 525 nm and 545 nm originating from the transitions 2 H 11/2 → 4 I 15/2 and 4 S 3/2 → 4 I 15/2 , respectively, and a red emission band at around 652 nm originating from the transition 4 F 9/2 → 4 I 15/2 [80]. The Ho 3+ ions have two main UC bands of green and red emission at 541 and 647 nm, corresponding to the transitions 5 S 2 / 5 F 4 → 5 I 8 and 5 F 5 → 5 I 8 , respectively [81]. The main UC band of the Tm 3+ ions is in the near infrared (NIR) range at around 800 nm, originating from the transition 3 H 4 → 3 H 6 [82]. This NIR UC band is located within the \"window of optical transparency\"for biological tissues, in which both light absorption and scattering are significantly reduced. This feature makes Tm 3+ -doped UCNPs particularly interesting for imaging of deeply located bio-targets. The Tm 3+ ions have another two generally less efficient UC emission bands at around 479 and 648 nm, generated by the transitions 1 G 4 → 3 H 6 and 1 G 4 → 3 F 4 , respectively [82]. The blue emission band is less suitable for bioimaging due to much higher light absorption and scattering in biological tissues at this wavelength. The intensity ratio between different UC bands is host and doping concentration dependent, even for the same activator.",

Note that despite only including the n 2 and n 4 band centres in the refinement, their rotational structures are reproduced well. In the 2920-3260 cm À1 region (shown Fig. 10 and 11) the dominant sources of opacity are predicted to be the strong n 1 + n 4 and n 3 + n 4 (A 1 ) (calculated band centre 3119.400 cm À1 ) bands, and the slightly weaker n 2 + n 3 (3023.706 cm À1 ) and n 1 + n 2 bands. Considering that no associated experimental energies were included in the refinement, the level of agreement is satisfying. Above 5000 cm À1 most absorption features are lost in the PNNL background noise; only the 2n 1 + n 4 , n 2 + 2n 0 3 and n 1 + n 3 + n 4 bands (our labelling) are clearly visible between 5000 and 5250 cm À1 (see Fig. 14). There is a tenuous absorption bump in the PNNL at 5050 cm À1 for which we appear to be offset by roughly 15 cm À1 , confirming our discrepancies with the 2n 1 + n 2 and n 1 + n 2 + n 3 band centres measured by Halonen et al. 58 (see Table 5). In the 6000-6400 cm À1 region (see Fig. 15) the salient feature is the 3n 1 and 2n 1 + n 3 Q-branch at 6135 cm À1 , for which we clearly underestimate the intensity. Although in line with our comparisons with Zheng et al. 71 (see Table 6) it is difficult to quantify this, or indeed draw any conclusions regarding the weaker n 1 + 2n 3 /3n 3 bands, without additional high-resolution experimental data.

The distances of the source from the slit and screen were 8*185 and 16*565 cm. respectively. With six values of the field varying between 4000 and 8500 gauss, the values of mvje determined from the observed deflections were 4*00, 4*00, 3*99, 4*00, 4*00, 4*015 x 105 electromagnetic units respectively, with a mean of 4*00 x 105. The con cordance of these results shows the sensitiveness of the method of measure ment. The mean result is probably correct to | per cent., an uncertain error arising from the details of the ordinary laboratory instruments used in the calibration. An accurate investigation of initial velocity and e/m is at present in progress by Prof. Rutherford and Mr. Robinson in this laboratory.",

The energy of translation of an electron after falling through one volt is T59 x 10~12 ergs, since its charge is 4'77 x 10~10 e.s.u., and one volt is equal to 1/300 e.s.u. The mean energy of translation of a molecule of a gas at absolute temperature T is equal to 3/2 RT, where R = T37 x 10-16. The electron after falling through one volt therefore has translational energy equal to the mean translational energy of a gas molecule at temperature T given by\nr y_ 2 X 1-59 X 10~12 _ t j 3 x T37 x 10~16\nWe must now consider the mean free path of the electron. To do this an estimate must be made of the radius of the sphere of action of the hydrogen atom. This will be of the order 10-8 cm., which is sufficiently accurate for the present purpose. Taking the number of atoms of hydrogen in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric pressure as 2 x 2*7 x 1019, the mean free path, X, of an electron which is both *so small that it can be regarded as a point, and is moving so fast that the hydrogen molecules may be assumed at rest, is given by x _ 760 _ 0 04 10-16 x 2 x 27 x 1019 x p'\n\nwhere p is the pressure in millimetres of mercury. The conditions under which the discharge tube was run were such that there was no positive column. In this case nearly the whole drop of potential occurs in the cathode dark space, and the potential gradient is uniform within that region.* If we assume that at each collision an electron loses the whole of its energy, the minimum value possible for the average energy with which an electron leaves the dark space can be obtained by finding the potential drop in a free path and calculating the energy gained by an electron in falling through this potential.",

The off-diagonal terms in the quantum master equation now include the decoherence of excited states and electronic dephasing between ground and excited states by exploiting the relation 1/T 2 = 1/2T 1 + 1/T * 2 to estimate the different contributions to the dephasing rate, where T 2 is the transverse relaxation time and T 1 , T * 2 are the longitudinal relaxation time and pure dephasing time, respectively. While working out the details with the results reported in this paper, this extended quantum master equation has also been independently put forward very recently in Ref. [28] and has been named the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT). To avoid confusion, we use to this nomenclature also here.\n\nFor calculating 2D photon-echo spectra, essentially two different approaches are available. On the one hand, the response to the sequence of applied laser pulses can be calculated by evaluating the third-order optical response function [29]. Modified Redfield theory was successfully applied to simulate the 2D spectra of the double-ring LH2 aggregate of purple bacteria including both the B800 and the B850 ring [30]. Comparing experimentally measured and theoretically calculated results of 2D spectra revealed that excitation energy transfer through the LHCII happens on three time scales: sub-100fs relaxation through spatially overlapping states, several hundred femtosecond transfer between nearby chlorophylls, and picosecond energy transfer steps between layers of pigments [31]. More recently, 2D spectra of the reaction center in the Photosystem II were calculated with MRT at low temperature, and the charge separation process was investigated by MRT including charge transfer states in the model [20,32].",

The intercept corresponding to the linear fit to the loglog plot of the fluorescence vs. incident power data was used to determine the relative value of the 2PA cross section at each wavelength. Only those points were used where the slope of the power dependence was verified to be in the range 2.00 ± 0.05. Correction for the beam shape was determined by imaging the beam at each wavelength with a CCD camera (Stingray, Basler). Pulse durations were measured using a home-built second harmonic generation autocorrelator using BBO as the doubling material, and were in the range 90-120 fs. The pulse repetition rate of the laser is 80 Mhz, and was chopped down to 70 Hz using a mechanical chopper wheel to alleviate thermal effects in the sample. Excitation power values were adjusted for the solvent absorption based on the linear spectroscopic measurements of each respective mixture.

On the other hand, when the Z-scan technique with ns lasers was applied, contradicting results were reported for the same wavelength, either 2PA or SA. 9,10 No s 2 values were calculated, and a 2 was determined at 532 nm to be from 2.0 Â 10 À10 m W À1 for Au 25 up to 7.5 Â 10 À10 m W À1 for Au 144 . Liu et al. compared s 2 measured with Z-scan and 2PEF methods and obtained values of 8761 GM and 3426 GM, respectively. 11 Note that the present report is the rst to provide the full, wide-wavelength-range spectral characterization of the NLO properties of the NCs.",

Using spectral widths measurements (Ocean Optics spectrometer, Ocean Insight, Rochester, NY, USA) of the laser output from 850 to 1000 nm, we obtained an almost constant value of pulse duration, ∆τ = (109 ± 1) fs. We assume that the pulse duration after the beam expander and objective lens in our optical system does not acquire any GVD broadening at 1100 nm [42] and, therefore, is equal to 109 fs. To evaluate the relative pulse duration ∆τ as a function of wavelength at the sample positions, we measured the two-photon excited fluorescence signal from a solution of Rhodamine 6G in methanol, cf. [23]. The solution, contained in a 1 mm thick optical cuvette, was placed in the focus of the objective lens and the power P was kept constant when going from one wavelength to another. In this situation, the thickness of layer l was much larger than the Rayleigh length, l >> z R , and integrated fluorescence signal over time and space (taking into account the Gaussian-Lorentzian intensity distribution (2)), reads\nF 2 = Cσ 2 (λ) λ ∆τ(λ) P 2 ,\nwhere C is a constant. To find the pulse duration as a function of wavelength, we regroup the previous equation to obtain:\n\n∆τ(λ) = CP 2 λ σ 2 (λ) F 2 (λ) . Figure S29 shows the ∆τ values calculated according to this equation (with the σ 2 (λ) values taken from [44]), and normalized to the value of 109 fs at 1100 nm.\n\n\nColony Thickness, Rayleigh Length, and Focal Spot Size inside a Colony",

[17].More specifically, for an X-ray photon energy of 1110 eV (in between (b) and (c) peaks in Figure 2), the reported experimental value was 7 × 10 −54 cm 4 •s [29] while the theoretical cross section based on a Hartree-Fock-Slater (HFS) model was found to be equal to 4.0 × 10 −57",

On average we likely have 21 photons per retinal chromophore.\n\nThe referee is right that it is not possible to obtain 100 % photo excitation and that the analysis of low occupancy data is very difficult.\n\n There is a units problem in their reported extinction coefficient.\n\nThank you for catching this. We corrected the typo.\n\n I calculate at the excitation conditions used, there are well over 1 photon per retinal (unless the protein concentration is off by an order of magnitude). The number of absorbed photons points out the problem again, without even considering peak power problems.\n\nTo get this correct, one has to include stimulated absorption from the excited state to higher lying electronic states with nearly the same oscillator strength as well as stimulated emission during the pulse duration (with exactly the same oscillator strength with minimal motion along the CI). To get the correct fraction excited is nontrivial and this number is critical to how they inferred the fraction excited and ensuing branching ratio.\n\nThe authors need the fraction excited to analyze their data. This is not correct. We do not need to derive this number (e.g. by spectroscopy) for the analysis of the X-ray data. In fact, we obtained an estimate of the fraction of excited molecules from comparing the data of the initial light-adapted dark state with the data of the pumped state. How we did this is described in detail in the Supplementary Methods. We can only identify populations that differ significantly in structures and therefore structure factors / electron densities. At our resolution, we cannot identify populations that differ in only electronic structure, hydrogen bonding or other small conformational differences.\n\n They must do at a proper estimate of the true fraction excited at the peak power used and then apply the same logic in branching ratios. The problem will be taking into 20 account the excited state absorption. The fraction excited, independent of light adaption issues, is not 20 % as reported.\n\nAs described above, this number is consistent with the X-ray data/electron densities. It does not exclude the occurrence of excited state populations that have very similar structures to the light-adapted dark state.",

For instance, titanium:sapphire lasers are prevalently used in two-photon microscopes. They emit 100-fs-long laser pulses with a wavelength between 700 and 1050 nm, 6 which corresponds to about 30 to 40 cycles of the electromagnetic wave. Assuming that the temporal shape of these pulses is a Gaussian function, thus their Fourier transform is also a Gaussian function, 17 and we can determine that the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of such a Gaussian pulse is about 55 THz, which corresponds to 15% of the typical central frequency of 375 THz (800 nm).

Using the PMA in combination with the conventional Redfield equations, 2D spectra of a single FMO subunit were studied, and the signature of energy transfer was revealed by well-resolved peaks in the simulation with adjustable pure dephasing of exciton states [34].\n\nAlthough MRT is used to tackle many different problems in the study energy transport in photosynthetic complexes, no investigation of its reliability in calculating nonlinear and, specifically, 2D optical spectra is at hand. In this work, we first verify the CMRT approach by comparing the population dynamics of FMO exciton states with numerically exact results of the QUAPI approach. In addition, we combine the CMRT with the PMA to calculate 2D photon-echo spectra for a simple dimer model. Again, the results of CMRT+PMA are benchmarked against numerically exact results of the QUAPI approach. For the long-time steady state dynamics, the CMRT+PMA and QUAPI simulations show differences for intermediate and strong system-bath coupling. However, for intermediate coupling, as it is typical in photosynthetic complexes, the short time dynamics including dephasing times and coherent beating frequencies are well described by CMRT+PMA. Hence, an efficient numerical scheme to calculate 2D photon-echo spectra with a reasonable computational effort is available.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized in the following way. In the next Section II, we briefly introduce the model of the FMO complex, for we compare the performance of the the CMRT+PMA in calculating a non-trivial population dynamics. Additionally, the dimer model is introduced for which we compare results of 2D photon echo spectra. A brief description of the CMRT+PMA and QUAPI for calculating the reduced density matrix and 2D spectra is given in Section III. In Section IV, we give the results of the comparison, and a thorough discussion is appended in Section V, before we finish with a conclusion.\n\n\nII. MODEL",

For a pure Poisson process, M = 0. Both B and M range from −1 to +1, with the value B = 0 and M = 0 for a strict Poisson process. We will assume for simplicity that the arriving photons are all absorbed and hence one exciton created within the membrane by each photon. This can easily be generalized but at the expense of adding another layer of statistical analysis to connect the statistics of arriving photons to the statistics of the excitons being created within the LH2/LH1 membraneindeed, taking a constant absorption probability less than unity would not change our main conclusions. We will also neglect the possibility that several photons arrive at exactly the same time. In principle, incident photons can be generated numerically with values of B and M which are arbitrarily close to any specific (M, B) value -however this is extremely time-consuming numerically. Instead, we focus here on specific processes where the B and M can be calculated analytically. Although this means that the entire (M, B) parameter space is not accessed, most of it can indeed be -and with the added advantage that analytic values for B and M are generated. Figure 16 summarizes our findings in terms of the incident photons (i.e. excitation input) and metabolic output from the LH2/LH1 membrane, over the entire (M, B) parameter space. The subspace shown by the combination of the white and dotted regions (i.e. the region in the (M, B) space which is not diagonally shaded) comprises points with (M, B) values that can be generated by one of three relatively simple types of photon input: (a) step input, (b) bunched input and (c) power-law step input, as shown in the three panels respectively. Each point in the blank or dotted region denotes a time-series of initial excitations in the membrane with those particular burstiness and memory values (B and M ). This train of initial excitations then migrates within the membrane of LH2/LH1 complexes, subject to the dynamical interplay of migration",

Assuming that the \"bright\" shots and beam-off shots are sampled from two different normal distributions with different mean values, we consider the energy shift between these mean values from ε initial ¼ ð550 AE 20Þ MeV to ε final ¼ ð470 AE 10Þ MeV. If the electron beam interacts with a pulse of FWHM duration 45 fs, the required peak a 0 to generate this energy loss is 10 AE 2 for a quantum model, and 9 AE 1 for a classical model based on the Landau-Lifshitz equation. For ε initial ≈ 550 MeV and a 0 ≈ 10, η ≈ 0.07 and in the quantum model the electron loses energy at a rate ≈0.75 that of the classical model [38]. In the classical model a slightly lower a 0 is therefore able to generate the same electron energy loss, though due to the relatively low value of η the difference in a 0 between the models is small compared to the experimental uncertainties when considering the electron beam energy loss alone. Additionally, the peak a 0 of the f=2 focal spot was calculated to be greater than 20 from measured pulse parameters, which is much larger than that inferred from the electron energy shift.",

For a typical excited state energy of 2 eV and width 100 meV , the onset is about 50 meV from the peak, leading to a fractional error of 2.5 %. For functions that vary as the fifth power of the energy, this contributes an error of less than 15 %the low end for the experimental uncertainty of the more accurate nonlinear-optical measurements. So, in using the peak values to obtain the energies, our calculations have an uncertainty of about 15 %; and, the positions of the peaks in our dispersion plots could be off by about 50 meV .\n\n\nA. Influence of the number of electrons\n\nA simple consequence of the Thomas-Khun sum-rules is that the two-photon cross-section of a molecule depends quadratically on the effective number of electrons. With the aid of the sum-rules one can rewrite γ T K3 I as:\nγ T K∞ I = e √ 2m 2 N 2 ef f E 5 10 Φ,(32)\nwhere Φ is a dimensionless function that depends on the energy ratios, the transition dipole moment ratios and the inverse radiative lifetimes but does not depend on N ef f . This is a general result that applies to molecules with any number of levels. Eq. 32 together with Eq. 1 predict a quadratic dependence on the effective number of electrons for the TPA cross-section: Fig. 9 shows a plot of the TPA cross-sections of the different molecules as a function of N 2 ef f . The data follow an approximately linear relationship, indicating that even though the performance of a molecule is dictated by many factors, it correlates with the square of the effective electrons. Note that while this scaling appears to be approximately universal for the molecules studied, it may not hold in other classes of molecules.     \nδ(ω) ∝ E 2 20 E 5 10 N 2 ef f Φ.(33)\n\nB.

The band origin for the main isotopic species is determined to be n 1 + n 3 = 983.2645(2)cm À1 .The gas-phase value is slightly lower than the IR absorptions at 992.6 and 1001.0 cm À1 that were assigned to ClHCl À in a neon matrix-isolation study, codepositing a Ne : HCl sample at 5 K with a beam of microwave excited neon atoms. 20or comparison, earlier argon-matrix experiments by Milligan and Jacox 21 yielded a lower value of 956.0 cm À1 , illustrating the sensitivity of the IR spectrum of ClHCl À to the environment (see ref. 20 for more details).\n\nChanges in the rotational constants B v between vibrational states n 1 + n 3 and n 3 amount to only 0.5%.On the other hand, the quartic centrifugal distortion constants (D v ) within the n 1 + n 3 state are much closer to their ground-state counterparts than to those of the n 3 state.As we will see later from theoretical simulations, the D v values of the n 3 states depend very sensitively on the choice of rotational energy levels employed in their determination.\n\n\nPotential energy and electric dipole moment functions",

The other four components have very close vibrational frequencies, which possibly come from the different combinations of chlorine isotopes. It is known that chlorine has two major isotopes, 35 Cl and 37 Cl, with natural abundances of 75.77% and 24.23%, respectively. Since the 37 Cl atom is heavier than the 35 Cl atom, a vibrational mode involving 37 Cl has lower frequency than the same mode involving 35 Cl. Taking into account these two isotopes, chloroform molecules have four possible combinations (CH 35 Cl 3 , CH 35 Cl 2 37 Cl, CH 35 Cl 37 Cl 2 , CH 37 Cl 3 ), and their proportions and the corresponding calculated vibrational frequencies of n 5 are listed in Table 2. For comparison, the tting parameters of the four components corresponding to the four combinations of chlorine isotopes are also listed in this table. Comparing the parameters listed in Table 2, the relative proportions of A j are very close to the calculated proportions of the four combinations. The frequency differences between the tted frequencies are basically consistent with the calculated frequency differences as well, and they are in good agreement with the ne structure measured under high dispersion. 31 Therefore, it can be conrmed that the lowfrequency polarization beats in the CARS transient of n 5 originate from the coherence between the symmetric CCl 3 deformation vibrations with different combinations of chlorine isotopes.",

The computation process consists of a number of stages. The first stage, STG1, is initiated with the wave function of the core ion as the initial input. The core ion wave function was obtained from atomic structure calculations using code SUPERSTRUCTURE (SS) [34,35] which uses the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-Amaldi potential and includes relativistic contributions from the Breit-Pauli approximation. Table 1 presents the 58 levels (the ground and 57 excited fine-structure levels) of Ne 3+ included in the wave function expansion of Ne 2+ obtained from the optimization of 17 configurations of the core ion. The table compares the calculated energies from SS with the observed values available in the compilation of the NIST [36], and shows a good agreement between the two.",

The spectra are shown in Fig. 2. Additional Raman spectra for NIR excitation from 1.75 eV to 1.41 eV can be found in Fig. S2 in the supporting information. The assignment of the bands was done based on the nomenclature by Heller et al. 28 . The shoulder of the G peak, becoming more pronounced at excitation energies below 2.5 eV, is historically and more commonly referred to as D' , but we will use in this manuscript G S instead 22,[29][30][31] . Besides the pronounced peak of the silicon substrate at 520 cm −1 the D and G band are present at about 1370 cm −1 and 1590 cm −1 for the highest photon energy 16,22 . At this energy, the D feature has an amplitude about twice as much as the G feature. In addition, the 2D and D + G S are visible at 2695 cm −1 and 2935 cm −1 , respectively. Depending on the transmission profile of the tunable long pass filters that we used, a maximum transmission window of approximately 200 cm −1 to 3700 cm −1 was achieved for specific photon energies, while a minimum transmission range of 500 cm −1 to 2300 cm −1 was achieved over the whole 2.83 eV -1.85 eV energy range. The latter can be seen for example as some of the higher wavenumber 2D and D + G S bands are cut-off at specific energies.",

G(to-tOo).To obtain the decay we should then calculate IFT(E(,o))I = and finally Fourier transform this quantity to obtain a spectrum of the beats in the decay\"",

Quantum mechanically, of course, this system has no bound states, only metastable states, which decay unimolecularly by tunneling through the barriers. Waite and Miller 5 have calculated the energies and lifetimes (the inverse of the unimolecular decay rate) of the individual metastable quantum states of the system, and Figure 1 shows a sample of their results. Because of the C3 symmetry of the system, the calculation is carried out separately for states of A symmetry (solid circles in Figure 1), A2 symmetry (open squares), and E symmetry (open circles). The solid line in Figure 1 is the result given by standard statistical theory, i.e., microcanonical transition state theory, 6\nk(E)= 3 P[E-Vo-(n +1/2)hto*]/[2,rrhp(E)] (2.2)\nHere P is the one-dimensional tunneling probability as a function of the energy along the reaction coordinate, to*= x/g is the frequency of the \"activated complex\", p(E) the density of reactant states, and the factor of 3 is due to the three equivalent transition states. The first thing that one observes in Figure 1 is that the statistical approximation to the rate constants (i.e., Eq. 2.2) is quite good for the A1 and E states, even in the low energy region below --0.11\n\nwhere the classical mechanics is essentially completely quasi-periodic.\n\nOn closer inspection one does see some mode-specificity in the A and E states, i.e., some dispersion about the average curve, but this is more pronounced at higher rather than lower energies. To the extent that there is any trend at all, therefore, it is opposite to what one would predict on the basis of the quasi-periodic/chaotic character of the classical mechanics. The appearance of some degree of modespecificity at high energies is perhaps understandable in that even if the various degrees of freedom are strongly coupled, states with most of the energy in the reaction coordinate will decay essentially instantaneously (i.e., within one vibrational period) while those with most of the energy in inactive modes will require at least a few vibrations for the energy to flow into the reaction coordinate.",

None of these atoms are stable since not only pion and kaon are intrinsically unstable, with half-lifes less than a microsecond, 9 but also all these particles may participate in the \"weak\" or the strong nuclear interactions and finally being absorbed by the nucleus of the atom. [255][256][257][258][259] In fact, they are usually captured initially in orbitals with high atomic quantum numbers and then fall into lower energy orbitals, the lowest one with an orbital radius comparable to the size of nucleus, through the deexcitation process and upon emitting photons in X-ray wavelength. [260][261][262][263][264] This is easily understandable since from the basic hydrogen atom problem in quantum mechanics, it is wellknown that the mean distance of the particle revolving around the nucleus is inversely proportional to its mass. 265 Consequently, the mean distances for the heavy negatively charged particles are hundreds of time smaller than the mean electron-nucleus distances. Accordingly, the spectroscopy of these exotic atoms may yield unique information about properties of nuclei as well as the forces operative within nuclei that are hard to be reached from other sources. [266][267][268][269][270] One may conclude that in the ground and probably some of the low-lying excited states the exotic atoms are not solely \"Columbic\" systems and the mentioned intricate interactions of the negatively charged particle and nucleus must be taken into account even in simplified quantum models of these atoms. 259,271 The same is true when the negatively charged particles are captured by molecules, 272 though in present contribution, for reasons to be disclosed in the next subsection, these intricacies are all ignored.",

The modern quantum theory of interaction between two complex particles gives a rather complicated expression for the mutual potential energy.*)* We have here two kind of forces corresponding to symmetrical antisymmetrical solutions of the wave equation. Both solutions show a strong repulsion at the distances compared with the dimension of particles. At greater distances the symmetrical solution gives an attraction decreasing exponentially with distance, the antisymmetrical one a repulsion of the same type. For our case of a-particles we have to accept the first solution and write the additional potential energy in the formj :\n-fix)---- (lA )\nExamining the behaviour of a collection of particles attracting one another with the forces very rapidly decreasing with distance (we neglect at first the coulomb forces which are comparatively small at nuclear distances) we can introduce the well-known ideas made use of in the theory of capillarity. Calculating the potential energy of a particle inside a certain space in which the others are distributed nearly uniformly we must take into account only the action of particles inside a small sphere surrounding the particle in question. In fact the potential energy u of our a-particle is given by the integral:\nu = -[ f(r) . 47ir2p dr,(2)\n\nJd\n\nwhere d is the smallest distance between the particles and p the density of particles. In our case, where the forces diminish rapidly with distance, the integral converges rather quickly and practically need be taken only up to a certain distance r*. The sphere of radius r* is well known in the theory of capillarity as \" the sphere of molecular action.\" We can say that the particle inside the liquid has no resultant force acting on it if the distance from the boundary is greater than r*. In the surface region very strong forces arise, trying to drag the particle inside the liquid (surface tension). Such a collection of a-particles will be very like a minute drop of water where the inside pressure, due to the kinetic energy of quantised motion, is in equilibrium with the forces of surface-tension trying to diminish the drop-radius.",

This is a development of my rapid estimation of basis set error and correlation energy from partial charges (REBECEP) method (density functional) based solely on using partial charges (e.g. Mulliken) only, published earlier. The development: (1) A larger set of atoms (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P and S) was considered as building blocks for closed shell, neutral, ground state molecules at their equilibrium geometry; (2) Geometries near equilibrium geometry were also considered; (3) A larger set, containing 115 molecules, was used to fit REBECEP parameters; (4) Most importantly, electrons belonging to chemical bonds (between atom pairs) were also considered (Mulliken matrix) in addition to the atoms (Mulliken charges), using more REBECEP parameters to fit and yielding a more flexible algorithm. With these parameters a rather accurate closed shell ground state electronic total energy can be obtained from a small basis set HFSCF calculation in the vicinity of optimal geometry. The 3.3 kcal/mol root mean square deviation of REBECEP has been improved to 1.5 kcal/mol when using Mulliken matrix instead of Mulliken charges. = = = = = = Jó sűrűség funkcionál (B3LYP/6-31G*) minőségű alap állapotú teljes elektronikus energia közelítését dolgoztam ki egypontos (adott geometriára vonatkozó) Hartree-Fock önkonzisztens (HF-SCF/6-31G*) teljes energia és annak Mulliken mátrixának felhasználásával, ami egy saját fejlesztésű sűrűség funkcionál.

This second 6 + is about 0.1 MeV higher in energy than the lowest 6 + in the T0JUN45 calculation. It may be that the two lowest 6 + states have switched order in removing the T = 0 matrix elements, allowing us to recapture a strong B(E2:6 → 4) without needing to resort to T = 0 effects. However, one thing clearly missing in the T0JUN45 calculation is a strong B(E2) connecting a J = 8 to a J = 6 state. (There is no such transition even if we expand to looking at the first half-dozen 6 + and 8 + levels in the T0JUN45 calculation.)\n\nWhile the results from [1] would seem to be pointing to the possibility of T = 0 pairing, it would appear that the experimental properties of the J = 8 state are needed to fully settle the question.\n\nNote that as one goes to higher angular momentum, beyond J = 4, the B(E2) values steadily decrease. This is typical of what happens in all shell model calculations and indeed experiment. In ref [3] we show the well known formulas for B(E2) values in the rotational and vibrational models. Both show ready increases with J. There have been attempts to get rotational bands which terminate e.g the work of Brink et al. [31]. Their work is also described in Igal Talmi's book. [32].\n\nQi et al. [33] also point out the importance of looking at electromagnetic transitions. For example they note in the vibrational model the B(E2)'s to the first excited state from the next J = 0, 2, 4 two-phonon triplet should all be the same -0(2) to 2(1), 2(2) to 2(1) and 4(1) to 2(1). However in their shell model calculations even though the energy levels display a harmonic behavior, the B(E2) 0(2) to 2(1) is much weaker than the other two.\n\n\nA Brief Comparison with 48 Cr",

Quasiclassical trajectory calculation\n\nThe N+NO and O+N 2 collisions systems are studied by running quasiclassical trajectories (QCT) on the global RKHS PESs for both 3 A and 3 A states of N 2 O. The QCT method followed here is well documented in Refs. 53-55 and 56. In this approach, Hamilton's coupled differential equations of motion are solved using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The integration time step was ∆t = 0.05 fs which guaranteed conservation of the total energy and angular momentum up to the sixth and eighth decimal places, respectively.\n\nInitial conditions for the trajectories are sampled using a Monte Carlo sampling method.\n\nThe ro-vibrational states for the reactant and product are computed using the semiclassical theory of bound states. The ro-vibrational states for the product diatom are assigned to the nearest integer using histogram binning (HB) and Gaussian binning (GB) schemes. [56][57][58] Since the results from both binning schemes are similar, only those obtained from HB are discussed unless otherwise mentioned.\n\nThe probability of an event x (reactive, vibrational relaxation) can be computed as\nP x = N x N tot ,(4)\nwhere N x is the number of trajectories corresponding to the event of interest and N tot is the total number of trajectories. The cross section for that event is then computed as\nσ x = πb 2 max P x(5)\nwhere b max is the maximum impact parameter for which the event can occur. The impact parameters are sampled using stratified sampling 37,54,59 by subdividing the interval between 0 and b max into six strata.\n\nThe rates for an event x at a particular temperature is then obtained as\nk i,x (T ) = g i (T ) 8k B T πµ πb 2 max P x .(6)\nwhere g i (T ) is the electronic degeneracy factor of an electronic state 'i', k B is the Boltzmann constant and µ is the reduced mass of the collision system.",

Our sensitivity is similar to the most recent previous measurement, by Anderson et al.[20], but our results show some significant discrepancies with theirs. The most egregious is for the intensity of the 2883-keV γ transition, which we determine to be an order of magnitude less than their result. It seems very likely that the value quoted by Anderson et al. is simply a misprint since it does not seem to be supported by their own γ-ray spectrum (see Figure 5 in Ref. [20]), in which the 2883-keV peak is clearly not one-half the intensity of the nearby peak at 3211 keV as their tabulated intensity would lead one to believe. There are two other smaller, but still significant, discrepancies between our results and those of Anderson et al. for the peaks at 1643 and 3726 keV. These discrepancies give us good reason to use our results exclusively in all subsequent determinations of the Gamow-Teller β-branching ratios from 38 Ca.\n\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\n\nA.

Using the time profile of the 38 Ca collection rate (see Fig. 6), together with the known half-lives of 38 Ca and its daughter 38m K, we calculated the total number of decays of each, integrated over the precisely delineated counting period. The fraction attributable to 38 Ca was thus found to be 0.3510 (3). This result incorporates the corrections described in items (ii) and (iii) above.\n\n\nFinal result for N β\n\nTo obtain our final result for N β from the total counts recorded in our β detector, we first remove room background, and then correct for β-decay events from impurities and for γ rays counted in the β detector. Finally we apply the calculated 38 Ca β fraction. These steps appear quantitatively in Table II, together with the final result for N β .\n\nE. β-coincident 1567-keV γ rays\n\nThe number of β-coincident 1567-keV gamma rays, N βγ1567 , is primarily determined from the integrated area of the 1567-keV γ-ray peak recorded in coincidence with the prompt peak in the γ-β time spectrum: See Fig. 3 and the description in Sec. III B. Our procedure for extracting all peak areas was to use a modified version of GF3, the least-squares peak-fitting program in the RAD-WARE series [18]. A Gaussian peak with a smoothed step function and a linear background in the peak region were sufficient to properly describe the detailed shape of all peaks of interest in the spectrum. This was the same fitting procedure as was used in the original detectorefficiency calibration [7,8]. The result obtained for the 1567-keV peak is given in the top row of Table III. Before this result can be used in Eq. (1), there are several small corrections that must be applied to account for coincidence summing, dead-time and pile-up. These corrections are described in the following sections.\n\n\nCoincidence summing",

The dipole-permitted transitions from the J = 1/2 level of the X 2 Π ground state to the A 2 ∆ state is well seen as a blend centered at 4300.3132 Å separated by 1.43 km/s (Lien 1984).

To obtain column density we used the relation presented by Herbig (1968) which gives proper column densities when the observed lines are unsaturated:\nN = 1.13 × 10 20 W λ /(λ 2 f ),(1)\nwhere W λ and λ are in Å and column density in cm −2 . The intensity ratio of two unsaturated spectral lines is equal to:\nW λ 1 W λ 2 = f 1 f 2 λ 2 1 λ 2 2 ,(2)\nwhere W λ 1 ,W λ 2 are the equivalent widths; f 1 , f 2 -the oscillator strengths (fvalues) and λ 1 , λ 2 -the wavelengths of the two lines under consideration. Equation (2) describes the ratio of equivalent widths of two different lines of the same molecule and originated from the same level in relation to their wavelengths and f-values.

The spectra used in this work are averages of 10 exposures (HD 27778) 24 exposures (HD 34078) and 59 exposures (HD 152233).\n\nThe spectra of HD's: 23180, 24398, 24912 were obtained with MAESTRO instrument fed by the 2-m telescope of the Observatory at Peak Terskol in the Northern Caucasus (see http://www.terskol.com/telescopes/3-camera.htm). The instrument forms échelle spectra that cover the range from 3,500 to 10,100 Å with the resolution R=80,000.\n\nTo reduce all our spectra we used the standard packages: MIDAS and IRAF, and our own DECH code (Galazutdinov 1992), which provides all the standard procedures of image and spectra processing. Most of our spectra from UVES were downloaded from the archive as pipeline-reduced products (UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph user manual) which allowed another comparison of the precision of the measured wavelengths and equivalent widths.\n\nIt is to be emphasized that the correct procedure of continuum placement is the main source of errors of the equivalent width measurements. This is especially important in the case of the B-X CH band because it is situated inside the more or less broad profile of the stellar 3889 Å Balmer line. If a weak CH features occupy an especially steep slope of the HI line profile, the baseline setting is really uncertain. In case of each spectral line the procedure presented in the publication of Weselak et al. (2009a) was performed. The error estimates were done using the formulation of Smith, Schempp & Federman (1984). The errors obtained on the basis of each fit are also presented in Table 2 and Table 3. In each case we also present calculated apparent optical depth (τ) as in the publication of Weselak et al. (2011).\n\n\nA. A.",

The difference between them is depicted in Fig. (2), where we clearly see the break of symmetry due to torsion and a tiny deviation in the size of the first peaks. There, the free parameters were chosen as follows: the slits are separated by 10 nm, their apertures are 0.1 nm each (which coincide with the wave packet width a), and the screen of detection is at 20 nm from the plane x 1 = 0. Also, (k 1 ) 0 = 50 nm −1 , (k 2 ) 0 = 0 and the instant time as t = mx 1 /(k 1 ) 0 , such that the peak of the packet in the x 1 -direction is depicted. Thus, the displacement of the first peaks are of the order ∆I M AX ∼ 10 −2 nm, corresponding to a detectable deviation at the atomic scale of 0.1 angstroms. This first order approach breaks down at the valleys, where higher orders of perturbation in ε are required in order to guarantee the positive-definiteness of the ordenate axis. Nevertheless, the existence of a shift in the interference pattern is preserved at the length scale aforementioned.",

Using the 1mm slit instead of the 2mm slit for both the entrance and the exit of the monochromator, the width of the 400nm hyper-Rayleigh narrows from 16nm to 9nm, which is the band width of the 800nm femtosecond pulse. However, the widths of the 448nm and 500nm bands are broad and remain unchanged. This indicates that the broadening mechanism for these two new and broad spectral features is quite different from that of the hyper-rayleigh processes, [16] even though they follow the same polarization dependence. If the widths of these two peaks are due to any fast molecular dynamic interactions, the time scale of these interactions must be in the range of 30 to 15 femtosecond, respectively. The angle resolved measurements of the 400nm, 448nm and 500nm peaks in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2. The angular dependence of the 400nm peak is again distinctively different from the 448nm and 500nm peaks. As expected for the hyper-Rayleigh process, the angular dependence here for the 400nm peaks follows the cos 2 θ function centering at the forward direction. Therefore, no additional information can be gained by looking in directions other than the classic 90 o angle for the hyperrayleigh process. [12,13] On the other hand, the angular dependence of the 448nm and 500nm peaks is distinctively very narrow and centered at the forward direction. The two curves may have small difference, but they certainly imply a very different mechanism from that of the hyper-Rayleigh or hyper-Raman processes, where no such strong angular anisotropy has ever been observed, except for processes such the stimulated Raman or superbroadening.",

The comparison between the black and red curves in each subpannel of Fig. 1 shows that the harmonic spectra have a broad region within the HHG plateau with highly suppressed harmonic emission rate. The center of the suppressed region shifts to higher harmonic order as the orientation angle θ increases. The broad suppressed regions arise from the two-center interference effect in the molecular HHG [2,20]. But the locations of the minima in the broad suppressed regions are difficult to identify in some cases. For example, for θ = 50 0 , in Fig. 1(c), the minimum is clear at the 67th order. Fig. 1(b) is not as clear as Fig. 1(c). It has been revealed in Ref. [22] that the interference minima in the molecular HHG spectra may shift as the laser intensity changes. In particular, according to the simple point-emitter model proposed in Ref [3], for H + 2 with R = 2 a.u. and θ = 50 0 , the predicted interference minimum is at the 51st order. Compared to the observation of the 67th order in Fig. 1(c), a large shift of about 16 orders occurs here. Based on the above analyses and discussions, we expect that probing molecular structure using the pronounced interference-related minimum can not be applicable in some cases.",

Θ is the scattering angle and 2Θ is the angle between the beam direction and a given detector point [42]. Ab initio calculations (GAMESS-US MP2/6-311 G** [43]) predict a value of 700 pm for the iodine-iodine distance. Figure 4 shows the experimentally obtained intensity profiles IðsÞ, averaged over −70°≤ α ≤ −50°, together with simulated IðsÞ profiles. Each curve is normalized to be independent of the exact molecular beam density M of DIBN molecules, which merely changes the contrast, i.e., the depth of the minimum. Because of the relatively long wavelength (620 pm) compared to the known iodine-iodine distance (700 pm), the scattering extends to large angles and the first scattering maximum from the iodine-iodine interference is not covered by the detector in our setup. The experimentally obtained IðsÞ is best fitted for an iodine-iodine distance of 800 pm. Figure 4 shows the simulated IðsÞ for iodine-iodine distances of 500, 700, 800, and 1000 pm. The inset of Fig. 4 depicts the calculated χ 2 values [44] in dependence of the iodine-iodine distance. Because of the experimental parameters, as mentioned above, the scattering features are large and vary only slightly within the recorded range of s values. We note that the structural features of small molecules, like DIBN, could be determined much more accurately with data recorded at a shorter wavelength where the available s range extends to cover several maxima and minima. This would be possible at wavelengths of 200-100 pm, which became available at LCLS recently and will be available at upcoming facilities, e.g., the European XFEL, in the near future.",

Minima from those symmetric molecules are just dependent on internuclear distances and alignment angles, while little information on the combining atoms is included.For example, minima were observed at the same position around 55eV in both harmonic spectra from N 2 O and CO 2 at parallel alignment, which is determined by the same internuclear distance of 2.3 Å.Note that although N 2 O is an asymmetric molecule, it has a very similar HOMO to that of CO2 with a π g symmetry [22,23].",

From the graph in Figure 2, I roughly estimate that the SB minimum is around 2.4 eV at the xMCQDPT2 level of theory, while the D0 state is (again rough estimate) at 3.5 eV. Thus, unless I made a mistake in reading these numbers, the energy gap is 0.9 eV. With a probe energy of 1.55 eV, the ejected electron would have a kinetic energy of 0.65 eV. However, in the text the authors write (line 154) that the energy is 0.87 eV. While the latter would indeed be very close to the experimental result of ~0.8 eV, the 0.65 estimate is a littel farther off, possibly even beyond the expected error of the underlying theoretical method? Unless I made a mistake, I suggest the authors to check their numbers and, if needed, adjust the text and/or figure.\n\nIt is in fact very difficult to accurately determine where the peak maximum will be. In normal photoelectron spectroscopy, the difference between the energy minima (as suggested by the referee) will yield the adiabatic detachment energy. However, this does shift if we include the energy imparted into the many modes of the system. This means that one does not go from the bottom of one well to the same vertical point on the neutral. For this reason, we have taken essentially the \"maximum\" kinetic energy that we expect to see, rather than the peak which is difficult to determine. The peaks of the photoelectron spectra for all the intermediates is always shifted to the red of these maximal kinetic energies, which is what one would expect. We do not want to claim that the \"static\" calculations can accurately predict the spectrum and have opted instead for the approach we have used as a relatively fair consideration of the energetics. We have added some text to emphasise this.\n\nAlso, please include the structures, and energies as SI, as well as the CASSCF profiles. This would facilitate comparison to previous (and future) works.\n\n\nWe have done this.",

The focuses of the two objectives are superimposed. We assume that the luminophore is at focus.

Beam2, which is emitted on the right side of the luminophore, is collimated by O2. Beam1 and Beam2 are parallel beams. They propagate in the same direction and interfere at infinity. The OPD, noted ∆ s , between Beam1 and Beam2 depends on the position of the luminophore between O1 and O2. ∆ d is assumed to be much greater than the coherence length of the source (here the luminophore).\n\n\nLuminophore on a microscope coverslip\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SET-UP",

The (u, v) distance, x kλ , corresponds to the baseline length b in units of the observed wavelength λ projected to the plane of the sky at the peak position. It is related to the angular structure by the Fourier transformation of the image. The angular fringe separation ∆θ is given by\n∆θ = λ b sin θ = 206.26 x kλ [arcsec].(1)\nWhen discussing spatial structures, it is more convenient to use angular radii r, where 2r = ∆θ, and convert to AU (1 ′′ = 1000 AU for our assumed distance to AFGL 2591). Each baseline yields an average value in one dimension. In spherical symmetry, the average source diameter isd = 0.5πr. Thus the relevant radius in the model is related to the one-dimensional resolution by\nr = 2∆θ π = 131.31 x kλ [1000 AU].(2)\nThe visibilities at the longest and shortest baselines yield information on the smallest observable spatial dimension. At the longest baselines (> 200 kλ, see Fig. 3), all observed lines, except for SO and possibly the main isotope HCN, show visibility amplitudes exceeding the noise. This indicates that the map contains a peak, most likely in the center, that is partially unresolved (< 600 AU in radius). Table 2 gives the average value in the range 200 -220 kλ, equivalent to the unresolved flux. As HCN(ν 2 =1) and HC 15 N have an unresolved component, its relatively low value in the main HCN isotope is likely an optical depth effect.\n\n\nModels",

The peak in G(Γ 2 ) appears at relatively large Γ 2 values, but Γ 2 cannot grow to too high values, because otherwise higher molecular states of the C 60 molecule will strongly hybridize with the states in the Au electrode and the model will break down. Moreover, a large Γ 2 at short distances corresponds to a large binding force of order κΓ 2 between the molecule and the Au electrode. In fact, we think that the crossover from the peak to the plateau in DMSO is determined by this consideration. Furthermore, the fully developed peak in toluene suggests that Γ 2 at the position of the peak (Γ * 2 ) is smaller in toluene than in DMSO.\n\nIn order to fix the upper bound of Γ 2 we need to discuss the typical energy scales of the orbitals in C 60 [25].

More intriguing is the assignment of the m 2 transition. In gas-phase it can be only indirectly derived at 2127 cm À1 , located in between its P-and R-branch. This agrees quite reasonably with the VCI calculated transition. Also in Ar MI-IR, a strong band is observed at 2127.6 cm À1 , which is in good agreement to gas-phase experiment and VCI calculations. However, a weaker band remains unassigned at 2117.3 cm À1 in Ar MI-IR. In Ne MI-IR, a pattern of five bands is observed. The ones at 2131.2 cm À1 and 2128.4 cm À1 are of similar intensity, which decreases with dilution. We expect this to be some type of oligomerization within the Ne matrix. The split band at 2126.0/2124.8 cm À1 can be assigned to the m 2 transition, as it is in good agreement with the other experiments and calculations. The weakest band of this pattern remains unassigned at 2121.4 cm À1 .",

Longer filaments have not yet formed, so that the signals at 405 and 594 nm appear identical. The signal intensity rises quickly at first but then, after a first inflection point at around 100 ms, more slowly, without reaching a plateau. Both the speed and the magnitude of the signal intensities increase with increasing salt concentrations. 2) At around 1-5 s, the scattered light signal shows a second inflection and picks up speed, indicating that longitudinal assembly has started to contribute to the scattered light signal. At around 5-30 s, depending on salt concentration, a fraction of the filaments has grown to a length of 2 ULFs or longer, and thus the 405 nm signal falls below the 594 nm signal. 3) The 405 nm signal shows a third inflection point at around 30-60 s (and in the case of mediumand high-salt concentrations, the signals even decrease) before leveling out toward the end of the recording at 600 s. Since the filaments still continue to grow in length, this signal decrease indicates that the filaments undergo a radial compaction. The 594 nm signal, which is less affected by the highly elongated shape of the filaments, shows its third inflection point later at around 100 s and then decreases only slightly and only at the highest salt conditions before leveling out. The signal plateau indicates that the filaments have reached a length beyond which the scattering signal becomes insensitive to any further growth. The signal plateau, moreover, is considerably higher for higher salt concentrations, indicating that the filaments have a larger mass per cross section.",

This value of OPD max is equivalent to a spectral resolution of 0.025 cm −1 (adopting the definition of resolution applied by the manufacturer of the FTIR spectrometer: resolution = 0.9/OPD max ). The signal-to-noise ratio ranges from 60 to well over 100 which allows us to determine the center position of a typical 0.035 cm −1 FWHM peak in the spectrum with a precision in the order of 0.0006 cm −1 . Fig. 4 shows the 2ν 1 band of HTO around 4500 cm −1 which has not been previously measured by high-resolution FTIR spectroscopy. It was selected to demonstrate the spectroscopic quality obtained with the cell in the presented hardware configuration. On the one hand, the band lays in an atmospheric transmission window meaning it is almost free of overlap with absorption features from species like H 16 2 O. On the other hand, the 2ν 1 mode of HTO is not perturbed by other modes of the same molecule. The comparison to a simulated spectrum (obtained via the Tomsk database) with highlighted P-, Q-, R-branches shows a clear rotational structure of the semi-rigid asymmetric top rotor. The complete experimental line list and the derivation of molecular constants will be published in a separate publication. In the entire recorded spectrum, we find further modes of HTO, which are less isolated than the one presented in fig. 4, like the 2ν 2 mode which was recently published [36].\n\nThe structure on the baseline in the spectrum in fig. 4 is due to minor etaloning.

Please note that a (Figure 3a) is set parallel to q x in accordance with the alignment of the fibre axis with the flow direction. Furthermore, one has to consider that   there is a degree of freedom with respect to the rotation of the aggregate along the long (fibre) axis. Thus, scattering from a unit cell mirrored along side a has to be taken into account, represented by diamonds in Figure 4a. Consequently, one expects four peaks for the 10 and 11 rings. For the 01 ring the peaks from the regular and mirrored unit cell coincide and therefore only two peaks are expected.\n\nThe measured difference pattern essentially shows two maxima for each of the rings, as can be seen in the angular plots in Figure 4b. While this is expected for the innermost ring, the theoretical model predicts four peaks for the other two rings. However, the width of the flow-induced orientation distribution for the aggregates needs to be taken into account. As the two peaks for the 01 ring coincide, the width of the distribution can be extracted from this reflection. Fitting a Gaussian to the angular data as shown in Figure 4b results in an approximate width (FWHM) of 72°, which in theory is the same for the other reflections. Consequently, the 11 reflections appear as one broader peak, as the expected separation between them is only 20°. In Figure 4b the peak is modelled as the sum of two identical Gaussian functions with the same FWHM as for the 01 reflection and is in agreement with the experimental data. For the 20 reflection the angular distance between the two maxima is about 66°according to the model. The peak can be modelled in the same fashion as for the 11 reflection giving rise to a plateau in the peak also found in the experimental data as shown in Figure 4b.

We have applied this formula to our results, but the agreement is only good for velocities greater than about 0*6 of the initial velocity. This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter.

This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight. This law is not strictly accurate, as it cannot hold for all velocities of a-particles, yet its wide range of approximate application seems to suggest that it has some simple theoretical foundation.\n\nWe are deeply indebted to Prof. Rutherford for his helpful encouraging interest in these experiments, and for supplying us with the large quantities of radium emanation necessary.\n\nF ig. 3 .\n3\n\n*\nH.

As mentioned above, we have investigated the possibility that the interaction with the laser light affects the velocity distribution of the circulating ions and hence the measured threshold value.

The number of ions in the excited level present in the ion beam is smaller than the number of ions in the ground state. This, in combination with a smaller photodetachment crosssection 42 , gives a very small photodetachment signal close to the threshold. Therefore, a slightly higher laser power of 215 mW is used to obtain enough signal. The measurement procedure is simpler than for the ground state since no depletion with the high-power laser is needed. Instead, the photon energy scan is started 10 s into the storage cycle and three scans over the threshold are performed before changing to the other laser propagation direction.

Now there is a problem here because in Bohr theory when an electron comes in from infinity it has to radiate half its energy to enter into orbit.There was no evidence for any such radiation and the electron would have needed to have twice the energy to start with.However, there were some theorists including Sommerfeld who had an explanation that the electron could be captured if it had a velocity equal to what it was going to have in orbit.\n\nThere were other disturbing facts.The peaks were 0.01 V wide; the fields in the tube were not that accurate.In addition, scanning the entire voltage range in such small steps would take a long time.Well, Davis and Barnes explained, they didn't quite do it that way: they found by some preliminary work that they did check with the Bohr orbit velocities, so they knew where to look.Sometimes they weren't quite in the right place, so they explored around and found them.Their precision was so good they were sure they could get a better value for the Rydberg constant (known then to 1 part in 10 8 ).\n\nThen Langmuir visited Columbia.The way the experiment was done was that an assistant named Hull sat opposite to Barnes in front of a voltmeter, that had a scale that went from 1 to a thousand volts and on that scale he was reading 0.01 V.The room was dark, to see the scintillations, and there was a light on the voltmeter and on the dial of the clock that Barnes used to time his measurements.",

The uncertainty in our experiment is dominated by the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz, corresponding to 50 µeV 49 . In addition, there are several minor effects contributing to the uncertainty: for an LaB 6 surface ionizer, as used in this experiment, the energy spread has been determined to be of the order of 0.55 eV 51 . This implies a velocity spread of the ions which is compressed due to the acceleration over a high potential in the subsequent ion beam extraction process 52 . The compressed velocity spread of the ions is given by the expression ∆v = ∆W / √ 2mW , where m is the ion mass, ∆W the energy spread of the ions and W the kinetic energy of the ion beam 53 . The velocity spread of the ion beam can be converted to a spread of the frequency of the laser light of ∆ν = ∆v/λ seen by the ions. This results in a frequency Doppler broadening of only a few MHz in the fast ion beam. The divergence of the ion and laser beams and the interaction time will also contribute to the broadening. However, this accumulates to uncertainties of less than 10 MHz. Consequently, the uncertainties arising from these minor effects could be ignored and only the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz needs to be considered. In addition to these statistical errors, some systematic uncertainties arise: the Doppler shift due to the velocity difference of ions and photons is very large but it can, as described above, be eliminated to all orders by performing the experiment with both co-and counter-propagating laser and ion beams and calculating the geometrical mean to determine the Doppler-free threshold. Hence, the Doppler shift does not contribute to the uncertainty of the result, barring slight potential angle misalignment of maximum 24 mrad as defined by the apertures. However, uncertainties of the ion beam energy and the wavelength calibration could potentially affect the results. Such drifts were estimated to be smaller than 20 µeV by comparing two reference scans on stable 127 I which were performed with the same setup before and after the measurements on astatine.",

From the uncertainty principle, if the electron wave function were to be squeezed into a small area described by Eq. 3, the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron would increase. In other words, as the electron goes through the contact, it could change momentum due to the uncertainty principle. As a result, Vk ;α;p is nonzero in general fork ≠p. Furthermore, if the contact size were to increase (larger uncertainty in position), the uncertainty in momentum would decrease. Therefore, Vk ;α;p fork ≠p becomes smaller and smaller as the contact size increases. We consider two extreme cases. First, if V ðrÞ = δðr −r 0 Þ, which corresponds to the case for STM, Vk ;α;p = 1. This case means that an electron with momentumk has an equal probability of changing momentum top after going through the delta-function point contact. On the other hand, for the planar tunnel junction (large contact regime), we assume that the matrix elements of electrons tunneling throughout the entire interface are the same; that is, V ðrÞ = V for r z = 0. In this case, because the uncertainty in the position of the interface is infinite, the uncertainty in the in-plane momentum is zero. Therefore, we have Vk ;α;p ≠ 0 only if the inplane momentum is conserved ðk k =p k Þ. This limit gives us the wellknown tunneling model.",

A thorough analysis of systematic effects points out that the total uncertainty is 1.1 p.p.b., and the result (ν 0 = 383, 407, 177.38(41) MHz) differs by only 0.6 p.p.b. from the theoretically predicted value (ν th = 383, 407, 177.150(15) MHz). A large contribution to the systematic uncertainty is the effect of chemical reactions in the Coulomb crystal, of which the 1σ uncertainty is 0.61 p.p.b (0.23 MHz). This effect, which had not been recognized before, causes a nonthermal velocity distribution that can be approximated by a q-Gaussian function, and which significantly influences the accuracy of laser spectroscopy of composite lineshapes in the presence of strong saturation and depletion of the HD + sample. This is a situation regularly encountered in laser spectroscopy of Doppler broadened transitions in finite samples of trapped molecular ions.\n\nThe agreement between experimental and theoretical data has several implications. First, it enables a test of molecular theory at the 1-p.p.b. level, and a test of molecular QED at the level of 2.7 × 10 −4 , which are the most stringent tests performed so far. Second, it allows us to put new bounds on the existence of hypothetical fifth forces, and put new limits on the compactification radius of higher dimensions, as described in detail in [3,4,11]. Third, the result presented here can be used to obtain a new value the proton-to-electron mass ratio with a precision of 2.9 p.p.b.

How to evaluate if the measurement uncertainty really covers all uncertainty that is associated with the analytical procedure? Considering that, many laboratories frequently underestimate or less frequently overestimate uncertainties on its results; this paper presents the evaluation of estimated uncertainties on two ICP-OES procedures of seven metal measurements according to GUM approach. Horwitz function and proficiency tests scaled standard uncertainties were used in this evaluation. Our data shows that most elements expanded uncertainties were from two to four times underestimated.

This last condition is not really necessary. Any other frame of reference would do equally well instead, the encounters considered being defined by the values of the momenta relative to it, together with its velocity (V' say) relative to the assembly as a whole, so as to make the probability coefficients independent of V1.

The fitting procedure was found not to enhance the uncertainties and fluctuations in the determination of W , as in this case the position of the current peak is the most important quantity that is well defined even in the presence of noises. This is why we estimate the total accuracy of the determination of W to be of the order of 3% based on our estimations of the errors in the measurements of the voltage, pressure, etc. The uncertainty of W caused by the fitting procedure itself (selection of the fitting domain) proved to be less than 1%. On the other hand, the values of the resulting D L were sensitive on the choice of the domain of fitting. Here, we accept values that are within 15%, which seems to be a proper value considering the fact that previous studies have also reported D L values with such an accuracy. The larger sensitivity of the measured D L on the choice of the fitting domain originates from the fact that the determination of the width of the pulse is more sensitive on the signal to noise ratio, compared to the determination of the peak position.\n\nBesides the fitting of the theoretical and measured density distributions, we also apply a slicing method for the determination of the bulk drift velocity W for E/N values below 1000 Td: cutting the I(z, t) maps of the swarm (or the n e (z, t) density distribution (1)) at fixed values of time, symmetrical Gaussian functions are obtained and the peaks of these functions can be associated with the center-of-mass of the swarm. A straight line fit to this position as a function of time yields the value of W [20]. The results obtained for W by both the fitting procedure and the slicing method agree more closely than 1 %.",

The three transition frequencies of interest are ν 01 ≈ 29.6 GHz, ν 12 ≈ 2.29 GHz, and ν 02 ≈ 31.9 GHz. In a series of papers  and Pachucki and Yerokhin (2009, 2010a, but see also Pachucki and Sapirstein (2010) and Sapirstein (2010), have significantly advanced the theory of these transitions in both helium and light helium-like ions. Based on this work, the theory is now complete to orders mα 7 and m(m/M )α 6 (m the electron mass and m/M the electron-alpha particle mass ratio), previous disagreements among calculations have been resolved, and an estimate of uncertainty due to the uncalculated mα 8 term has been made. Indeed, the uncertainty of the theoretical expression for the ν 02 transition, which is the most accurately known both theoretically and experimentally, is estimated to be 1.7 kHz, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 5.3 × 10 −8 or 2.7 × 10 −8 for α. Nevertheless, even if an experimental value of ν 02 with an uncertainty of just a few hertz were available, the uncertainty in the value of α from helium fine structure would still be too large to be included in the 2010 adjustment In fact, the most accurate experimental value of ν 02 is that measured by Smiciklas and Shiner (2010) with an uncertainty of 300 Hz, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 9.4 × 10 −9 or 4.7 × 10 −9 for α. As given by Pachucki and Yerokhin (2011b), the value of α obtained by equating this experimental result and the theoretical result is α −1 = 137.035 9996(37) [2.7 × 10 −8 ], which agrees well with the two most accurate values mentioned at the start of this section but is not competitive with them.",

We have two different values forṘ:Ṙ adi , which assumes a motion on the ground adiabatic state, andṘ dia for a motion in the first diabatic state.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTo illustrate correlation between our indicator and performance of mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods we performed simulations with the EH, SH, and SO methods on two one-dimensional models. All MQC simulations were run using 2000 trajectories with initial conditions sampled from a Wigner Gaussian distribution with the standard deviation of 1/ √ 2 for both nuclear positions and momenta. Dynamics were propagated using the fourthorder Runge-Kutta method for ≈ 121 fs, with a time-step of ∆t = 1.0(0.1) a.u. for a sinusoidal (metallic surface) model. In all cases, dynamics were checked to yield converged results with respect to the time-step. The particle mass was set to be of 2000 a.u.\n\nAll SH dynamics were done in the adiabatic basis except in the low coupling case shown in Fig. 4c,d. For this case, the motion is highly diabatic, and as discussed in Ref. 24, SH yields better results in the representation with fewer hops, which is the diabatic representation in this case.",

On this view, it would be expected that, with every ionisation velocity, there would be associated a definite radiation velocity. In our experiments, evidence of three ionisation velocities and of only two radiation velocities was obtained. I t is unlikely that the absence of any indication of a third radiation velocity can be explained by supposing that a third radiation is produced, but is of too small a frequency to give a photo-electric effect, since the three ionisation velocities correspond to frequencies well within the Lyman region of the spectrum. It is possible, however, that two radiation velocities occur so close together that they do not give separate indications in the curves, in which case one of them would escape detection. W hatever view is taken of the origin of the effects occurring at different critical velocities, it seems necessary that a definite radiation velocity should be associated with each ionisation velocity, and it therefore seems probable that, unless one radiation velocity is escaping detection, the ionisation observed at one of the three critical velocities is a spurious effect. The electron velocity, 20*0 volts, at which the second ionisation was detected, is in fair agreement with the value we found for the minimum radiation velocity for electrons in helium (20'4 volts), if allowance is made for the difference in the methods employed in determining the correction in the two cases. If helium were present as an impurity in the neon used, radiation would be produced in the gas when the electron velocity reached 20*4 volts, and this radiation would be of sufficiently high frequency to cause the ionisation of the system to which the ionisation velocity of 16'7 volts is attributable. The radiation produced at 204 volts might therefore show, as an increase of ionisation current rather than as an increase of radiation current, and in this case no further change in the ionisation current would be expected when the ionisation velocity of' helium (25'6 volts) was reached, since the direct ionisation of this gas by collisions might not result in the production of more positive ions than the indirect ionisation of the neon by the 20'4 volt helium radiation. The presence of helium as an impurity would thus provide a possible explana tion for the additional ionisation velocity",

(Fig. 2) illustrates this damping for the example of a STM situation. The fact that the wave function within the potential barrier (0 x s) is just damped and not erased altogether has an important consequence: as long as the barrier width is not too large there is still a small amplitude of the wave function behind the barrier. What does that mean? Although the wave function reflects the wave nature of a particle, it is complex-valued and therefore doesn't provide a measurement parameter. However, the square of the absolute value of the wave function (| (x) | 2 ) can statistically be interpreted as the probability density for a particle to be detected at a location point x [e.g. 10]. Therefore a remaining amplitude of the wave function behind the barrier means that there is a small but nonetheless existing probability for a particle to ''transmit'' or ''tunnel'' through the barrier even if there is no sufficient energy to overcome the barrier classically. The transmission probability (P) can be calculated via the equation (4) and provides a clear measurement parameter. In fact a STM measures a current which is proportional to the exponential e -2ks . The value of the current depends not only on the local electron density of states in the sample and the tip but also corresponds to the transmission probability of an electron passing the tip-sample barrier. It is this exponential dependence of the transmission probability on the width and height of a potential barrier which causes the extreme sensitivity of the resulting current to the tip-sample distance. The exponential dependence enables gaining images with atomic resolution because tiny changes in the tip-sample distance cause large changes in the resulting tunnelling current. This is why a nanometre-wide tip-sample gap in STM is so important: it creates a situation characteristic of quantum tunnelling by measuring the result of quantum mechanical transmission probabilities. The Schrödinger equation not only enables a qualitative description of quantum tunnelling, but is also essential for more advanced, quantitative models of tunnelling (for a most recent overview of such tunnelling models for STM see [11]). However, it is not the only possible way to explain and describe the tunnelling phenomenon. Let us remember what the Schrödinger equation is based on: the wave-particle dualism.

For BCME dynamics, ∼10% of the particles are trapped, and for EF dynamics, more than 20% of the particles trap in the well near z = 0.9. In general, we find that this trend holds for most calculations below with different parameters: the EF results usually result in far more trapping that CME or BCME dynamics (see Table II).\n\n\nB. Vibrational distribution\n\nLet us now discuss the vibrational relaxation of the outgoing particles that are scattered backwards (and ignore all the trapped particles). With CME or BCME dynamics, because of the large energy penalty to emerge as an anion asymptotically, almost all (>99%) the reflected particles are found to lie on the neutral state |0 . For this reason, the vibrational state of each particle can be calculated as follows: (a) we compute the kinetic energy in the x direction, E kx = p 2\n\nx /2m x , (b) we compute the potential energy in the x direction, E px = U 0 (x), and (c) we compute n vib = (E kx + E px )/ ω 0.5 and round it to an integer. This procedure can be applied for all the methods above (CME, BCME, and EF). Note that, for BCME dynamics, we may safely use U 0 (x) [rather than U b 0 (x)] because at z = 20, Γ → 0, and the U 0 (x) and the U b 0 (x) surfaces have negligible differences.\n\n\nRelaxation dependence on Γ 0",

Where a decade ago one would speak of how fast their computer was, now one speaks of how many cores it has. This is parallelization's contribution. ℵ 0 core would be the limiting case if this trend of the processor to duo − core to quad − core to 2 n core persists, but appended to the technical difficulties involved with space are now the technical difficulties involved with time, the synchronization of the bits from all the its. The limitation that won't go away here is the speed of light; if A needs a signal from B before time t, the situation is hopeless unless B is spatially located within ct of A. Multiple processors on a chip enable a reduction in heat dissipated by providing channels for which heat can be carried away from a processor.

The problem with the current description is that the numerical values are presented as intrinsically reliable. The manuscript would be improved by more cautious wording reflecting the multiple layers of uncertainties and assumptions.

One of the most important of these is that the lines due to the doubly charged atoms, like those due to the simply charged ones, show prolongations towards the vertical axis. If is the normal minimum distance from the vertical axis, i.e., d is the minimum electrostatic displace ment of a singly charged atom, then it was found that on many of the plates the lines due to the doubly charged atoms of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon were prolonged, so that the minimum electrostatic displacement was only 2d/3. On a few of the best plates the lines corresponding to the doubly charged oxygen and nitrogen atoms were prolonged until the minimum electrostatic displacement was only d j2 . I could not be sure that th of the line due to the carbon atom was as great as this. The prolongation beyond the normal stopping-place indicates* that some of the carriers had while in the discharge tube a greater charge, and so by falling through the same potential difference acquired greater energy than the normally charged atom. They lost the extra charge after leaving the discharge tube and before being photographed, so that the value of m/e for the prolongation is the same as for the main portion of the curve.\n\nThe energy possessed by a carrier is inversely proportional to its dis placement by the electrostatic field, and since the energy is proportional to the charge carried by the particle in the discharge tube, this charge will be inversely proportional to the minimum distance of the parabola from the vertical.\n\nThus, if a parabola has a prolongation such that the minimum distance of a point from the vertical is d , /2 , while d is the norma it shows that the carrier which gives rise to the parabola can occur in the discharge tube with twice the normal charge.",

We note that although 0.89 still seems a big overlap, it already means the physical picture is no longer right in this system. If we consider an overlap larger than 0.98 to be reasonably good, then in the short time scale of 100 fs, the adiabatic approximation works relatively well, and in a longer time scale, it cannot match quantum dynamics anymore. The amplitude overlap roughly describes how good the nuclear density is, and we can see that it oscillates between approximately 1 (indicating that the wave packet S20 positions are roughly the same and most errors are in momentum) and the value of the total wave function overlap (indicating that most errors lie in the wave packet description in the real space). Then we investigate a more sensitive property: the variance of position. It roughly tells how delocalized the wave function is and is heavily influenced by quantum interferences. Now we can see in Figure S3 that even within the first 100 fs, the adiabatic CMES-MD is already much different from quantum dynamics with an oversimplified dynamics picture and no interference, which is not surprising considering the classical treatment as well as the adiabatic approximation.\n\nIn summary, CMES-MD can approximate quantum dynamics in a relatively short time scale, but it can be quite different from the quantum dynamics in a longer time scale.\n\n\nEquation 12, together with d x / dt = p /m, forms the equations of motion for CMES-MD.

Arguably at such temperatures the energy associated with the surrounding atmosphere will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a system at 300 K radiates thermal centered blackbody energy, which disperses into the atmosphere, whose thermal radiation energy is clearly a linear function of temperature.\n\nSimilarly, the kinematic energies of the atmospheric gases are influenced by their absorption of the surrounding atmosphere's thermal radiation. This occurs even though they are not necessarily in a fully enclosed system, as is used to calculate their heat capacities and their relations to kinetic theory. This applies whether it be the traditional, or the more exacting kinetic theory developed by this author [11,12].\n\nInterestingly, at T=3 K, the blackbody radiation is dominated by microwave radiation, which is not exactly what one considers, as being true/pure thermal energy. It becomes increasingly obvious that as T→0, any clear relationship between temperature and thermal energy density will be lost.\n\nOf interest, the traditional assertion is that the heat capacities are not constant for all temperature regimes, e.g., heat capacity falters as T→0. One can now consider that it is not the notion of heat capacity that falters, rather it is our concept of temperature that collapses. Of course, this raises the question of, \"when is a system's temperature no longer directly proportional to its thermal energy density?\" At this time, the answer is really a guess, 10 K, 100 K, 250 K. Clearly, the relationships between the thermal energy density, and blackbody radiation is not the same for all temperature regimes.\n\n\nXIII.

Therefore, the Sun's insolation is actually dominated by thermal photons, that being at infra-red frequencies.

[9] for strongly radiating jet flames, and by Suo-Anttila et al. [10] for ethanol, ethanol/toluene, JP8, and heptane pool fires.The maximum emission observed in Figure 4 is between the blackbody emission curves at 1400 and 1600 K and corresponds to the emission of a blackbody at a temperature of 1522 K.This temperature may be interpreted as the gas temperature.\n\nA similar experimental study was carried out using KO as fuel.Figure 5 shows the maximum emission spectra obtained from the burning of KO fuel beds with a length ranging from 0.5 to 3 m.Data for fresh and dry KO are reported for the same load and same flame length.The comparison between Figures 4 and 5 indicates that the change in fuel type significantly affects flame emission.As previously observed for WS fuel beds, the trend of an increasing emission with fuel bed length is also seen, but with lower emission levels.The emission from soot is also undoubtedly observed.The emission at around 2300 cm −1 is still very high, close to that of a blackbody at 1600 K. Emission spectra obtained using fresh KO as fuel gave lower intensities from both inflame soot particles and gas species, as a consequence of different thermal degradation processes.\n\n\nSpectral Radiative Properties",

From the spectral shape of flame emissions (Figure 4), it may be stated that the flame emissivity is stronger for large wavenumbers (in this range, emission spectra are closer to blackbody spectra) and that the emission level decreases for small wavenumbers.This is in agreement with the expectation that the absorption coefficient of soot strongly rises with wavenumber, as it will be discussed below.If the assumption of opaque flame holds for large wavenumbers, one can observe that the 4 m long flame emission starts from that of a blackbody at 1400 K, defining an effective flame temperature.However, this assumption is questionable for at least two reasons.First, the emission intensities still vary for the 3 m-and 4 m long flames.Second, a higher emission level is reached in the range attributed to CO 2 emission.This shows that the so-called effective temperature is overwhelmed (emissivity cannot be greater than unity) and that the gas temperature should be close to 1600 K.",

A single blackbody curve cannot properly reproduce the overall shape of the dust continuum, suggesting that there is some stratification in the dust layers. From our point of view, we can see through the outer (and colder) dust layers up the point where the dust becomes optically thick; at that point, the dust temperature is T max d . We thus approximated the dust emission by a weighted sum of blackbody spectra at temperatures between T max d and an arbitrarily chosen minimum temperature T min d of 25 K in steps of 25 K. Assuming optically thin dust in radiative equilibrium with the hottest (optically thick) dust, we then determined the appropriate weights for each temperature bin consistent with a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate (i.e. we determined the mass in each layer). We find that the best model is one with a maximum dust temperature of about 425 K (see Fig. 1). However, even in such a case, we overestimate the dust emission at the longer wavelengths; this suggests that there is less cold dust than expected for a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate. Nonetheless, the cold dust does not matter much for the analysis of the molecular bands; for the modeling presented in this paper, we assume that the molecules are absorbing 425 K blackbody radiation.\n\nWe also note that our dust temperature estimate is higher than that in Paper I, but our estimate should be more reliable than their greybody fit.\n\n\nMolecular bands\n\n\nMolecular Inventory\n\nSuperposed on the dust emission are many absorption features due to various molecular species (see Fig. 2).

Namely, \"how does one now explain the reality that system's here on Earth radiate blackbody radiation whose thermal signature cannot be approximated as some linear function of temperature?\"\n\nTemperature is a comparative based upon the Zeroth law. Here on Earth, all comparisons are made to our atmosphere, whose temperature is strongly influenced by our Sun's insolation. Arguably, our atmosphere's temperature adheres to the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation.\n\nFurthermore, thermal equilibrium does not mean that two systems in thermal contact exchange precisely the same radiation spectrum. Rather that they exchange the same quantity of thermal energy. And here on Earth, as the biggest of all heat sinks/baths, our atmosphere will govern the relationships that define any exchanges of thermal energy.\n\nSo perhaps, the best explanation for thermal energy witnessed here on Earth generally being a linear function of temperature is as follows. \"Our atmosphere has its thermal energy density (ET/V) directly proportional to temperature (T). And since all our systems are ultimately compared to the comparatively massive atmosphere then they too can be contemplated in terms of, ET/V ∝ T.\"\n\n\nXI.

OUR SUN'S INSOLATION\n\n\"Is the near infrared [aka visible infrared: 740 nm to 3000 nm], actually part of what is called thermal radiation?\" Interestingly, near infrared emission and adsorption are often attributed to changes in a molecule's rotationalvibrational movement, which implies some sort of thermal energy. Of course, our new understanding poises the question \"is this in excess of the thermal signature that is generally subtracted as a blank in a spectrometer?\" It seems logical. Fig. 1. Sketch illustrating the differences in our Sun's spectral irradiance at the top of the atmosphere versus at sea level. Notice how the curve flattens out as the wavelengths become longer. Fig. 1 shows our Sun's irradiance versus wavelength, i.e., blackbody curve for T=5,700 K. It is accepted that our Solar radiation is; 5% ultraviolet (300-370 nm), 43% visible (370-740 nm), and 52% infrared [13]. Note that, Fig. 1 only shows up to the near infrared (740-3,000 nm), with the thermal infrared starting at 3,000 nm, i.e., extending to the far right.\n\nConsider the near infrared spectral irradiance, as is witnessed at sea level. It roughly approximates a \"decreasing linear\" function of increasing wavelength. However, the requirement for the Rayleigh-Jean's approximation as ascribed by ℎ ≪ is not valid for most of the near infrared. It can be shown that ℎ ≈ when, λ ≈2,500 nm =2.5μm. I.e., the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation when applied to our Sun's insolation only becomes valid when λ>2.5μm.\n\nAccepting that λ > 3μm = 3,000 nm constitutes the majority of thermal energy that is witnessed here on Earth, may help explain why system's thermal energies here on Earth tend to be directly proportional to temperature. When viewed in Fig. 1, it visually appears irrelevant.\n\n\nIX. COMPARING SUN'S INFRARED TO VISIBLE",

For effective temperatures T eff = 20000-50000 K that are relevant for massive stars, we find that the energy densities of our normalized spectra at the wavelengths of interest typically differ by no more than a factor of three from the Draine (1978) model for the ISRF. Bakes & Tielens (1994) calculate the heating rate for a radiation field with the shape of a T eff = 3 × 10 4 K blackbody and compare this to the results they obtain for the Draine ISRF, normalized so that G0 is the same for both spectra. They find that in this case, the difference in spectral shape makes around a 25% difference to the photoelectric heating rate. A spectrum with effective temperature of T eff = 2 × 10 4 K nearly reproduces the Draine field and so in this case, we would expect the error to be much smaller, around a few percent. For higher effective temperatures of 4 × 10 4 K and 5 × 10 4 K, the shape of the spectrum does not change drastically from the reference 3 × 10 4 K blackbody, and so although the error will be larger, we would still expect it to be less than 50%. We are therefore justified in using the same efficiency parameter as in Wolfire et al. (2003), as any errors introduced by the difference in spectra shape are relatively small and are probably dwarfed by the uncertainties stemming from other features of the dust physics, such as the PAH abundance in dense clouds or the exact geometric shape of the dust grains.",

The dispersion exponent a is an empirical constant, ranging from 0.7 to 2.2, depending on the chemical composition and the porosity of soot particles. The identification of these properties is beyond the scope of the present study, but a 1/λ wavelength dependence is often considered as a good approximation [8]. This means that the greatest absorption coefficients are at the smallest wavelengths (or at the greatest wavenumbers, approximately in the range of [5600-6000 cm −1 ]), giving some justification to the assumption of blackbody emission in this range and some confidence in the reference value of 1400 K for the flame temperature. Therefore, considering the emission above, the 1400 K blackbody spectrum in the range attributed to CO-CO 2 , this suggests the presence of large quantities of relatively cold soot within the flame. This was already observed by Sivathanu et al. [9] for strongly radiating jet flames, and by Suo-Anttila et al. [10] for ethanol, ethanol/toluene, JP8, and heptane pool fires. The maximum emission observed in Figure 4 is between the blackbody emission curves at 1400 and 1600 K and corresponds to the emission of a blackbody at a temperature of 1522 K. This temperature may be interpreted as the gas temperature.\n\nA similar experimental study was carried out using KO as fuel. Figure 5 shows the maximum emission spectra obtained from the burning of KO fuel beds with a length ranging from 0.5 to 3 m. Data for fresh and dry KO are reported for the same load and same flame length. The comparison between Figures 4 and 5 indicates that the change in fuel type significantly affects flame emission. As previously observed for WS fuel beds, the trend of an increasing emission with fuel bed length is also seen, but with lower emission levels. The emission from soot is also undoubtedly observed. The emission at around 2300 cm −1 is still very high, close to that of a blackbody at 1600 K. Emission spectra obtained using fresh KO as fuel gave lower intensities from both inflame soot particles and gas species, as a consequence of different thermal degradation processes.",

The calculation shown here seems to imply that the visibility could allow the instrument to view on the order of 57 km, which is not possible, even for a particle-free atmosphere. The Rayleigh limit at 350 nm is around 10 km for a horizontal path at atmospheric pressure. It is clear that the authors know this fact, but the manuscript is not very clear on the point. One way to estimate the effective pathlength (the visibility in the UV) in their calculations is to consider the product of the delta AMF times the vertical path of the layer (when geometric effects do not take the view out of the layer). For the 1 degree elevation without any aerosols, delta AMF˜= 40, and the vertical path is 0.2km, leading to an effective path of˜8km (Fig. 1a). Aerosols make this path shorter, as demonstrated by lower delta AMFs in those simulations. Therefore, to speak of 57 km doesn't make much sense. Another confusion on this point is the Polarstern visibility data. With what wavelength light were these data recorded? It appears that they are for some visible wavelength and the instrument seems to have a maximum of 10km. Please provide some details on the measurements and describe how to consider these data with respect to UV radiation. S507 It is argued that the conversion between deltaSCD and concentration is \"not very sensitive to assumed altitude range\". This argument is based upon believing BrO is present in box-profiles with constant concentrations from the surface to some maximal height. The vertical profile is very likely to be more complex than their assumed profiles due to stable stratification that is common in the boundary layer over ice during wintertime. If the vertical profile is more complex, then the conversions they present here are not correct. Additionally, the high degree of nonlinearity of ozone depletion chemistry induced by the quadratic pressure dependence of the BrO-BrO self reaction means that there is a high sensitivity to concentration in terms of the chemistry. Therefore, a change from 26 to 51 ppt of BrO (doubling the concentration) would cause a 4-fold increase in the rate of the BrO-BrO self reaction, which is clearly not trivial. The conversion from deltaSCD data to concentrations, possibly including \"hotspots\" in the vertical dimension is",

The emissivity ϵ (λ, T) describes the spectral emittance of a blackbody as a function of wavelength and temperature, whereby the limit ϵ (λ, T) = 1 represents the case of an ideal blackbody radiator. Typical blackbody emitters are the Nernst glower and the globar, whereby either a ceramic rod (e.g., SiC) or a tungsten filament, respectively, are resistively heated.\n\nEven though thermal emitters are inexpensive, the emitted radiation-central wavelength and radiant intensitycan only be controlled by the temperature of the emitter element. Figure 1 shows the blackbody radiation of an ideal emitter and the temperature dependence of the emitted radiation in terms of wavelength. This dependence renders thermal emitters for specific applications in the fingerprint region (e.g., 6-15 µm) of limited utility, as for this spectral regime a thermal emitter would have to be operated at room temperature, and thus would have only low emissivity. To overcome these limits, one may refer to Kirchhoff's law of radiation. Kirchhoff's law states that the emissivity of a blackbody radiator at a given temperature and wavelength is equal to the ratio of emissivity ϵ and absorptivity α at that same wavelength and temperature constant:\n\nwhere R is the reflectivity, T the transmissivity and θ the angle of incidence of the light. Thus, following from Kirchhoff's law an adequate absorber must also be an adequate blackbody emitter, which can be exploited for the development of advanced thermal emitters. Despite evident progress in light source technology, a large number of the systems reported to date are based on either a change of a specific property of a natural material or a temperature change, and are, therefore, limited by operation at high temperatures, a limited operating frequency, or a slow modulation speed.",

Liszt & Lucas (1996) measured the excitation temperature of OH through both emission and absorption profiles toward 8 quasars in which they considered a typical value of T ex − T CMB = 1 K. Recent work from an even larger sample of quasar-absorption systems (∼44) by Li et al. (2018) found that the majority (∼90%) of OH components have an excitation temperature within 2 K of the Galactic emission background. In addition, this value can be generalized to various molecular cloud environments (e.g., dark clouds, P lanck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs), Tang et al. 2021b). However, due to lack of constraint on the excitation condition, the uncertainty of the empirical correlation of T ex -T bg = 2 K could be up to an order of magnitude when T ex is close to T bg . Following the T ex -T bg = 2 K (Li et al. 2018), the maximum optical depth of OH can be obtained by solving the radiative transfer Eqn. 2, which is ∼0.7 at the peak intensity (∼1 K toward p03). Thus, the uncertainty of OH column density as well as the abundance induced by optical depth could be underestimated by 38%. The calculation of the CH column density is based on the common assumption that the excitation temperature of CH is much higher than the background temperature. However, combined observations of optical/UV absorption and radio emission (Dailey et al. 2020), ON-OFF observations against quasars using Arecibo (Tang et al. 2021a), and interferometry observations against bright galactic continuum sources (Jacob et al. 2021) have found that the T ex values have a large scatter toward different LOSs, which could deviate from the canonical value. We should note that in some extreme cases when the T ex reaches a value of -0.3 K, the derived column density of CH would decrease by a factor of ∼10.",

Therefore, the greater the frequency of the peak intensity for the collision induced photons would be. Moreover, it would help explain what is witnessed, whether one is considering the blackbody radiation from either condensed matter, or from a polyatomic gas, i.e., the witnessed radiation is due to molecular collisions, and this creates a blackbody spectrum.\n\nCertainly, it would explain why one witnesses blackbody radiation in an enclosure, whether that enclosure is a vacuum, or is filled with a gas. Equally, it should help provide a correlation between P-T relationships and the sun's insolation. In so far as this would explain so much, at this point, it still must be taken as speculation.\n\nAnother question arises, \"to what degree is the measured solar radiance at sea level actually due to our Sun's solar influx, versus being a result of heat created during the numerous atmospheric intermolecular inelastic collisions [10,14], e.g., P-T relation [10,15]?\" It should be some combination of both. And if they are all related by similar Stephen-Boltzmann relationships (blackbody radiations) then thermal equilibrium may mean that we may never be able to separate them, when taking a measurement.\n\n\nXII. TEMPERATURE'S LIMITS\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, at the temperatures of hot blast furnaces (T=1,800 K) the peak radiation is in the near infrared. At such high temperatures, the thermal energy density is best defined by (2), e.g., it is not a linear function of temperature. Moreover, at such high temperatures the energy density associated with the blast furnace will be significantly greater than that of the surrounding atmosphere, hence the blast furnaces thermal energy will dominate what is witnessed. Therefore, a blast furnace is a system whose interaction with other system's cannot be expressed in terms of a linear function of temperature. This explains the white-hot blackbody radiation witnessed from hot molten metal, even though the visible part of the spectrum remains rather small for blackbody spectrum for T=1,800 K.",

The 400-900 nm regime where the atmosphere is largely transparent is useful because it enables us to compare our models against other codes (e.g., Rugheimer et al., 2015) and observations (e.g., Wuttke and Seckmeyer, 2006), which extend to the visible. We include both solar radiation and blackbody thermal emission in our source function and boundary conditions. Planetary thermal emission is negligible at UV wavelengths for habitable worlds; we include it because the computational cost is modest and because it may be convenient to those wishing to adapt our code to exotic scenarios where the planetary thermal emission is not negligible compared to instellation at UV wavelengths. We note as a corollary that this makes our model insensitive to the temperature profile and surface temperature.",

This argument is treated separately ^cause it affects also any alternative to Vegard's theory, but it is plain that le amount of nitrogen in the solid form will be less than that in the gaseous rm up to very great heights, and much less at all heights than would account >r even a faint aurora. Since something like 104 quanta per second must e emitted from each cubic cm. in an aurora, Vegard's theory is quite ladequate, for it requires that each crystal shall emit 4. 1010 quanta per second Jiitinuously, instead of one in the course of its whole life. II. Vegard has thus not really given any grounds for hoping that, if crystals mid form, the explanation of the aurora would in any way be facilitated, et. us now examine the possibility of their formation, which he seems to be 'filing to take for granted. Whatever assumptions are made, one finds that nitrogen is to solidify it must do so at a temperature between 25° and 35°. lie question is how such a low temperature could be reached. At the outset it is necessary to insist that the presence of gas is essential, egard's statement (' Ilefrig. Cong. Rep.,' opening sentence) that \" When matter xists in space at a considerable distance from any large body it is likely to ake up an extremely low temperature \" is at best a statement often correct, »ut still so loosely worded as to be unsuited to a precise argument. The only •robable temperature at any point out in space is in most cases one fairly near he black-body temperature corresponding to the total intensity of radiation it that point; special absorption conditions can modify this to some extent, mt mere distance from large bodies, except in so far as it alters the radiation • lensity, is quite irrelevant. A few hundred kilometres above the surface of the earth the black-body temperature (even within the earth's shadow) is but some 45° below the ground temperature. Gas can only reach a very much lower temperature if (a) it is continuously stirred or (6) it is not much heated by the sun, and absorbs so strongly in some given wave-length that the upper layers are completely shielded from the earth's radiation by the lower ones.",

Effective values are summarized in Table 2.As the fuel bed length increases from 1 m to 4 m, the effective intensity increases from 4.2 to 43 kW/m 2 •sr and the so-called emissivity from 0.41 to 0.74.The average extinction coefficient obtained by inverting relation (2) yields values in the range of 0.34-0.53,with an average value of 0.40 m −1 .As aforementioned, the higher value determined for the 1 m long fuel bed is probably a consequence of flame flickering effects.Table 2 shows that   Although not shown, the same analysis has been performed using dry KO as fuel, leading to an effective intensity of 27.5 kW/m 2 •sr, an emissivity of 0.47, and an average extinction coefficient of 0.40 m −1 .\n\n\nEmission from the Burning Fuel Bed",

(1994) and Osthoff et al. (2007).The parameterisations of Orphal et al. (2003) and Osthoff et al.

[42] for oriented samples.At the top of the Table 1 there are six values for single sites that have been reported and these are included for comparison.What is also given in Table 1 is the values obtained earlier for the ratio of the singlet decay relative to the visible decay where spin polarisation is quenched, and the ratio does not involve J charge transfer.This is considered to give the value of (a +2B)/3.In the case of single site (top six values) and Mizuno samples the (a + 2B)/3 values are calculated from lifetimes.",

The average power of the 391 nm emission generated at the gas pressure of 20 mbar was measured to be ∼3 nW. Therefore, the conversion efficiency from the 1580 nm pump pulse to the 391 nm emission is determined to be ∼3×10 −9 , which appears low. However, we should notice that the 391 nm emission originates from the SRS process in which the driver field is the FH of the 1580 nm pump laser. Based on this picture, the conversion efficiency of 391 nm laser-like emission from the FH must be several orders of magnitude higher than ∼3×10 −9 . Due to the continuous conversion from the FH to the 391 nm emission along the plasma channel, it is difficult to precisely determine the conversion efficiency of the FH from the 1580 nm pump laser field. Nevertheless, from the spectrum in figure 2(c), a large portion of the FH has been converted to the laser-like emission at 391 nm as well as the supercontinuum, indicating a very efficient wavelength conversion process.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nTo conclude, we have investigated near-resonant extreme nonlinear optics in nitrogen molecular ions at several wavelengths between 1.2 and 2 μm. Due to the existence of abundant vibrational energy levels, a series of thirdorder nonlinear optical processes including three-photon excitation, SRS, and cross phase modulation can occur almost simultaneously at multiple resonant wavelengths. We notice that nitrogen molecular ions are a unique quantum system for demonstrating such extreme nonlinear effects. Since these molecular ions have a large ionization potential as high as ∼28 eV, they can survive against photoionization at visible and infrared wavelengths even when the pump laser intensity reaches 8.5×10 14 W cm −2 (assuming an ionization probability of ∼1%). In the meantime, the nitrogen molecular ions can also allow the transitions between various vibrational levels of \n\n\nFirst, + N 2 ions produced in the 800 nm fields are preferentially populated on the excited",

Photo-electric action suggested by Vegard (£ Phil. Mag.,' pp. 581, 585) may probably be ruled out in an Arctic night, so that \" cosmic rays \" must be relied on. Now, it may readily be shown that [3-rays are likely to vaporise any crystal they strike. For a (3-ray that is to excite a crystal to emit one quantum of 5578 must lose for that purpose alone a minimum of 2 • 2 volts of its energy : since 5 per cent, efficiency is uncommonly high for exciting (by impact) any radiation in any other solid, it is reasonable to sup pose that for every quantum emitted, about 45 volts will be used up merely in heating the crystal. 45 volts corresponds to 1 *72.10~18 cal., and the latent heat of evaporation of a crystal of 632 molecules is 1 ' 75.10~18\n\ncal., or probably less, in view of its very small radius, and of the fact that 842E is a maximum for the heat of sublimation.* Thus a 5 per cent, efficiency will result in an allowance of \" one crystal one quantum,\" so that unless the excitation conditions are totally different from any hitherto experienced the chances are against the possibility that a crystal could emit more than a very few quanta. The same objection may be urged even more strongly against a-rays. If we endeavour to avoid the difficulty by supposing that the crystals are large and multiply-charged, we have to suppose there are fewer of them if the volume charge is to remain small, but in any case every electron that helps to lift solid nitrogen can only lift enough to emit one quantum of 5578. Thus the volume charge necessary to support a good auroral display would inevit ably be very large.",

The power dependence clearly demonstrates the onset of nonlinear absorption above 30 GW/cm^2. At this excitation, they document a change in absorption at 1513 cm-1 as a direct measure of the fraction of cis photoproduct. The onset of nonlinear absorption sets in at approximately an excitation fraction of 30% (consistent with the estimated number of photons per retinal in the supplemental material). If one looks at the signal level at 180 GW/cm^2, the highest excitation done for the laser power dependence, the signal is approximately the same as at 30 GW/cm^2 and a factor of 50% less than at 60 GW/cm^2. The signal should have been at least as large as the signal at 60 GW/cm^2 which would be the saturation excitation. This single measurement definitely shows that there are other processes occurring that are depleting the 1-photon channel for absorption. The amount of cis photoproduct is going down not up in relation to other excitation channels. This measurement was done at 180 GW/cm^2, which is a factor 3 less than the peak power used for the time resolved x-ray studies. If the nonlinear multiphoton process is being dominated by 2-photon processes, then the fraction of retinal excited by 2-photon processes would be 10x larger than the maximum peak power done in the laser titration. Taking 30% to be the fraction excited at 30 GW/cm^2, there would only be 3% of the retinal excited via 1-photon channels at the 500 GW/cm^2 used in the experiments. This control study shows the multiphoton absorption is not a minor channel but is the major photon absorption pathway. (It should be noted that 3photon channels will make this situation worse.)",

As shown in Figure 12c, the typical morphology of our synthesized 0.25Fe-WO3 photocatalytic particle is a hexagon disk with irregular bumps on the particle surface. In the simulations, the edge length of the hexagonal particle was set as 300 nm and the thickness of the particle was chosen as 100 nm. The irregular bumps on the particle surface was introduced by using the idea of Gaussian random particle [52]with the relative standard derivation of 80 nm and the corresponding angle of 5 o .

The effective refractive index &(( and extinction coefficient &(( of the 0.25Fe-WO3 photocatalytic particle under different wavelengths, as plotted in Figure 12a, were obtained by using the mole averaged value of the the refractive index and extinction coefficient of WO3 [53,54] and those of Fe2O3 [55]which leads to &(( = 0.75 )* ! + 0.25 +& \" * ! and &(( = 0.75 )* ! + 0.25 +& \" * ! , respectively.

This transition has been employed to assess physical and/or chemical parameters, mainly in high pressure oxygen although there are studies in organic solvents too [99,101,123,[173][174][175][176].\n\nIts popularity in biological studies comes from the fact that the band coincides with the emission of the very common Helium-Neon (He-Ne) laser at 632.8 nm. Thus, He-Ne laser availability has made studies at this wavelength quite accessible. There are literally hundreds of scientific publications on the biological action of He-Ne laser. Most of them study the photomodulation and photostimulation of cells, tissues and animals within the frame of LLLT [108,141,143,[177][178][179][180] although some studies also report on the damaging action when high light doses are employed [29,181]. LLLT is currently a very active and broad research and clinical area. It is therefore outside the scope of this review which tries to focus explicitly in the direct excitation of 1 O 2 . The interested reader can consult some of the cited references for more specific sources and information on this very appealing topic (see also the review by Chung et al. for an interesting introduction to LLLT [182]).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that, by pure chance, the 633 nm dimol transition overlaps with a 627 nm monomol transition. This monomol band corresponds to the initial excitation of 1 O 2 (b) v = 2 [157,158,167]. However its absorption coefficient is very low. But it seems interesting, in regards to the mechanistic action of LLLT, to keep in mind that exciting at~633 nm can in fact excite 1 O 2 by two complementary transitions: a monomol and a dimol.\n\n\n577 nm band",

The lower limit of T eff was set to 400 K to avoid nonnegligible contributions of the interior temperature (all models have T int =200 K) into the atmospheric properties, and the upper limit was chosen to be 2600 K to avoid highly irradiated regions where the heat redistribution becomes inefficient and the planetary average irradiation treatment might become invalid. The surface gravity spans from 2.0 to 5.0 to broadly cover possible surface gravity values. Metallicity ranges from −1.0 to 2.0 with an increment of 0.5. The stellar spectral types were chosen to be M5, K5, G5, and F5.

Here we adopt an effective temperature of 2500 K. The temperature gradient across the extended atmosphere can be usually well accounted for using a  Figure 1 of Bladh et al. 2019). The green and blue dashed curves show the profiles resulting from a 3D model of an AGB atmosphere with and without radiation pressure on dust (models st28gm06n06 and st28gm06n26 from Freytag et al. 2017, where profiles are averaged over spherical shells and time). The black dotted line shows the empirical profile derived for the carbon star IRC +10216 ). In the bottom panel we also show as thin solid lines various radial pressure profiles derived from high angular resolution observations of the radio continuum of various AGB stars (Reid & Menten 1997), of Mira from ALMA observations of SiO and H 2 O (Wong et al. 2016) and of CO v = 1 (Khouri et al. 2018), and of Mira, R Leo, W Hya, and R Dor from ALMA observations of the (sub)mm continuum (Vlemmings et al. 2019). The radial temperature and pressure profiles adopted in this study as representative of an AGB atmosphere are shown as thick magenta curves.",

Parsec-scale CO Depletion and Deuterium Fraction of HCO+The broad bandpass of EMIR simultaneously covers 16 GHz bandwidth. By super-positioning two spectral tunings, our observations cover the frequency ranges 70. 718-78.501, 82.058-94.183, and 217.122-224.842 GHz in total. These frequency ranges cover several dense gas tracers, shock tracers, and deuterated lines (see the targeted lines in Table A2, which will be analyzed in future studies). Using the FTS200 backend, we achieve a frequency resolution of 195 kHz (corresponding to 0.659 km s −1 at 88.632 GHz). The angular resolution of the IRAM 30 m telescope is 29.3 at 88.632 GHz. The weather conditions during the observations were good (radiometer opacity τ at 255GHz < 0.6), and we used Saturn and Mars for pointing and focus. Using the corresponding forward efficiency (F e f f ) and a main beam efficiency (B e f f ) at individual frequencies 3 , we converted the data from antenna temperature (T * A ) to main beam temperature (T mb = F e f f /B e f f × T * A ).

We use this software to calculate line intensity ratios across a range of kinetic temperatures and densities and determine whether it is reasonable to assume LTE. We used the CH 3 CN line ratios for these sources as this species is a known tracer (Wang et al. 2013) of kinetic temperature as a near-symmetric top molecule where transitions with different energy levels have similar critical densities. We consider as input parameters the ratios of the peaks of unblended CH 3 CN lines. The transitions used were 19 8 -18 8 , 19 6 -18 6 , 19 5 -18 5 , 19 4 -18 4 , 19 3 -18 3 , and 19 2 -18 2 with a column density of 5 × 10 15 cm −2 . The line ratios were modeled for kinetic temperatures between 100 and 500 K and for H 2 densities between 10 6 and 10 9 cm −3 . Errors were calculated from the measured error on the Gaussian fit of each spectral line.\n\nWe find that B2 is the coolest region with an average T kin of 120 K and a range from 90-170 K. Next hottest is B1 with an average T kin of 160 K and a range from 120-220 K. G35.20 A is significantly hotter than these with an average T kin of 285 K and a range from 150-450 K. B3 is consistently the hottest, ranging from 175-490 K with an average T kin of 300 K. The kinetic temperatures in G35.03 are also very high, ranging from 100-450 K with an average T kin of 275 K.",

The detection of two temperature components suggests that all six clumps have a heating source inside or nearby. The cold and the warm components were then fitted with a two-component model, fitting a grey-body and a black body simultaneously. From the fits, we determine the bolometric luminosities, the warm and cold temperatures of the clumps, and the spectral emissivity index β. The uncertainties of the fitting parameters are calculated from the covariance matrix, which is returned from the Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm. The SED fits are shown in Fig. 2. The cold temperatures and luminosities are listed in Table 5 (Columns 6−7). The cold temperatures range between 25 and 43 K with the highest values of T cold being estimated for W33 Main and W33 B1. While the temperatures of both components are similar for all sources, the luminosity covers a wide range of values from 6 · 10 3 L in W33 A1 to 4.5 · 10 5 L in W33 Main. The total bolometric luminosity of the W33 complex is 5.5 · 10 5 L which is only slightly smaller than the revised value (8 · 10 5 L ) of Stier et al. (1984). The spectral emissivity index quantifies the frequency-dependence of the emissivity in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectrum (Dent et al. 1998). This parameter ranges from 1.2 to 1.9 and shows no clear trend with the evolutionary stage of the clump.\n\nThe masses and column densities estimated for the warm component have large uncertainties and their contribution to the total masses and column densities is only a couple percent, compared to the cold component. We thus neglected its contribution in the following calculations. Assuming no temperature gradient, the total mass of a clump is given by  \nM tot M = 2.0 · 10 −2 J ν (T cold ) a 0.1 µm ρ 3 g cm −3 R 100 F ν,source\n\nW33Main",

The fundamental reason for this is the fact the high-frequency (optical) AC conductivity, or equivalently the optical constants n, k, which determine the emissivity, are not known for material at WDM conditions. An attempt to improve the situation by simultaneously measuring emission at many wavelengths (multi-wavelength pyrometery) (Dewitt, 1998;Ni et al. 2008;Ni et al. 2011) does not solve the problem because there is a new unknown emissivity E(λ) at each new wavelength λ and there always N+1 unknowns, where N is the number of direct measurements. Thus from the mathematical point of view, multi-wavelength pyrometry cannot produce a unique temperature. If emissivity is not measured and there is no information about its behavior, experimenters can assume a linear or quadratic dependence of E(λ) on wavelength λ and optimize this \"gray-body\" fit to the multifrequency emission measurements. The temperature produced by this fit is often reported as the temperature \"observed\" in the experiment.\n\n\nReal-world example of \"blind\" curve fitting.",

A single blackbody curve cannot properly reproduce the overall shape of the dust continuum, suggesting that there is some stratification in the dust layers. From our point of view, we can see through the outer (and colder) dust layers up the point where the dust becomes optically thick; at that point, the dust temperature is T max d . We thus approximated the dust emission by a weighted sum of blackbody spectra at temperatures between T max d and an arbitrarily chosen minimum temperature T min d of 25 K in steps of 25 K. Assuming optically thin dust in radiative equilibrium with the hottest (optically thick) dust, we then determined the appropriate weights for each temperature bin consistent with a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate (i.e. we determined the mass in each layer). We find that the best model is one with a maximum dust temperature of about 425 K (see Fig. 1). However, even in such a case, we overestimate the dust emission at the longer wavelengths; this suggests that there is less cold dust than expected for a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate. Nonetheless, the cold dust does not matter much for the analysis of the molecular bands; for the modeling presented in this paper, we assume that the molecules are absorbing 425 K blackbody radiation.\n\nWe also note that our dust temperature estimate is higher than that in Paper I, but our estimate should be more reliable than their greybody fit.\n\n\nMolecular bands\n\n\nMolecular Inventory\n\nSuperposed on the dust emission are many absorption features due to various molecular species (see Fig. 2). We will restrict our discussion to wavelengths shorter than 17 µm, where most of the absorption occurs.",

From the non-LTE modeling of both C 18 O and N 2 H + we also find 2.1 ×10 22 cm −2 in a 180 radius, which is a lower limit since the cloud is truncated to the C 18 O emission extension and is consistent with the Plummer profile. This discrepancy is due to our different approach to derive the total column density. We use dust extinction, which is independent of the dust temperature (T dust ), and N 2 H + modeling for which the uncertainty on the collisional coefficients is extremely small compared to the uncertainty on dust properties in emission at long wavelengths. On top of dust properties uncertainties, it is well known that the problem of quantifying dust in emission is degenerate. This is because of the unconstrained temperature variation along the line of sight that can hardly be disentangled from dust property variations and the nonlinearity of the blackbody intensity with temperature for   A&A proofs: manuscript no. main the combination of wavelengths and temperatures of concern in starless cores . Indeed, Lee et al. (2003) and Lippok et al. (2013Lippok et al.

However, their N H 2 are less than ∼50% of our result. Pagani et al. (2015) suggest that if only dust continuum data are used, T dust can be overestimated and consequently the column density of starless cores can be underestimated. This is because warmer dust emission can easily dominate over cold dust emission in the spectral energy distribution fitting.",

Expressed by the same unit, the quantity adopted by Sir J. Herschel as the amount of the sun's radiation, viz. that which would melt 40 feet thick of ice in a minute (at the sun's surface), is 1,280,000. The 2\\·th of this, or 64,000, expresses, therefore, the quantity which we have estimated the lime under Parker's lens to have radiated, per square foot of ita surface, at its estimated temperature of 4000° Fah. If now we calculate ita temperature by the above formula, from the estimated radiation, the result is 1166° Cent. or 2130° Fah. This is manifestly much below the real temperature, and so far below that there can be no doubt the formula of Dulong and Petit has failed. at the melting point of lime. If instead of the co-efficient 8·377 we had used the larger co-efficient 12·808 which Hopkins gives for unpolished limestone, the formula would have been reduced only 53° Cent. It best suits the direction of our inquiry to use the smallest co-efficient which Hopkins' experiments gave, since we are seeking the highest temperature which can be plausibly deduced fl'Om the sun's radiation. For ease of expression, the curve which we will imagine for representing the actual relation of radiation to temperature, the horizontal ordinate standing for the temperature and the vertical ordinate for the radiation corresponding thereto, may be called the curve of radiation. The course of this curve from the freezing point of water to a point somewhat below the boiling point of mercury is correctly marked out to us by the formula. Beyond that we have but the rough approximation which we can get by means of the above comparison, to the single point of the curve where the radiation is 2\\,th that of the sun's photosphere. The attempt, from these data, to extend the curve till it reaches the full radiation of that photosphere, must be mainly conjectural. As a bURis for the most plausible conjecture I am able to make let us assume: first, that the upward concavity of the curve of radiation, which increases very rapidly with the temperature as far as",

In addition to the Lorentz profiles, the underlying continuum is fitted simultaneously. For the latter, we took a modified blackbody with an emissivity law proportional to x, the temperature and peak brightness of which were the free parameters. The same set of fit parameters was used for all objects. Such a set was first fixed on the M17-SW spectrum which has a high signal-to-noise ratio and a good feature-to-continuum contrast. To fit the 2.4-25 µm spectrum, twenty Lorentz profiles were necessary. Then, the parameter values of the Lorentz profiles and of the continuum in M17-SW were used as input to fit the other AIB spectra: very good fits were obtained by first relaxing the Lorentz amplitudes and blackbody continuum parameters, suggesting a complete and robust decomposition of the AIB spectrum. After adjusting the amplitudes, the profile (position and width) and continuum parameters were fine-tuned, simultaneously, over restricted spectral ranges. The centroids, widths and amplitudes of the Lorentzian fits to the main AIBs are given in Table 2. Our fit to the 5-25 µm-AIB spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. The blackbody component of this decomposition is consistent with the emission of warm dust in the mid-infrared and in particular its exponential decay (the Wien tail of the blackbody). The observed strong variability of the 20 µmcontinuum flux (very weak in NGC 2023 whereas strong in M17-SW and the Orion Bar) then reflects the varying temperature of the warm dust component. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the underlying continuum contributes little below the AIBs. On the other hand, additional, colder blackbody, type continua are required to fit the full SWS spectra out to 45 µm.",

Physical Properties of the Hot Gas and Supernova FeedbackAll the calculations performed in this section use the parameters obtained from the best-fit spectral models and listed in Table 1. Table 2 gives the detailed emission parameters derived from the spectral analysis of each region. The observed flux in the 0.3-10 keV band is listed for both the power-law (if present) and the thermal emission in columns (2) and (3), respectively. The emission measure (EM = n 2 V ) is listed in column (4). For each region we present also the intrinsic (absorption-corrected for N H ) luminosity in the 0.3-10 keV band for both the power-law (if present) and the thermal emission (columns (5) and (6)). Column (7) gives the ratio between the intrinsic luminosities in the 0.3-10 keV band of the power-law and thermal components. In the case of Region 4b, modelled with two temperatures, we were unable to determine a confidence range for EM because of the lack of constraints on both temperatures (kT 1 unconstrained and kT 2 > 0.54 keV at 1σ). Therefore, we give only the values corresponding to the best-fit kT 1 and kT 2 (corresponding to 0.20 keV and 0.60 keV, respectively) ¿From these parameters and those listed in Table 1, we can estimate various properties of the emitting plasma, such as electron density n e (≈ n H ), thermal energy content E th , cooling time τ c , and pressure p. These quantities are given in Table 3. The calculation of these parameters depends on the emitting volume and on the filling factor η of the hot gas. Since we observe regions projected on the plane of the sky, we can only measure the \"footprint\" of each emitting region. To estimate the emitting volumes we adopted the following procedure. For all \"single\"-temperature regions, we assumed a depth of 200K pc for the emitting volume, where K is a variable parameter (the numbers given in Table 3 assume K = 1, corresponding to the typical depth of a spiral disk). In the case of Region 4b, where we have two temperatures, we assumed that the high-and low-temperature components are in pressure equilibrium, and derived the thicknesses for the volumes occupied by these two phases from the",

For example, the visible region of light between 400 and 700 nanometers (nm) is directly detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light (1 nm = 10 -9 m).The atom, energy of a quantum state and electronic transitionsBohr model has an atom consisting of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons in fact inhabit specific regions in space. This is known as an orbital. The further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the more they gain potential energy associated to a determined orbital. Quantum Mechanics explains that orbitals have quantized energy levels and for moving an electron to another level, it has to receive or emit the exact amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the two electronic levels (ΔE = E 1 -E 0 ). The amount of energy required to move and electron from energy level E 0 to energy level E 1 can be provided by heat due to a collision with other particles or absorb the energy of a photon. In this case, the energy of a Photon (E = h = hc/ ) should be equal to the difference between the orbitals (ΔE), this is, only a Photon of a particular wavelength is absorbed and can promote that transition. This phenomenon is known as atomic absorption. A more stable electron configuration of an atom is the one with less energy, also known as ground state configuration. The difference of energy between the last full orbital and the next empty orbital of the atom in a ground state is of the same order of magnitude of photons with wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm, this means, photons in ultraviolet regions and visible light of electromagnetic spectrum. Sodium atom in ground state, e.g., has an electronic configuration of 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 1 . The 3s electron can receive a photon with energy of 589.0 nm (E=2.2 eV) and passes to 3p orbital, which is an unstable state known as excited state. Being unstable, the excited atom loses its energy quickly (approximately in 10",

These are set out in fig. 1.\n\nThe main structure of the spectrum of H 2 is undoubtedly closely analogous to that of the spectrum of atomic helium. Whether we derive the ground state from the union of two unexcited H atoms or from the splitting up of the nucleus of a helium atom we conclude that the ground state of H 2 has the con figuration ls21E, where Is2 (or Is Is) means that both electrons have principal quantum number 1 and azimuthal or analogous quantum number l, denoted by s, = 0 , £ denotes that the total component A = 2X of L = resultant l along the internuclear axis is 0 and the prefix 1 that the state is a singlet state. Both in absorption and emission we have transitions from and to this state with each of the states B ( = 2 JS) and C the final state of the present bands. In 2 X S the rotational levels are all present and they are single levels. This is, therefore, a x2 state. In contrast to the ground state its lowest rotational level is a strong level, the next weak and so on. This means that -Xx -f-l2 -X2, the suffixes referring to the individual atoms of the molecule, is now an odd number (X is the component of l along the internuclear axis). This is necessary to satisfy the rule that the complete proper function of the molecule must be antisymmetric in both the qjectrons and the protons. The B or 2 hS level is the lowest which goes down to the ground level; so that its excited electron will have principal quantum number 2, a fact which is confirmed by the value of the effective quantum number (1-959). Thus -Xx + l2 -cannot  \n\n\n494",

One way to lose excitation energy is by emitting a photon of 589.0 nm, a phenomenon known as atomic emission. A photon of 330.3 nm can also be absorbed by sodium. This is the difference of energy between 3s and a 4p orbital (3.6eV), but one photon of 400 nm cannot be absorbed because there are not two orbitals in a sodium atom with the same difference of energy. The return of electron from 4p orbital to ground state can also occur in two steps: first to 4s and then to 3s by emitting two photons with energies correspondent to the two transitions in a phenomenon known as atomic fluorescence. The sodium atom can also receive enough energy to remove an electron, turning into sodium ion (Na + ), known as ionization. In this case, a change occurs in orbitals of different energy levels, so that the ion has a new set of transition being able to absorb or emit photons of wavelengths differently from metallic sodium. Each chemical element has a unique electronic structure that differentiates from others. This implies in a possible and unique set of transitions, a set of characteristic absorption/emission lines that can be used for identification. Although the set of transitions is unique for each element, there may be a coincidence of spectrum in some lines of two or more elements, which means that different atoms can absorb or emit photons of same wavelength. Even though the theoretical basis was established in the beginning of the twentieth century, only in the early 1950s an Australian physicist, Sir Alan Walsh, proposed the phenomenon",

In the higher energy range (>~53000 cm -1 ), the widths of the resonances become broader, due apparently to the predissociation barrier resulted from a conical intersection with the repulsive 1 DA  state. The isotope-induced shifts of the absorption peaks have been extensively examined as it has been widely considered as the origin of the S-MIF effect. 11,12,18,19,52 As discussed in our recent work, the shifts of the spectra follow simple linear relationship with the photon energy, 55 in excellent agreement with known experimental data. 12,19 The adiabatic dissociation barrier from SO2( shorter lifetimes. Unfortunately, the lifetimes of these resonance states cannot be accurately determined because they are often overlapping with each other. The SO vibrational state distribution is dependent on the individual resonances. However, a general trend exists that the vibrational excitation is higher at higher excitation energies. In the energy range < ~54000 cm -1 , the ground state product of SO dominates. As the excitation energy increases (54500~56000 cm -1 ), the first excited vibrational state (v=1) of the SO product has the largest population. In even higher energies, the dominated vibrational state v=2 can be found in some energy points.\n\nIn Figure 7, the vibrational state distributions of the SO( 3 X   ) fragment from the dissociation of 32 SO2 are displayed for six photon energies (Ehv=53706, 54024, 54189, 54263, 55950, and 56095 cm -1 ).

Because the absorption spectrum of ground state QPH ends around 450 nm and the emission spectrum has peaks at similar wavelengths, it is most likely to be stimulated emission signal. Therefore the initially decaying species is presumably the lowest singlet excited state, which is an observable emissive state. From the rapid decay, we know that the emissive state lasts very short, which may explain the low quantum yield of the molecule. From the aforementioned isosbestic point, we assume that it evolves into a different excited state.

This shows the nuclear wavepacket initially oscillating on the molecular excited state |B, 0 . The light-matter coupling then leads to efficient energy transfer to the plasmonic state |X, 1 at the nuclear positions where they are close in energy, roughly between R = 3 a.u. and R = 7 a.u. The plasmonic state almost immediately decays after excitation, such that the wavepacket is directly transferred to the |X, 0 state. However, it is clearly visible in the third panel of Fig. 3 that a significant fraction of the wavepacket that decays to the ground state overcomes the dissociation barrier and propagates to large in-ternuclear distances R, where it is absorbed by the absorbing potential. Since the nuclear wavepacket in the lower panels of Fig. 3 is shown in logarithmic scale, which inhibits easy visual interpretation of absolute probabilities, in the upper panels we additionally show the integrated probabilities in the \"active\" nuclear region of each electronic-plasmonic state, P A (t), as well as the already dissociated component P D (t). This demonstrates clearly that the light-matter coupling through the plasmonic pseudomode induces ultrafast decay of the nuclear wavepacket from the initial excited state, with most of the probability disappearing within about 100 fs. Furthermore, it also shows that after decaying to the ground state |X, 0 , a significant portion of the nuclear wavepacket dissociates, reaching more than 50% for the present parameters. The remaining wavepacket ends up in bound vibrational levels on the ground-state surface.",

The initial EF-X step in this scheme has recently been improved by two orders of magnitude to an accuracy of 73 kHz[20], but an improvement of D 0 (H 2 ) awaits an improved measurement of the EF-np interval.In the present work, we adopt an alternative excitation scheme to determine D 0 (H 2 ), through the GK 1 Σ + g (1,1) intermediate state, which offers the possibility of using continuous wave (cw) infrared laser excitation to high-n Rydberg states[21]. Experimental results from two laboratories are combined: the measurement of the Dopplerfree two-photon transition GK(1, 1) ← X(0, 1) in Amsterdam, and the determination of the interval between GK(1,1) and the 56p1 1 Rydberg state by near-infrared (NIR) cw-laser spectroscopy in Zürich.In the GK-X experiment, schematically depicted inFig. 2, a narrow bandwidth (∼9 MHz) injection-seeded oscillator-amplifier titanium sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser system delivers 50-ns-long pulses at the fundamental wavelength of 716 nm.

By this we mean that we can calculate the expectation value of all operators, e.g., positions, momenta, kinetic or potential energies (or distribution-valued operators, 87 e.g. densities, current densities or kinetic-energy densities) that share the same domain as the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian is bounded from below and thus we can use the usual energy minimization principle to find a possible ground state of the coupled light-matter system. Indeed, it can be shown that any system that has a ground state in quantum mechanics, i.e., without coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, also has a ground state in non-relativistic QED. [97][98][99][100][101][102] This is exactly the property we need in order to be able to discuss the equilibrium properties of a coupled light-matter system. An important dif-ference, however, is that all excited states turn into resonances in non-relativistic QED, i.e., excited states are no longer eigenstates but have a finite lifetime. 97,99,103,104 This feature, which is also termed spontaneous emission, is completely missing in standard electronic quantum mechanics, where excited states have the unphysical property to be infinitely long-lived. Indeed, if one just looks at the spectrum of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, one will usually just find one eigenstate, i.e., the ground state, and then a continuum above the ground state. Thus the spectrum alone does not provide much insight into the properties of the coupled lightmatter system. 22,99,103 On the other hand, due to the inclusion of the continuum of photon modes and all the nuclear/ionic degrees of freedom, we have included all dissipation and decoherence channels that are physically present for the subsystems of the total light-matter system and no artifical external baths or non-Hermitian terms need to be added to mimic those processes. In other words, despite the theory being self-adjoint, i.e., closed, the infinite amount of degrees of freedom include also the physical bath degrees of freedom by radiating light from the molecules to the far field and hence being lost to the molecular subsystem. So we can conclude that we have found a fully non-perturbative and consistent theory of light and matter, which answers the first fundamental question from the",

The estimates in this and previous papers from the electron terms all come con sistently low, and I wonder if the value of the heat of dissociation of normal H 2 may not be a little higher than the value found by Langmuir, or, alterna tively, the spectroscopic value of the ionisation potential of H2 might be a little under the experimental value 15-9 volts. Even so, the utmost that could be allowed in this way is probably about 5000 wave-numbers, which would still be insufficient to bridge the discrepancy. This brings us back to the difficulty that the calculated 2S term 33727 is too low to agree with the apparent identity of the final states with Dieke and Hopfield's B states. If their corresponding electronic term 37238 is used instead of 33727, the values in brackets inTable VIII are obtained. The value of the heat of dissociation 24746 is now just about as much below the value estimated from the vibration term data as these estimates from the electronic term data generally seem to run. These difficulties can be avoided by the following re-arrangement of the bands, which, however, can only be regarded as provisional at this stage. I still take the strong A band system as a 3 -> 2 electron transition, but I take out the 0B0, 0Bj, 0B2 and 0B3 bands and the C fragment and assume the jB0, jB,, -jB2 and jB3 lines to be respectively the 0B0, qBj, 0B2 and 0B3 lines of the 4 -> 2 electron transition bands. The electron levels now proposed are shown diagrammatically, but not to scale, in Diagram II. The three lowest levels are the A, B and C levels of Dieke and Hopfield, and the others give the surface of the molecule corresponding to the ionisation potential of normal H 2 and the levels for the new 0B0 Q (1) (jBq Q (1) ofTable VI) and the 0A0 Q (1) lines. The higher levels are getting near the ionisation potential limit, and it is not surprising if they are not found.In what follows the experimental value 128800 of",

A brief derivation of this analytic result will be given below for two reasons. On the one hand, it is a very valuable ingredient since it constitutes a reliable reference and calibration tool to test the accuracy of our numerical approach. On the other hand, it brings out an alternative three-parameter model based on a generalized Morse potential that has a definite advantage over the standard two-parameter model. If we consider the case = 0 in equation (2.1), then the S-wave Schrödinger equation for the generalized Morse potential reads as follows,\n−h 2 2m d 2 dr 2 + D e e −2α( r r e −1) − 2β e −α( r r e −1) − E χ = 0, (3.1)\nwhere the potential strength D e > 0, the parameters α and r e are positive and β is a deformation parameter of the classical Morse potential. This equation has an exact analytic solution for the bound state energy spectrum. Its derivation goes as follows. If we let\nx = r/r e , E 0 =h 2 /mr 2 e , A = 2D e e α /E 0 , ε = 2E/E 0 , then equation (3.1) becomes d 2 dx 2 − A[e α e −2αx − 2β e −αx ] + ε χ = 0.

Bound statesConclusion\n\nThis work is the first in a series of articles in which we study the rotating Morse potential model for diatomic molecules in the tridiagonal J-matrix representation. Here, we provided an alternative method for obtaining the bound-state energies for four different types of diatomic molecules: H 2 , LiH, HCl and CO. Our numerical results have been compared favourably with those obtained using other approximation schemes such as the variational method using the Pekeris approximation, supersymmetry, hypervirial perturbation, the shifted 1/N expansion, the modified shifted 1/N expansion, the asymptotic iteration method and the two-point quasirational approximation technique. Furthermore, since realistic diatomic potentials are more accurately modelled by the perturbed or deformed Morse potentials, we are confident that our approach will produce much more accurate information about the structure and dynamics of such molecules if we use these deformed potential models. This will be the subject of investigation in one of our future articles in the series. We believe that our approach has the advantage of combining analytic and numerical powers making it very stable, rapidly converging and highly accurate. Of course, the real advantage of our method will be exhibited when we address the issue of energy resonances while taking into account the full contribution of the reference Hamiltonian H 0 (even if it were to include long-range solvable potentials such as the Coulomb potential). As such, our method is systematic, highly accurate, and could easily be extended to other short-range potentials of which the Morse is only an example. Now, the only remaining quantity that is needed to perform the calculation is the matrix elements of the potential V(r). This is obtained by evaluating the following integral: Using Gauss quadrature integral approximation [21], we obtain\nV nm ∼ = N−1 k=0 nk mk [V ( √ ε k /λ)], (A.7)\nwhere N is a large enough integer. ε k and { nk } N−1 n=0 are the respective N eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the N × N tridiagonal symmetric matrix, whose elements are J n,n = 2n + ν + 1, J n,n+1 = − (n + 1)(n + ν + 1).\n\n(A.8)",

INTRODUCTION\n\nImportance of the exponentially varying Morse potential [1] in context of vibrationrotation states of diatomic molecules has been realized in an enormous amount of work ever since its inception about 85 years ago. The celebrated empirical potential has witnessed many important applications in various branches, such as molecular physics, solidstate physics, chemical physics, etc [2,3]. This potential has been studied also in several other contexts. For example, its generalized and photon-added coherent states are discussed [4,5]; series solution for D-dimensional Schrödinger equation with More potential presented [6]; controllability with a compact group SU(2) put forth [7]; a series expansion solution of position-dependent mass is given [8]; a proper quantization rule where the energy spectra is determined only from its ground-state energy has been proposed [9]; also its momentum representation by hypergeometric function is suggested [10]. It is well known that, exact analytical results are available only for ℓ = 0 states, while the rotational Morse oscillator states must be approximated. Thus over the years, a large number of attractive efficient methodologies have been developed for better understanding of this model potential employing a multitude of approximations.",

Bound statesIn this section, we will consider the Morse potential with non-vanishing angular momentum and use our numerical procedure presented in section 2 to evaluate the corresponding boundstate energy spectrum. The stability and the accuracy of our results depend mainly on two parameters, λ and N. N represents the number of basis elements that we used (dimension of our tridiagonal matrix) and λ is the length scale parameter of the basis. The Morse potential with = 0 is not exactly solvable and hence our numerical results cannot be checked against  exact ones. However many numerical and perturbative results have been published in recent years [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. The most widely used approximation was devised by Pekeris [4] which is based on the expansion of the centrifugal ( + 1)/r 2 barrier in a series of exponential terms around the equilibrium inter-nuclear position r e of the Morse potential by keeping terms up to second order in r/r e (i.e., at low excitation energy, where r ≈ r e ). Other approximations have also been devised but they require the numerical solution of transcendental equations [7,10,13]. In table 3 we show the bound-state energy of the H 2 molecule for different values of the angular momentum generated by using the Laguerre basis with λ = 40, N = 100 and the model parameters in table 1. We also list analogous results obtained by other approximations such as the hyper-virial perturbation method (HV) [11], the super-symmetric method (SUSY) [9], the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) [16], the results of Duff (Duff) [6], the modified shifted 1/N expansion (MSE) [13], the two-point quasi-rational approximation technique (TQA) [17] and the variational method using the Pekeris approximation [8]. In table 4, we give the boundstate energies generated by our method for different values of the angular momentum for LiH in the Laguerre basis using the parameters N = 100, λ = 60 and the corresponding model parameters in table 1.

By studying the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO), we will take a step towards to a more realistic scenario. For this case, V( ) will be a continuous position function of the type V( ) = . The QHO can be used to describe almost any system in which a certain entity makes small vibrations with respect to an equilibrium point.\n\nIn Figure 1a, we show a one-dimensional potential that is described with a solid line. This potential has a minimum point, for which it is possible to approximate a parabolic function V( ) represented by the dashed line. (a) A \"realistic\" continuous potential is described by the solid gray line. At the minimum, the \"realistic\" potential can be very well approximated by a quadratic potential (dashed black line). (b) By setting the origin of the coordinate system at the minimum of the dashed quadratic potential, we redefine the zero-potential energy = 0.",

This basis along with the corresponding matrix manipulations are presented in the appendix. The reference Hamiltonian H 0 in this representation could therefore be fully accounted for analytically, whereas the potential V is approximated by its representation in a subset of the basis, such that\nH nm ∼ = (H 0 ) nm + V nm ; n, m N − 1 (H 0 ) nm ; n, m > N − 1.

It is an algebraic method that has the advantage of taking into account the full contribution of H 0 exactly without any truncation. Nevertheless, we will confine our implementation of the present approach to the finite matrix representation (in the subspace {φ n } N−1 n=0 ) for the potential V as well as for the reference Hamiltonian H 0 . Taking into account the full reference Hamiltonian should result in a substantial improvement on the accuracy of the results.

These often require a significant number of spatial grid points chiefly because of their uniform distributional nature. In the GPS method, however, a nonuniform optimal spatial discretization could be achieved efficiently as detailed below, maintaining similar kind of good accuracy at both small and large r regions. Therefore it requires much lesser grid points to reach convergence, compared to many other methods in the literature. One can have a denser mesh at smaller r while a coarser mesh at large r regions. A primary feature of this scheme is that a function f (x) in the interval x ∈ [−1, 1]",

This enables us to measure the accuracy of our numerical results against analytic ones for four different types of binary molecules. In section 4, we apply our approach to the calculation of the energy eigenvalues for the rotating Morse potential where = 0 and compare our results with those obtained by other methods elsewhere.

For the same accurate potential, the L2 norm density error used in this work is orders of magnitude smaller than the L1 norm used in other methods such as that of Ref. 32. The convergence thresholds of 10**(-5)e**2 and 10**(-6)e**2 used in the paper are probably equivalent to the L1 norm error of ~0.01e, which is much greater than the values used in Refs. 32 and elsewhere. It is very misleading to claim \"unprecedented\" L2-norm errors when most readers familiar with the problem are thinking in terms of L1 norms. 3. The authors attempt to use Gaussian basis-set densities to produce xc potentials that do not oscillate and decay as -1/r. Such attempts are misguided because Kohn-Sham potentials corresponding to Gaussian densities in the basis-set limit must oscillate and increase as r**2 at large r, as shown in Refs. 31 and 32. Any potential from a Gaussian density that does not oscillate (at least near the nucleus) or does not blow up is not the exact answer to the inversion problem. 4. The proposed method gets rid of the oscillations by \"adding a small correction, Delta rho(r), to rho_data(r), so as to correct for the missing cusp at the nuclei\" (eq. 6). In other words, the \"solution\" is to fudge the input density. This is hardly \"an advance that is likely to influence thinking in the field\". Moreover, the principle of this correction is clearly inspired by the trick of Ref. 33, a fact that is not acknowledged. 5. The authors apply the following adjectives to describe their method: \"rigorous\", \"unambiguous\", \"unprecedented\", etc. None of these characterizations is justified. Modifying an input density is neither \"rigorous\" nor \"unambiguous\". Convergence with respect to the L2 norm of 10**(-6)e**2 is anything but \"unprecedented\", especially after rho_data is \"corrected\". Wobbly potentials seen in Figs. 5 and 6c are poorer than could be obtained by other methods. 6. The general idea of using constrained optimization for mapping densities to xc potentials is not new.

Here, we compute the bound-state energy spectrum by diagonalizing the finite-dimensional Hamiltonian matrix of H 2 , LiH, HCl and CO molecules for arbitrary angular momentum. The calculation was performed using the J-matrix basis that supports a tridiagonal matrix representation for the reference Hamiltonian. Our results for these diatomic molecules have been compared with available numerical data satisfactorily.

In short, a simple, accurate and efficient method is presented for this and other similar potentials in molecular physics. * This article is dedicated to my kind-hearted father Sj. Bisweswar Roy, on the occasion of his 70th birthday.It is because of his untiring effort and constant inspiration that I could pursue research.(1)The three positive parameters D e , r e , a denote dissociation energy, equilibrium internuclear distance and the radius of potential well respectively. It shows qualitatively correct asymptotic behavior as internuclear distance tends towards zero and infinity. Because of the qualitative similarity with Morse potential, this is also often termed as Generalized Morse potential[29,30]. Besides, this is also related to the well-known Manning-Rosen potential[7] and has found interesting applications in molecular spectroscopy as well as electronic transitions. Employing this potential, transition frequencies and intensities of overtones of X-H stretching vibrations in small molecules were calculated and compared with Morse potential[30].As with many other potentials of interest in physical, chemical systems, exact analytical solution of this potential for arbitrary quantum states has not been found as yet. Therefore, several theoretical attempts have been made to approximate the nature of solutions of this potential in relativistic and non-relativistic domain. For example, the exact solvability problem was discussed by means of an SO(2, 2) symmetry algebra[29]. Later, eigenvalues,The shifted DF (sDF) potential in Eq.(2) resembles the behavior of Morse potential for large r regions (r ≈ r",

Chemical Bonds Described by Morse Oscillators\n\nIn contrast to the rotation of a chemical bond and its electronic energy levels (Figure .2(b)), the transitions in the vibrational energy spectrum are typically on the order of 0.1 eV, placing them in the mid-infrared band.This band lies in the range that has a significant influence on neural activity.The vibrations of chemical bonds are generally anharmonic oscillators, and the energy levels are not equally spaced.In order to describe anharmonic vibrations, we adopt Morse oscillators [26] to describe actual chemical bond vibrations as shown in Figure .2(b).The advantage of using a Morse oscillator is that its determinant Schrödinger equation has an analytical solution, which makes it very convenient for us to calculate the dipole moment of the chemical bond.the potential function of Morse oscillator can be written as [27] V (r) = D e e −2w(r−re) − 2e −w(r−re) .",

Figure 1 depicts the shape of the potential for a few values of β. It is well known that the Morse oscillator is a standard model which is widely used in theoretical chemistry to describe the photodissociation of the molecules. It can also be considered as a rough model for (i) multiphoton excitation of a diatomic molecule in a dense medium or in a gaseous cell under high pressure (ii) pumping of a local model of a polyatomic molecule by an infrared laser and (iii) the explanation of the anomalous gains observed in stimulated Raman emissions [21][22][23][24][25][26]. For the past few years much interest has been focused on the study of Morse oscillator with classical, semiclassical and quantum mechanical methods and fascinating results were obtained. For example Lie et al. [27] numerically studied the bistable and chaotic behaviours in a damped driven Morse oscillator. Goggin et al. [22] compared the results obtained from the classical and quantum theories of a Morse oscillator driven by a sinusoidal field or two-frequency excitation. Knob et al. [28] investigated the bifurcation structure of the classical Morse oscillator. Jing et al. [29] studied  [30] investigated the control of chaos in damped and driven Morse oscillator via slave-master feedback. Gan et al. [31] investigated the torus breakdown and noise induced dynamics in the randomly driven Morse oscillator. de Lima [32] studied the control of chaotic photodissociation in the classical driven Morse oscillator by means of bichromatic pulses. Recently, Abirami et al. [33] have investigated the occurrence of vibrational resonance in both classical and quantum mechanical Morse oscillators driven by a biharmonic force. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we analyze the occurrence of VR in classical Morse oscillator driven by NBFM signal and with WBFM signal in section 3. We characterized VR and dynamics of the system using response amplitude Q and bifurcation diagram. In the final section we summarized and discuss results of this work.",

We also see that the errors aren't affected by the choice of solar normalization, since the solar terms are no longer part of the equation. Meaning, if we say that we have [Q/H] = 0.0 ± 0.05 dex, that is the same as saying A(Q) = 7.46 ± 0.05. Therefore, the errors would be the same for [Q/H] and A(Q). Taking this a step further, we propagate the errors for two elements in dex-abundance-notation, namely Eq. 15. The standard method for propagating errors is to convert the total uncertainty to fractional uncertainty for both elements in the numerator (num) and denominator (denom) and then add those fractional uncertainties in quadrature: (δ num /num) 2 + (δ denom /denom) 2 , per Taylor (1997, their Eq. 3.47). We therefore add the error in quadrature in order to get the fractional error of the molar ratio Q/R: (10) \nδ Q * R * = δQ * |Q * | 2 + δR * |R * | 2 = ln\nWe note that while Eq. 20 is nearly identical to Eq. 6 presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018, since ln(10) ≈ 2.303), the results from Eq. 6 were treated as full uncertainties in moles when in reality the equation calculates fractional or percentage errors. As a result, the error values provided in Table 5 of Hinkel & Unterborn (2018) were all overreported. Therefore, it is our intention that the detailed walk-through presented here that resulted in Eq. 20 will supersede what was presented in Hinkel & Unterborn (2018).\n\n\nEXAMPLE CASE",

This recovers exactly the expansion in Eq. (6.4) of Ref B. The asymptotic expansion is evaluated at N + 1 rather than at N in the regular EM formula. This confers two distinct advantages: For a given order, our errors are typically much smaller when the index is increased by 1, and secondly, since the order of optimal truncation is πN , by evaluating at N + 1, three additional orders are added to the optimally truncated series, with their concommitant improvement in accuracy. We note that one need only evaluate each contribution in Eq. 59 at the upper end. Taking N = 0 and subtracting then yields S N , guaranteeing correctly its vanishing for N = 0. Thus we have recovered the main one-dimensional result of Ref B without need for (but also missing the elegance of) regularizing sums as N → ∞. Eq. 59 can be applied directly to finite wells, such as PT or the truncated linear half-well of Ref. [81]. We show some results from the summation formula for the linear half well in Fig. 5 for N = 1, where E 1 = 1 . The summation formula is less accurate than the original formula for M = 0, but is much more accurate even for M = 3 (by two orders of magnitude). More importantly, its optimal truncation is at 6, producing almost 3 orders of magnitude in improvement, i.e., going from milliHartrees to microHartrees errors! To see that this is due to our evaluation at N + 1, in Fig. 6 we add in the second eigenvalue and the second sum, E 2 = 1 + 2 . Its error curve is almost identical to that of the summation formula for the first level. Of course, the summation formula for the 2nd level has leaped ahead again, with errors of nanoHartrees at the optimal truncation of M = 9! Finally, we attempt to show the error in the 6th level in Fig. 7. The black line here is for the error in individual level, and so matches the purple line of Fig. 5.

Instead a much more accurate estimate can be obtained by computing the value of the function on both sides of the center point. This is known as the two-point or central difference quotient [1]. The formula for this is given by:\ndf (x) dx ≈ f (x + h) − f (x − h) 2h\nIn the one-point scheme the error was proportional to the size of the step, h. In the two-point case the error is proportional to the square of the step size h. One way to think of the two-point scheme is as a combination of a forwarddifference and backward-difference method. When combined, the first-order terms cancel leaving the second order term intact. Hence the error become proportional to the square, or h 2 . This can be shown as follows. First, we write out the forward and backward schemes as a Taylor series:\nf (x + h) ≈ f (x) + h · f (x) + (h) 2 f (x) 2 + (h) 3 f (x) 6 f (x − h) ≈ f (x) − h · f (x) + (h) 2 f (x) 2 − (h) 3 f (x) 6\nWe then take the difference between them by computing\nf (x + h) − f (x − h)\nfrom which we obtain:\nf (x + h) − f (x − h) ≈ 2h · f (x) + (h) 3 f (x) 3\nRearranging this by dividing both sides by 2h yields:\nf (x + h) − f (x − h) 2h ≈ f (x) + (h) 2 f (x) 6 or f (x) ≈ f (x + h) − f (x − h) 2h − (h) 2 f (x) 6",

Esta abordagem assume que a incerteza do método de referência é conhecida. No entanto, nem sempre se encontra um método de referência preexistente. O ensaio de recuperação constitui o método mais utilizado para validação de processos analíticos. A recuperação está relacionada com a exatidão, pois reflete a quantidade de determinado analito, recuperado no processo, em relação à quantidade real presente na amostra 69 . A recuperação (ou fator de recuperação), R, é definida como a eficiência da extração de um processo analítico reportada como porcentagem da quantidade medida do analito em relação à quantidade adicionada na matriz (branco), após as etapas de extração do método 62 . Calcula-se a quantidade percentual recuperada pelo processo usando a seguinte fórmula: concentração do analito na amostra fortificada; p c : concentração do analito na solução padrão. No estudo de recuperação são realizados testes de significância, utilizando o teste \"t\" de Student de acordo com a seguinte fórmula 65 : valor \"t\" obtido estiver enquadrado no intervalo estabelecido pelo valor tabelado, ou seja t t tab , para n-1 graus de liberdade em dado nível de significância, então o método será considerado exato, ou seja, não se pode afirmar diferenças significativas entre as recuperações obtidas e o valor esperado (100%). É importante considerar como a eficiência do método varia em função da concentração da substância.

The choice of which method to use depends on how accurate the estimate should be and how fast does the computation need to proceed. The simplest method for computing a derivative of a function f (x) is the onepoint method.\n\n\nOne-Point Method\n\nAll numerical methods for estimating derivatives are by their nature approximate. The one-point method [1], also know as the Newton's difference quotient or forward-different method, is the simplest and is given by:\ndf (x) dx ≈ f (x + h) − f (x) h\nThe estimate relies on the step-size, h. A step-size that is too large, will incur a significant error in the estimate for the derivative especially when the function f (x) is non-linear. It's possible to estimate this error by expanding the function, f (x) in a Taylor series:\nf (x + h) = f (x) + h df (x) dx + higher terms(1)\nThe error in our estimate comes from neglecting the higher terms. If we assume this error is dominated by the first term in the higher terms (i.e the second derivative), then we can show that the error is given approximately by:\nh 2 df (x) 2 d 2 t\nThis tells us that the higher the value of h the greater the error. It also indicates that the error is a function of the second derivative, that is the curvature. For a simple equation such as y = x 2 , the curvature is a constant of value 2, so that the error term reduces to h. For y = x 2 the error in our estimate will therefore equal the step-size.\n\nRearranging equation (1) yields:\ndf (x) dx = f (x + h) − f (x) h − higher terms\nIn the limit, as the step size, h, tends to zero the approximation becomes exact:\ndf (x) dx = lim h→0 f (x + h) − f (x) h .\n\nTwo-Point Methods",

O intervalo de trabalho expressa a faixa entre a menor e a maior concentração dos padrões usados na construção do gráfico de calibração65 . Matematicamente, a estimativa dos coeficientes de uma curva analítica a partir de um conjunto de medições experimentais pode ser efetuada usando o método matemático conhecido como regressão linear. Além dos coeficientes de regressão a e b, também é possível calcular, a partir dos pontos experimentais, o coeficiente da curva obtida, pois quanto mais próximo de 1,0; menor a dispersão do conjunto de pontos experimentais e menor a incerteza dos coeficientes de regressão estimados. A ANVISA 60 recomenda um coeficiente de correlação igual a 0,99 e o INMETRO 61 um valor acima de 0,90. Em qualquer técnica instrumental, a relação linear é simples, descrita pela equação y= ax + b, só é válida em um determinado intervalo de massa ou concentração da espécie medida. Este intervalo de massa ou concentrações, no qual se pode construir uma curva analítica linear, é a faixa linear dinâmica.

A faixa de aplicação é normalmente expressa nas mesmas unidades dos resultados obtidos pelo método. Diferentes recomendações são fornecidas na literatura e dependem da aplicação. Para fármacos e medicamentos, a ANVISA 60 recomenda uma faixa entre 80-120% da concentração teórica do analito.

In performing the experiments the stop was kept the same throughout, and the thickness of aluminium required to cut down the radiation through the given stop to one-half was measured for different magnetic fields. The first column of Table I I I gives the product of the magnitude of the field into the radius of curvature of the path. We have then\nttt) m H E = - v e\nwhere m, v, and e are the mass, velocity and charge of the /3-particle.

Assuming Bucherer's* value, T76 x 107, for e/m0, these equations enable us to calculate v. The product of the first two columns is equal to mv2je, the values of which are g third column of the table. The fourth column gives the corresponding values of tm, the thickness of aluminium necessary to cut down the radiation through the fixed aperture to one-half. According to either of the equations A or B, the quotient mv2l e f t m should be constant. The values of this quantity are given in* the last column of the table, and it will be seen that there is again a satisfactory agreement between the theory and the experimental results. Though the actual range of velocities is not great, yet owing to the rapid change in mass with change of velocity which occurs for these fast moving particles, the value of mv2, which is what we are really concerned with, increases more than threefold in the course of the series. This is a sufficient proportional increase to afford a reasonable test of the theory.\n\nHaving now obtained satisfactory evidence that, in the three directions where it lends itself to experimental verification, the theory of Prof. Thomson does express the experimental facts concerning the scattering of homogeneous /3-rays, we may now proceed to apply it to the determination of the number of electrons contained in an atom of the various elements concerned.\n\n\nOn the Number of Electrons in an Atom.",

We assume a Gaussian temporal pulse shape, characterized by a full width at half maximum (FWHM), a laser wavelength λ, and a laser fluence F , as described in Appendix B. In agreement with experiments done in Ref. [9], here we choose λ = 400 nm, FWHM = 150 fs, and we consider two fluences, F = 50 and 170 J/m 2 , respectively. For a critical look on (further) approximations made within the TTM, which we test here, a few details should be mentioned. Notably, the C el,ph in Eqs. (2) and (3) are electron and phonon heat capacities, κ el is the electronic heat conductivity, and g is the electron-phonon-coupling constant. The choice of the latter is described in Appendix B. The phonon heat capacity C ph is calculated using the Debye model [36] for the Cu crystal, also described in Appendix B. The T el dependence of the electronic heat capacity C el is usually approximated in a free-electron, Sommerfeld model as linear,\nC el (T el ) = γ el T el ,(4)",

It was assumed that in the predicted continuum excited and emitting molecules go to the nearest quantum state, and that the relative number of transitions taking place when the nucleus is in any small portion of the oscillatory orbit is proportional to the time of stay of an harmonic oscillator in that portion. The values obtained for the com plete intensities of the second positive bands 0 -> 2, 1 -> 3, and 2 -> 4 were 100, 48, and 19. The agreement with experiment is quite good (cf . Table IV) considering the roughness of the method. On the other hand, while the classical method and wave mechanics predict complete intensities, which are in rough agreement, they differ in the predicted excitation and emission prob abilities. The classical probabilities are 100, 51, and 38 in excitation, and 100, 94, and 50 in emission.\n\nAn interesting part of the curves of fig. 2 lies below an accelerating potential of 30 volts. The intensity ratios of the second positive bands exhibit a marked dependence on the exciting voltage for values from about 20 volts down to the excitation potential (13*0 volts*). The energy separation of the 0, 1 and 1, 2 initial emission levels is 0 • 25 volts. If one corrects for this energy difference by plotting the intensities for the 1 -> 3 and 2 -> 4 bands with abscissae respec tively 0 • 25 and 0 • 50 volts less than the measured accelerating potential, the intensity ratios 1-* 3/0-> 2, 2-> 4/0-> 2, and 2-> 4/1 -> 3 become 0*75, 0-23, 0-32 at 14 volts, and 0*78, 0*23, 0*30 at 16 volts. This correction is sufficient to make the band intensity ratios approximately independent of the exciting voltage in this region.",

Assuming that the \"bright\" shots and beam-off shots are sampled from two different normal distributions with different mean values, we consider the energy shift between these mean values from ε initial ¼ ð550 AE 20Þ MeV to ε final ¼ ð470 AE 10Þ MeV. If the electron beam interacts with a pulse of FWHM duration 45 fs, the required peak a 0 to generate this energy loss is 10 AE 2 for a quantum model, and 9 AE 1 for a classical model based on the Landau-Lifshitz equation. For ε initial ≈ 550 MeV and a 0 ≈ 10, η ≈ 0.07 and in the quantum model the electron loses energy at a rate ≈0.75 that of the classical model [38]. In the classical model a slightly lower a 0 is therefore able to generate the same electron energy loss, though due to the relatively low value of η the difference in a 0 between the models is small compared to the experimental uncertainties when considering the electron beam energy loss alone. Additionally, the peak a 0 of the f=2 focal spot was calculated to be greater than 20 from measured pulse parameters, which is much larger than that inferred from the electron energy shift.",

In many situations, however, when the electrons can be considered thermalized at a given temperature T e , the rate coefficients can be obtained by convoluting the cross sections with a Maxwellian energy distribution function, according to the equation:\nK v i →v f (T e ) = 8 m e π 1 kT e 3/2 ∞ th dEE e − E kTe σ v i →v f (E),(3)\nwhere m e is the electron mass, k is the Boltzmann constant, th is the threshold energy and σ v i →v f (E) is the cross section for the v i → v f RVE for electron energy E. Using the calculated cross sections for both processes (1) and (2), we have also calculated the corresponding rate coefficients, by equation (3), for all the transitions and in the range of electron temperature from 0.1 eV up to 100 eV. The organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section we briefly describe the main equations of the LCP model and give some computational details. In section 3 we compare the calculated cross sections with some available theoretical and experimental results of the literature, and in section 4 we illustrate a few particular examples of the calculated cross sections and rate coefficients.
